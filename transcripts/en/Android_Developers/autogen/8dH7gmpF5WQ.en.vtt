00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.900
past 12 months we've seen one in three
people actively take steps to make a

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:28.910
people actively take steps to make a
 

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.090
people actively take steps to make a
change with their relationship with tech

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:31.100
change with their relationship with tech
 

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.520
change with their relationship with tech
and the interesting thing is that these

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:33.530
and the interesting thing is that these
 

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.140
and the interesting thing is that these
people have taken steps that I have

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.150
people have taken steps that I have
 

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.750
people have taken steps that I have
certainly taken myself things like

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760
certainly taken myself things like
 

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.060
certainly taken myself things like
deleting apps I'm not actively using or

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.070
deleting apps I'm not actively using or
 

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.780

a different room in order to not be
 

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.150
a different room in order to not be
interrupted and the good news is that

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160
interrupted and the good news is that
 

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.460
interrupted and the good news is that
80% of them have reported a positive

from Sofia and Mindy and Maggie we have
 

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.049
from Sofia and Mindy and Maggie we have
been making a lot of progress we're

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:02.059
been making a lot of progress we're
 

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:04.090
been making a lot of progress we're
encouraged to see the data which shows

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.100
encouraged to see the data which shows
 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.220
encouraged to see the data which shows
our users are really changing their

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:06.230
our users are really changing their
 

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.650
our users are really changing their
behaviors and meeting their goals but

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:08.660
behaviors and meeting their goals but
 

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.569
behaviors and meeting their goals but
also our research tells us there's more

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:10.579
also our research tells us there's more
 

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:12.939
also our research tells us there's more
work to do so we're excited to announce

00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:12.949
work to do so we're excited to announce
 

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:14.799
work to do so we're excited to announce
some new features which continue to

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:14.809
some new features which continue to
 

00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:18.419
some new features which continue to
build on what we announced last year

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:18.429
 

00:15:18.429 --> 00:15:21.639
first as we heard notifications can be a

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:21.649
first as we heard notifications can be a
 

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:24.849
first as we heard notifications can be a
source of stress so there's a whole

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:24.859
source of stress so there's a whole
 

00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:26.529
source of stress so there's a whole
bunch of stuff that my phone will tell

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:26.539
bunch of stuff that my phone will tell
 

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.710
bunch of stuff that my phone will tell
me that's really useful but not all of

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720
me that's really useful but not all of
 

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.729
me that's really useful but not all of
it is useful right now for example this

00:15:33.729 --> 00:15:33.739
it is useful right now for example this
 

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.710
it is useful right now for example this
morning I was working out

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720
morning I was working out
 

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.300
morning I was working out
and before anyone thinks I'm a hero I'm

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:37.310
and before anyone thinks I'm a hero I'm
 

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.369
and before anyone thinks I'm a hero I'm
on London time so I'm basically in the

00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:39.379
on London time so I'm basically in the
 

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:42.100
on London time so I'm basically in the
afternoon right now and I'm sitting at a

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.110
afternoon right now and I'm sitting at a
 

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.800
afternoon right now and I'm sitting at a
plank and I'm watching the timer hoping

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:44.810
plank and I'm watching the timer hoping
 

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.199
plank and I'm watching the timer hoping
that timer's gonna go down quickly and I

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:47.209
that timer's gonna go down quickly and I
 

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:49.119
that timer's gonna go down quickly and I
get the notification that says hey the

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:49.129
get the notification that says hey the
 

00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:51.639
get the notification that says hey the
daily crossword is ready and I love my

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:51.649
daily crossword is ready and I love my
 

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:54.670
daily crossword is ready and I love my
crosswords but right then I didn't need

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680
crosswords but right then I didn't need
 

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.670
crosswords but right then I didn't need
that so in Android q what we're

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680
that so in Android q what we're
 

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.309
that so in Android q what we're
introducing is priority notifications

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319
introducing is priority notifications
 

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:03.040
introducing is priority notifications
and what this does is creates two types

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.050
and what this does is creates two types
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.090
and what this does is creates two types
of notifications

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.100
of notifications
 

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.689
of notifications
there's priority and there's gentle and

00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:06.699
there's priority and there's gentle and
 

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.129
there's priority and there's gentle and
only the gently the priority

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:09.139
only the gently the priority
 

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:11.530
only the gently the priority
notifications will make noise or vibrate

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:11.540
notifications will make noise or vibrate
 

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.379
notifications will make noise or vibrate
and interrupt you so in my example that

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:14.389
and interrupt you so in my example that
 

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:16.660
and interrupt you so in my example that
crossword notification that could be

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:16.670
crossword notification that could be
 

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.309
crossword notification that could be
gentle and something I come back to

00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319
gentle and something I come back to
 

00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:20.259
gentle and something I come back to
later as opposed to interrupting me

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:20.269
later as opposed to interrupting me
 

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:24.309
later as opposed to interrupting me
right now in the moment and we've

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319
right now in the moment and we've
 

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:25.960
right now in the moment and we've
learned from the research that it's the

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:25.970
learned from the research that it's the
 

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.210
learned from the research that it's the
unintentional moments that can lead to

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:28.220
unintentional moments that can lead to
 

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.090
unintentional moments that can lead to
feelings of regret and guilt so there

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.100
feelings of regret and guilt so there
 

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.949
feelings of regret and guilt so there
are important moments in your day when

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959
are important moments in your day when
 

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.019
are important moments in your day when
your phone should reflect the intention

user is good for the well-being and that

00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:49.599
user is good for the well-being and that
 

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:51.539
user is good for the well-being and that
makes a lot of sense and what's

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:51.549
makes a lot of sense and what's
 

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:53.249
makes a lot of sense and what's
interesting about jobs this is a

00:23:53.249 --> 00:23:53.259
interesting about jobs this is a
 

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:55.200
interesting about jobs this is a
language learning app they use a

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.210
language learning app they use a
 

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.299
language learning app they use a
technique called spaced repetition and

00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:57.309
technique called spaced repetition and
 

00:23:57.309 --> 00:23:59.369
technique called spaced repetition and
they have an intentional amount of time

00:23:59.369 --> 00:23:59.379
they have an intentional amount of time
 

00:23:59.379 --> 00:24:02.039
they have an intentional amount of time
where they give a lapse between the last

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:02.049
where they give a lapse between the last
 

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:03.930
where they give a lapse between the last
learning session and the subsequent

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:03.940
learning session and the subsequent
 

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.690
learning session and the subsequent
session and what's interesting is these

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
session and what's interesting is these
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.070
session and what's interesting is these
stats could look possibly

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080
stats could look possibly
 

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.529
stats could look possibly
counterintuitive to somebody who's

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:10.539
counterintuitive to somebody who's
 

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:12.539
counterintuitive to somebody who's
looking at it from a growth kind of

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:12.549
looking at it from a growth kind of
 

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:14.789
looking at it from a growth kind of
perspective the average daily user

00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799
perspective the average daily user
 

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:17.369
perspective the average daily user
spends 56 percent less time within the

00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:17.379
spends 56 percent less time within the
 

00:24:17.379 --> 00:24:20.700
spends 56 percent less time within the
app and uses it 51 percent less often

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:20.710
app and uses it 51 percent less often
 

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.469
app and uses it 51 percent less often
and so from a digital well-being

00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:22.479
and so from a digital well-being
 

00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:24.210
and so from a digital well-being
standpoint this sounds like a really

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.220
standpoint this sounds like a really
 

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.460
standpoint this sounds like a really
good thing but the amazing thing is that

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:26.470
good thing but the amazing thing is that
 

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.560
good thing but the amazing thing is that
this model really lines up the user

from a user goals perspective they want

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:43.190
from a user goals perspective they want
 

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.639
from a user goals perspective they want
to lower the barrier to entry so they've

00:24:45.639 --> 00:24:45.649
to lower the barrier to entry so they've
 

00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:47.619
to lower the barrier to entry so they've
introduced a five-minute session limit

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:47.629
introduced a five-minute session limit
 

00:24:47.629 --> 00:24:49.509

to make sure they've got a sustainable

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:57.350
to make sure they've got a sustainable
 

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.619
to make sure they've got a sustainable
engagement model so they have a limit on

00:24:59.619 --> 00:24:59.629
engagement model so they have a limit on
 

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:01.499
engagement model so they have a limit on
the next session which is 10 hours

what's cool about that is that is that

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:04.629
what's cool about that is that is that
 

00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:07.739
what's cool about that is that is that
space repetition which really allows for

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:07.749
space repetition which really allows for
 

00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:11.080
space repetition which really allows for
memorization so a great way to align

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.090
memorization so a great way to align
 

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.129
memorization so a great way to align

quantity so let me tell you a little bit
 

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.399
quantity so let me tell you a little bit
more about quality so what this might

00:26:33.399 --> 00:26:33.409
more about quality so what this might
 

00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:34.840
more about quality so what this might
look like as you're thinking about your

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.340
and then finally one thing that we've
 

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.460
and then finally one thing that we've
really looked into is collecting signals

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:54.470
really looked into is collecting signals
 

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.649
really looked into is collecting signals
of quality so that we understand how

00:26:56.649 --> 00:26:56.659
of quality so that we understand how
 

00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:58.480

interesting about this is oftentimes the
 

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.860
interesting about this is oftentimes the
people in their life the people who
