00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.170
&gt;&gt; Linda Zachrison: Jonas Hassen
Khemiri in his debut novel

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.420
"Ett oga rott," "One Red Eye," hit
the Swedish literary scene in 2003

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.580
and was praised for its comment on
the present and changing society

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.010
with its playful language,
humor, satire, and fast pace.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.320
Ever since then, Jonas has received
a number of awards for his novels,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.750
for his short stories and
plays in Sweden and abroad.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.890
He has now written four novels
and six plays and the latest play,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.630
Everything-- no, the latest novel,
"Everything I Don't Remember,"

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.890
was awarded with the Sweden's
most prestigious literary prize,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.220
the August Prize, named
after Strindberg, of course.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.120
Jonas Hassen Khemiri often shifts
perspectives in his writing

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.860
and invites the reader to come
and play with him and his--

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.320
and to play with his
electrified language of his own

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.940
but even got a name for
itself, called Khemirian.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.560
His work has been translated
into 23 languages

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.280
and his plays have been performed

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.210
by over a hundred companies
around the world.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.600
Right now, his play, "I
Call My Brothers," is staged

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.860
at the Forum Theatre here
in Washington and it runs

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.140
until October 1st,
so you better hurry.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.640
A couple of years ago, Jonas wrote
an open letter to the Minister

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.380
of Justice in Sweden who had
publicly defended racial profiling

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.400
in the subways of Stockholm.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.660
It was called "Dear Beatrice."

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.060
It became the most shared piece
in Swedish social media history

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.980
with 250,000 shares
only the first day,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.530
and it started a Tweeter
movement where people

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.950
under the #dearbeatrice started
sharing their own stories.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.680
Jonas encourages us all to
look behind the surface,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.570
behind our prejudices,
and behind our fear.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.340
You can all support the
festival with a gift or donation

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.720
and the festival would not be
possible without the support

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.600
of sponsors and book lovers.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.880
Just a few more things, please turn
your cellphones off and I also want

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.800
to tell you that Q&amp;A will
follow after Jonas' talk.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.450
So, save your questions.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.910
Also, be aware that if you ask
question, you will be filmed

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.280
for the archives and that you can
meet Jonas also after the talk

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.780
when he will do signing,
starting at 4:30.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.510
Now, please join me in welcoming
from Sweden, Jonas Hassen Khemiri.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:11.890
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.730
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri:
Does that work?

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.530
Even though I'm too
tall for this podium.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.950
Do you hear me OK if
I speak like this?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.040
Great. So thank you very much for
that very kind introduction, Linda.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.110
I do have to say, if my
mother is watching this,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.420
that she was not a librarian
but she was a physiotherapist

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.530
and she was very much
a lover of books.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.880
I have some kind of idea of how
I'm going to structure this.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.340
The plan is that I will start to
talk a little bit about memories

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.020
and what memories do to us and
I will do that because the--

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.520
my latest novel that was
published in the States is called

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.660
"Everything I Don't Remember."

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.470
A few years ago, I went
to my grandmother's house

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.100
and I started finding these kind
of weird small handwritten notes.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.690
I would go there every
weekend and I would visit her

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.680
and I would see small
scribblings in her house.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.390
So what she-- The first
thing I found was

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.620
like small yellow Post-It notes
where she had written like salt

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.050
on the box where she keeps
salt or sugar on the sugar box.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.390
And I was kind of taken aback.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.680 position:56%
I wasn't sure what she was doing
because I recognize her handwriting.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.370
My grandmother was a
retired teacher of Swedish

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.320
so she had this very antiquated
and beautiful handwriting.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.110
After when I realized that she was
writing these kind of small notes

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.140
as a way to try to find stability

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.370
because her memories were
slowly starting to fade.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.160
I specifically remember
once when I got there

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:29.440
and she had written two Post-Its on
her phone and on her remote control

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.600 position:56%
because they looked so very similar.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.630
So on the phone, she
had written phone

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.180
and on the remote control,
she had written TV.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.370
Because I realized when
she was watching TV

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.960
and someone would call
her, she often tried

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.920
to respond in the remote, you know.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.570
Or if she tried to raise the
volume, she tried to use the phone.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.460
So, these electronic devices were
a little bit too similar so she had

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.310 position:56%
to separate them by using her words.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.170
And this shift, when the
memories started fading,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.710
it went really quickly for
her to start to become more

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.900
and more insecure about
who she was and who we were

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.890
who were surrounding her.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.110
The next step was that she-- I
was-- I would be at home sleeping

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.670
and I would wake up in the middle
of the night and she would--

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.400
I would see that it was my
grandma calling me like 2

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.590
or 3 in the morning and
I would always respond

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.160
because I'm being a little worried,
you know, something might happened.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.780
And always when I responded,
she was so happy.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.750
That was her first
reaction, like extreme joy,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.930
and she was like Jonas,
are you awake?

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.620
And then I'm just, well,
not really, you know.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.960
She was [inaudible] because
that meant that she was not,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.260
you know, awake by herself.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.260 position:56%
And then she-- her next thing was
that she just wants to check whether

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.290
or not my number was my number.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.330
So she said the number like she
had just dialed and just wanted

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.730
to check that that was me.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.030
And I said yes, that's me.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.810
And she said thank you.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.740 position:56%
Then I can go back to sleep
feeling a little bit more comforted.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.260
So, she used the languages
and the numbers in order

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.000
to find some kind of stability.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.030
That summer, she became a
little bit unsure who I was.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.110
In the fall, she-- for the first
time I went there and she saw me

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.590
and became afraid seeing me because
she didn't recognize me at all.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.600
And in the spring, she could
not stay in her house so we had

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.100
to move her to a house
for people with dementia.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.280
And this experience created
this question of who we are

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.720
without our memories, because it
was-- that was my grandmother.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.460
Like every time I went there, I
can see that she looked the same,

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.730
she had the same facial
features, the same perfume.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.170
We talked about the same things.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.930
She was-- Since she was a retired
teacher, she had very clear ideas

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.930
about everything, especially
how to reform the school system.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.300
She knows exactly how to do that.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.760 position:56%
She also had quite a lot of opinions
about my authorship and my writing.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.680
I remember once, I asked her what
she thought about my first book

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.970
and she said-- very
quickly, she said, well,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.850
I like you, you know, I like you.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.670
And it-- for a moment, it really
sounded as if she said I like it

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.960
and I was kind of clinging on to
the idea that she said I like it.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.260
But no, I like you.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.480
You know, you're my eldest
grandchild, you know, so.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.510
Because there were kind
of a lot of swear words

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.450
and curse words in that book.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.960
And she also thought that I--
sometimes that I kind of--

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.910
that I didn't write the truth.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.900
She like the truth and I
should stick to the truth.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.860
That was her thing.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.330
These thoughts and questions about
memory and who we are without them

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.960 position:56%
and specifically I remember thinking
at some point she will end--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.560
she will stop being my grandmother.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.940
So, if she has 80% of her memories,
of course, she's my grandmother.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.840
If she has 40, yes,
it's still her, right?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.140
I recognize her.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.430
But if she has 20,
5%, is that still her?

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.270 position:56%
All these questions kind of
trickled down into this latest novel

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.650
that is called "Everything
I Don't Remember."

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:38.220 position:56%
In that novel, there is a
grandmother who is losing her memory

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.280
and who was very upset that someone
has taken her driving license.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.080
There's also a house
that has been left.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.740
And but then, in the center of the
novel is a young man called Samuel.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.780
And Samuel-- The book
starts off with a car crash.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.750
It's not at all spoiler
but we find out very early

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.600
on in the book that Samuel is dead.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.970
Samuel has taken his grandmother's
car and he has driven it

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:14.320
into a tree outside of Stockholm,
in an area called Vastberga.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.780
A writer, who is a little
bit reminiscent of the writer

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.880
that you see in front of you right
now, hears about this car crash

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.980
and becomes obsessed with trying
to find out what really happened.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.930
So what was behind this car crash?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.980
Was it a suicide, was
it an accident,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.800
was it due to the long relationship
that Samuel had had with Laide,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.370
was it because of economic conflict

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.690
with his friend Vandad,
what happened?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.100
That's the mystery
that drives this novel.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.110
So the writer starts contacting
everyone who remembers Samuel

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.780
and tries to ask them
who Samuel really was.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.210
So we get to know his friends,
his family, his neighbors.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.610
The plan is to try
to map what happens--

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.790
happened during Samuel's
last day alive.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.540
The problem is the people are not
really remembering the same things.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.180
So there's kind of a friction

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.150
between the different
ideas of who Samuel was.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.500
For example, some people claim that
in the story, there is this kind

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.670
of big love affair
between Samuel and Laide.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.400
Some people say that that's--
that was like a, you know,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.670
this kind of Hollywood
version love affair,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.560
that that is what explained
why he passed away.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.100 position:56%
And according to Laide who was
the-- involved in this relationship,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.540
it was more like a fling.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.840
It was nothing.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.350
It was not a big thing
as some people claim.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.260
So, the different versions of the
story are kind of being tested

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.690
and being conflicted
throughout the novel.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.310
And the more we read without
like spoiling anything,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.680
I could say that the writer
himself has kind of a secret agenda

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.090
to why he wants to
collect all these memories.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.640
And towards the end, we realize
maybe he and Samuel has--

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.580
have more in common
that he wants to reveal.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.940
So in the center of the novel,
there's Samuel who is a young man

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.870
who is super fascinated
with the memory.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:20.550
Specially, he is fascinated with
how to make people remember him.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.990 position:56%
So, on the first date with Laide, he
has this long argument where he says

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.720
that the best way to get
people to remember you is

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.640
to make them associate you with
their daily routine, right.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.690 position:56%
So if I'm going to make you remember
me, I should make you associate--

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:43.280
I should make you associate me with
something that you do every day.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.190
And Laide is a little bit-- she
doesn't really believe this theory.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.990
She said, well, the main thing if
you want to remember someone is,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.290
of course, you create
some kind of emotion.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.930
But Samuel is not too
big on emotions.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.560
He's more into like creating
different systems of his own.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.950 position:56%
So he says, well, the smartest thing
for you to remember me that would be

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.670
if I can make you associate
me with water.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.860
And then Samuel takes a glass
of water and he pours it

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.850
onto himself kind of,
with the ambition to kind

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:17.090
of force her not to forget him.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.450 position:56%
Another important person in the book
is Laide who's the ex-girlfriend

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.380
of Samuel's.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.840
And then the third important
person is his best friend, Vandad,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.030 position:56%
who is a super loyal friend who some
people claim that he does everything

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.630
for money but he says that
he doesn't care about money.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.540
But he's one of those persons
who says that quite lot.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.310
You know, people say like,
well, I don't care about money.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.610
Money is nothing.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.470
Like I don't care, but
like it doesn't matter

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.770
who pays or who doesn't pay.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.840
But in a way, you know, it's only
money but he keeps coming back

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.140
to the issue of money
throughout the novel.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.440
So these are the three characters.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.750
And then there is the
grandmother, of course,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.630
that was losing her memory.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.880
The form of the novel
is structured in a way

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:10.520
so that we're not totally sure
100% of the time who is speaking.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.320
And I've always enjoy that
feeling, when I'm reading myself,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.490
I'm not really sure if the words
that I'm being presented with,

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.900
if they come from a man or a woman
or someone who is old or young,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.810
because that makes me kind of
see my own preconceived ideas,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.290
my own prejudice.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.220
So in the novel, these different
voices, these different memories

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.710
of Samuel are being kind of--
they're being thrown back and forth

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.040
between different perspectives
on this person

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.380
who is not alive anymore.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.980 position:56%
Do you have Lego here in the States?

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:53.600
Lego? I was a big-- I love
that reaction, oh my God, yeah.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.970
So, Lego, when I was a kid,
I was a big Lego fan, right,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.050
and I know that's a
very tired metaphor

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.890
for like constructing something but
that's like-- that is my feeling.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.660
When I encounter a book
that I really love,

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.820
my feeling is that I'm being
presented with some kind

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.620
of like big sea of Lego bits and
it's up to me to put them together.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.030
That-- Hopefully if this novel
works, that is the feeling

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.870
that I want you to have to like--
that you are the ones who are kind

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.090
of creating Samuel and hopefully
that gives you some kind of feeling

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.370
that Samuel exists in a 3D form.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.670
There's another character
in the novel who is not--

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.400 position:56%
who is voiceless, and that
character is my hometown, Stockholm.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.840
I came back to Stockholm after
having spent a few years abroad

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.870
in 2010 and I felt
my city had changed.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.410
One of the inspirations
came from a friend of mine

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:57.230
who had a job one summer to drive
one of those kind of tourist trains

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.920
that looked like toys,
have you seen them?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.330
So it's like a-- it looks like a--
it kind of like a huge toy train

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.890
where tourists go on this train
and he would drive the tourists

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.190
around the highlights so they could
see the highlights of Stockholm.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:17.010
And during this ride, they
had a prerecorded voiceover

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.190 position:56%
that said all these terrible cliches
about what Stockholm was, of course.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.010
Like, oh, Stockholm, it's the
Venice of the North, you know.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.180
Stockholm, it's beautiful.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.410
And it was up to my friend to
kind of drive with exact speed

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:38.290
so that the, you know, voice
met up with what they saw.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.060
Because what happens otherwise,
then we have a voice who's kind

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.610
of dislocated, a voice that
can come from anywhere.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.340
So, his ambition was to drive.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.470
When we pass the rich area of
Ostermalm, the voice had to say,

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.730
"Look, this is the
affluent area of Ostermalm."

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.330 position:56%
When the train cross the bridge, the
voice would say, "Wow, Stockholm,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.730
the Venice of the North,
water everywhere," you know.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.540
And then the train
would stop like on a--

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.510
high up on a hill so you saw
the beautiful view of Stockholm

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:18.150
and the voice said, "Stockholm,
look at her, isn't she beautiful?"

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.280
[ Laughter ]

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.010 position:56%
And my friend said, I'm going crazy.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.310
[ Laughter ]

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:30.550
I will not take it.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.010
I hate that voice.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.310
[ Laughter ]

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.400
And I was like why?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.940
Well, because it only
tells one story.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.660
It tells the people who are
visiting our city one version

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.960
of what we have in this city.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.530
Of course, there's a view,
there's water, there's--

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:54.420
there are areas that are very rich,
but what about my neighborhood,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.690
where are the experiences
that I have of this city.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.370
That's my friend was like.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.330
He kept saying this through in
the whole summer and he was like,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.010
one day, I'm going
to hijack that train.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.480
[ Laughter ]

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.110
I'm going to just take it
and I'm just going to drive

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.830
to the area where I grew up.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.760
So every time the voice says,
"Wow, look, the most affluent area

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.620
of Stockholm," they
would see his background.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.940 position:56%
And whenever this, you know, if they
would say-- the voice would say,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.170 position:56%
"Wow, it's the Venice of the North,"
they would see the mall, you know,

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.710
where he hang out in the weekend.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.510
And do you think he did it?

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:40.050
Do you think at one point he took
that train and went for a joy ride?

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.450 position:56%
Because what happens if you do that?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:48.020
You get fired right there, economic
consequences of making that choice.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.330
So he kept saying I'm going
to do it, I'm going to--

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.630
just wait one day, one day.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.450
And I was just like,
have you done it?

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.980
Tuesday, I'm going
to do it, Tuesday.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.850
I'm just waiting for the right day.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.150
Finally, he never did.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.460 position:56%
They did, of course, he kept driving
his route because it's very--

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.550
to make that kind of rebellion,
you have to face consequences.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.100
And oftentimes, it's easier to make
those kind of rebellions in theory

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.260
than to do them in practice.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.930
So Stockholm was a big inspiration.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.460
When I came back to Stockholm, I
had this idea, I had the feeling

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.960
that my city had changed because
everyone was talking about economy,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.590
that it was as if economy
had come seep

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.720
into the veins of my--
even my friends.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.960
I would sit with friends who
I know were big book lovers.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.650
Normally, we talk about
Calvino, Fortner or Baldwin.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:37.040
And now, all of a sudden, they
were speaking about mortgages

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.390
and how much they're going to
invest in a certain apartment

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.380
and how much they're going to
sell it for and renovate it.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.670
And I remember thinking,
that's never going to be me

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.720
because I'm above economy, right.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.750
I deal with the high arts.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.110
My book is for sale
afterwards, you see.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.200
[ Laughter ]

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.410
No, but that's not part
of me because I'm above.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.990
I have my own system, my own--

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.230
I can just liberate myself
with the use of my imagination.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.200
Then, I became a father.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.180
And I wrote this open letter that
became a very viral thing in Sweden

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.280
and that got a lot of love but also
got a lot of quite harsh attacks

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.620
from certain right-wing
powers in Stockholm.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:31.740 position:56%
And all of a sudden, I became the
person who was focused on mortgages.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.410
And all of a sudden, I was a person
who realized that if it comes

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.590
to paying a price for security,
I would be ready to do anything.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.330
If-- It's up to me to put my
family in like in a secured place.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.970
I would pay anything
to make that happen.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.370
So all of a sudden, I was like
sitting there with, you know,

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.230 position:56%
comparing different interest rates
and feeling economy entering my body

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:57.600 position:56%
but also kidnapping my eyes, because
the city that I knew from growing

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600
up was not the city that I saw.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:06.550
All of a sudden, I saw a city full
of potential investments, you know.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.200
And I hated that part of me but
I could really see it happening,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.070
how kind of the numbers and
the economy kind of, yeah,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.820
almost became part of my DNA.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.370
So I think that's why the novel
deals a lot with economics.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.120
In the center, we have three
people are trying to get close

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.460
to each other but economy and
numbers are kind of making

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.020
that impossible, you could say.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.900
So, with this book, I
had it kind of like--

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.480
it started off in a very
light place and I'm--

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.030
now I'm going to do something
which maybe is not a good idea

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.440
because I'm in Washington DC.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:54.410
But I-- I'm trying to frame it in a
way so you won't-- no, but when I--

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.440
I'm going to say it like this.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.390
When my father-- he had a big
vinyl collection and he had a lot

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:09.260
of soul music in that collection,
like Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding,

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.560 position:56%
Aretha Franklin, and I remember
listening to those records as a kid,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.980
really enjoying the
music, but kind of thinking

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:24.800
that the words were a little
bit like lame, you know.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.940
And he is like the--
because isn't, I think,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.140
Marvin Gaye is from
Washington, right?

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.440
&gt;&gt; Detroit.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.150
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: Detroit?

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.650
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] Washington.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.680
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: I'm
sorry, you're outnumbered.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.430
The thing is this book
started with the ambition

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.400
to write a very happy kind
of love story, and it started

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.020
with an investigation of
curiosity if I would be ready

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.260
to actually write down cliches.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.160
Because when I was a kid, I
remember listening to like

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.760
"Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low enough.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.150 position:56%
Nothing can stop me from getting to
you," and I kind of yawn and thought

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.450
that was, come on, Marvin,

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.090
that's not how you write
interesting fiction.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:10.450
Like you have to use
words that are more--

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.230
that are not as lame, kind of.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.530
Cliches don't work.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.430
And then I fell in love the
first time and I listened

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.980
to this same song, "Ain't
no mountain high enough,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.170
ain't no valley low
enough," and all of a sudden,

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.750
I felt like that's really true.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.050
That's exactly what it feels like.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.350
[ Laughter ]

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.410
And of course, nothing had changed.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.410
The song was there.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.280
The text was exactly the
same, but I had changed.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.580
And when you're in this kind

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.410
of strong emotional
states, cliches come alive.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.480
And I wanted to see if I would be
ready to kind of actually write

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.190
down what it feels to be in love.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.580
I wasn't sure if I would
be able to do that.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.880
I wanted to try it.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.940
So that was the starting point
of the novel, to write this kind

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.520
of "ain't no mountain
high enough" novel.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.200
Then life intervened.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.100
I was writing, I was
having a grand all the time,

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.730
Laide and Samuel met each other.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.810
Samuel poured the water over him.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.990
Fiction was being created.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.150
But then, as I was writing,
I had the experience of--

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:21.100
I had a friend who passed away
while I was writing this book.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:28.150 position:56%
And then all of a sudden, everything
that I was writing felt empty.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.380
There was no point
in writing anymore.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.540
But my first reaction
when I heard that call--

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.740
when I got the call and said she's
not alive anymore, all right,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.190
my first impulse was I'm
going to write her back.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.030
I'm going to take everything
I remember of that person

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.410
and make her permanent
through my memories, kind of.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.040
I wrote a short text, I
read it at her funeral.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.340
Did that make her come alive?

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.940
No. Was she in that text?

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.200
Maybe a fragment of what
was her was in that text.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.890
But she was not there.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.420
She was maybe even more void.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.910
The void of her maybe became even
bigger the more I wrote about her.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.430
So I think that also
influenced this novel

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.850
because when a young person
dies, what happens to everyone

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:20.660
who is left, at least in my
experience, is this giant question

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.960
of what could I have
done differently,

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.060
and I think that's
what all the characters

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.920
in the book are dealing with,
like could I have called more,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.500
called less, what would have
happened if I did so and so.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.560
So I think that's why the
characters are also clinging

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:42.570
on to their version of Samuel
because it's their way of, yeah,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.840
their way-- maybe their way
of convincing themselves

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.770 position:56%
that they did not do anything wrong.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.030
And the second thing that happened
while I was writing was this

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.040
experience that I started
off with telling you

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.550
about with my grandmother when she,
in a very quick just a few months,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.240
started losing her memories.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.450
And in order for you to
get some kind of idea to--

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.760
what I found interesting
with that experience was

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.860
that she always return to the words
and the numbers and her handwriting

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.990
and even the expressions.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.450
Those became her kind
of emergency exit.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.300
Those became the things
that she clung on to

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.270
in order to re-find herself.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.640
So no matter how-- when--
before she became sick,

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.650
she always used-- she
had this saying.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.700
She always used to say "I'm
not stubborn, I'm not stubborn,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.010
I'm not stubborn, I'm not
stubborn, but I never gave in."

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.310
[ Laughter ]

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.470
And that was very much her.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.410
So, she starts losing her memories.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.990
The fog enters into her
body and she disappears.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.160
She's no longer the
person that I remember

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.170
and she doesn't remember me.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:03.890
But even when she was in her
home towards the end of her life,

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.900
even when she was in a
constant state of terror

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.400
because she didn't recognize
anyone or anything around her,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.750
that saying kept coming back.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.680
Like she said the same words, "I'm
not stubborn, I'm not stubborn,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.430
I'm not stubborn, but
I never gave in."

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.330
So I would like to
end with reading--

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.380
actually, I had the idea that I'm
not going to read from the novel,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.300
I'm going to read from
a short text that I kind

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.600
of started off the novel.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.970
I think of this text as a
rocket launcher, rocket launcher

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.670
or rocket kind of a rocket
something for the novel.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.190
What is it called, the thing
that is around the rocket?

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.490
&gt;&gt; A launching pad.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.790
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: A
launching pad, thank you.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:52.470
So, this is the launching pad of
the novel, and it's a short piece

00:27:52.470 --> 00:28:00.490
that I-- it started off with a
newspaper in Sweden that wanted--

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.110
that asked me if I wanted
to write like a review

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:09.960
from a music festival in Sweden.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.650
And I went to that festival and
I borrowed my grandmother's car.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.590
I went to the festival
and then I came back

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.510
and then I couldn't write a
review about the music festival

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.440 position:56%
because my heart was somewhere else.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.740
I was only thinking about the fact

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.860
that my grandmother was
slowly losing her memories.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.070
So, instead of writing a review,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.880
I wrote a text called
"Grandma's Mitsubishi."

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.260
The newspaper printed it but they
were a little bit confused of it

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.040
and they were like not 100%
amused, a little bit more confused.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.340
But I'm going to try to read that
text and then I will be happy

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:52.020
to answer any questions
that you might have.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.470 position:56%
Just-- I will actually-- I will
read just a short section in Swedish

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.930
because Swedish is my
mother tongue and just

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.520
so you hear what it
sounds like in Swedish.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.210
And then I will read the
whole thing through in English

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.510
and then we do questions.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:29.680
[ Foreign Language ]

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.550 position:56%
I go to grandma's house to return
her car and would sit in her kitchen

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.950 position:56%
and drink coffee from the new coffee
maker that only costs 200 krona,

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:45.650
200, even though it's a Philips
and Philips is a good brand

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.540
because it's Swedish, grandma says,

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.440
smiling so that her gold
fillings in her teeth gleam.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.570
She's wearing her flattery
blue blouse

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.660
and a pearl necklace
with matching earrings.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.140
And as long as she's
sitting down, you don't think

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.770
about how she only has
one shoe and no skirt.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.230
But my skirt is around
here somewhere.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.160
Hold on, I'll get it, grandma says.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.720
And she gets up and walks over
to the stove and stands there

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.350
for a few seconds before she goes
into the pantry and comes back

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.960
with a big pack carton
full of cookies.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.240
They've taken my driver's
license, she says

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.080
and then we sit there in silence.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.080
We drink coffee and eat cookies

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.930
and they taste almost
exactly as I remember.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.820
So, you can imagine that you're
the newspaper agents, you know,

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.510
kind of waiting for some
kind of festival action.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.290
But here it comes, just.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.380
I tell her about the music
festival I went to in Gothenburg.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.510
James Blake's completely
magical concert

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.140
in Annedal Church, goosebumps.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.300
Prince's is a big show with
purple confetti, dancing pains.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.740
I baked these cookies a long
time ago, grandma replies,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.980
long before they took
my driver's license.

I tell her about the high energy Wiz
Khalifa concert, hands in the air,

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.460
and their super boring MF
Doom session, yawn attack.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.120
But I'm not going to
give up, grandma says.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.560
I'm going to appeal.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.280
They can't lock me up in here.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.600
On the last night, we went to
kind of weird Kanye West concert,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.790
I say, do you know who that is?

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.600
Kanye West, is he Japanese,
grandma answers.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.900
No, American.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.200
He had like 20 female
ballet dancers on the stage

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.110
and then extravagant laser show
and fireworks and smoke machines,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.670
but the only thing that
was good about his show was

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.430
when he accidentally
showed he was human.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.380
Like when he lost his place
during a memorized interlude

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.990
about how important it
is to follow your dreams.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.980
All this time, he sneaked a
peek up at his image on one

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.340 position:56%
of the big screens to check
himself out in the middle of a song.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.340
Then he was transformed from being
a superstar to being a human being.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.220
But those people aren't
human, grandma says.

Who? The people who took
my driver's license.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.940
And every time grandma says
those, she uses that tone

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.040 position:56%
that is impossible to misunderstand.

Those people, those damn people,
those people that seemed capable

of absolutely anything, those people
who cut pensions without remembering

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.640
who it was who built this country,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.240
those people who don't have
the slightest idea of how

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.300
to impose order and control
in school classrooms,

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.150
those people who shut down the gas
station in the corner and turned it

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.820
into a graveyard for
rusting ventilation ducts,

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.260
yellow insulation foam,
and broken coffee machines.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.560
And yet, the worse thing of all
is that those people decided,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.240
with no warning whatsoever, that
grandma is no longer allowed

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.460
to drive her own gray Mitsubishi,
while she has been driving

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.670
for over 40 years and has never
ever been involved in an accident.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.050
But there had actually been a few
accidents over the years, I say.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.920
Yes, of course, says grandma,
a few but not very many

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.010
and none of them were fatal.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.490
And that's true.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.790
Grandma is right.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.390
She has never been involved
in a fatal accident,

But recently, during
the last few years,

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:29.010
the number of minor incidents
has increased more and more.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.130
Like the time grandma picked
up my brother from the airport

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.620
in the countryside and turned out
to the parking lot and then tried

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.350
to drive straight through
a roundabout.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.060 position:56%
But it was extremely foggy that day.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.940
Or like the time grandma got a
hole in her fog light after running

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.910
into a carelessly placed broom.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.300
Or the time grandma was
involved in three crashes

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.320 position:56%
in one year on the Liljeholm Bridge.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.550
But none of them were
my fault, grandma says.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.430
And I agree.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:05.900
The first time, there was an idiot
who honked at her at a red light.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.800
And since she had dozed off, she
became frightened and happened

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.240 position:56%
to run into the car in front of her.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.020
The second time she had
ended up in the wrong lane

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.770
and an idiotic bus driver
refused to let her by.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.640
And the third crash wasn't
even on the Liljeholm Bridge,

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.940
it was just past it
on the Arsta side.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.180
A deer was running alongside road
and suddenly without warning,

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.940
the deer swerved to the
left and flung itself

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.990
across the hood of grandma's car.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.910
Some people, the witnesses,
the insurance company,

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.210
the police report claimed that
grandma ran into the deer.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.650
She didn't.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:47.610
It was the deer that
flung itself onto her car.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.830
You could almost call
it a suicide attempt,

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.450
grandma says because she could
see that the deer had sad eyes,

00:34:54.450 --> 00:35:01.620
drooping antlers, and a
general air of depression.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.860
When the-- Before I published
this, I went to grandma's house.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.180
I sat in front of her and I read
this text because the whole point

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.360
of this text is to
get her to understand

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.200
that she has to let us help us.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.160
Like she has done everything
throughout her life,

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.990
she's always helped us,
but she can't ask for help.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:20.680
So the whole point of this text is
just you have to let us help you.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.000
As I'm reading this, I'm thinking
that she's going to interrupt me

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.590
and say something like, come on,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.510
that's a little bit
over the top, you know.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.860
That's like your first
novel, kind of.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.860
But she stopped me after-- I
was reading about the deer,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.760
she stopped me and she
put her hand at me,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.470
her hand on mine and
she said, "Jonas."

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.760
I was like, "Yeah?"

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.010
"That's the best thing
you've ever written."

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.540
It was exactly like that.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.190
And it was.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:54.140
Like in her memory of that
incident, it was exactly like that.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.920
Because if it had been any
other way, she would be forced

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.040
to change her idea of who she was
and then things would get tricky.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.750
When the coffee is gone, we say
goodbye and I hide the car keys

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:12.230
where she can't find them
way up high on the hat rack.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.230
Later that afternoon, she calls
and asks when I'm going to come

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.450
by with the car or whether I
had fun at the music festival.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.200
She calls again that
evening and asks

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.120
if I'm coming by with the car soon.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.570
We can drink coffee,
we can eat cookies.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:29.200 position:56%
I'm curious to hear what it was
like at that festival in Gothenburg.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.640
The next day, she calls at dawn
and asks when I'm going to pick her

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.670
up so we can drive up to Stockholm.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.420
She doesn't want to be
in the country anymore.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.720
She wants to go home.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.820
She feels isolated.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.410
But grandma, I say, you're
already in Stockholm.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.820
You are home.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.120
Can't you tell?

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.330
You're calling me from
your regular home number.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.030
You're lying in your
regular old bed.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.120
And if you just look
a little to the right,

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.900 position:56%
you can see a regular old night
stand, with the old Vademecum bottle

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.810
and a glass of water
and the tattered Bible

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.910
and the blinking clock radio.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:11.540
And right next to the bed is the
note you've written to yourself.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:19.730
Your beautiful, ornate handwriting
that says, "I am in Stockholm.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.600
I'm not going anywhere."

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:28.200
And grandma finds the note and
reads the words and says, "Oh,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.010
I guess I'm starting
to get a bit nutty."

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.500
And we hung up and I persuade
myself that my memories are eternal

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.080
and I will never need
to write something

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.900
down for it to remain with me.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.050
My phone is quiet for 10
minutes before it rings again

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.350
and it's grandma wanting
to know when I'm coming

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.990
by to drop off the car and how
it went at that music festival

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:55.080
in Gothenburg and I say the
music festival was totally wicked

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.420
and magical and I'm so glad
you decided to come along.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.510
It was so fun to see you rocking
out to Prince hits and clapping

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.520
in time with Wiz Khalifa.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.960
And I'm sure you remember, you
remember, right, how the audience

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.000
in that church cheered when
you climbed up on stage

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.590
to sing the second verse of
James Blake's encore song, right?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:25.130
And grandma is quiet for a few
seconds and then she says, "Oh,

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.980
now you're just making things up."

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.070
But you can hear that
she is smiling.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.390
Thank you very much for coming
and if there are any questions,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.510
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:47.510
[ Applause ]

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.620
So I'm being told by a sign
that we have five minutes,

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.210
if there are any questions or--

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.820
&gt;&gt; I wanted to say that I
love what you say about memory

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.140
and when we're losing our memory.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.150
I watched my mother go through
that and I just think that the--

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.140
all the different ways you looked
at it and the ways that you looked

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.080
at what makes up a human being

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.220
from all the perspectives
is just very moving.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.520
Thank you very much.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.820
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri:
Thank you very much.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.620
I'm really happy to hear that.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.330
[ Applause ]

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.630
Yes.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.020
&gt;&gt; I was intrigued by what you
said about returning to Stockholm

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.470
and the emphasis on the economy.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:28.720 position:56%
And I was wondering how you've seen
economic issues impact not only your

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.940
own work but the work of
other Swedish novelists

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.240
who are your contemporaries

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:38.070
and why you think those might
be surprising as a theme.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.300
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: I
think-- that's a great question.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:48.370
I think maybe I had-- I was more--
I was quite-- how should I put it.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.640
I'm a failed economist.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.010
Like I have studied economy when
I was young and I never graduated

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.040
which my father reminds
me about every 10 minutes.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.420
But I've always been
fascinated with the kind

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.590
of the power that money
can give you.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.800
And I think the money-- the power

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.850
and the privilege that
money can give you.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.260
So, since I became a father,
I had this kind of theme.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.990
My latest play was called "Almost
Equal To" and that also deals

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:25.400
with economy and kind of
the challenges of knowing

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:30.620
that there's a system that has
all these negative consequences,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.940
but not really knowing how
to formulate an alternative.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.900 position:56%
And I think that I-- before I became
a father, I think I had this idea

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:47.320
that I could be free to create
in my fictional universe.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.450
But I think becoming a father,
to think I realize that my idea

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.890
of economics were quite-- was
quite simplified actually,

00:40:54.890 --> 00:41:02.170 position:56%
that it was very tricky to create
this kind of separate universe from,

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.950
yeah, the everyday
reality in Stockholm.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:10.660
And like the main shift that has
happened in Stockholm is that we--

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.630
the latest 10 and 20 years, we've
changed the whole housing market.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:19.200 position:56%
So, we've gone from a rent-based
system to now we can actually invest

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.550
in housing which creates all this--

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.030
all kinds of interesting
consequences,

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.210
not only for the people who-- like
I had the luxury of being able

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.450
to find a secure place
for my family.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.440
But it was also interesting
to see how

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.350 position:56%
that changed my view of my own city.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.900
Because if you had the
illusion that you can own a part

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.600
of a physical space, the people
who don't have that ability,

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:51.260
you start seeing them as with
a suspicion that I was, yeah,

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:57.000
that I didn't think that I was
capable with that, kind of.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.300
Yeah.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, you want to go first?

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.640
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: Yeah.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.140
My question is how long did
it take you to write the book

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.120
and how do you find the
strength to write again

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.910
when your friend dies
and you feel empty?

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.690 position:56%
How do you move on and keep writing?

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.030
Do you stop?

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:25.900
How do you, I guess, get to
starting and completing a book?

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.560
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri:
Well, this one was trickier

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.980
than the other ones, actually.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.500
And I think it had to do
with that feeling that I've--

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.800
so I've been writing all my life.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.780
That has been my main joy, like
the best drug I know is to--

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.350
just to go home and
to write and to--

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:47.120
I've never doubted
the value of words.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.690 position:56%
But having that loss in my life, for
the first time, it was as if I kind

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:55.090
of doubted what words
could do actually.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:43:06.430 position:56%
And I don't think I have a-- the one
thing that got me out of that whole

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:12.780
of feeling like doubting what
words could do was just to realize

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.700
that even though they
couldn't, how should I put it,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.590
even though they couldn't
recreate the person who was gone,

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.660
the feelings that I had of having
lost her were able to capture--

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.880
I was able to put that on the
page, and there were many things

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.100
that happened after having lost her

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:38.690
that I thought would be
tricky to put in post.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.360
One thing that was weird to me that
we all know if we lose someone,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.070
that person is gone, but
the strange thing was

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.070
that even though she was gone,
she was present everywhere.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.050
So I kept seeing her everywhere,
I kept just speaking my memories

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.920
like the amounts of
memories that kept coming

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.000
up that we had shared
was just endless.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.060
So, the only way I had-- the only
way I could deal with that was

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:08.330
to try to write myself
out of it and, yeah.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.750
In the end, it became
this book, but--

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.670
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.970
&gt;&gt; Jonas Hassen Khemiri: Now, I'm
seeing a sign that says wrap up

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.010
and I'm guessing that that
means that we are done.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.810
So thank you very much for coming.
