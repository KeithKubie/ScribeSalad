00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.010
I think if we tried to write down a

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.020
I think if we tried to write down a
 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.190
I think if we tried to write down a
universe on on the piece of paper that

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200
universe on on the piece of paper that
 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.869
universe on on the piece of paper that
was the most simple in the most elegant

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879
was the most simple in the most elegant
 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.339
was the most simple in the most elegant
there's a lot of things you wouldn't

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349
there's a lot of things you wouldn't
 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.429
there's a lot of things you wouldn't
find so it uh it's all all the way all

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439
find so it uh it's all all the way all
 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.250
find so it uh it's all all the way all
the details intermesh are very important

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260
the details intermesh are very important
 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.109
the details intermesh are very important
to for example allowing people to exist

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119
to for example allowing people to exist
 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.230
to for example allowing people to exist
and I mean on the biological level I

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240
and I mean on the biological level I
 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.820
and I mean on the biological level I
guess this is obvious that we're very

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830
guess this is obvious that we're very
 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.950
guess this is obvious that we're very
dependent on respiratory system and all

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960
dependent on respiratory system and all
 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.150
dependent on respiratory system and all
the rest of it which is not something

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160
the rest of it which is not something
 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.280
the rest of it which is not something
that you would just invent again if you

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290
that you would just invent again if you
 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.520
that you would just invent again if you
had a random piece of paper and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530
had a random piece of paper and
 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.799
had a random piece of paper and
certainly what we've discovered this

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809
certainly what we've discovered this
 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.780
certainly what we've discovered this
sort of pie picture of the universe that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790
sort of pie picture of the universe that
 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.530
sort of pie picture of the universe that
you have four percent atoms the dark

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540
you have four percent atoms the dark
 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.170
you have four percent atoms the dark
matter which i think is a that is a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180
matter which i think is a that is a
 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.180
matter which i think is a that is a
soluble problem I think we're on the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
soluble problem I think we're on the
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.670
soluble problem I think we're on the
edge of solving that one but then all of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680
edge of solving that one but then all of
 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.319
edge of solving that one but then all of
a sudden this dark energy appeared out

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329
a sudden this dark energy appeared out
 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.410
a sudden this dark energy appeared out
as a complete mystery this was in the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420
as a complete mystery this was in the
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.529
as a complete mystery this was in the
late 1990s so i think i was saying

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539
late 1990s so i think i was saying
 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.209
late 1990s so i think i was saying
around then in the past ten years around

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219
around then in the past ten years around
 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.010
around then in the past ten years around
the turn of the millennium it's really

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020
the turn of the millennium it's really
 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.109
the turn of the millennium it's really
been the golden age for cosmology from

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119
been the golden age for cosmology from
 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.700
been the golden age for cosmology from
the point of view of data coming in and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710
the point of view of data coming in and

the point of view of data coming in and
really affecting our thinking so this is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
really affecting our thinking so this is
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.830
really affecting our thinking so this is
a very bizarre probably illogical thing

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840
a very bizarre probably illogical thing
 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.590
a very bizarre probably illogical thing
from our current understanding of what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
from our current understanding of what
 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.859
from our current understanding of what
powers the dark energy so what the the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869
powers the dark energy so what the the
 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.690
powers the dark energy so what the the
thing that we see is that the apparently

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700
thing that we see is that the apparently
 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.270
thing that we see is that the apparently
the universe is not only expanding that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280
the universe is not only expanding that
 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.100
the universe is not only expanding that
we've known that for a long time but

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110
we've known that for a long time but
 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.350
we've known that for a long time but
also accelerating and the way this was

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360
also accelerating and the way this was
 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.630
also accelerating and the way this was
originally found was by looking at very

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
originally found was by looking at very
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.539
originally found was by looking at very
bright supernovae these are the

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549
bright supernovae these are the
 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.270
bright supernovae these are the
explosions of dying stars and these

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280
explosions of dying stars and these
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.060
explosions of dying stars and these
distant supernovae were seen to be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070
distant supernovae were seen to be
 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.999
distant supernovae were seen to be
fainter than anybody expected and one

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
fainter than anybody expected and one
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.859
fainter than anybody expected and one
interpretation was that they're

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
interpretation was that they're
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.560
interpretation was that they're
accelerating away from us and at first

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570
accelerating away from us and at first
 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.600
accelerating away from us and at first
it wasn't clear what really was going on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610
it wasn't clear what really was going on
 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.340
it wasn't clear what really was going on
but that is the consensus picture at

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
but that is the consensus picture at
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.289
but that is the consensus picture at
this point that this you have this

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299
this point that this you have this
 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.460
this point that this you have this
acceleration driven by this powerful new

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
acceleration driven by this powerful new
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.170
acceleration driven by this powerful new
well it's this is this isn't it's almost

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180
well it's this is this isn't it's almost
 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.450
well it's this is this isn't it's almost
like an antigravity so whereas dark

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460
like an antigravity so whereas dark
 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.670
like an antigravity so whereas dark
matter makes up galaxies it has a normal

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680

gravitational interaction this other

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810

stuff has some kind of negative pressure

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
stuff has some kind of negative pressure
 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.679
stuff has some kind of negative pressure
it pushes things apart and it could

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
it pushes things apart and it could
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.800
it pushes things apart and it could
either be a new kind of energy density

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
either be a new kind of energy density
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.110
either be a new kind of energy density
of vacuum energy density or it could be

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
of vacuum energy density or it could be
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300
of vacuum energy density or it could be
telling us that our basic equations are

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
telling us that our basic equations are
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.900
telling us that our basic equations are
wrong and we

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910
wrong and we
 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.210
wrong and we
have to rethink everything so this one

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220
have to rethink everything so this one
 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.330
have to rethink everything so this one
has people very excited and puzzled and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
has people very excited and puzzled and
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.470
has people very excited and puzzled and
it's not going to be answered you know

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
it's not going to be answered you know
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.730
it's not going to be answered you know
that's this one will not be answered

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740
that's this one will not be answered
 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.130
that's this one will not be answered
tomorrow but it's a it's a big one and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
tomorrow but it's a it's a big one and
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.030
tomorrow but it's a it's a big one and
it certainly affects the future

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
it certainly affects the future
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.840
it certainly affects the future
evolution of the universe as well
