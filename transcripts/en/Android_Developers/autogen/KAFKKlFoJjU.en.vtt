talk about our view of growth and it's
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.920
talk about our view of growth and it's
about testing lots of ideas and some of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
about testing lots of ideas and some of
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689
about testing lots of ideas and some of
the principles and processes that you

jumping into growth is testing lots of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
jumping into growth is testing lots of
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.939
jumping into growth is testing lots of
ideas so to begin with I just wanted to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
ideas so to begin with I just wanted to
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.490
ideas so to begin with I just wanted to
illustrate the point by showing you four

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
illustrate the point by showing you four
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260
illustrate the point by showing you four
different conversion tests that we've

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
different conversion tests that we've
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.080
different conversion tests that we've
run in the past six months and I was

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
run in the past six months and I was
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640
run in the past six months and I was
hoping to ask the audience which one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
hoping to ask the audience which one
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.149
hoping to ask the audience which one
similar to what Jenny did which one you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
similar to what Jenny did which one you
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.160
similar to what Jenny did which one you
think had the biggest impact on our

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
think had the biggest impact on our
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770
think had the biggest impact on our
conversion rate so if we take them in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
conversion rate so if we take them in
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679
conversion rate so if we take them in
turn the first one was making the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
turn the first one was making the
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.499
turn the first one was making the
ability to replay games in a given day a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
ability to replay games in a given day a
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.070
ability to replay games in a given day a
pro feature now the second one was

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
pro feature now the second one was
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620
pro feature now the second one was
reducing the price of Pro by 25% in our

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
reducing the price of Pro by 25% in our
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.800
reducing the price of Pro by 25% in our
top two markets the third one was

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
top two markets the third one was
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390
top two markets the third one was
bundling add-on modules from our

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

Peroni content so that users could

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
Peroni content so that users could
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170
Peroni content so that users could
actually see what they're getting before

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
actually see what they're getting before
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.760

they buy it so and which one do you guys

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
they buy it so and which one do you guys
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.870
they buy it so and which one do you guys
think had the biggest impact like

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
think had the biggest impact like
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.440

maybe for a show of hands cool 4b 4c not
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.180
maybe for a show of hands cool 4b 4c not
a popular one for D Wow ok so that's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
a popular one for D Wow ok so that's
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.780
a popular one for D Wow ok so that's
interesting because the answer was a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.800
making game replays a pro feature

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
making game replays a pro feature
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140
making game replays a pro feature
actually increased our conversion rate

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
actually increased our conversion rate
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.390
actually increased our conversion rate
by more than 50% which is huge for the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
by more than 50% which is huge for the
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.530
by more than 50% which is huge for the
business and you can go further it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
business and you can go further it
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.180
business and you can go further it
actually had a bigger impact on our

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
actually had a bigger impact on our
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650
actually had a bigger impact on our
conversion rate than the last 10 tests

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
conversion rate than the last 10 tests
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.280
conversion rate than the last 10 tests
we did combined so what's the key

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
we did combined so what's the key
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.900
we did combined so what's the key
takeaway well basically you don't know

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
takeaway well basically you don't know
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.850
takeaway well basically you don't know
what's going to work and what won't so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
what's going to work and what won't so
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.410
what's going to work and what won't so
the key is to test lots of ideas as

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420
the key is to test lots of ideas as
 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.970
the key is to test lots of ideas as
quickly as you can

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.280
cool so taking that on board how should

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
cool so taking that on board how should
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.240
cool so taking that on board how should
you approach testing in your company

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
you approach testing in your company
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.770
you approach testing in your company
well we think that before you test for

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
well we think that before you test for
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.340
well we think that before you test for
growth you need a great product to do so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350
growth you need a great product to do so
 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.780
growth you need a great product to do so
with a great retention if you have a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
with a great retention if you have a
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520
with a great retention if you have a
customer lifetime component to your

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
customer lifetime component to your
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.250
customer lifetime component to your
business model if you don't have this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
business model if you don't have this
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780
business model if you don't have this
then what's going to happen well you'll

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
then what's going to happen well you'll
 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.400
then what's going to happen well you'll
be adding more users into the top of the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
be adding more users into the top of the
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.020
be adding more users into the top of the
funnel but they'll just be leaking out

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030
funnel but they'll just be leaking out
 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.420
funnel but they'll just be leaking out
down the funnel so you won't be able to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
down the funnel so you won't be able to
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.920
down the funnel so you won't be able to
grow your business and you're going to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930
grow your business and you're going to
 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.599
grow your business and you're going to
be looking like the leaky app there in

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609
be looking like the leaky app there in
 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:18.740
be looking like the leaky app there in
the bottom right hand corner so testing

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
the bottom right hand corner so testing
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.110
the bottom right hand corner so testing
for growth is by nature quantitative so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
for growth is by nature quantitative so
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.220
for growth is by nature quantitative so
we also think that you need data

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
we also think that you need data
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.060
we also think that you need data
informed culture to test successfully I

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070
informed culture to test successfully I
 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.620
informed culture to test successfully I
picked out four things here that I think

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
picked out four things here that I think
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.360
picked out four things here that I think
we do quite well at peak which might be

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370

for that the second one is prioritizing
 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.499
for that the second one is prioritizing
those ideas and to do this what we tend

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509
those ideas and to do this what we tend
 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.409
those ideas and to do this what we tend
to do is group the ideas by which part

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419
to do is group the ideas by which part
 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.180
to do is group the ideas by which part
of the funnel we're testing and then

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190
of the funnel we're testing and then
 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.740
of the funnel we're testing and then
within that we will prioritize them

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750
within that we will prioritize them
 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.749
within that we will prioritize them
based on the impacts that we think each

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759
based on the impacts that we think each
 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.330
based on the impacts that we think each
test will have taking into account that

to work and which one won't once you
have an idea of what's test you should

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389
have an idea of what's test you should

Viable test for that so that's the

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440
Viable test for that so that's the
 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.680
Viable test for that so that's the
quickest easiest thing you can do to

your business understands what the test

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409
your business understands what the test
 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.920
your business understands what the test
was what the results were and you want

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930
was what the results were and you want
 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.689
was what the results were and you want
to think is there anything else that I'm

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699
to think is there anything else that I'm
 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.860
to think is there anything else that I'm
doing at the moment that this test

part are the key KPIs for our tests and

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.290
part are the key KPIs for our tests and
 

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.560
part are the key KPIs for our tests and
the fifth bar are the results and the

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.570
the fifth bar are the results and the
 

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.719
the fifth bar are the results and the
next steps for the tests that we

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:13.729
next steps for the tests that we
 

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:18.370
next steps for the tests that we
finished so the reason why this works

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.380
finished so the reason why this works
 

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.070
finished so the reason why this works
particularly well is that when you do

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080
particularly well is that when you do
 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.840
