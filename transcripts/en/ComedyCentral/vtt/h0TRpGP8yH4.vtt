00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:03.704
- WITH OUR SIGN NOW ON DISPLAY,
MY PLAN QUICKLY BEGAN TO WORK,

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:04.805
AS PEOPLE STARTED COMING IN

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.940
THINKING IT WAS
AN ACTUAL STARBUCKS.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.977
- OH, DUMB STARBUCKS.
OKAY, OKAY.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.011
- OH, YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS STARBUCKS.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.446
- I DID.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.515
- BUT THE FEW CUSTOMERS WE DID
GET SEEMED TO HAVE TROUBLE

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.483
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE WERE
ALL ABOUT.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.688
I MEAN, LEGALLY SPEAKING,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:26.927
THIS STORE HAS TO BE CATEGORIZED
AS AN ART GALLERY,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.931
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE
BY THE SAME HEALTH REGULATIONS

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.332
AS A STARBUCKS WOULD.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.707
I MEAN, WE DON'T WANT ANY OF
OUR CUSTOMERS TO GET SICK.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.242
BUT IF THEY DO,
TECHNICALLY,

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.445
THAT'S PART OF
THE ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.515
THINGS WERE OFF
TO AN OKAY START.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.684
BUT AS THE DAY PROGRESSED,
I BECAME FRUSTRATED

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.720
WE WEREN'T GETTING THE AMOUNT
OF CUSTOMERS I EXPECTED.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.923
SO I HEADED OUT TO A NEARBY
COFFEE SHOP

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:58.392
TO TRY AND SPREAD THE WORD
ABOUT MY NEW BUSINESS.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.660
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A DUMB STARBUCKS

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.228
THAT'S OPENED UP
DOWN THE BLOCK.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.596
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.065
IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME COFFEE.
CHEAPER PRICES, AND--

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.333
- DUMB STARBUCKS?
- YEAH.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.969
TODAY, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE
A FREE COFFEE ON ME.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.671
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROMOTE YOUR COMPANY.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.372
- RIGHT.
- I ADMIRE THAT.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.574
BUT THAT'S GREAT.
YOU CAN'T DO IT ON

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:14.741
STARBUCKS' PROPERTY.
- AND I ADMIRE YOU.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.376
AND I WILL BE--
- AND EVERY TIME I STEP BACK,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.679
YOU KEEP TAKING A STEP FORWARD.
- NO, I HAVEN'T MOVED.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.414
- YOU HAVE.
WE STARTED OVER HERE.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.882
- NO, WE STARTED RIGHT HERE.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.284
- BUT YOU NEED TO WALK THAT WAY.
- OKAY, I WILL.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:27.087
- UNFORTUNATELY, MY MARKETING
EFFORTS WERE CUT SHORT.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.825
BUT I WAS AT LEAST ABLE
TO GET SOME FREE SUPPLIES.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.260
WITH AN UNDERWHELMING
LAUNCH DAY,

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.196
I BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE I PUT IN
ALL THIS EFFORT FOR NOTHING.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:41.335
BUT THE NEXT MORNING
THINGS CHANGED.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.003
JEREMIAH CALLED ME TO SAY
THERE WAS A LINE

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.906
OF OVER 15 PEOPLE AT THE STORE.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.541
THEN I SAW PHOTOS
OF MY SHOP POSTED

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.177
ON A STRAIGHT BODY BUILDING
MESSAGE BOARD.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.213
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE FORESEEN
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:54.948 line:0%
 
- A NEW COFFEE SHOP
WITH A FAMILIAR NAME

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:57.117 line:0%
 
CREATING QUITE A STIR
IN LOS ANGELES.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.188 line:0%
 
THE COFFEE SHOP--GET THIS--
IS CALLED DUMB STARBUCKS.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.123 line:0%
 
- THAT LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE A STARBUCKS.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.626 line:0%
 
THE LOGO, THE LETTERING,
THE GREEN COLORING--

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.060 line:0%
 
HOW DO THEY GET AWAY
WITH THIS?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.496 line:0%
 
- BECAUSE THEY PUT THE WORD
"DUMB" ON TOP OF STARBUCKS,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.898 line:0%
 
SO THEY'RE PARODYING
STARBUCKS.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.901
- A COFFEE CHAIN NOTORIOUS
FOR SUING IMITATORS

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.636
MAY HAVE FINALLY
MET IT'S MATCH.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.938
- AT THE COUNTER, CUSTOMERS
CAN ORDER A "DUMB VENTI"

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.874
OR BUY A CD
OF "DUMB NORAH JONES DUETS."

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.510 line:0%
 
- SOME PEOPLE WAITED IN LINE
FOR UP TO AN HOUR.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.446 line:0%
 
- IT'S AN ART GALLERY WHERE
COFFEE IS CONSIDERED ART.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.916
- WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE ART?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE MESSAGE?

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.686 line:0%
 
- I DON'T KNOW.
- [speaking Spanish]

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.589
- [speaking Korean]

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:36.790
- I WAS STUNNED.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.893
WE HAD MORE CUSTOMERS
THAN I EVER DREAMED OF.

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:42.129
AND WITHIN 24 HOURS,
DUMB STARBUCKS

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.364
HAD BECOME
A WORLDWIDE SENSATION.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.166
- YEAH, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
ARTISTIC VALUE HERE.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.935 line:0%
 
- TO ME, THIS IS A PROTEST.

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:49.336 line:0%
 
THIS IS A PROTEST
AGAINST THE BIG FISH.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.338 line:0%
 
THE LEVIATHANS OF STARBUCKS.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.240 line:0%
 
- IT WAS COOL THAT PEOPLE
COULD DRAW THEIR OWN MEANING

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.109 line:0%
 
FROM A BUSINESS THAT
WAS JUST THERE TO MAKE MONEY.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.278 line:0%
 
- THERE'S A RUMOR
THAT IT MIGHT BE BANKSY

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:00.280 line:0%
 
AND WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.549
- I HAD INADVERTENTLY
CREATED SOMETHING

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.752
THAT WAS ON PAR WITH ONE OF
THE WORLD'S GREATEST ARTISTS.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.521 line:0%
 
- SOMETHING TIED TO AN ART
INSTALLATION.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.056 line:0%
 
MAYBE THIS IS BANKSY.

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.091 line:0%
 
- BEFORE I KNEW IT,
CUPS FROM MY SHOP

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:14.127 line:0%
 
WERE SELLING ON EBAY
FOR $500 A PIECE.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.563 line:0%
 
AND SWINDLERS WERE EVEN TRYING
TO CASH IN ON THE HYPE

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:19.766 line:0%
 
BY HOCKING FAKE MERCHANDISE
OUTSIDE THE STORE.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.170 line:0%
 
BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND
I REALIZED THAT DUMB STARBUCKS

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.306 line:0%
 
WAS A BIGGER IDEA
THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.575
SO I GATHERED THE WORLDWIDE
MEDIA TO ANNOUNCE

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.511
THAT WE WERE EXPANDING.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.079
[cheers and applause]

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.081
HI.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.850
I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT WE'LL SOON BE OPENING

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:40.320
A SECOND DUMB STARBUCKS LOCATION
IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.622
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.491
[cheers and applause]

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.261
MY BUSINESS WAS NOT ONLY
A BONA FIDE SUCCESS,

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.129
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.099
IT FELT LIKE PEOPLE ACTUALLY
WANTED TO BE AROUND ME.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.469
WHATEVER I HAD DONE
RESONATED WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.372
AND THE ATTENTION
WAS LIKE SUNLIGHT ON MY SOUL.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.541 line:0%
 
MY ENTIRE MARKETING PLAN
DEPENDED ON USING

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.043 line:0%
 
THEIR CORPORATE LOGO
TO GET ATTENTION.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.913 line:0%
 
AND THE ONLY WAY TO LEGALLY DO
IT IS BY USING "DUMB."

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:09.216 line:0%
 
- EVERY MAJOR NETWORK IN AMERICA
WANTED TO KNOW MY STORY.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.651
- NATHAN FIELDER.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.119
- I WAS INVINCIBLE.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.889
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, THE VIEW
FROM THE TOP WAS PRETTY NICE.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.058
WE'RE ALSO FAMOUS
FOR OUR PASTRIES.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.960
I BROUGHT YOU SOME, ACTUALLY.
- OH, OKAY. YEAH, GREAT.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.061
- I BROUGHT SOME
OF OUR PASTRIES, YEAH.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.063
- OH, THOSE LOOK GREAT.
[audience laughs]

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.698
WHAT DO YOU CALL THESE?
ARE THESE THOSE--

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.066
- I BROUGHT MUFFINS TOO.
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.501
- THESE ARE OUR FAMOUS PASTRIES.
- ISN'T THAT WEIRD.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.736
IT SAYS VONS ON THE SIDE.
[audience laughs]

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.906
- I WAS ALL SMILES
AND MY HEAD WAS IN THE CLOUDS.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.675
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
REALITY HIT.
