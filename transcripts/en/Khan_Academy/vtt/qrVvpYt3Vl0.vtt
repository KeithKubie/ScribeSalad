00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.680
According to the
pictograph below,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.870
how many survey respondents
have type O positive blood?

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.700
How many have O negative blood?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.750
So a pictograph is
really just a way

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.990
of representing
data with pictures

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.970
that are somehow
related to the data.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.970
So in this case, they
gave us little pictures

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.870
of, I'm assuming, blood
drops right over here.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.470
And then they tell us that each
blood drop in this pictograph

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.944
represents 8 people.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.360
So you could kind of view that
as a scale of these graphs.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.730
Each of these say 8 people.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.230
So, for example, if you say how
many people have A positive?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.570
It would be 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 blood drops.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.580
But each of those blood
drops represent 8 people,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.230
so it would be 56 people
have type A positive.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.730
But let's answer
the actual question

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.920
that they're asking us.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.080
How many survey respondents
have type O positive?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.560
So this is O, and then
we care about O positive.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.532
So we have 1 blood drop, 2, 3.

00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:02.490
I'm going to do this in
a new, different color.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.000
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.880
So we have 8 drops.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.360
I'll put those in quotes because
they're pictures of drops.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.780
And then the scale is 8 people.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.170
Let me write it this way.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.940
Times 8 people per drop.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.370
And so 8 times 8-- and
actually even the drops,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.869
you could view them
as canceling out

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.210
if you view them as
units, so drops, drops.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.412
8 times 8 is equal to 64 people.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.370
So they could have written
literally the number

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.550
64 right over here.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.540
64 people have type
O positive blood.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.060
Now let's think about
the O negative case,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.260
O negative blood.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.480
Well, this is O. And then
within the blood group O,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.420
this is O negative.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.510
And we have 1 drops, 2 drops.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.220
So we have 2 drops
times 8 people per drop.

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:06.420
And so 2 times 8, each
of these represent 8.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.030
So 8 and then 16, or 2 times
8 is equal to 16 people.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.060
So 16 of the survey respondents,
16 have type O negative.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.328
64 have type O positive.
