00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.559
Hey there predictable patrons, Jules here
for DNews.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.800
Randomness is… kind of an elusive concept.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.840
In theory, we can broadly define something
as random if it is unpredictable.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.911
Pulling a red or blue marble out of a jar
is considered 'random' since there’s no

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.000
practical way to predict which of the two
you’ll pull out.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.509
A roll of the dice is also seemingly random,
as most people can only guess at the result.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.469
And that’s kind of important.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.780
Randomness matters when it comes to gambling,
scientific experiments, military drafts, cryptography,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.780
even art!

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.219
As a society, we use randomness as a method
of 'fairness' or impartiality.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.309
The idea is that if something random cannot
be predicted, then it cannot be usefully influenced

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.260
in one direction or another, and it’s just
up to the 'universe' to make a choice for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.260
us.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569
At least, that’s the theory.

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.479
But we’re talking about 'practical randomness',
which can range from things that are just

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.640
hard to measure in advance -- like a coin
flip -- to things that are almost impossible

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.820
to measure -- like which direction a leaf
might float as it falls from a tree.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.399
To predict that, you would need to know the
weight of the leaf, the airflow around it,

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.600
temperature, tree height, and basically a
million other factors.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.409
The more factors involved, the harder it is
to take them all into account.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
But that doesn’t necessarily mean that we
can’t EVENTUALLY make a prediction.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.310
In 2012, researchers from Poland and Scotland
determined a way to predict die rolls.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
They took into account air viscosity, table
friction, and the acceleration of gravity,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.340
ran that through a series of complex equations,
and compared the result to high speed camera

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.310
footage of real dice.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.570
Using this, they managed to develop a system
to predict what number the die would most

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.810
likely land on.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.189
So, as of 2012, dice are not necessarily random
anymore -- at least, if you’re a scientist.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.109
This 'predicting randomness' issue is kind
of a huge problem.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.380
The better math, science, and technology are
at assessing prior conditions, the better

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.070
they’ll be at making random things predictable.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.859
And in fact, much of what is purported to
be random, is ACTUALLY 'pseudo-random'.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.860
Here’s an example: if you go online, you
can quickly find a 'random number generator',

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.220
and for most purposes, that’s fine.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.700
But almost by definition, a computer cannot
provide 'random' results.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.030
A calculation with all the same original parts
must deliver the same result every time, and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.750
that’s all a computer is -- an ultra-powerful
number cruncher.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.410
So how do computers produce random numbers?

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.930
There are a few ways, and most involve using
an initial number based on some external variable

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.590
that the computer cannot itself generate.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.500
This can be anything, like measuring how long
you hold down a letter on your keyboard divided

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.720
by the current temperature at the top of Mount
Everest.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.080
Another theoretical source is to measure the
radioactive decay of an atom, which at that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.680
level, according to quantum theory, is impossible
to predict, and is thus 'random'.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.599
But the same problem exists as with the die
rolls.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.630
Right now, we are not able to predict atomic
decay, or the length of time you might hold

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.030
down the G key while Mount Everest is 14 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.340
But that doesn’t mean we never will.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.549
And since those random numbers are STILL predicated
on a fixed value, their randomness is suspect.1For

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.110
cryptologists, this is an enormous problem.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.439
To try and solve it, Intel developed RdRand
on their processing chips.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.970
These read a source of unpredictable entropy
on the processor itself, which is converted

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.900
into a number to be used as a seed for developing
a random number by running it through complex

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.900
algorithms.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.512
But the system was blacklisted by some operating
system developers on the basis that it may

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:38.689
contain a backdoor for the NSA should Intel
give them access.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.980
Some have even taken to running RdRand’s
output through their own algorithms to prevent

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.780
the possibility of a third party being able
to decrypt the RdRand output and break its

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.780
randomness.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.070
Even when we seemingly have a source of randomness,
it can theoretically be compromised.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.250
As we get better and better at measuring the
world around us, true randomness becomes more

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.570
and more elusive.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.040
If one day we’re able to reliably measure
the quantum output of atoms, then we might

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.340
as well give up on gambling, and stop using
computer encryption.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.719
But for most, pseudo-randomness is enough.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.590
There are some things we can predict however,
such as the most likely outcomes of a game,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.389
a social situation, or even an election.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:37.199
Check out our video all about that, here.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.449
So what do you think?

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.009
Can anything really be random?
