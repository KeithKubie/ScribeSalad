[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.970
FILIP: Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.070
This is, again, this is your
favorite host of "Flutter

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.270
Boring Show," Emily
and I. And we are

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.309
very impressed with our work.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.050
We like the app that we have.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.770
EMILY: Quality.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.570
FILIP: Yeah, the
quality is amazing.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.140
And we hear that
there is a drought

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.110
of apps on the Play Store.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.850
EMILY: Demand is just
through the roof.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.350
FILIP: Yes.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.630
They're calling
Google like, when.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.050
So we are going to fill
that gap by publishing

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.290
our Flutter "Hacker News"
app to the Play Store.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.800
EMILY: Disrupts the "Hacker
News" reading space.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.570
FILIP: Next episode
is going to be

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
about startups and investment
and stuff like this.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.580
So we have our app.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.130
It has caching and everything.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.820
It's a regular Flutter app.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.280
Now that I think of it, we've
been only testing it in iOS.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.940
I'm only hoping that
it's also working

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.480
for Android, because we're
publishing it to Play Store.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.600
So how do you do
something like that?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.980
There's actually a
really good article

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.930
at flutterio about publishing.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.360
Maybe I should just use Google.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.097
So flutter publish.

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.430
EMILY: Good thing our employer
is good at finding things

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.050
on the internet.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.430
FILIP: Right, so this one.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.100
As you can see, I've
seen this recently.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.700
And this is all you need.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.610
Let's go through this quickly.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.180
I have done this recently,
as I mentioned before.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.840
And I think, all of this
should be pretty good.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.830
So review the app manifest.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.840
This is the Android
instructions.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.100
App manifest is located in
Android app source main.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.732
So we're going to Android.

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:08.000
What did I say?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.245
EMILY: App source main.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:14.260
FILIP: App source
main, Android manifest.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.340
So this is the name
of the package.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.610
Verify the values, application,
edit the application tag

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.950
to reflect the final
name of the app.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.176
Where's that application?

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:27.050
Oh.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.900
So the label's probably
something like--

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I don't know if that's a
trademark or something.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.665
So H- N app in Flutter.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.331
Oh, Flutter HN.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.700
EMILY: By Phillip the great.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.310
FILIP: User permissions--
do we need internet?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.760
Yes, we do, and we have it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240
So that's done.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.250
Review the build configuration.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.810
So we need our
application ID that's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.070
unique as our app ID
in the Android app.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.530
So that's not this.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.320
Build gradle.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.324
And we get to default config.

00:03:21.324 --> 00:03:22.240
EMILY: [INAUDIBLE] up.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.040
FILIP: OK, we can use that.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.065
We can live with this.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.130
Yes, our own unique
application ID.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.540
EMILY: Do we need to
register it or anything?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.540
FILIP: I don't think so.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.081
I think it's just
needs to be unique.

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.620
We'll see.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.390
Version code, version name.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.710
Specify the internal app
version number, and the--

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.460
consult the version
information guidance.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.980
Version name, version name.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.140
OK.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.430
min SDK, it should work on
everything, including SDK 16,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.610
so it's great.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.780
Launcher icon, we have the
regular Flutter Launcher icon,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.430
so we're not going
to add a new one.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.600
It's going to look
ugly, but that's fine.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.360
Signing the app, this is
actually pretty complicated

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.399
if you do this for
the first time.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.300
And also, I don't want to--

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.860
I trust you, but I'm
not going to show you--

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.989
use my keys.

00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:28.780
EMILY: You don't really
trust the internet.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.720
FILIP: Yes.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.870
So I'm going to go through
these things very quickly.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.945
And we either cut to the end--

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.330
EMILY: And I will distract you.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.579
FILIP: Yes, you will distract.

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:42.490
Thank you.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.210
OK.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.310
EMILY: So while
Filip is doing that,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.670
I notice actually a couple
of other little tweaks

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.180
that I think we should
make in the future.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.440
Or maybe while Filip is doing
that, I'll do it a little bit.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.740
Right now, it looks like--

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.110
I think when I
did the animation,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.330
I had it always
appear, just so that we

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.300
could see what was
happening and debug it,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.570
but then we never took it out.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.490
So now that little icon
[INAUDIBLE] is always there.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.620
And I was noticing,
so it should just

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.170
be we have this comment if
the snapshot is loading,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.830
that stream of like,
are we loading or not--

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.840
in fact, I'm going to
rename this from snapshot

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.600
to loading because I
think that's a little more

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.530
descriptive.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.750
And then, I'm going to
fix the indentation.

00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:52.270
And-- oh, great.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.480
And because I don't trust
my hot reload right now

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.300
I'm going to load it again.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.514
And next episode, you
all are in for a treat

00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:13.180
because we are going
to bring in someone

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.638
who actually knows
how to make apps

00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:17.230
look pretty, and is going to--

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.100
you can see how we take a
basic looking Material app

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.220
and make it better.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.580
We still have a problem.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.220
OK, Filip feel free to
cut in whenever you're--

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.890
FILIP: No, I'm still-- thank
you for covering for me.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.190
EMILY: OK.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.380
That's a long error.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.060
What's going on here?

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.138
Build functions must
never return null.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.640
So OK, that's right.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.940
So right now, we're
saying if it's loading

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.861
return this fading transition.

00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:50.360
Otherwise, we're
not doing anything.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.818
And it's saying,
you can't do that,

00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:53.420
because it shouldn't be null.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.697
So instead, I'm going to return
a very exciting container,

00:06:59.697 --> 00:07:00.530
if I spell it right.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.520
So now, if I tap on
this, there it is.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.060
You get the little Y
Combinator popping up.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.580
And actually, now, because
we implemented caching,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.020
you don't even see it at all.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.260
So we could add it in
briefly to make it appear,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.040
but yeah, that's a little
animation clean-up.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.460
FILIP: Still not
there, but I think

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:40.080
I am done with the
sensitive stuff.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.580
So as discussed before, I had to
create this key properties file

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.140
with a lot of secrets.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.930
And then I can go to
android/app/build.gradle.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.290
So android/app/build.gradle.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.220
This is, by the way, I
always get tripped up,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.525
because there's two build
gradles and one is an--

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.540
anyway.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.230
And then, it tells
me replace this

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.280
with this, which is basically
using my file from earlier

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.330
with the secrets.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:28.272
And then, I also replace this
with this, so build types,

00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:29.540
where's build types?

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.390
It's right here.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.750
OK, and then, [INAUDIBLE]
enabling Proguard,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.010
we don't need to.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.030
Building a release APK--

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.820
EMILY: That's really if you just
want to obfuscate your code.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.515
FILIP: Right.

00:08:44.515 --> 00:08:46.160
EMILY: And we're
open source already.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.910
People can see it.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.930
Who cares?

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.820
FILIP: So now,
flutter build apk,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.660
that by default is in
release, and fingers crossed.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.800
EMILY: So yeah, this
is actually building it

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.450
down to machine code.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.760
And so if you run
this version, you

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.720
won't be able to do hot reload,
because we're not running--

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.290
FILIP: Yes.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.790
Yes.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.915
EMILY: But it's going to
be super fast as a result.

00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:12.500
FILIP: Right.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.450
If you want to get
closer to this,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.120
you can run this
in profile, which

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.370
is this button I'm
running now, but actually,

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.160
let me just close this.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.470
But with profile mode,
it's very close to what

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.690
you get with release mode, but
it isn't signed with the things

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.660
that you need for
actual release.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.960
And it has some instrumentation
for doing profiling.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.460
So that's the closest
you get for that.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.810
Otherwise, you know,
everything else is the same.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.783
And as you can see,
we're assembleRelease.

00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:50.330
EMILY: Waiting on gradle.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.600
FILIP: Yeah, building gradle.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.280
Looks good.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.520
EMILY: And were there any
other-- oh, you're good.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.606
FILIP: Yeah, we're done.

00:09:58.606 --> 00:09:59.540
We're done.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.970
So I can open this--

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:13.200
and now I have 6.7 megabytes of
things that just do, you know,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.890
so you see that the debug
release is 30 megabytes.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:25.460
So don't get ever scared about
the size of your debug build.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.850
It's always going to be much
bigger than your actual build.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.490
And our 6.7 megabytes
that includes,

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.570
I think, the icons
and some other stuff.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.650
EMILY: And I will say the
photo team is actively

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.090
working on reducing the size
of even that release APK,

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.950
so it's 6.7 megabytes
right now, but it

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.240
is continuing to go down.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.510
FILIP: Yes.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.570
OK, so I went to the Play Store.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.900
We're not going to go
through like creating

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.610
a user in the Play Store
or anything like that,

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.230
but we have our Flutter HN app.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.160
It's going to
default to English.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.830
And then, short description,
it's HN app in Flutter.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.150
Yeah, right?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.390
And, oh, we need assets.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.260
OK, so that's maybe going
to be another intermission,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.560
because we somehow need to--

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.110
EMILY: Screenshots.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.190
FILIP: Screenshots
is the easier one.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.180
Let's do screenshots.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.550
EMILY: How many do you need?

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.010
FILIP: Two screenshots
are required.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.520
That's fine.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.600
OK, so you know what?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.160
EMILY: Yeah, really quick.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.870
FILIP: We're just going
to do a quick Android.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.210
Maybe the screenshot
in iPhone would not

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.816
work for the Play Store.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.190
EMILY: I think people will
appreciate if it's an Android.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.689
FILIP: Yeah.

00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:01.670
So let's run it.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.950
This is going to run it in
debug mode to be honest.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.410
So not great, but, you know.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.710
By the way, we're not
actually releasing it

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.180
for public consumption.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.790
We're going to release
it for private beta.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.259
We're just trying
to show you how--

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.800
EMILY: The process
of how that works.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.840
FILIP: Yes.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.670
OK, so phone, then the icon.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.840
Where do we get the icon?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.350
OK, so--

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.900
EMILY: Do you want
me give you an icon?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.510
FILIP: Yeah.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.010
EMILY: OK.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.360
FILIP: Do you have it?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.684
EMILY: I have like a--

00:12:34.684 --> 00:12:35.810
I can make it.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.040
Well, I have a dash icon.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.080
Or do you want the
Hacker News icon?

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.520
FILIP: No, dash icon is great.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.020
EMILY: OK.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.020
FILIP: Yeah.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.290
And then, 1,024 times 500 PNG.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:53.920
This is, obviously, this is
just getting the app to there.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.970
I'm going to go through
the rest of these things.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.160
So it's an application
in the category of News.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.480
EMILY: Is there a
limitation on size of icon?

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.280
FILIP: No, well, I will
need a 512 to 512 size.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.770
It needs like an exact
size unfortunately.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.960
EMILY: OK.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.650
FILIP: Oh, I need
a questionnaire

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.890
on content rating.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.900
That's just my things.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.876
Privacy policy.

00:13:21.876 --> 00:13:22.376
OK.

00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:32.708
Right.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.540
I just want to do app releases.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:55.984
OK, so and maybe we can just
postpone the actual images

00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:57.400
and stuff like
this, because I can

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.130
imagine that a lot of the
things will be-- oh, this

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.470
is super cute.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:08.680
So I don't know if we're
going to do that like, fully,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.760
but at least I want to show you
how you would like upload it

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.320
to the Play Store.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.349
So as I said, this--

00:14:15.349 --> 00:14:16.390
EMILY: Will it allow you?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.710
FILIP: --not going to--

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.400
yes.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.020
This is not going to be
a production app yet.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.070
So we're going to use
the internal test track.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.580
And the internal
test track is great

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:33.850
because it is only open to
people who you will give

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.990
the email addresses to that.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.030
It needs to be less
than 100 people,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.770
but whenever you make
a change, their app

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.730
will update in something
like five seconds, or maybe

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.060
a minute or five minutes.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.210
So that's really
helpful, especially

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.910
if you want to test it on
your own device as well,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.630
and you want to see like how
does the production app look

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.040
like with everything.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.140
Then you use the
internal test track.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.140
So I'm going to click Manage
here, and create a release.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:13.680
And-- reuse?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.290
OK.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.740
Continue.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.410
And now, all I need
to do hopefully,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.530
is just put this here.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.023
EMILY: So there were two--

00:15:34.023 --> 00:15:35.910
there was two APKs I saw.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.910
Sorry, go back to your--

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:37.930
FILIP: Right, yes.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.681
So this is the debug one.

00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:41.680
This is the release one.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.210
And then, I think this is just--

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.370
this is the same
as the debug one.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.950
It's just like a
sibling or something.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.800
But yeah, you definitely
want to put that release one.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.220
Even if you even
try the debug one,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.520
it will just scream at you
that this is a debug one.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:04.430
So OK, oh, another thing
that I wanted to show you

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.560
is whenever you
release to the store,

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.980
you need to have a different
release name and release

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.490
number.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:12.989
Right?

00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:16.430
We have a version code
one and release name 1.0.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.640
This is actually coming from--

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.590
EMILY: Our pubspec?

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:27.360
FILIP: Yeah, I thought it's
coming from our pubspec,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.030
and I don't see it here now.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.230
EMILY: Yeah, I thought
you specified--

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.840
FILIP: Yeah, maybe
this is a new pubspec.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.290
And this pubspec that
we're using for HN

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.055
app is coming from,
you know, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:46.210
EMILY: I think you
just specify a version.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.060
Yeah.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.015
FILIP: OK, so this
would be 001 +1.

00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:56.340
The +1 is important, because
that's what this is going

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.210
to be.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:57.760
Right?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.790
So at some point, you could have
like +8 and still have a 001.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.060
EMILY: So why is
it not version 1.0?

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.530
FILIP: We could do that in 1.0.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.980
You can do whatever,
but yeah, all right.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.722
Yeah, I mean it's pre-release.

00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:14.430
EMILY: Oh, I see.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.020
I see.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.270
OK, then don't do 1.0.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.700
FILIP: OK, so--

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.664
EMILY: 1.1.

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:26.220
FILIP: OK, so now, we
have to actually rebuild.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.700
So let's do it again, because
that's what actually--

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.670
so Flutter will update some
of the gradle things that

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.400
will make it sign as that.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.790
Right?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.210
Hopefully, this time it's
not going to be 40 seconds.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.360
So then, yes, so we're done.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:54.679
OK, so we actually
want to use this one.

00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:02.041
EMILY: Oh, no.

00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:03.790
FILIP: You need to use
a different version

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.130
code for your APK,
because you already

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.630
have one with version one.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.470
See?

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.870
So even though we
didn't publish,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.075
we just need to do this.

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:13.360
EMILY: Oh, my goodness.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.800
FILIP: Yeah.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.730
So this is why many people will
go with continuous delivery,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.200
something like fastlane.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.820
And again, if you
go to flutter.io,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.480
you will find a good
article about how

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.460
to do this automatically on
both stores, and continuously,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.660
but again, for testing
and for small apps,

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.607
you might just want to use this.

00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:37.690
EMILY: Do a one-off thing?

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.995
FILIP: Yes.

00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:42.148
EMILY: Do you need to rebuild?

00:18:42.148 --> 00:18:43.615
Or did you rebuild?

00:18:48.505 --> 00:18:50.827
FILIP: Hopefully, this
is the one that-- yeah.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.410
Really?

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.640
EMILY: I don't know
if you actually

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.427
rebuild after you saved.

00:18:58.427 --> 00:18:59.260
FILIP: Oh, I didn't?

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.530
EMILY: Yeah.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.950
FILIP: Also, probably do this.

00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:15.924
OK.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.790
With another file.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.590
EMILY: Come on
Google Play Store.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.692
FILIP: Yeah.

00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:26.525
EMILY: Take our APK.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.505
Seriously?

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:33.957
Wait, so did we
already upload one?

00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:34.790
FILIP: Yeah, we did.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.440
EMILY: Can we just use that?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.830
FILIP: We could.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.420
Yeah, I know.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.560
EMILY: If we wanted
to show the process.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.340
FILIP: Yeah.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.410
So no, so this is basically,
you have a release

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.200
that's been rolled out.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.580
Yeah, I mean-- yeah,
let's not dwell on this.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.930
Like you would have to rebuild
it or create a new release,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.610
but for now, we just
have version one review.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.150
And then, you should
provide release notes

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.230
for every release.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.220
OK.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.090
So initial release.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.750
Please [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.250
Review.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.814
View warning message.

00:20:23.814 --> 00:20:25.230
Will not be available
to any users

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.450
because you haven't specified
any testers for it yet.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.750
OK.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.710
And then, I could add
at least me as a tester,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.790
and so on and so forth.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:38.190
So from now on, it's really
just like procedural things

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.966
like, adding testers.

00:20:40.966 --> 00:20:42.590
EMILY: So where do
you add the testers?

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.931
FILIP: Oh, yeah.

00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:47.457
EMILY: Is that something
we can click through?

00:20:47.457 --> 00:20:48.290
FILIP: This is this.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.229
EMILY: Ah, OK.

00:20:49.229 --> 00:20:49.770
FILIP: Right?

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.220
So you just add
emails and all this.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.460
So yeah, I mean,
it takes its time.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.260
And for the first time you
will have to get screenshots,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.390
and you will have to get
icons and stuff like this.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.900
You will need to go
through all this process,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.560
but after that, it's
really just like copy

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.380
pasting, or dragging and
dropping your latest release

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.310
version.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.150
And it's signed
completely automatically.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.230
And it's just Flutter build APK.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.430
And that's it.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:30.060
A similar process for test
flight for iPhone, and maybe

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.900
at some point we could do
that, as well, but not today.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.290
So yeah, we've released,
almost released,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.970
our app to Play Store.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.720
I think it's doing great.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.860
And I think that's it for
today's episode of the Flutter

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.590
Boring Show.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.380
EMILY: Thanks for watching.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.505
FILIP: Thanks for watching.

00:21:48.505 --> 00:21:50.960
