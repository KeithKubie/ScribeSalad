00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.010
DAVID THORBURN: The film
experience is, as I said,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
began many years ago, 38 or
39 years ago in the version

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.990
that I teach.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.020
And it has undergone
almost a continuous process

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.960
of transformation.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.230
One of the ironies is that
it began its career in an era

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.630
before there was any
technology available to support

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.320
film study.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.170
It made things
actually very awkward.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.210
But it was also in some way
convenient for the professor.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.119
What we used to have to
do was show the film.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.670
We used to-- and
in fact, MIT belong

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.170
to a group called the
University Film Study Center.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.620
A group of institutions,
included Harvard and Yale.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.570
And what we did was we had a
library of 16 millimeter prints

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.440
of classic films.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.460
And we circulated them.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
So you had to
alter your syllabus

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.110
so that the guy at
Harvard was also

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.430
able to do Keaton because
there was only one

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.640
copy of The General available.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.100
So that was very complicated.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.440
And but we all managed to do it.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.820
And then at while I
was at MIT, that system

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.730
became moribund because
videotape became available,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.730
and films became
available on videotape.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.276
We also begin to be able to
project them on videotape.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:13.900
So we didn't have
the problem of trying

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.860
to rent the movie
at great expense,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.730
or to belong to the
Film Study Center,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.200
and try to keep these fraying 16
millimeter prints in operation.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.440
So that was a great boon.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.390
It also allowed us
for the first time

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.530
to stop and start the text.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700
So it allowed for forms of
close reading of the media that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.840
had never existed before.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.930
And one of the things it
exposed was the errors

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.710
of older scholars
and older critics,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.480
who were working from
memory in describing films,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.330
because in order to write
about a film in the old days,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.470
in the days when I
began to teach film,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.260
you actually had
to project a movie.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.750
And they had scholarly
versions of 16 millimeter

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.924
and other kinds
of projectors that

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:54.590
would allow you to
stop and start things

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.740
so you could study things.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.170
They were fairly expensive.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.720
And you had to go to an archive
that had the material film.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.310
The advent of videotape
transformed media study

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.540
and transformed film study
in ways that are still not

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.750
fully clear because every
film scholar, any place

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.060
in the world, was able to get
his hands on important text.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.050
And that process is, of
course, been elaborated

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.810
an almost infinite
number of times,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.380
a tremendous number of
times over the past decade,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.980
so that today, people could
go online and virtually get

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.340
access, certainly to clips,
and to many older films that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.660
were never available before.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.500
And every university,
and every film class

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.090
has access to this
material, and can even

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
set up-- first, as we've finally
done at MIT-- a system in which

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.480
students can actually
videostream films

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990
to their own laptops at will.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.210
And that's another
wrinkle because that's

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.130
a very recent addition to
what the film course did.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.381
So in the beginning, we would
have a communal viewing.

00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:57.921
And it was the only
time the students

00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:58.930
could look at the film.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.820
They couldn't even get
a second look at it.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.850
Then we moved to a phase
in which we continued

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.110
to have the communal viewing.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.380
But we made videotape
versions of the films

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.300
available on
reserve for students

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.680
who wanted to write papers
or to review for exams.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.820
And then we moved to a phase in
which when DVDs were available,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.380
we would sometimes not only
project the film from DVDs,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.066
but we would also make
both tapes and video

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:28.150
DVDs available to students
for use after class.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
And we would also allow
students to borrow the DVDs

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.830
and watch them in
their own time,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.970
and not attend the
communal viewing if they

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.330
were unable to attend.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.340
And, of course, that
immediately set in a process,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.190
began a process of attrition, in
which fewer and fewer students

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.690
found time to come to
the communal viewings.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.830
This is partly a function of
the scheduling crisis at MIT,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.570
and the busyness
of our students.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.250
If they have an option to
do it in their own time,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.810
they will often do
so, so that what

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.830
had been a kind of sacred space
in the course, the 8 to 10

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.180
evening slot that I often used
to show the film experience

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.470
text became less and
less well attended.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.690
And this had the
also troubling effect

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.550
of a slight-- ans I say maybe
more than slight-- but at least

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.430
a slight decline in the
attendance at the evening

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.295
lecture.

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:19.920
Because the way I
taught the course was

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.004
I had one lecture at 4 o'clock.

00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:23.920
From 4:00 to 5:00, they
would break for dinner

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.610
or their sports activities.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.290
At 7 o'clock, I would give
an introductory lecture.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.400
And at 8 o'clock, the communal
screening would begin.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.590
That communal moment before
the advent of streaming

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.650
and before it was
easy for the students

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.760
to get access to the
text on their own,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.930
was a much more powerful
moment than it has become.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.350
And so we haven't
figured out what to do.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.670
We haven't exactly figured
how the course can evolve

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.530
in ways that can maximize the
students opportunity to look

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.450
at the material
in their own time,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.300
but also maintain a sense
that there are certain spaces

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.810
ad times during the day that
are devoted to our activity,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.970
just as there are for
their physics lab,

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.070
and just as there are for
their chemistry lecture.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.185
We've got to do that to maintain
our parody with the sciences.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.060
When I begin the
film experience,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.870
I asked the students
to do something

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.900
they find increasingly
difficult. In the old days,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.690
this request wasn't necessary
in quite the same way.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.610
In the old days, before the
proliferation of smartphones,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.490
and visual media all over
the place, and everyone

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.560
being able to make his own video
and so forth, and the ubiquity

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.530
of DVDs, before those days, I
was able to tell the students,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.690
look, we live in an
audio visual age.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.530
We live in a televisual age.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.190
I want you to think
that stuff away.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.970
I want you to think
yourself back to an age

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.870
before people
understood that there

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.830
is such a thing as a film.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.330
And think about the original
meaning of movie is.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.150
Go back to the root meaning.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.640
It's a metaphor that is
a dead metaphor for us.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.550
But it actually--
it tells you what

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.570
the most fundamental
aspect of the movies

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.320
were for the original audiences,
and why they were so fascinated

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.220
by the capacity of this new
technology to capture motion.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.440
It seemed like, and it was,
a tremendous new advance

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.120
in technologies of
the representation

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.445
of human experience, because
it captured humans in motion.

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:33.570
It captured the
movements of the world.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.910
And the first films, as I
try to show my students,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.300
were so preoccupied by
this wondrous capacity

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.030
of the medium, that it's almost
the only thing they filmed.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.580
And you can see the evolution
of the medium embodied

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.460
in the way in which, after an
initial profound fascination

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.060
with the novelty of
movement begins to wear off,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.520
other properties of the film
medium begin to be discovered.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.210
So I tell my students
this principle.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.710
And I ask them to try
to think their way back

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.220
into the attitude of
these first viewers, who

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.980
didn't know about
the visual media,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.630
to play a kind of
thought experiment.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.450
Today, it's much
harder to make them

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.820
play that experiment
because I have to tell them,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.420
as I do in that first lecture,
think away your iPads.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.120
Imagine a world without iPads.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.280
Imagine a world
without smartphones.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.210
Imagine a world without
instant communication.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.680
And of course, this is much
harder for the students to do.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.120
And of course, at one level
they're much more capable

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.890
of processing audio visual
information than I am,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.526
and then my parents' generation,
and all of the generations

00:07:45.526 --> 00:07:47.400
older than they are,
because they've grown up

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.810
in an environment in which
essentially they're surrounded

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:57.100
24/7 by audio visual stimuli,
by audio visual signals.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.930
Many people might see
this as dangerous.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.890
Perhaps it is.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.790
But it develops new capacities.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.310
And one can see this in
the history of television,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.410
in which at a
certain point, there

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.100
are certain kinds of
television programs

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.390
that become too complex
for older generations.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.830
And only the younger-- the
cutoff comes around 1980

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.130
with a show called Hill
Street Blues, which

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.960
older fans, the fans that belong
to my parents' generation,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.230
couldn't watch because
it had too many subplots.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.662
And it jumped around too much.

00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:26.120
But the younger
generation that was

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.703
used to going to the movies, and
had been watching television,

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:33.530
and had been watching MTV,
or the origins of MTV,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.820
were able to understand
this very easily.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.400
And of course, that
process continued

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.270
on television very
intensely sot that today,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.710
there are forms of television
whose audio visual complexity

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.090
is beyond the imagination of the
people who were making programs

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:55.780
for the medium in the 1950s.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.740
One irony of this situation is
that even though the students

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.160
are very adept at
processing this information,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.400
they are even more
ignorant about the history

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.750
of the medium, especially the
history of movies, than ever.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.260
And it's even harder
today to find students

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.550
who even remember the
environment in which people had

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.690
television sets that required
you to change the channels,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.799
or who had television sets
in which were confined

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.840
to a single room, and
which in order to watch it,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.370
you had to move into that room.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.900
So the physical environment
is changing so much.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.410
And of course,
the original space

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.050
of the movies, the
great communal theater,

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.860
that's a dying space.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.300
You have to try to remind
the students about that.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.630
And so the part of
teaching the film course

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.080
has become much more historical.
