Can you guess which movie is represented by these emoji stay tuned at the end to find out?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.759
Timmy Turner is Danny Phantom growing up with fairy

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.299
Godparents is given Timmy Turner some great perks we followed his adventures through ten seasons of the hit Nick Toon Fairly

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.460
OddParents and even saw the addition of a third

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.690
Godparent by the name of poof Timmy can wish for anything he wants and gets to go on all sorts of adventures of course

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.029
Timmy's fun only last to the age of 13

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.359
That's when the godparents have to move on from their assignment this left lots of fans wondering about the future of Timmy

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.819
But the answer is clear according to a widespread

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.409
Theory upon turning 13 Timmy wishes to become a ghost fighting superhero

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.469
And his whole world is transformed into Danny Phantom

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.779
That's right a popular theory states that Danny Phantom and Timmy Turner are actually the same person

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.799
The characters have very similar looks and the same color eyes

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.279
supporting evidence can also be found through the show's supporting characters Chester looks like a younger version of -

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.239
AJ is a younger version of Tucker and Trixie is a younger version of Paulina the characters not only look alike

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.519
But they also have similar personality traits

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.639
Considering that both shows were created by Butch Hartman the connection makes more sense and is only even stronger

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.049
Spongebob is reborn first show that's been on for nearly 20 years and Counting SpongeBob SquarePants has gone through several

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.409
changes over this time one of the biggest differences between the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.700
Personality and the way spongebob acts can be seen at the start of season five in this season spongebob appear much more

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.760
Childish he's not as intelligent as he once was

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.349
And he does a lot more immature things with his friends like Patrick the drastic change in character points to one theory stating that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.729
Spongebob was actually reborn after dying and that his newborn younger self doesn't have the same maturity as his previous incarnation

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.939
Did wondering when spongebob died and was reborn?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.529
It's all on film for you in the first spongebob squarepants feature-length film

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.220
Spongebob and patrick are captured and brought to a beach souvenir shop

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.859
They're put under a heated lamp at a table and dry out the movie shows a tear bring them back to life

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.760
But real-life sponges are actually asexual and can reproduce on their own spongebob didn't come back to life

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.910
He was merely

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.089
reborn again the younger and immature

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.820
Spongebob also explains why he didn't remain the manager of the Krusty Krab as seen at the end of the movie

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.349
The fake Pete one of the more quirky and bizarre shows to ever appear on

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.420
Nickelodeon was The Adventures of Pete and Pete the two brothers lived a strange life filled with

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.329
Superheroes ice cream men and some pretty crazy

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.540
scenarios involving

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.459
Friends and family things may just seem a little weirder when he consider a fan theory stating the younger Pete was actually a fictional

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.569
manifestation of the older Pete basically it says that Pete had schizophrenia

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.279
And he envisioned the younger Pete as a way to capture years of youthful adventures

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.000
He missed out on Pete would also

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.870
manifest other

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.490
Characters on the show like the strong man named Artie the theory has some evidence in the form of the way the characters act around

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.850
Pete also for the simple fact that his parents would name both children by the same name the mom on the show also has a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.050
metal plate on her head

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.300
Which could have been the result of a condition passed down to the older Pete does the whole theory sound familiar?

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.210
It basically plays out like a child's version of Fight Club where Tyler Durden isn't a real character

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.409
But still has the ability to interact and communicate with the narrator of the story

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.270
Crazy Steve kidnapped Carly producer and writer Dan Schneider has spent years developing shows for Nickelodeon

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.510
He said several back-to-back hits starting with Drake and Josh

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.880
Transitioning to AI car and then eventually forming into crossover hits like

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:35.539
victorious and salmon cat there's one thing connecting the universe of all these shows and that's a character known as

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.339
Crazy steve played by Jerry Trainor crazy Steve made his debut and drake and josh is one of the movie theatre employees once

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.359
Icarly premiered the actor Jerry Trainor played Carly's older brother Spencer

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.319
but fans quickly strung a theory together making you question whether

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.759
Spencer is really Carly's brother at all the theory states that crazy Steve

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.369
eventually killed Drake and Josh while kidnapping their younger sibling Megan through manipulation and

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.250
Brainwashing crazy Steve moved Megan to Seattle forced her to change her name to Carly and the rest is history

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.809
The theory seemed a little far-fetched at first that is until a random episode of Sam and Kat showed crazy Steve in an insane

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:22.909
Asylum this helped make the final connection and revealed crazy steve was finally caught after Carly got away on the series finale of icarly

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.539
If Sam and Kat had continued to produce more episodes. We may have gotten more answers about the true story of crazy Steve

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.790
Drake and Josh the reality show every episode of Drake and Josh

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.809
Pretty much began the same way Drake and Josh would talk to the camera

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.320
Showcase their point of view and help set up the plot for the whole episode

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.110
While it appeared to have been done as a creative choice

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.390
Later clues from down the line may reveal that Drake and Josh was actually a show within a show

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.149
The reality show followed the characters lives as they dealt with their teenage years and their mixed family life

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.860
Some of the biggest clues to the reality show Theory actually come from other Nick shows on

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.219
Victorious multiple characters have referred to watching the show and on iCarly clips of the show have been shown

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.270
Pranks

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.859
one of the biggest clues comes from a character played by Yvette Nicole Brown

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.360
on Drake and Josh Brown played the movie theater manager named Helen Dubois on

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.570
Victorious the same

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:31.820
Character comes to take over as principal of Hollywood Arts High School if the characters on Victorious watched Drake and Josh and the same

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.620
Character shows up at their school

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.530
Then this is pretty much a confirmation that Drake and Josh was the reality show said in they're connected universes oh

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.700
Sure Mac

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.929
So great Steve's drug problem poor Blue's Clues

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.750
The preschool show we watched way beyond our

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.830
Preschool years has been under the microscope of rumors and theories for years

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.419
Some of the craziest rumors came when Steve left the show and was replaced by Joe

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.379
but people still can't coming up with theories about the adventures a grown man has with his puppy Blu as rumors of Steve's death and

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.380
Real life were proven to be false other

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.640
Rumors sparked up about the character and the stories he comes up with one of the more popular theories

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.830
Involves Steve taking drugs the characters use of heavy and hard drugs has created the whole

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.570
Alternate reality where blue and everything in his house comes to life how else would you explain?

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.249
Talking salt and pepper shakers who had a child together named paprika things seemed even more

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.140
drug-induced when Steve starts jumping into paintings and going on all sorts of crazy adventures

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.129
Right inside his own home these moments can all be seen as drug

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.500
Hallucinations for all we know Steve is just lounging in his big chair letting his mind run wild

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.439
You can only imagine the drugs and lifestyle the character into when he left the house to Joe and headed off to college

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.740
Timmy turner's

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.049
antidepressants The Fairly OddParents had ten seasons of happiness and adventures

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.240
But it didn't always start out this way timmy turner was not a happy child at the beginning

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.019
He had troubles at school was often neglected by his parents, and he was forced to deal with Vicky his horrible babysitter

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:19.699
According to a theory all of these factors. Led to depression to help with his depression Timmy didn't get the help of fairy godparents

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.699
But rather was prescribed

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:28.729
Antidepressants he manifested into his alternate view of godparents each godparent Timmy has could be broken down into different

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:36.648
Antidepressant medications the antidepressant Prozac is represented by Wanda Prozac is known for allowing a person to be calm and focused

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.260
Much like Wanda is in the series

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:47.029
Cosmo represents the antidepressant medication known as zoloft this works to make you more giddy and excited rather than depressed and

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:51.948
Represents exactly how Cosmo acts in the series the pills are taken and Timmy's room

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:58.010
Which just happens to be the place where the fairies appear anytime the fairies run out of magic or disappear?

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:04.129
It's essentially the pills wearing off and Timmy's depression starting to take hold again come to think of it

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.589
We're getting a little depressed just thinking about this theory

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:13.099
Jimmy neutrons government conspiracy

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.029
Jimmy Neutron is a boy genius who entertained Knick fans for over a decade

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.969
Looking back on the series there were some odd things

00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:27.319
Involving the characters and the town of retro Ville a widespread theory about the show puts everything into a perspective easy to explain

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.399
Jimmy and the other children were genetically modified government experiments used to help with military research and inventions

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.000
Basically Jimmy's whole life is a big lie the town of retro Ville is a front with paid actors used to play

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:47.420
Citizens this is one of the reasons no one bats an eye when Jimmy flies around in a rocket or has some sort of crazy

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.819
weapon

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:55.309
This is also a reason why a number of Jimmy's inventions just happen to disappear once invented the government takes them for their own research

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.549
Development the theory is proven even further with the show's presence of area 86 the secret government

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.699
Facilities exist in retro Ville and are obviously the headquarters where Jimmy and all of his friends are tracked and researched

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.829
Jimmy's work and inventions have been influenced by several seemingly random events in the town

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.059
But maybe those were purposely created to get the new inventions the government needed

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.450
Are you afraid of the dark

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:27.950
Scariest ghosts one of Nickelodeon's greatest shows will always be are you afraid of the dark the anthology series?

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:34.039
Followed a group of friends known as the midnight society as they took turns telling scary stories around a campfire

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.920
Aliens clowns and witches were just a few of the tales keeping kids up late at night in the 90s and early

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.520
2000s the show touched on many different subjects, but one of the scariest aspects may have been the midnight society

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.420
Themselves a theory speculates that the midnight society was actually made up of the ghosts of teens who died young?

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:59.480
Breaking down the various events can help shed light on this eerie theory the characters only showed up at night

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.639
They were never seen in their everyday life

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.799
And they all seemed to come from different

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.379
Directions in the woods their parents never cared how late they stayed out and none of them really touched on lives

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.549
outside of their ghost story group when a new member joined the group they

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:20.420
Represented another tragic death of a teen when a member left the group they crossed over to the other side as the midnight society

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.650
represented a state of limbo

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:29.329
Until the teen ghosts can confront their darkest fears and sins now reliving the series just got a little scarier

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.510
definitely something else I

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.240
Felt like I was kissing my sister

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.240
nevermind

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.740
complete friendzone

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:45.660
Larissa explains it all to her children before Melissa Joan Hart wooed audiences with her witchy magic on Sabrina the Teenage Witch

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.790
she was making fans with her likeable character and family life on Clarissa explains it all the show lasted for five seasons on Nick and

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.119
The final episode left us with a fantasy glimpse at the future

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.900
But we never knew some of the future would become a reality in one of the more legitimate

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.189
theories found from Nick shows the 90s series may have a connection to the

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.729
2004 series entitled Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide on the show we're never introduced to Ned's parents

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:19.859
But we do learn that Ned's second surname is darling the same as Clarissa this could easily be brushed off as a random coincidence

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.069
but a further clue about Ned's father adds more to the

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.610
Connection in another episode Ned refers to his father as Sam

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:34.050
the name of klarissa's neighbor and love interest from the series this means that Ned could be the love child of Clarissa and Sam but

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.690
It's pretty clear that Sam isn't stepping up to be the father

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:44.070
He should be maybe he's too busy visiting other houses and climbing up windows with his trusty ladder of course the connection may seem legit

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.239
if you ignore the release of the official Clarissa novel where she's childless and

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.590
There you have it what theory do you believe the most are there any we missed?
