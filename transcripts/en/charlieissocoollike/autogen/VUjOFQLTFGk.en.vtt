trying to say is that human babies are

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869
trying to say is that human babies are

trying to say is that human babies are
an example of offspring that are

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280
an example of offspring that are
 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.010
an example of offspring that are
completely reliant on their parents

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020
completely reliant on their parents
 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.620
completely reliant on their parents
which makes them quite a lot to handle

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
which makes them quite a lot to handle
 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.990
which makes them quite a lot to handle
okay it makes sense then from an

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
okay it makes sense then from an
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.820
okay it makes sense then from an
evolutionary standpoint that our brains

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830
evolutionary standpoint that our brains
 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.800
evolutionary standpoint that our brains
would encourage us to want to take care

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
would encourage us to want to take care
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.960
would encourage us to want to take care
of our infant children that's continuing

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
of our infant children that's continuing
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.090
of our infant children that's continuing
on our species that's why when we see a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100
on our species that's why when we see a
 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.670
on our species that's why when we see a
baby our natural instinct is to cuddle

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680
baby our natural instinct is to cuddle
 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.130
baby our natural instinct is to cuddle
protect and nurture it despite the fact

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
protect and nurture it despite the fact
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.230
protect and nurture it despite the fact
that they are otherwise quite annoying

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240
that they are otherwise quite annoying
 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.570
that they are otherwise quite annoying
to take care of now obviously in order

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
to take care of now obviously in order
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.400
to take care of now obviously in order
for this to work we need to be able to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
for this to work we need to be able to
 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.770
for this to work we need to be able to
recognize a baby when we see one which

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
recognize a baby when we see one which
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.840
recognize a baby when we see one which
we do by taking note of its acute

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850
we do by taking note of its acute
 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.120
we do by taking note of its acute
features however it just so happens that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
features however it just so happens that
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.160
features however it just so happens that
we can find these same features in other

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
we can find these same features in other
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.230
we can find these same features in other
species too and so we find ourselves

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240
species too and so we find ourselves
 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.020
species too and so we find ourselves
having the same instinct to nurture we

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
having the same instinct to nurture we
 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.640
having the same instinct to nurture we
even breed animals with these same

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
even breed animals with these same
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.740
even breed animals with these same
traits this doesn't just apply to other

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
traits this doesn't just apply to other
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.449
traits this doesn't just apply to other
animals though as if we're able to

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459
animals though as if we're able to
 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.250
animals though as if we're able to
recognize these same features in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260
recognize these same features in
 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.320
recognize these same features in
inanimate objects that we can end up

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330
inanimate objects that we can end up
 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.449
inanimate objects that we can end up
finding those things cute too the

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
finding those things cute too the
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.979
finding those things cute too the
important thing here is that the only

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989
important thing here is that the only
 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.930
important thing here is that the only
reason we find these things cute is

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940
reason we find these things cute is
 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.520
reason we find these things cute is
because they have features similar to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
because they have features similar to
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.040
because they have features similar to
human infants so if for some reason

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050
human infants so if for some reason
 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.110
human infants so if for some reason
babies came out bright green and covered

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
babies came out bright green and covered
 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.940
babies came out bright green and covered
