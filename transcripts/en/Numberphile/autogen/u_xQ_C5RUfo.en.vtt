are fit on your head if you start taking

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
are fit on your head if you start taking

this inside-out

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
this inside-out
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.000
this inside-out
I noticed though you pull it inside out

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
I noticed though you pull it inside out
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.919
I noticed though you pull it inside out
and keep going keep going keep going

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
and keep going keep going keep going
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.129
and keep going keep going keep going
eventually you get a shape that remember

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
eventually you get a shape that remember
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439
eventually you get a shape that remember
this is the same as the same model where

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
this is the same as the same model where
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.870
this is the same as the same model where
the fabric is going in one direction and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
the fabric is going in one direction and
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720
the fabric is going in one direction and
the other direction there's a circular

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
the other direction there's a circular
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.599
the other direction there's a circular
hole where my finger touching this part

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
hole where my finger touching this part
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.689
hole where my finger touching this part
of the manifold is going the left this

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
of the manifold is going the left this
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609
of the manifold is going the left this
finger is going to the right so there's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
finger is going to the right so there's
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.910
finger is going to the right so there's
a round hole around here okay I looked

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
a round hole around here okay I looked
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.340
a round hole around here okay I looked
at that and I said I'll bet that that's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
at that and I said I'll bet that that's
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.580
at that and I said I'll bet that that's
related to what in topology is called a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
related to what in topology is called a
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.580
related to what in topology is called a
cross cap I looked at and I said okay

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
cross cap I looked at and I said okay
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.840
cross cap I looked at and I said okay
that's nice to know

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
that's nice to know
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.470

pants leg has pulled through its hole so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
pants leg has pulled through its hole so
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.899
pants leg has pulled through its hole so
that it goes up along here and down

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
that it goes up along here and down
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.070
that it goes up along here and down
along here no words if I had it the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
along here no words if I had it the
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200
along here no words if I had it the
right way out if I hadn't been pulled

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
right way out if I hadn't been pulled
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.310
right way out if I hadn't been pulled
inside out it'd be just an ordinary

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
inside out it'd be just an ordinary
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.359
inside out it'd be just an ordinary
pants leg well the hole in it but popped

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
pants leg well the hole in it but popped
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.039
pants leg well the hole in it but popped
out of the dryer looking like this

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049
out of the dryer looking like this
 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.330
out of the dryer looking like this
and I looked at it and said wait a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
and I looked at it and said wait a
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.840
and I looked at it and said wait a
second this shape here where one side is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
second this shape here where one side is
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760
second this shape here where one side is
going this way this side is going this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
going this way this side is going this
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.190
going this way this side is going this
way it's the same fabric shape as a head

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
way it's the same fabric shape as a head
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.800
