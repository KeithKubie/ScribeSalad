00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:09.801
This is The Notorious B.I.G., 1995,

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.971
the Palladium nightclub, New York City.

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.769
What really I want to talk about is

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.403
my dedication, my 100% focus,

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.007
and finding something that I love,

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:20.363
my passion point.

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.234
I fought to be on this stage,

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.192
to be able to stand next to Lil' Kim

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:26.362
and take all these pictures to create

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:28.250
one definitive photo.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.808
A photo that was the most important

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:32.276
of anything that I took.

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.685
And I really wanted it for future generations

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.108
to be able to feel the energy that was in that room,

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:39.227
and certaintly you can feel that right there.

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:41.381
I'm a photographer, this is what I do for a living.

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.600
I chase these moments,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.139
these fractions of seconds,

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.566
that will never be the same again.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.316
You can't take this picture again because I took it,

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:50.855
and he's no longer with us, sadly, rest in peace.

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.325
The definitive portrait of that person, in that moment,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.346
is what I strive for every single time out,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:58.456
like when you close your eyes

00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.748
and think of a picture of Jay-Z,

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:01.658
I want it to be my picture.

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:02.912
So far, so good.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.599
Eight album covers for Jay-Z later,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.282
I'm not doing too bad.

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:10.595
Aaliyah. Gorgeous and amazing,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:13.822
and I really spent proper time with her,

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.552
conversing, having a conversation,

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:17.754
connecting to her,

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:19.737
which I find is a big part of my work.

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:22.790
That connection, to be able to have a conversation,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.887
to say you're doing great,

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:27.626
to say why I want a certain picture and a certain attitude.

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:30.442
In this moment, we talked about shooting in the Caribbean,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:33.306
and it's sort of a passion point for me,

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.439
Caribbean culture, Trinidad, Barbados, Jamaica,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.043
and I said, "We should do a photo shoot there

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.124
because I think it would be incredible."

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:42.037
And she said, "Yeah, you know, let's do it."

00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:44.468
You know, as we're taking these beautiful pictures,

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:45.516
all this is happening,

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:49.099
I'm continuing to converse with her and really connect.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.994
So, she believed in my vision at that moment,

00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:53.919
you know, even while all the work was happening

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:56.088
there was a human connection that happened.

00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:57.241
At the end of the day,

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:59.542
I have people sign Polaroids

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:02.142
just as kind of a diary for myself.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.033
And she wrote,

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:06.106
"I can't wait for the Caribbean. I'll see you then."

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.790
(Exhales)

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.088
You've got to take a breath. You've got to take a breath.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:13.493
She's missed incredibly.

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:14.937
And I think what the reminder is

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:16.617
that these moments are really precious,

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:19.343
and you really have to take the time to connect to them,

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:21.782
to be part of that process,

00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:24.319
to make a difference in people's lives in that moment.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.023
You never know how you're affected by somebody,

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:29.211
clearly I am, you can see it,

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:31.153
but you never know how you affect that person,

00:02:31.153 --> 00:02:33.802
how you make that moment a little more important for them.

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:35.151
This is my good friend Drake.

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.718
I had the opportunity to work with him

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:37.974
for the FADER magazine.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.676
He is a beast and one of my favorites.

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:42.851
He's my friend.

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:44.512
I shot him for three different days,

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:46.769
two in New York, and he had just signed his record deal.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.360
He said, "What's most important to me

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.799
is going home to Toronto to celebrate with my family."

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.311
So, we went home. We flew home.

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.471
And he said, "I've got to do a pit stop.

00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.320
I've got to go see my grandmother in the afternoon,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.245
and so you probably don't want to bother with that."

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.991
I said, "It would be an honor to meet your grandmother."

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:04.574
I asked for what I wanted.

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:07.318
I asked for access that nobody else had

00:03:07.318 --> 00:03:10.868
because this is what makes a photographer sort of greater,

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:13.450
to have a picture that somebody else doesn't have.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.924
We want these unique moments.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:17.288
I asked for these moments, right?

00:03:17.288 --> 00:03:19.663
And I'm reminded of a story.

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:23.130
He said, "Grandma, I just got millions of dollars.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.209
I just signed a record deal.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.399
I've got millions of dollars

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.328
from Cash Money Universal and Young Money."

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:31.649
And she said, "A million dollars?"

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:35.362
He said, "No Grandma, millions of dollars. What do you want?"

00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:39.527
And she said, "I want a kiss, and I want a hug."

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:43.298
Again, the reminder of, like, why we do this.

00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:47.927
It also revealed for me another layer of Drake as a character,

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.778
and how important this guy is,

00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:50.959
you know, his message.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.576
He's not just about the limelight and self-serving.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:55.040
He's connected to these moments

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.083
as much as I was connected to this moment as a photographer.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:00.602
I know everybody does this everyday,

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.025
they ask DMX to get in a pool of blood.

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.084
This was my challenge this day.

00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:07.712
I needed to get him to see my vision.

00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:09.276
I was very clear in what I wanted for

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:10.581
"Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood,"

00:04:10.581 --> 00:04:12.018
which was his album cover.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.989
You know, I envisioned photographs of him in this pool of blood,

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.220
just making these things happen, you know?

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.369
And what was difficult was he didn't see it

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:24.009
the same way I saw it, right?

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.868
He walked in, and he had these pants on. Brand new pants.

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.980
Everybody feels fresh when they have brand new pants on, right?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.363
He said, "I'm not getting in that pool of blood."

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.005
I said, "Oh yes, you're going to get in that pool of blood."

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:36.049
You know? And he said,

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:39.150
"No, my dogs, I'm not getting in that pool of blood."

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.959
And I said, "My dude, you're going to get in that pool of blood."

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.589
And in a bold statement, using all the psychology knowledge

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:48.042
that I had from my schooling at Kenyon College,

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.783
I dropped my pants in front of 40 people on a set

00:04:50.783 --> 00:04:54.464
that all were, like, stunned.

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:55.372
DMX laughed.

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:56.818
He said, "Alright, my dude,

00:04:56.818 --> 00:05:00.031
put your pants back on, and I'll get in the blood."

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.619
One of the most epic photos that we've ever created

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.149
in this hip-hop movement.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.172
I'm on home soil. I'm in New Orleans.

00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:09.160
We've got to give love to Lil Wayne.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.171
Lil Wayne is an incredible MC,

00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:13.702
and the biggest point that I want to drive home here

00:05:13.702 --> 00:05:15.790
is about the opportunity to create

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.686
somebody's legacy with them,

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.555
to take pictures, to see them grow.

00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:21.533
It was about trust in the moment

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:23.836
and understanding that you could make a difference,

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:25.315
have a communication,

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:27.986
see somebody elevate and move forward,

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:30.627
to take a variety of different pictures, you know?

00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:32.995
Him in a spacesuit.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:35.693
He's a Martian, you know, what can I say, you know?

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:38.642
But it was about seeing his growth,

00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:39.836
and having an important role

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:45.298
and communication with this guy in the moment.

00:05:45.298 --> 00:05:47.110
DJ Quick once said, "Isn't it incredible

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.148
how you make people see your vision in hip-hop?

00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:53.730
The way that people look at hip-hop is through your eyes."

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.044
I'm really, really proud of what I've created,

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.272
what I've done, and passionately working

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:01.003
to make quality work constantly.

00:06:01.003 --> 00:06:04.222
It's not about taking a photo.

00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:06.505
For me, it's about giving a photo

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.442
to people that believe in it so much. Thank you.
