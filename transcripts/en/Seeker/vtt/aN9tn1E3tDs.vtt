00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.000
Physicists have conducted a famous physics
experiment for the first time using antimatter.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.720
Get ready to dive into the quantum world,
folks.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
We’re goin’ deep.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.000
If you’re new to quantum physics, you may
want to watch this video where we cover the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
basics.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.590
Essentially, we’ve got two main ways of
explaining the universe--one that works with

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.470
our idea of gravity, and one that works on
the quantum level.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.180
The problem is, they don’t agree with each
other.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.800
Experimentalists and theorists are searching
for the magic key that could resolve this

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.090
paradox for us--what we like to call ‘a
theory of everything’.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
And some think that the answer lies in a classic
physics exercise called the double-slit experiment.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
Here’s how it works: you have a sheet with
two slits in it.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.160
Behind that, a blank sheet.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.010
You have your source of matter, let’s say...cheese
balls.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.120
If you fire the cheese balls through the double
slit sheet, you should get two lines of orange

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.280
cheese ball dust on that back sheet.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.500
Simple enough.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.850
But let’s say instead of cheese balls we
want to fire something that moves in a wave,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.640
like sound.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.070
Instead of getting two slit-like impressions
on the back sheet, you get a pattern of several

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.070
lines.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.140
That’s because the sound waves, as they’re
passing through the slits, bounce off each

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.130
other and cancel each other out in what’s
called an interference pattern.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.240
But some things are not only a wave, they’re
also a particle.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.490
For example, the basic unit of light is the
photons--so what would happen if we start

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.920
firing individual photons, not as a wave?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.680
Well, if you cover one of those slits, you
get what you’d expect--the imprint of those

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240
particles on the back sheet in one line.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.469
They just travel straight through--they’re
behaving like the cheese balls, and not like

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.469
the wave.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.749
But then--and hold onto your hats here--you
uncover both slits, and fire the photons (again,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:37.789
not as a wave).

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.549
You’d expect to see two lines on the back
sheet, like with the cheese balls, but NO!

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.889
You see an interference pattern, even though
the light shouldn’t be behaving as a wave.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.219
It’s almost like the photons know where
the other photons are going to end up before

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.899
they’ve gotten there, like they’re connected
to each other on some level we can’t understand.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.740
Maybe somehow the particle splits itself and
travels through both slits at once, interferes

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.119
with itself, and then reunites into one particle
and that’s what produces the pattern?

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.840
Well, if you put a detector by the slits to
try observe what’s happening, the particles

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.959
stop producing an interference pattern and
start behaving like the cheese balls.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.560
Like they KNOW you’re watching.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560
What?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.709
This mystery--this absolutely bizarre behavior--is
widely considered one of the central mysteries

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.459
of quantum physics, bringing together what
we still don’t know about the wave particle-duality

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.939
of matter and the problem of measuring things
on the quantum level.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.849
We still don’t really know why observing
and measuring a phenomenon may change what’s

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:38.849
happening.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.129
Some scientists think that if we could understand
the mechanics behind the double slit experiment,

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.280
that knowledge would be the missing piece
we need to unify our quantum theories of the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.989
universe with the theory of gravity.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.340
And for the first time ever, we’ve seen
that the double slit experiment works for

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.610
antimatter too.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.720
Each fundamental particle has a complementary
particle that behaves in some kind of opposite

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750
way, like its spin or its charge.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.220
That’s antimatter.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.290
The electron’s antimatter particle is the
positron.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.269
The electron is negatively charged, the positron
is positively charged.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.719
This new study replicated the double slit
experiment using positrons, demonstrating

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.069
that antimatter behaves the way matter does
in this situation.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.719
Part of the reason no one’s done this before,
is because antimatter is pretty hard to get

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.719
your hands on.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.800
Now, this paper was just published, and has
yet to be peer-reviewed, but aims to be just

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.959
the start of this team’s exploration into
the nature of antimatter.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.959
Why?

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.450
The main goal is to find out how gravity acts
on antimatter.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.439
Which is important because some scientists
think that gravity may act differently on

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.340
antimatter than it does on matter, potentially
helping us fill in the gaps between general

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.939
relativity and the standard model, getting
us one step further to a unified theory of

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.170
everything.This may also help us explain why
there’s so much more matter in the universe

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.519
than antimatter...a question we still don’t
know the answer to.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.879
So that would be pretty cool.

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.459
And Fun fact: the double-slit experiment was
first performed in 1801!

Thanks for watching.
