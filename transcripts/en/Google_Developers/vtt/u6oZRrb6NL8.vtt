[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.350
Hi, everybody.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.070
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.390
My name's Ali, and today I'm
going to be talking to you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.000
about Google Drive SDK.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.975
This is our last session of the
year, and so we thought it

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.980
would be a nice idea to
wrap up what we've

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.990
been up to this year.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.430
It's been quite exciting.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.370
So I'm just going to run
through, in a vaguely

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.650
chronological order, all the
features we've implemented and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.600
added to the Drive
SDK this year.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.250
Once we've done that, we'll take
a little sneaky peek at

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.010
next year and what we have
planned and the directions

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.440
we're going.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.730
So thanks for joining us.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.480
As I say, the last
one of the year.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.020
We'll be taking a break after
this, and we should be back

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.600
with you in the new year.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.480
So the Google Drive SDK.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
Well, as you all probably know,
or if you don't, we

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.710
launched Google Drive in
April of this year.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.810
And Google Drive is Google's
cloud storage solution.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.880
You put files in your Google
Drive, and they're available

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.570
to you from all your platforms,
from your phone,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.180
from your tablet, from your
desktop computer, from your

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.280
laptop, from any way you can
connect to the internet, these

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.220
files are available to you.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.180
So what is the Drive SDK, and
what were we trying to do?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.580
Well, we thought we could add
value to Google Drive, the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.080
consumer product.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.190
How were we going to do that?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.500
Well, if good apps exist, in
addition to the regular apps

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.680
that use Google Drive--
ie Google Docs, Google

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.820
Spreadsheets, Google
Presentations.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.410
In addition to those, if we
could allow developers to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.440
write awesome apps, the edit
files or create files, then

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.030
that would firstly be an
improvement for the user, ie,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.140
you'd have more things that you
could do from your files

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.530
that are in Drive, it would
be an improvement for the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.720
developers, for the people
writing those software,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.870
because we would shift good
numbers of customers and new

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.740
customers to those
applications.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.150
And so adding those two
together, that's a good thing

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.970
for Google Drive.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.810
And that improves the Google
Drive ecosystem.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.980
So how were we going
to do this?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.630
Well, we had a long think, and
we decided that we want to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.600
provide a platform for
developers to be able to write

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.030
applications that are as good
and as complex and as

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.740
effective as the Google Docs
editors that exist, ie, docs,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.840
spreadsheets, and presentations,
and the others.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.180
So we really wanted to provide
this entire platform.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.070
And as you know, we've been
bringing in bits and pieces,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.430
and gradually, as I'll show you
by the end of the day, I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.430
think we're getting to a point
where you can actually do

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.590
that, which is exciting.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.810
So let's go back to April.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.810
What happened in April?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.220
Well, we launched the
SDK Version 1.0.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.170
Now, this was quite a small
chunk of what we have at the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.240
moment, and what it essentially
did was allow your

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.649
application to open files
from Google Drive.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.290
So your icon would appear in
Google Drive when a user

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.240
right-clicks on a file
that your application

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.170
knows how to open.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.730
This is really useful for things
like Microsoft Project

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.860
files, for example, where there
are lots of them in

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.960
Google Drive but no
native editor.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.870
So we allowed those
to be built.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.940
We launched, in April, with
Google Drive at the same time.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.130
So that's really important.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.390
The platform was released as
part of the main product, not

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.670
an afterthought, really one of
the principal driving things

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.290
for the product.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.780
So we launched there with
some key applications.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.940
There were 18 of them, and they
all were able to open

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.000
files from Google Drive.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.010
One example is HelloFax, which
you can right-click on a PDF,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.450
and you can just fax
it to someone

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.740
directly from Google Drive.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.470
This is the kind of value
that we wanted to add by

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.370
enabling the SDK.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.030
So what could you do?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.490
You could open files.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.840
You could edit them offline,
and you could save

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.800
them back to Drive.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320
There were two types of
files, initially.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.920
One of them are binary
files that are

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.500
stored in Google Drive.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.840
That's like a standard file,
a text file, as I said, a

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.530
Project file, Excel
files, whatever.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.200
But we also realized at that
point you may have some

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.780
different way of
storing files.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.260
Your files may not
be real files.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.250
They may be just columns in
a database, for example.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.210
So we also produced this system
that allows you to keep

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.750
shortcuts in Google Drive.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.050
So there's no binary data
stored there, but it's a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.080
shortcut that, again, will
open correctly in your

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.950
application.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.310
So we covered those bases.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.730
As I said, the API was
quite small in scope.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.480
It allowed you to read files,
save files, but nothing else.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.300
For all the other management
functions of files and things

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.780
in Google Drive, you would have
to use the Documents List

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.580
API Version 3.0 that's been
around for a while.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.360
And I'll talk about how we
gradually deprecated that.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.220
One really important thing we
launched then with Google

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.300
Drive SDK V1.0 is
the file scope.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.510
Now if I can explain that,
by scope, I mean

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.620
an OAuth 2.0 scope.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.135
And that is, essentially, how
much permission you will give

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:33.820
an application to access
your Google Drive.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.630
Before this, and many other
solutions for cloud storage,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.440
when you get a token, when you
authorize an application,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.760
you're really authorizing
them to access your

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.260
entire Google Drive.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.110
And that was the situation
before.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.430
We didn't think that
was ideal, really.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.890
If you've got some photos
somewhere, and you've got some

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.410
other file somewhere you want
to edit one of these photos,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.315
really, that application should
not have access to all

00:06:58.315 --> 00:06:59.130
your Google Drive.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.470
You may have sensitive
stuff there.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.490
Obviously, most applications and
the big applications are

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.640
all very well behaved, but
still, this is a slight

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.110
privacy gap that we
didn't want users

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.020
to have to go through.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.410
So we brought in this thing
called the file scope.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.800
Now, the file scope means that
an application can only access

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.110
the files either that it's
created or that you've opened

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.560
with the application.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.480
And by that, we very much
narrowed down the scope-- this

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.280
is why it's called a scope--

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.220
to files which you explicitly
say this application can

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.070
access them.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.800
We found this was very good,
and users responded well.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.300
You might think, well,
people don't care.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.530
They just click on the button.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.520
OK, grant access.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.590
But that's not actually the
case, especially in corporate

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.130
environments where, really, the
things you're authorizing

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.190
these applications to do are
company secrets, which that's

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.420
just not a situation which
you're allowed to even do.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.390
So that was the SDK
Version 1.0.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.070
And as soon as we launched it,
we started working very hard

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.390
on the SDK Version 2.0.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.460
And the SDK Version 2.0, wanted
to add functionality to

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.670
the SDK Version 1.0 that would
allow you to perform complete

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.460
file management and essentially,
replace the

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.360
Documents List API
Version 3.0.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.620
So what kind of management of
files could we have here?

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.830
Well, obviously, when I say file
management, uploading,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.150
downloading, but additional
things, the changes feed.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.720
Well, you can fetch a feed that
lists all the changes

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.299
that a user has done in
their application.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.929
And that's really useful for
synchronizing, making sure you

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.400
don't download things that
haven't changed,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.919
that kind of situation.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.650
There are revisions on files.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.910
So as you know, Google Drive
is fully versioned like a

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.010
version control system.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.210
When you make changes,
there are revisions.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.230
You can access these different
revisions and get

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.400
the content for them.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.900
So great.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.040
So you've got a history.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.480
Applications can leverage this
history to maybe roll back to

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.780
a previous revision and
things like that.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.860
Exporting of Google documents,
and that's a

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.770
feature that's available.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.360
So you can't actually download
the native Google Docs or

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.960
Google Sheets format,
because that

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.070
doesn't really mean anything.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.540
It's not actually a file.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.960
It's one of those examples of
one of the shortcuts that I

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.910
mentioned that is really
not quite but

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.190
rows in a table somewhere.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.100
So you can export them with
the API to PDFs or to any

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.630
other formats that
are supported--

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.200
Excel or plain text, whatever
you happen to have.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.360
And gradually we took these
features-- there are a few

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.300
other ones, but gradually we
tried to listen to what the

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.810
community wanted and especially
the things that

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.290
were missing from the Documents
List API and tried

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.200
to fill them out to have
a complete replacement.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.590
And so over the year, we added
features such as service

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.820
account support.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.210
Now, service accounts are a way
in which your application

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.740
can perform without being
manned, without a user there.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.110
So there are two cases here.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.030
One of them you could have a
service account for a domain,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.230
which is really useful for
domain administrators to be

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.930
able to access all the files
or manage all the files for

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.230
people working in a company,
for example.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.110
The second one is
application-owned accounts.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.470
So your application can only
account, and essentially, they

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.170
become the user, and the Google
Drive is owned by the

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.950
application.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.020
And it's really useful
for certain

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.780
application-based storage.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.780
That application can share files
out to individuals if

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.190
they want, but really, that's
the choice of the application.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.390
Again, really useful and
something which we had from

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.400
the Documents List API.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.890
We gradually tried to improve
the authorization story.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.650
So when you authorize--

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.840
when you open a file from Google
Drive, before you were

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.650
tied slightly to our
authorization flow.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.380
And now you can provide your
own authorization flow, ie,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.530
Vanilla OAuth, 2.0 and you can
get a token like that and

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.440
things still work.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.440
So these were all features which
we were listening to you

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.680
guys, and thank you for raising
your feature requests.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.850
Really, it's something we try
and listen to you guys, and we

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.000
try and do the best we can.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.120
And as the year went on, we
added some other features, for

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.460
example, comment support.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.380
This was one of the longest
standing feature requests I'd

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.680
heard from the Documents List
API, even back to Versions

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.010
1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.260
And that was to be able to
manage comments on files.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.990
So we added that feature.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.100
You can manage comments on
native Google documents.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.750
You can also add comments to
your own files, so your own

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.170
binary files, and you can anchor
them however you like.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.425
There's a schema for anchoring,
and I suggest if

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.870
you're interested in that,
you check it out.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.310
For example, a position on a
photo could be illustrated by

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.710
an x- and y-coordinates.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.150
That's an example
of anchoring.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.660
Or in a text file, you might
anchor to a line.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.890
So this is really for you to be
able to add these features

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:10.760
to your application.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.290
Again, back to the original
point, we want your

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.630
applications to be as good and
as complex and as rich as the

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.870
Google Docs applications.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.600
We don't want there to
be any difference.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.670
That's our mission, anyway.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.370
One of my favorite features was
released towards the end

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.530
of the year, and that
was site publishing.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.250
So if you haven't seen, it's
actually been one of our most

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.170
popular features.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.890
Extremely simple.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.910
Inside Google Drive, you can
put some files, make them

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.930
publicly available,
and then that's

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.400
treated as a web directory.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.430
So relative links work.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.370
JavaScript works.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.600
CSS works.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.660
And it's really great for,
what I would call,

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.160
lightweight, personal
website publishing.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.150
A lot of applications popping
up that use that.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.550
And we think that's
really great.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.260
So if you have any feature
requests about that, again,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.650
please get in touch with us.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.490
And towards the very end of
year, one thing we've been

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.440
trying to do is really improve
our mobile story.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.230
What do I mean by our
mobile story?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.350
I mean the ability
for you to write

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.000
applications on mobile devices.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.330
We've concentrated for now
on Android and iOS.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.700
We are really keen to provide
equivalent comparable

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.880
experiences and good developer
experiences

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.200
on both those platforms.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.240
So we're really not favoring
Android over iOS.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.220
We appreciate the
needs of you.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.880
And that is that you really
probably want to write your

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.270
applications for both, or you
may just want to write an

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.750
iPhone app or whatever.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.030
That's really not
our business.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.150
We want to make that experience
as good as

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.440
possible for you.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.260
And likewise, we do that with
all the client libraries.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.500
So we have a .NET
client library.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.640
If you like programming in
.NET, that's great, too.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.890
And also all the traditional,
more Google library based

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.900
things, like Java, Python,
JavaScript,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.630
that kind of thing.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.940
So we really tried to improve
our mobile story

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.570
to make that better.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.910
We have quick starts for
both those platforms.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.730
So if you want to get started
in five minutes, you can.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.430
And we have complete
applications that do the same

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.740
thing, actually.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.800
They take a photo, and they
just upload them.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.640
But as you know, a full working
complete application

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.280
is better than a lot of
docs in some way.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.350
You just unzip it, get it
running, and then you can

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.180
tweak it to do whatever
you like.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.590
So we've tried to do that.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.430
Again, if there any stumbling
blocks, please get

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.550
in touch with us.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.550
One more thing I wanted to
mention is user interface

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.250
components in the Drive SDK.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.280
Now, I've left this until
last, because it's

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.100
really a key point.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.700
We try and provide you these
user interface components to

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.170
make your web apps better.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.590
Now, what do I mean by
these components?

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.350
Well, we have two.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.790
The first one is the picker--

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.840
the file picker--

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.500
which is essentially a file
browser that you can open up

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.940
with certain filters.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.390
You can customize the way it
appears with side bars or

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.150
without side bars.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.030
But this is a file browser
that's branded Google-like and

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.800
looks like Google Drive.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.490
And it has the ability to
perform the open with that I

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.740
was talking about.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.590
So that's the file picker.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.800
You can just embed this in your
application with a few

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.970
lines of code.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.980
Really, really useful.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.970
You don't need to write
something to list and find the

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.130
icon for each file and then
redirect somewhere else and

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.020
this kind of thing.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.560
It's there for you.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.200
That's the first one.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.670
The second one, we have
an equivalent

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.180
widget for sharing files.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.690
So as you do in Google Drive,
when you click on the Share

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.980
button, it pops up, a list of
users, that kind of thing, and

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.890
share them.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.820
You pick the ones you want to
share, and you choose what

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.870
access you want, whether it's
read access, write access,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.930
ability to comment or not,
whether they get

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.380
notifications.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.345
You can perform all that
functionality from inside your

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:05.300
own application.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.790
So we tried to build these as
shortcuts for your application

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.710
to be able to use this
functionality.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.650
Of course, if you want to write
your own widget, that's

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.450
absolutely fine too.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.720
But hopefully, these will
get you started and

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.370
up and running quickly.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.150
To follow on from that,
something we've tried to do to

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.020
make it easy for you is how
to discover applications.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.240
How does a user find
your applications?

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.810
How do they know that you have
a file that opens images and

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.880
you can edit images?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.100
How do you market
that to people?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.870
Well, we use the Chrome
Web Store for this.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.600
And in the Chrome Web Store,
you describe what kind of

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.100
files you can open.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.120
And then from within Google
Drive, users can find these

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.560
applications.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.760
So we find this is a really
useful vector to get people to

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.730
your application.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.210
Again, we're not just doing
it because we're

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.280
selfless and we love you.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.870
We do love you.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.910
We're doing it because that's a
better experience for users.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.390
It's better for a user to see,
oh, I can open this file if I

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.560
install this free application
that edits images.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.290
Or say you want to add text
to an image, captions.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.770
Well, we help you find them.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.430
So always for the user.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.950
Improve the user, and improve
Google Drive.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.150
So that's really an overview
of the year.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.130
It was vaguely in chronological
order.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.900
It was just really a recap of
the features we've created and

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.250
the features we've added.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.740
As I say, we're always
listening to you.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.390
So if you really miss some
features or you want

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.260
something, let us know.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.080
OK?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.750
2012--

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.020
fantastic.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.800
What are our plans for 2013?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.710
Well, again, if I can go back
to the mission, we want your

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.600
applications to be as complex
and as good as the Google Docs

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.780
applications.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.030
So we do appreciate that
at the moment,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.330
really, you have an SDK.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.020
You have a few APIs.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.980
But it's not a complete
platform.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.260
There are some areas which are
lacking and some things which

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.310
you can immediately think, hang
on, how do I do the cool

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.460
feature of Google
Docs currently?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.400
Well, you can't, but these are
coming, and we are committed

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.160
to improving this experience.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.710
So if I can mention
a few features.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.540
The first one is our
collaborative platform.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:34.170
This was demoed at Google I/O
this year, and it's really

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.530
progressed a lot.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.120
What is it?

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.400
Well, it's a way in which
multiple users connected can

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.660
collaborate on a file.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.195
It handles the shared data.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.590
It handles the conflict
resolution.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:58.920
It handles delivering these
messages of change, these

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.490
events, and these notifications

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.760
of when data changes.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.940
It handles delivering all of
them to the correct browser

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.540
sessions at the right time.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.010
So this is exactly what you
would see in Google Docs.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.240
You see the cursors moving
around, someone's typing,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.990
someone else is typing.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.670
This is how that is performed,
and we're

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.790
providing that as a service.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.790
As I said, if you want to see
the demo, check out Google

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:25.060
I/O. But it has advanced a lot
since then, and we really are

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.690
trying to make it
as simple and as

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.550
comfortable to use as possible.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.390
At the same time, making it
as flexible to be able to

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.030
integrate with your existing--

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.240
whether you use Frameworks,
jQuery libraries, or

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.270
AngularJS--

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.860
however deep you are into NVC
in your JavaScript apps, we

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.400
want to be able to integrate
with that.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.470
So that's coming soon.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.470
We're really excited
about that.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.020
In addition, we're trying
to improve the

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.290
platform around files.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.910
One feature we've really
listened to people on is

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.740
application-based data.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.890
So we're looking to provide a
way in which applications can

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:09.300
store data or files that really
they own inside a

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:09.960
user's drive.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.070
So this will be essentially
hidden from the user.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.720
They'll be able to delete it,
because it's their data

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.730
really, and it will
be using up quota.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.590
So if it gets large, they
will want to delete it.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.160
But really allows you
to save files that

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.360
your application owns.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.740
And you can use that to
save various things.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.280
In addition to that, we want to
provide metadata on files.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.220
That's your arbitrary data.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.240
You can decide any keys or any
values, and you can just put

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.470
them on the file.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.370
And again, this time the user
can see that data, the user

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.000
can share that data,
that kind of thing.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.980
It's more user-based, but this
will allow you to add your own

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.570
tags, for example, to a file,
which we, again, think is

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.330
really useful but also somewhat
lacking at the moment

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.050
to make Google Drive into a full
platform on which you can

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.350
build something.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:04.140
So that's the metadata and
the application data.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.490
In addition to that, we're
looking to provide another

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.170
[? long OS ?]

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.380
feature, which is push
notifications, which is when

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.540
you subscribe to something, a
file, when it changes, you are

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.090
notified of change.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.950
So your application will
be notified somehow.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.890
I won't go into the details,
but again, we talked about

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.640
this at Google I/O and
that's coming soon.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.320
So no more need to
poll the changes

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.960
feed, has a file changed?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.060
You subscribe once, and then
Google Drive will tell you,

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.640
hey look, this file
has changed.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.130
Do you want to download
the file again?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.040
You really can choose what you
want to do based on the

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.290
information you get.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.160
So that's another
feature coming.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.970
And so those are features.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.910
In a general sense, we're
really keen on trying to

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.740
improve, as I said, the user
experience, but one of the

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.290
ways in which we're trying to
do this at the moment is we

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.880
really want to bring together
mobile and web applications.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.050
So we think there's a
discrepancy at the moment.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:09.000
An application might have a
mobile version, a desktop

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.040
version, and a web version.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.510
Now, why do people have
to install all three?

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.740
Well, these are open questions,
really, but this is

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.620
the general experience
we're trying to fix.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.960
So once we have a better
platform for you, we're going

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.330
to try and improve the
general integration

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.560
of the whole thing.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.430
Again, I'm available always
for questions.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.840
So if you really want to say,
oh, no, no, don't, please

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.700
don't add that feature,
just let me know.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.680
And I'll talk to
you about that.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.140
So that's where we're going.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.870
Just a few reminders of ways in
which you can get in touch

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.450
with us and the community that
we're trying to build around

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.160
Google Drive SDK.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.376
Firstly, these video sessions,
Google Developers Live, we do

00:22:54.376 --> 00:22:55.950
two a week.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.070
It's great of you, those
who attend, and we

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.910
hope you enjoy them.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.160
So that's that.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.370
Stack Overflow.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.140
We've migrated to
a Stack Overflow

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.160
support model this year.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.000
We've just found it way better,
because you get

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.280
experts from all sides of
computing who can contribute

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.680
to the answers to
your questions.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.510
It's really great.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.820
And we can have cross
connections with, for example,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.610
the Java client library
or various other APIs.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.170
So we're really enjoying that.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.770
We've had 1,000 questions,
almost, on Stack Overflow, and

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.600
we hope to answer your
problems as soon

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.470
as they come up.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.420
So talk to us on
Stack Overflow.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.580
Thirdly, the Google+ community
we launched a few weeks ago.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.120
Thank you.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.340
There's been an amazing
response there.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.040
We've got 2,700 and something
members and 10 to 15 to 20

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.140
posts a day.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.120
That's really great.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.790
We love engaging with
you like that.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.820
We think Stack Overflow was
somewhat lacking in this much

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.930
more quick-term question and
answer, or you just want empty

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.740
your mind into the community
so people can

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.530
know what you're thinking.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.750
Or you just want to announce
your application.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.540
These kind of things are great,
and we're really happy

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.830
with how that community
is going.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.800
Again, if you're interested,
check us out in the Google

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.430
Drive SDK community on Plus,
and come and say hello.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.250
We're always there.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.930
Finally, one thing we did this
quarter is we had a workshop

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.100
for some Google Drive
potential customers.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.930
Now, we tried to pick--

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.210
and those who were
interested--

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.600
were generally the better
applications.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.900
You know, big, established
applications,

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.890
not really for people.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.940
It's not really a hack-a-thon
situation.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.630
But these people came out
to Mountain View to the

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.520
Googleplex in California, and
we had a fun couple of days

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.080
where we tried to get people
over the initial integration

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.290
into their applications.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.120
You know what it's like when
you're writing code.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.720
Something blocks you, and then
you spend the next two hours

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.380
trying to work out
how to fix it.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.920
It's just one line of code.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.850
You're looking at Docs, and they
link to other docs, and

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.780
they link to other docs.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.550
And you don't waste all this
time, because it's all

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.030
learning, but it does
take a lot of time.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.710
So we tried to cut that out
by having Google engineers

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.030
available on the spot.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.380
If you're interested, we will
be having future sessions.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.610
If you are interested, please,
again, let us know, and we'll

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.180
see if we can accommodate you
in our future workshops.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.150
So that's been us, 2012.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.800
We look forward to seeing
you next year.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.340
Thank you very much
for coming, and

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.765
have a merry holidays.

00:25:33.765 --> 00:25:36.230
If you're on vacation,
enjoy them.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.380
If you working, don't
work too hard.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.220
Thank you very much.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.470
Bye bye.

00:25:46.025 --> 00:26:32.167
