00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.472
- [Instructor] So we have
an infinite series here,

00:00:02.472 --> 00:00:04.399
one plus one over two to the fifth,

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.585
plus one over three to the fifth,

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:07.595
and we just keep on going forever.

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:09.953
We could write this as

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:11.519
the sum

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.936
from n equals one

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:16.295
to infinity of one

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.895
over n to the fifth power,

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.497
one over n to the fifth power.

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:26.831
And now you might recognize,
notice, when n is equal to one,

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:28.204
this is one over one to the fifth,

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.624
that's that over there,
and we could keep on going.

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:34.441
Now you might immediately
recognize this as a p-series,

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.481
and a p-series has the
general form of the sum,

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.470
going from n equals one to infinity,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.553
of one over n

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:47.273
to the p, where p is a positive value.

00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:48.899
So in this particular case,

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.287
our p, for this p-series,
is equal to five.

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:54.458
P is equal to five.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.110
Now you might already recognize,
under which conditions

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.288
for a p-series does it
converge or diverge?

00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:03.676
It's going to converge.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:08.066
It's going to converge when
your p is greater than one,

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.655
which is clearly the case in
this scenario right over here.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:13.691
Our p is clearly greater than one.

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.652
We would diverge,

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:16.985
we would diverge

00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:19.114
if our p is

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.395
greater than zero

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.009
and less than or equal,

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.008
or less than or equal to one.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:29.166
This would be a divergent.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.748
So if this was like .9 here,

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:34.065
or if this was a, you know, 3/4,

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.118
then we would be diverging.

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:39.977
So at least for this
one, we are convergent.

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:43.013
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:43.013 --> 00:01:44.654
All right.

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:49.156
So here, you might again
recognize this as a p-series.

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.863
Let me rewrite this infinite sum.

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:53.587
So this is the sum

00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:56.570
from n equals one to infinity

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.570
of one over,

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.048
let's see, we have a square root of two,

00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:02.120
a square root of three.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.518
So you could do this as two to the 1/2,

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:05.433
three to the 1/2, four to the 1/2.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:08.459
So it's one over n to the 1/2.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.900
Notice, this is when n is equal to one.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.125
One over one to the 1/2 is one.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:16.056
One over two to the 1/2, well,
that's this right over here.

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:18.407
And we keep on going on and on and on.

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:20.511
Well, in this case, we
still have a p-series.

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.313
We have one over n to some power,

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:24.512
and that power is positive.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:28.837
But notice, in this
case, our p falls between

00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:30.703
zero and one.

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.463
So 1/2 is our p.

00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:36.301
So p for our p-series is equal to 1/2,

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.151
and that's between zero and one.

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.323
Remember, we're divergent,

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:41.156
divergent,

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:45.528
when our p is greater than zero

00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:46.917
and less than or equal to one,

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.160
which was clearly the
case right over here.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.910
So this is going to be divergent.
