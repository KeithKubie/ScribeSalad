Hi, I'm John Green and this is Crash Course
Big History. Today we're gonna be exploring

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.660
what happened to the universe after the Big
Bang, particularly how you and I and everyone

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.429
you know, emerged from stars. And we'll also
be investigating the burning question of why

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.310
anyone who studies history has to care about
chemistry.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.890
Mr Green! Mr Green! I'm sorry, but I hate
chemistry. Why can't we just learn about like,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.680
English kings stabbing each other!?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.840
Sorry, me from the past. The thing is, if
you look far back enough in your family tree,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.180
you're going to find not just like farmers
and foragers and fish and microbes... You're

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.760
gonna find stars. And I don't mean stars like
Kim Kardashian, who is actually not a star

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.129
-- she is a person! I mean actual stars, Me
From the Past. And to understand how we got

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.649
from stars to people, you're gonna need some
chemistry.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.480
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.720
So, last episode, we went from the very beginning
of everything to the release of Cosmic Background

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.940
Radiation, and CBR is a major piece of evidence
that the Big Bang happened. Studying it closely

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.440
also tells us the age of the universe and it allows
us to see the minute variations in temperature

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.820
and density of the early universe. And it turns out
that those tiny differences are a really big deal.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.390
So when the universe inflated from much, much
smaller than an atom to the size of a grapefruit

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.430
in a split second, there were quantum fluctuations
-- tiny little blips on the unpredictable

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.470
quantum scale -- and they created those little
variations that we see in Cosmic Background

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.750
Radiation. And as the universe continued to
expand -- I mean, it is currently larger than

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.560
a grapefruit -- those variations in density
were inflated to such a scale that gravity

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.580
was able to take hold and start clumping together
clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.720
So 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe
was becoming an increasingly cold and increasingly

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.610
boring place. Like, temperatures were no longer
high enough to forge new elements, and if

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.630
hydrogen and helium hadn't clumped together,
nothing would have ever happened, ever again!

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.000
Our universe would just be a dull, homogeneous
place with some clouds of hydrogen and helium

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.280
gas floating around. Dull and gassy, just
like North Dakota. I'm just kidding, North

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.620
Dakota! You do have a lot of natural gas,
but you're very interesting! I mean, you have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.959
Mount Rushmore! What's that? Oh. Oh, I see.
Sorry. Yeah, mmm. Ugh!

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.699
But what happened is that while the universe
on the whole continued to cool, thanks to those

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.260
tiny variations that emerged during inflation, certain
pockets of the universe were about to get very hot!

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.900
Indeed! A liberal dose of hot sauce was yet to come!
Hydrogen and helium, though, are light gasses.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.680
They are the lightest two elements
-- so light that they require very little

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.269
encouragement to escape the Earth's atmosphere.
But while the explosive force of the Big Bang

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.579
flings matter and energy apart, gravity has
the ability to pull tiny pockets of the cosmos

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.979
back together -- provided it has some wrinkles
in the universe to work with.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.460
As gravity sucked hydrogen and helium atoms
together, enormous thick clouds began to form.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.620
While the expansion of the universe continued
to increase the gaps between these clouds,

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.889
the density of these pockets also increased.
The vastness of empty space began to be filled

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.810
with tiny islands where atoms of hydrogen
and helium were increasingly squished together.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.920
Despite being the lightest of all the elements,
the immense amount of all that gas built pressure

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.029
up in the center. Increasing pressure meant
increasing temperatures, just like after your

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:28.860
2am taco run, suddenly these gassy pockets were
burning inside. It was in this rather uncomfortable

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.100
state of heartburn that the first stars flared
into life, roughly 100 million years after the Big Bang.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.090
By a billion years after the big bang, the
universe was starting to look like what we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.620
think of as a universe -- an immense vastness
littered with hundreds of billions of galactic

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.230
islands, containing hundreds of billions of
stars. And as recent work with the Kepler

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.830
space telescope has revealed, a mind-numbing
number of planets.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.599
So the universe is big! It's really big! But
it's not so big that it's impossible for the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.819
average person to get a mental picture of
like, our neighborhood.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.180
Our galaxy, the Milky Way, formed from these
galactic mergers with other galaxies that

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.719
stopped like, around 10 billion years ago.
Our galaxy's about 100,000 light years across,

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.730
which means that it takes, you know, 100,000
years for light to get across it.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.760
And even if humans become like, technologically
capable of colonizing the galaxy in the next millions of

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.580
years, our little galactic island is probably where we're
gonna stay, just peeping out on the rest of the universe.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.780
So there are between 200 and 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way, with huge distances between them.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.380
There hasn't been a merger between our
galaxy and another for a long time, but our

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.569
neighbor, Andromeda -- which has closer to
a trillion stars -- is actually set to collide

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.199
with us in 3.75 billion years. But don't worry,
this isn't gonna be like a car crash, because

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.169
the vast distances between stars make it very
unlikely that stars will actually hit each

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.180
other in such an event, although many new
stars will form.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.250
Instead of a car crash, think of like a three
billion year long tango of two graceful galactic

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.180
dancers. This is gonna totally mess up the
constellations that we're familiar with now,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.930
but the good news is that by that time, the
sun will have wiped out life on Earth regardless,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.050
so we won't have to worry about it! And the
even better news is that, let's face it, there's

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.629
no way our species is making it until the
sun wipes us out.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.030
As far as these galactic islands go, ours
is a modest size. Like, Malin 1 is a spiral

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.409
galaxy like ours, but it's a whopping 680
thousand light years across. And the giant

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.039
elliptical galaxy, excitingly named M87 -- because
astronomers are so good at naming things -- is

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.339
980 thousand light years across. And with
its radio jets, the elliptical galaxy Hercules A --

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.480
that's a slightly better name -- is a whopping
1.5 million light years across from end to end.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.620
Galactic islands are separated by millions
and millions of light years, and the Virgo

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.639
Supercluster of galaxies, to which the Milky
Way belongs, is roughly 110 million light

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.379
years in diameter, and that's only one of many,
likely infinite, Superclusters in the universe.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.650
Wait, literally infinite? Wow!

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.000
Unfortunately, we can't know whether the universe
truly is infinite or not, because of a little

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.949
thing called the cosmic horizon. We can only
see the light that has reached us from the

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.580
start of the universe 13.8 billion years ago.
Simply looking into the sky is an act of investigating

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.900
history, and the farther we look back, we
begin to see more primitive things --

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.760
the first stars and galaxies.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.800
Mind you, the light we observe billions of
years after it first shone, and the continued

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.759
expansion of the universe, means that the
cosmic horizon is approximately 46 billion

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.280
light years away by now. Roughly double that,
and you know that our little cosmic bubble

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.340
is about 92 billion light years across. I mean, compare
that to our already-huge 100 thousand light year galaxy!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.110
Just for a little bit of context, the circumference
of the earth is less than one fifth of one

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.569
light second. But beyond our little cosmic
bubble, there is more universe eternally inflating.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.729
And where our universe is sort of one hole
in a block of Swiss cheese, other holes might

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:03.309
exist in that block of cheese, multiple universes with laws of physics completely different from ours!

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:04.699
John from the Past: What!?

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.409
I know, right?! It's nuts! It's actually more
like cheese, but it's nuts!

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:12.810
But our cosmic bubble, while it's very large,
is not such an intimidating place. Like it's

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.539
pretty easy just to get a mental picture of
it -- a vast bubble with a lot of empty space

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.590
and a light dusting of galaxies.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.939
To further this point, and don't take this
too seriously, but in 2002, Karl Glazebrook

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:30.699
and Ivan Baldry added up the light from 200,000
galaxies and determined that if you were able

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:36.469
to stand outside our cosmic bubble and look
at it with human eyes, the color of our universe

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.979
would be -- wait for it! -- beige. That's
a bit of an anti-climax so they tried to dress

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.919
it up by calling it Cosmic Latte. But I don't
mind beige. I mean, look. This stuff is gigantic

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.610
and somewhat scary, but you can't be scared
of beige!

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.159
And a lot of cosmologists infuse their lessons
with a sense of awe at this vast expanse.

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:58.419
And that awe is certainly justified -- I mean,
the universe is literally awesome.

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:02.469
But let me ask you this: if you lived in
New York City, would you feel bashful or depressed

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:07.770
about the size of your city compared to say,
the miles and miles of the plains of Saskatchewan?

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.620
So yeah, there are millions and millions of
light years of empty space, but it's empty

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.689
space! One thing we find out about the rising
complexity in Big History is just how unique

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:22.330
some of these tiny areas of the universe can
be. This is where the action is!

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.780
Enough of the pontification! Let's get back
to those gassy heartburn-suffering stars!

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.819
As core regions of the gas clouds heat up,
the atoms get jumpy, move faster and faster

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:35.389
and collide with ever-increasing ferocity.
Eventually it's ferocious enough to overcome

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:40.589
the electric repulsion between the atoms, they
fuse and the cloud officially becomes a star.

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:45.420
Hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms at about
ten million degrees, releasing yet more energy.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.620
The sun is a massive hydrogen bomb in the
sky, and the release of energy in just the

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.180
right amounts is very good for us, provided
we don't mess up the ozone layer too bad or

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.900
spend too much time tanning on the beach.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.560
When it comes to stars, size matters. If an
initial cloud is smaller than 8% of the size

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.550
of our sun, it'll never form a star -- maybe
only a brown dwarf. If the initial cloud is

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.200
60-100 times our sun, it will probably split
into two or more regions of stellar formation.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.040
If the cloud is between 8% and eight times
the size of our sun, it has a longer lifespan.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.779
Our sun is middle-aged and will last for about
another 5 billion years. Much smaller stars

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:29.260
may have lifespans of hundreds of billions
of years. Large stars sometimes only live

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.940
for a few hundred million years.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:36.110
As all stars run out of hydrogen and helium
as fuel, the outer edges of the star swells

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.050
up. Fusion of heavier elements occurs, requiring
higher and higher temperatures, creating heavier

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.970
and heavier elements, all the way up to iron.
But elements heavier than iron can't be created

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.639
in the stars - there simply isn't enough energy
to fuse those heavier nuclei together.

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:55.510
So how is the rest of the periodic table formed?
When giant stars, 8-60 times the size of our

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.420
sun, exhaust their fuel, they collapse. This
may last no longer than a second, but it will

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:08.300
be followed by a huge explosion. These explosions
shine with the energy of billions of stars,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.180
and combined with proton and neutron capture,
supernovae are responsible for creating the

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.550
heavier elements of the periodic table. Flinging
out these elements, the rest of the cosmos

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.550
is fertilized and nourished by the ashes of
dead stars.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.700
Carl Sagan said it best: "We are made of star
stuff." And he really meant that! I mean,

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.620
you see this globe? It was made in the belly
of a star! You see your computer? Made in

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.930
the belly of a star. Your dog? Made in the
belly of a star. Your right hand -- made in

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.820
the belly of a star. Your left hand? Potentially
made in the belly of a different star. Stellar

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.230
evolution bridges the gap between the mind-boggling
origin of our universe and the tangible material

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.930
stuff that you see around you. And in fact,
the tangible material stuff that you are!

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.110
Humans haven't just appeared out of nowhere.
We've changed form. We used to be much hotter

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.829
of course -- I mean temperature-wise. This
is why chemistry is important to understanding

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:06.240
the grand narrative of 13.8 billion years,
and it's also why we look at the big history

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.000
of individual objects -- something we call
"little big histories".

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.329
Like, see this ring on my finger? I bought
it in a jewelry store -- a nice person sold

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:17.570
it to me, a jeweler crafted it and miners
dug it out of the ground. But it got there

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:23.089
by being flung out of a huge star in a massive
explosion billions of years ago. It wound

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:27.970
up in our solar system, was part of the tiny
.1% of matter that didn't get sucked into

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.760
the sun, accreted from the dusty debris in
the one sliver of the solar system where the

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.529
Earth was, and because gold is an iron-loving
element, it was more prone to sink to the

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:42.100
center of the Earth, making it even more unlikely
that it should be found on the Earth's crust!

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.490
Rare and shiny things are valued by a lot
of human social orders, and during the agrarian

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.680
era, gold became a sign of social-standing
and wealth. And in marriage tradition, giving

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.910
someone an expensive gift can be a sign of
esteem, hence Sarah and I spent $450 on this

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.300
which we could have spent on an Xbox!

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.500
Tiny wrinkles in the early universe had a
major impact on one of the unifying themes

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:09.580
of 13.8 billion years -- rising complexity.
Wrinkles created stars, stars created elements,

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:13.289
and some of those elements came together to
form life, and of course, us.

00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:17.160
Gradually, we see an increase in the number
of connections in building blocks present

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.640
in the universe. For instance, a star's comprised
primarily of two elements, hydrogen and helium.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.560
But here's the thing -- if there had been no
wrinkles in the early universe, energy would

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.550
have been evenly distributed across the cosmos.
Without flow of energy, like say, that through

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:37.149
a star, no complexity can arise -- none whatsoever.
This state of existence is called thermodynamic

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:40.970
disequilibrium, which means that energy is
not evenly distributed.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.620
A simple structure like a star is big, but
it's just a large pile of the lightest elements

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.399
and doesn't score very high in energy flow
density. Your brain is 75,000 times more complex

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:56.370
than a similar sized chunk of the sun. Its
building blocks and nodes are way more intricate.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.730
Your brain has way more connections than there
are stars in the galaxy.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:04.550
You wouldn't think a story than spans cosmology,
geology, biology, and human history would have

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:10.700
a unifying theme, but rising complexity is
something that stretches across all 13.8 billion years.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.680
And it began with those tiny wrinkles in the
early cosmos.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.980
So now, moving past, I hope you see why a
basic understanding of chemistry is important

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.870
to understanding our ancestry. I mean, stars
are pretty much your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.269
etc grandparents! And you wouldn't ignore
your grandparents, would you?!

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:31.609
Mr Green, Mr Green! No -- no way! I mean, they're a big
part of my plan to get a car for my sixteenth birthday!

00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:34.289
That's really touching, Me From the Past.
Also I've got bad news for you.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.740
So in today's episode, we've learned that
everything around us, everything that we can

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:45.340
touch and feel and see, even us, is debris floating
around enormous stars in the vacuum of space.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:51.580
We clump into specks, we change form, but
we owe our entire existence to these burning,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:56.660
gassy balls that we see in the night sky.
We may just be the ashes of dead stars, but

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.000
those ashes hold the potential to arrange
themselves in increasingly complex ways, from

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.020
which the Earth and all it contains, can arise.
But more on that next time!
