00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.980
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them;

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.360
We should try hard to get them right.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.380
So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.680
Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.480
which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.300
Why not, then, cities?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.460
It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.760
We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.720
It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.400
This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.540
There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.980
1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.420
One of the things we really love in cities is order.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.060
Order means balance, symmetry and repetition;

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.440
it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.760
Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.760
But most cities are a complete mess.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.900
When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
And that's worrying.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
It's horrible when everything is jumbled up.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
A pitched roof next to a flat roof,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.680
a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.700
high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
We generally have an itch to straighten things out,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.640
and when we can't, it's frustrating.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.380
The same urge is there when we look at cities.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.220
Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.880
it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.740
like they are increasingly in London,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.120
whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.540
However, you have to keep something else in mind:

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.980
excessive order can be just as much of a problem.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.080
Too much regularity can be soul destroying.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.300
Too much order feels rigid and alien.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.100
It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.060
So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.180
This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic:

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.360
where every house is the same width and height

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.020
but within that ordered pattern,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.520
every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.200
or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict:

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.300
each house has the same height and width,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.840
the color range is restricted,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.580
but within this grid, each unit is completely individual.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.220
We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.800
And that's what humans adore.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.840
That's what more and more cities should have:

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.340
order and variety.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860
So as a general rule:

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.800
too much mess, and it's off putting,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.720
but too much simple order, and it's boring.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.380
What we crave it's organized complexity

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.200
which you can see as much here:

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360
as here:

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.960
Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful:

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.240
they have to have visible life.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.560
There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.880
and in general, we crave the live ones.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.180
This is a live street in Hong Kong.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.120
This is a live scene in Venice.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.220
In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.760
specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.440
because they're full of life.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.980
There's always plenty going on.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.360
In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.400
The work sheds are rough, but they're charming.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.640
It's fascinating to see what people are up to.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.300
How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
The life of the city is on display,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.380
and we're primed to love this.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.600
Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.980
Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.360
look dull and dead.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.340
They're spaced out along huge highways,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.300
and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.040
because there's nothing to see.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.500
And most office buildings are brutally anonymous;

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.540
the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.680
but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.400
The street levels are dead.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.640
Contrast this with the streets we all love,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.580
where you can see things going on: a bakery,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.320
a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.340
these are streets we love because they're full of life.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.200
More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.360
We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.420
connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.700
Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.800
look them in the eye as they walk down the road

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.640
and feel connected to others.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.640
Modern planners have become obessed by

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.000
hiding technology

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.300
rather than trying to make it nice to look at.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.200
Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.200
was gonna be slapped across a lovely river;

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.400
we'd be up in arms!

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.480
But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.520
That's because it's built for beauty and practicality.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.780
We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.140
It's just the ugliness.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.360
So let's make sure our streets are full of life,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.920
full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.540
That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along:

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.840
the work is on show,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.700
the people are proud of what they're doing

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.120
and happy to let the world notice and appreciate

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.200
the practical side of things.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.940
There's a third principle of good cities:

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.440
They are compact.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.220
In the past, being able to be alone

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.740
or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.200
Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.680
and it was horrid.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.680
As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.580
and have their own plots.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.680
Through the later decades of 20th century,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.920
more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.880
And it's been a disaster.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.860
It's become deadly, cold, and boring,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.020
and very, very wasteful on the environment.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.620
A compact city like Barcelona

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.280
swallows a fraction of the energy

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.880
of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.680
We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.060
connected by sterile wide motorways

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.400
all because we labor under the false impression

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.180
that we want to be far away from other people.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.740
But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.100
of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.740
That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.680
with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.480
All the most beautiful compact cities have squares.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.600
Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.140
We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.420
but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.200
It's not rocket science though.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.840
Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.800
It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.120
Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.800
you get to be around other people,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.360
their moderating, cheering affect is restoring.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.300
It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.160
There's an art to a good square:

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.920
it should be neither too big nor too small,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.400
anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.820
by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them,

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.540
creating a sense of alienation and dislocation.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.460
In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.320
You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.400
The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.440
There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.520
By definition, cities are huge,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.460
but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.320
and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.920
We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.540
It's actually lovely to get a bit lost.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.440
A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.520
At Cartagena, in Colombia,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.780
the balconies nearly touch across the street-

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.980
you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.660
what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.180
The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.280
They don't shout at each other quite so much.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.020
They put flowers on the table more often.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.360
We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.600
Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.880
because they suppose that's what we all want,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.720
and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.760
are the most important things in the world.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.080
Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.960
Necessarily, cities are large.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.560
We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.780
So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.500
We need cities that offer us two important pleasures:

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.720
the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.720
Let's think about scale now.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.080
Modern cities are all about big things.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680
Joseph Campbell once wrote:

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.360
"If you want to see what a society really believes in,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.120
look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to".

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.980
The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.000
We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.760
the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.240
Our cities, however, tell another story.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.680
They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.400
That is a bit depressing.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.400
As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.120
we don't mind being humbled,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.660
so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.580
like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.220
But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.240
by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.460
but pizza corporations and hedge funds.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.020
They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake:

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.180
we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.140
And in the end, who has air rights

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.860
determines what you can see from your window.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.680
We suggest that the ideal height for any city block

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.800
is five stories high.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.040
No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.700
So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.620
Make it dense, compact, and tight,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.880
like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.200
London, and Paris, the bits we love.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.840
Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.880
but let's keep it for something really special,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.340
something all of humanity can love.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.920
Towers have to be worthy of their prominence,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.060
they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.880
Finally, make it local.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.440
Somethings should be the same everywhere.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.360
We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.620
or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.700
But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.060
It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.760
The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake;

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.080
because of climate, history and social traditions,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.520
each society really does have different needs,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.280
different strengths and weaknesses.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.520
There are many distinct styles of happiness;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.940
many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.920
The sameness of cities is a problem

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.660
because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.220
It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.120
or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.140
Cities need to have strong characters

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.960
connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.560
The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.480
A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone-

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.340
formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:59.460
Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.120
Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.880
found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.380
So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere;

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.660
find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.300
The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:29.780
We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.520
The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly;

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.820
we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.140
It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.820
It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.260
We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:06.620
No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.240
So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.900
Yes! There is such a thing as beauty.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.600
Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.200
The proof lies in the tourist statistics.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.200
Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder;

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.760
that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.760
The other obstacle is a lack of political will.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.520
We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.640
We've given up believing in democracy.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.920
We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.720
There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.600
but we can say no.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.920
Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.200
to keep the greedy, private guys in check.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.240
Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.520
which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.880
They were precise legislation detailing

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.000
heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.600
That's the only way you get beauty.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.640
They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.880
When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.320
We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.560
We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.200
which is wrong because we need places to live.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.800
Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.000
When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.800
The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.480
because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.200
We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.000
Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.480
Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.480
That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.120
These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.
