1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,670
how do you think there's going to affect
things like competitive athletics?

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,380
Hugely. So, um, right now,
um, we have this problem,

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,060
someone like Lance Armstrong is, he
was doing, he's manipulating his, uh,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,070
his body and what he's basically doing
is adding more red blood cells so that he

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,400
can carry more oxygen and people
feel that that's cheating. It's a,

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,310
it's a different topic that probably
everybody in the Tour de France was doing

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:30,200
exactly that when he, when
he went. Um, but what if it,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,230
which will be the case, we're going
to be able to sequence the people,

10
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,410
let's say nobody's doing drugs and
we sequence all these athletes,

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,280
some of them will just have
a natural genetic advantage.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,210
Their bodies will naturally be doing
what Lamstar Lance Armstrong had

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,930
manipulated his body to. Do
you know, that's happening
with a sprinter right now?

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,860
Yeah. Well that female
sprinters, high levels of
testosterone. Yeah. No. And it's,

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,000
I feel really sorry for her, but
we have categories. I mean, yeah,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,780
you with your world and
in mixed martial arts,

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,020
I mean I think I remember it in the past,
there was some person who has,

18
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,710
who was kind of a
borderline on, on uh, uh,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,610
between genders and we're just kicking
the shit out of all of these women in

20
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,310
cage fighting.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,590
It's like we have these categories of
man and woman and we know that the gender

22
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,450
identities are fluid,

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,850
but how do we think about it when these
genetic differences confer advantages?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,590
So if your body is primed to do something,
um,

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,240
maybe you could have like a Plato's
republic world where everybody fulfills a

26
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:37,350
function that you are genetically
optimized to do and that you could imagine

27
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,560
that being a very competitive
kind of a of environment.

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,160
But what do you do it for now
in something like the Olympics,

29
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:46,140
if somebody has this
huge genetic advantage,

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,020
should we let somebody else
manipulate their bodies?

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,700
There's a thing called gene doping in
order to change the expression of genes.

32
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,960
So your body to act like
you're as Jeanette naturally
genetic enhances somebody

33
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:58,950
else.
It's complicated.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Are they capable of doing certain
physical enhancements through gene doping

35
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,810
right now? Yeah. Like what can
they do right now known as? So,

36
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,650
so the way it works is so your,

37
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:13,430
your genes instruct your cells
to make proteins. That's, that's,

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,450
that's how the whole system works.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,480
So you can change genes or you can trigger
the expression of proteins so you can

40
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:27,280
get people's bodies to behave
as if they had the, uh,

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,800
these periodic optimization. Yeah.
Yeah. And so that's why now the,

42
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,450
the World Anti Doping Agency,
I mean,

43
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:38,280
they are now starting to look
at gene doping and this is
the first time, uh, that,

44
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,710
that's, that that's even being
considered as a category.

45
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,660
And then there are other
people that have done that.

46
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,140
Are there people that have done
that successfully? You know,

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,350
I don't know the answer to that.
I know that [inaudible] is looking for it,

48
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:53,190
which makes me assume that it must
have done, but I haven't seen it.

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,410
I've looked for it and I haven't
seen any reports on it starts winning

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,250
everything. Which line is
so, so my, my rope, my uh,

51
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,830
one of my Psi Phi novels, Genesis Code
was about this. So China as you know,

52
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,780
has their system of their Olympic sports
schools and the way it works is they

53
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:11,050
test kids all around the country.
So let's just say it's,

54
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,280
it's diving and they identify what
are the core skills of a diver,

55
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,114
what do you need?

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
And then they go around the country and
they test kids and then they bring a

57
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,550
bunch of them to their Olympic sports
schools and then they, you know,

58
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,320
they get them all involved and then some
kids are the best of those kids and the

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,390
best of those kids.
And then you get with these champion,

60
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,760
that's why China advance.
So, uh, so rapidly,

61
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,730
but what happens if they're doing that?

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,720
But it's at the genetic level and there
are countries like Kazakhstan that are

63
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,860
already announcing that they are going
to be screening all of their athletes.

64
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:44,200
So the science isn't there yet.
So it's really,

65
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,690
it's impossible right now to say out,
well,

66
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm going to do a genome sequence of
somebody and I know this person has the

67
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,360
potential to be an Olympic sprinter,

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,450
but 10 years from now that's
not going to be the case. Wow.

69
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,581
Yeah.

70
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:00,480
It's sort of going to throw a monkey
wrench in the whole idea of what is fair

71
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:04,680
when it comes to athletics. Yeah. What is
fair? What is human right? What is human?

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,450
Yeah.
I mean look,

73
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,950
it's not like people don't already
alter their bodies by training,

74
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,900
by diet, exercise, all sorts of
different recovery modalities,

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,830
cryo therapy, sauna,
all of it. Um, you know,

76
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,480
high elevation training,

77
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,600
all these different things that they
do that manipulates the human body.

78
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,390
But it's not like there would be kind
of crazy if you had sports but you

79
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,100
couldn't practice and
you couldn't work out.

80
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,970
Like we want to find out what a person's
really like. No practice, no working out.

81
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,060
And that's the thing is like we
are moving, it comes back to,

82
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,520
we were saying before about in
nature it's like we have this,

83
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,240
this feeling nature somehow
feels comfortable to us.

84
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,410
That's what we're used to is all this
stuff that you're talking about it,

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,090
nobody was doing that 10,000 years ago.
It's like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm,

86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,110
I'm running after a buffalo and so and
so as these boundaries change as the

87
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,670
realm of possibility changes,

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,330
then we're going to be faced
with all of these questions.

89
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:07,240
Even now look at a sport like
competitive weightlifting,

90
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,510
they have these like the,

91
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:14,150
the real competitive bodybuilding
and you see these guys in there,

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,010
they're monsters and then they have
these drug free guys and everybody looks

93
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:22,570
like a Yogi. And so it's still a
pretty big, they look pretty big,

94
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,520
but not compared to these,
these other guys.

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,790
The only way to get those freak
levels is to steroids. Yeah.

96
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,570
And so like how are we
going to pull these,

97
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,400
this and I think it's
going to be very difficult.

98
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:38,020
And so maybe we can have some
kind of natural area of life.

99
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:42,910
But I think that our, our model of
what's normal is just going to change.

100
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,990
Because like I was
saying in the beginning,

101
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,610
we set our baseline based on how we
grew up and that it seems about right,

102
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:52,960
like it seems about right to us
that everybody gets immunizations.

103
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,680
Immunizations are a form of superpower.
Imagine if our ancestor,

104
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,490
they couldn't even imagine immunizations.

105
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,710
What an unfair advantage when you
have 100 million people dying of,

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,860
of Spanish flu.
So we're this,

107
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,670
all of this stuff is scary
and it's going to normalize.

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,510
But how it normalizes is, is
that's what's at play now. Well,

109
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,790
the world has changed so much
just in the last 20 years,

110
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,210
but it feels like this is just scratching
the surface in comparison to what's

111
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,500
coming.
It was a,

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,160
people miss understand and they
underestimate the rate of change.

113
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:28,370
And the reason that they do that is
since the beginning of the digital

114
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,204
revolution,

115
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,750
we have experienced a thing called
exponential changes that you've heard of

116
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,380
Moore's law, which is basically computing
power roughly doubles every two years.

117
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,480
And we've internalized Moore's law.
And that means that every new iPhone,

118
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:45,110
we expect to be better and stronger and
faster and all these kinds of things.

119
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,880
But now we're entering in a world,

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,050
a world where we're going to have
exponential change across technology

121
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,080
platforms.
And so we think about,

122
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,560
well what does exponential change
mean in the context of biology? Well,

123
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,100
at the very, very beginning,
it's genome sequencing is, is,

124
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,280
is going to be basically a basically free,

125
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,380
but we're going to be able to change life.
And because we're on this j curve,

126
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,650
like when you think of what's a 10
year unit of change, looking in the,

127
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,790
in the rear view mirror,

128
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,240
that amount of change is only going
to take five years going forward.

129
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,220
And then two years and then one year.

130
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,500
And so that's the reason why I've written
this book cause I, we have to get to,

131
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,270
this stuff is coming fast and
if we want to be part of it,

132
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,780
we have to understand it and we
have to make our voices heard.

133
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,280
[inaudible].
