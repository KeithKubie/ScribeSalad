INTERVIEWER: We've all
heard the old cliche

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.020
that pictures capture
an exact moment in time.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.230
But that is what they do.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.340
The bouquet floating in the air,
the happy bride, the excited

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.640
tourists.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.670
This odd mix of
people and emotions

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.200
only existed this one
time for this one moment,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.310
and the photograph was
able to capture it all.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.070
The person responsible for
catching this particular split

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.680
second was this guy.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.900
JOSE MANUEL RIOS: Hi, my
name is Jose Manuel Rios.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.490
I am a closed captioning
technician for hearing

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.240
impaired, video editor,
and amateur photographer

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.810
based in Seville, Spain.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.040
This picture was
taken August, 2011.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.210
It was a warm evening
with fantastic weather.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.130
That summer, I was traveling
through Italy with my partner,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.200
and I was taking my camera
with me all the time.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
INTERVIEWER: The photo was
taken in the Piazza del Duomo.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.310
The Piazza is the
heart of Florence,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.450
as well as its historic center
full of beautiful architecture

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.770
and buildings dating
back almost 1,000 years.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.710
So it's no wonder that Jose
was drawn here with camera

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.131
in hand ready for anything.

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.630
JOSE MANUEL RIOS: That evening
when I arrived to the Piazza,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.700
the bride was there with
a wedding photographer.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.180
But everybody there
was looking at her.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.210
And many, many people, mostly
tourists, were gathering around

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.720
and the place was full.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.010
Everybody wanted to
catch the bouquet.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.000
So I prepare my camera,
and fortunately I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
got the picture of
this exact moment.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.350
Everybody was so happy, and
you can feel it in the picture.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.949
I was just lucky to be in the
right place at the right time.

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:46.240
INTERVIEWER: And that is how
memories like this happen,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.040
intentionally or otherwise.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.790
At least that's what
happened to Jose, this crowd,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.732
and oh yeah, this little girl.

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:54.190
JOSE MANUEL RIOS:
I don't know how,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.220
but this little young
girl grabbed the bouquet.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.070
It was so fast that I
didn't see it coming.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.102
I was just taking pictures
and suddenly this kid had it.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:04.810
INTERVIEWER: It was
a pretty great moment

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.520
for everyone, the girl, the
bride, the crowd, and Jose.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520
JOSE MANUEL RIOS: For me, as a
photographer, this was so cool.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.280
I could capture this unique
moment with my camera.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.280
And I'm sure all that people
will always remember this.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.501
I'm glad I could take
part of this moment.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.000
INTERVIEWER: At
"This Happened Here"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.490
we're always
looking for new ways

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.530
to tell stories through photos.
