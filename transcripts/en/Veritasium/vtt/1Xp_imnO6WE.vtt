00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.380
- Five fun physics phenomena. Number one,
have a friend hold a cane out horizontally

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.260
for you, or another similar object. And putting
your two index fingers together, try to place

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.420
them underneath the center of mass. When they
let go, you will find it doesn't normally

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.339
work. But now try putting each index finger
at opposite ends of the cane, and then moving

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:30.419
your index fingers in towards the middle.
What you will find is that they always end

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:38.100
up right under the center of mass of the cane.
You can try starting off asymmetrically and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.190
they will still end up under the center of
mass. You can try going at different speeds.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:01:03.390
Really slowly, or really fast. But you still
end up perfectly under the center of mass.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.830
How does this work? Number two, the phone
flip. Have you ever tried to spin your phone?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.030
If you do it in this direction, it's pretty
easy. It stays nicely aligned. If you spin

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.159
it along its short axis, you'll also find
it spins very well. But if you try to flip

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.750
your phone end over end like this, you can't
do it cleanly. The phone will never flip simply

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.250
end over end without also rotating in one
of the other directions. Even when I make

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.670
an almost perfect flip, instabilities grow
until the phone rotates around another axis.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:50.420
Why can't... No, I still can't do it. Why
is it so? Number three, you've probably seen

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.049
that if you rub a cup on your hair, you can
make it electrically charged. And if you bring

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.539
it close to a stream of water, you can actually
cause that stream to deflect. Now usually

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.400
this is used in chemistry textbooks as a demonstration
of the polar nature of water. Water is a molecule

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.800
with a more positive side and a more negative
side, and so what happens, so you're told,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.910
is that the water molecule flips around so
the positive side of the water faces the negative

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
side of the cup and that is what attracts
the water to the cup. But this is not the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.220
real explanation. If you have a uniform electric
field, there's an equal force pulling the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.690
positive side towards it as there is pushing
the negative side away from it. And so you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.331
can't actually do more than just turn the
molecules. You would need a really, really

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.880
strong gradient in your electric field to
make this work at all, and it basically is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.700
just not going to happen from a cup. So why
is the stream actually attracted to a charged

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.560
cup? That is the question. Number four, take
a piece of your favorite cereal and drop it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:09.840
into a bowl of water. Then using a very strong
magnet, try to pull the cereal around. Isn't

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.280
that cool? So why is cereal magnetic? And
finally, five, the teabag rocket. Take a teabag

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:29.230
and cut off the sealed end very carefully.
Now dump out the tea. Form the teabag into

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:40.621
a square column. And balance it on the plate.
Now light the top of the teabag on fire. Try

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:53.900
to light it evenly on all sides. Get ready
for takeoff in three, two, one. Ha, yeah!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.200
That is the beauty of the teabag rocket. So
why did that happen? So how do all of these

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.070
phenomena work? Let me know in the comments
or make a video explaining any or all of them.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:17.030
Or subscribe to the channel and I'll post
the answers next week. I hope you enjoyed

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.900
those fun physics phenomena. I know a guy
who would, the former commander of the international

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.150
space station, Commander Chris Hadfield. I'm
actually hosting live events with him in late

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.569
August in Sydney and Canberra. I'm so looking
forward to that. Now, the Sydney shows are

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.680
all sold out, but there are still as of now
tickets to the Canberra show. So if you want

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.680
to come to that, check out the link in the
description. Now Chris Hadfield actually wrote

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.319
a book called An Astronaut's Guide to Life
on Earth, and I'm listening to it right now

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.680
as I travel around the world, and it is awesome
because it contains great advice not only

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.289
for people who want to become astronauts,
but also for everyone who wants to lead a

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.729
meaningful life here on earth. And you can
download this book for free if you like by

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.080
going to audible.com/veritasium. Or you can
pick any other book of your choosing for a

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.940
one month free trial. Audible is a great service
with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.569
including fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals,
and so you can find virtually anything you

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.979
want there. And by going to audible.com/veritasium,
they know that I sent you and they help me

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.120
out to continue making these videos for you
for free. So I really want to thank Audible

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.590
for supporting me and I want to thank you
for watching.
