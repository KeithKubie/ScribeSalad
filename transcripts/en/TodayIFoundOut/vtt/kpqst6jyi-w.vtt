00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.500
Benjamin Franklin, through extensive study
of the world’s major religions and various

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.539
moral codes, came up with a list of thirteen
main virtues that he felt every person should

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.410
strive to live their life by.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.770
As such, he himself attempted to always live
by this code and developed charts with which

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.500
he charted his progress from day to day, to
make sure that he was constantly improving

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.870
towards this end.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.050
He would start with one of the virtues and
plot his progress on the chart until he mastered

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.500
that virtue; then moving on to the next; and
so on until he mastered them all.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.580
He ordered them specifically as shown below,
as some of them naturally lend towards others.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.571
Thus by sticking to this order, he felt it
made it easier to achieve the whole.

00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.890
This code is as follows:

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.340
Temperance: Eat not to Dullness, drink not
to elevation

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.089
Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others
or yourself.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.969
Avoid trifling Conversation
Order: Let all your Things have their Places.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.709
Let each Part of your Business have its Time
Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.570
Perform without fail what you resolve.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.310
Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good
to others or yourself: i.e.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.499
Waste Nothing
Industry: Lose no Time.

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.929
Be always employ’d in something useful.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.229
Cut off all unnecessary Actions
Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.929
Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak;
speak accordingly.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.970
Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or
omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.170
Moderation: Avoid Extremes.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.219
Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you
think they deserve.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.890
Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body,
Clothes, or Habitation

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.259
Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles,
or at Accidents common or unavoidable.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.690
Chastity: Rarely use Venery but for Health
or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
or the Injury of your own or another’s Peace
or Reputation.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:32.500
Humility: Imitate Jesus 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.290
and Socrates.
