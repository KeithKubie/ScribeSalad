00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
gonna be something like five to ten
 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.850 align:start position:0%
gonna be something like five to ten

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.969 align:start position:0%
name by then I think oh yeah I guess
this<00:05:08.060><c> would</c><00:05:08.300><c> have</c><00:05:08.479><c> been</c><00:05:08.630><c> though</c><00:05:08.870><c> it</c><00:05:09.680><c> was</c><00:05:09.800><c> like</c>

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 align:start position:0%
this would have been though it was like
 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.740 align:start position:0%
this would have been though it was like
two<00:05:10.280><c> movies</c><00:05:10.699><c> after</c><00:05:10.970><c> there's</c><00:05:11.449><c> something</c><00:05:11.660><c> about</c>

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
two movies after there's something about

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 align:start position:0%
meals and yeah if you look at like the
 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.060 align:start position:0%
meals and yeah if you look at like the
original<00:05:16.789><c> draft</c><00:05:17.120><c> and</c><00:05:17.419><c> idea</c><00:05:17.750><c> it's</c><00:05:18.229><c> like</c><00:05:18.410><c> it</c>

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 align:start position:0%

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.010 align:start position:0%
original draft and idea it's like it
would<00:05:19.280><c> have</c><00:05:19.370><c> been</c><00:05:19.490><c> mostly</c><00:05:19.910><c> animation</c><00:05:20.599><c> five</c><00:05:20.840><c> to</c>

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 align:start position:0%
would have been mostly animation five to
 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.730 align:start position:0%
would have been mostly animation five to
10<00:05:21.169><c> minutes</c><00:05:21.440><c> of</c><00:05:21.500><c> live-action</c><00:05:21.860><c> and</c><00:05:22.310><c> I</c><00:05:23.740><c> still</c>

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 align:start position:0%
10 minutes of live-action and I still
 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.350 align:start position:0%
10 minutes of live-action and I still
don't<00:05:24.889><c> think</c><00:05:24.949><c> given</c><00:05:25.370><c> what</c><00:05:25.400><c> we</c><00:05:25.639><c> got</c><00:05:25.820><c> on</c><00:05:25.970><c> screen</c>

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
don't think given what we got on screen
 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.790 align:start position:0%
don't think given what we got on screen
with<00:05:26.570><c> the</c><00:05:26.659><c> animated</c><00:05:27.169><c> stuff</c><00:05:27.380><c> it</c><00:05:27.590><c> would</c><00:05:27.710><c> have</c>

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
with the animated stuff it would have
 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.320 align:start position:0%

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 align:start position:0%
been a great movie but it would have

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:55.180 align:start position:0%
felt like that Blanc and maybe something
 

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
felt like that Blanc and maybe something
like<00:13:55.390><c> read</c><00:13:55.600><c> and</c><00:13:55.720><c> Stimpy</c><00:13:56.140><c> or</c><00:13:56.260><c> something</c><00:13:56.680><c> where</c>

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
like read and Stimpy or something where
 

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.670 align:start position:0%
like read and Stimpy or something where
you<00:13:58.120><c> know</c><00:13:58.240><c> you</c><00:13:58.300><c> could</c><00:13:58.570><c> go</c><00:13:58.750><c> over</c><00:13:59.019><c> the</c><00:13:59.230><c> top</c><00:13:59.440><c> like</c>

00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know you could go over the top like
 

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know you could go over the top like
that<00:13:59.709><c> but</c><00:14:00.130><c> I</c><00:14:00.209><c> that's</c><00:14:01.209><c> probably</c><00:14:01.720><c> my</c><00:14:01.930><c> only</c>

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.170 align:start position:0%
that but I that's probably my only
 

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.870 align:start position:0%
that but I that's probably my only
complaint<00:14:02.529><c> I</c><00:14:02.860><c> honestly</c><00:14:03.250><c> thought</c><00:14:03.399><c> the</c><00:14:03.579><c> rest</c><00:14:03.760><c> of</c>

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
complaint I honestly thought the rest of
 

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
complaint I honestly thought the rest of
the<00:14:03.940><c> animation</c><00:14:04.449><c> was</c><00:14:04.630><c> really</c><00:14:05.050><c> solid</c><00:14:05.380><c> yeah</c><00:14:06.190><c> for</c>

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:06.430 align:start position:0%
the animation was really solid yeah for
 

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.189 align:start position:0%
the animation was really solid yeah for
the<00:14:06.490><c> most</c><00:14:06.670><c> part</c><00:14:06.880><c> it</c><00:14:07.000><c> looked</c><00:14:07.209><c> you</c><00:14:07.570><c> know</c><00:14:07.600><c> I</c><00:14:07.839><c> think</c>

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
the most part it looked you know I think
 

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:09.630 align:start position:0%
the most part it looked you know I think
honestly<00:14:08.680><c> I</c><00:14:08.740><c> think</c><00:14:08.829><c> it</c><00:14:09.100><c> could</c><00:14:09.220><c> have</c><00:14:09.310><c> used</c><00:14:09.339><c> an</c>

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
honestly I think it could have used an
 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
honestly I think it could have used an
even<00:14:09.880><c> bigger</c><00:14:10.029><c> budget</c><00:14:10.540><c> um</c><00:14:10.870><c> I</c><00:14:11.860><c> honestly</c><00:14:12.610><c> for</c>

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
even bigger budget um I honestly for
 

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
even bigger budget um I honestly for
what<00:14:13.720><c> we</c><00:14:13.839><c> got</c><00:14:14.019><c> I</c><00:14:14.050><c> thought</c><00:14:14.320><c> looked</c><00:14:15.040><c> really</c><00:14:15.699><c> good</c>

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:15.850 align:start position:0%
what we got I thought looked really good
 

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
what we got I thought looked really good
like<00:14:16.060><c> those</c><00:14:16.240><c> city</c><00:14:16.570><c> doesn't</c><00:14:16.959><c> let</c><00:14:17.199><c> everything</c>

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.410 align:start position:0%
like those city doesn't let everything
 

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.230 align:start position:0%
like those city doesn't let everything
look<00:14:17.740><c> trim</c><00:14:18.070><c> I</c><00:14:18.190><c> have</c><00:14:18.399><c> an</c><00:14:18.519><c> older</c><00:14:18.760><c> goal</c><00:14:18.910><c> I</c><00:14:18.940><c> thought</c>

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
look trim I have an older goal I thought
 

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.730 align:start position:0%
look trim I have an older goal I thought
it<00:14:19.360><c> looked</c><00:14:19.449><c> good</c><00:14:19.779><c> I</c><00:14:19.839><c> mean</c><00:14:20.170><c> maybe</c><00:14:20.380><c> this</c><00:14:20.589><c> is</c>

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:20.740 align:start position:0%
it looked good I mean maybe this is
 

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.470 align:start position:0%
it looked good I mean maybe this is
because<00:14:21.160><c> we're</c><00:14:21.430><c> looking</c><00:14:21.670><c> at</c><00:14:21.790><c> this</c><00:14:21.970><c> now</c><00:14:22.180><c> with</c>

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at this now with
 

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.750 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at this now with
hindsight<00:14:23.050><c> being</c><00:14:23.470><c> 20/20</c><00:14:24.130><c> and</c><00:14:24.250><c> we've</c><00:14:24.370><c> got</c><00:14:24.550><c> all</c>

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
hindsight being 20/20 and we've got all

the films out now um but I bet some of
 

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the films out now um but I bet some of
the<00:14:28.480><c> animators</c><00:14:28.930><c> I</c><00:14:29.110><c> just</c><00:14:29.290><c> feel</c><00:14:29.440><c> like</c><00:14:29.649><c> it's</c><00:14:29.860><c> like</c>

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.010 align:start position:0%
the animators I just feel like it's like
 

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.710 align:start position:0%
the animators I just feel like it's like
if<00:14:30.519><c> that's</c><00:14:30.760><c> what</c><00:14:31.000><c> they</c><00:14:31.120><c> could</c><00:14:31.300><c> do</c><00:14:31.360><c> with</c><00:14:31.390><c> what</c>

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
