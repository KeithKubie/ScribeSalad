00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.160
How 
a bird reacts to the cold depends on what

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.600
kind of a bird it is and there are a variety
of methods they use to keep their legs warm,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.230
from the mundane to the much more fascinating.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.119
For starters, many birds will simply pull
their legs and feet close to their centre

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.480
of mass one at a time, keeping them warm with
their feathers and body heat and off the cold

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
ground.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.870
Likewise, some birds crouch down and cover
both feet with their plumage.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.219
In particularly cold weather, the bird can
also “fluff up” its feathers, trapping

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.829
air between the feathery layers to keep extra
warm from head to toe, so to speak.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.039
If there are other birds around, they may
also huddle together when doing this.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.400
Another slightly mundane, but also very helpful,
method of keeping themselves, and in turn

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.539
their feet, warm is body fat.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.710
Towards this end, some birds will gorge themselves
before winter, not just for the extra energy

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.999
store, but to build up a layer of fat to help
shield themselves from the weather.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.250
Further, as a last resort, most birds can
shiver their flight muscles to generate body

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.250
heat (not unlike how the cold-blooded honey
bee keeps the hive warm in winter), though

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.260
this comes with the problem of physically
tiring the bird and perhaps limiting its ability

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.260
to fly.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.290
Concerning the feet and legs more directly,
many bird legs are covered with a rough, scaly

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.010
skin that limits heat loss, not to mention
the legs and feet often have an incredibly

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.930
small surface area compared to the rest of
their bodies, severely limiting the amount

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320
of skin actually exposed to the cold.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.820
So what about something like a duck with positively
huge, flat feet that are not only exposed

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.340
to the elements, but may be submerged in ice
cold water?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.490
In these cases, the birds have a nifty trick
up their non-existent sleeves.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.090
Using a counter current exchange system, some
birds can submerge their feet in ice cold

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.550
water for hours at a time without real consequence.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.020
In a nutshell, counter current exchange simply
means that the bird’s veins and arteries

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.280
are aligned in such a way as to facilitate
heat exchange between warm blood being pumped

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.870
towards the feet and the cool blood being
pumped away from them.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.910
This means that recently cooled blood from
the bird’s feet is warmed before it reaches

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.710
the bird’s core while at the same time blood
from the bird’s core is cooled significantly

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.440
before it reaches the feet.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.650
This makes sure they aren’t dually heating
the blood returning to the core and the water

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.160
around their legs and feet with their core
temperature blood (often 104 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.750
40 degrees Celsius, or more depending on the
bird).

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.070
Instead, the lace-like formation of the birds’
capillaries ensures that a lower, but sustainable

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.440
temperature is maintained in the feet (sometimes
only just above freezing, as is the case with

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.950
Emperor penguins or ducks swimming in a nearly
frozen body of water), allowing it to endure

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.540
freezing temperatures around their exposed
feet, while minimizing heat loss.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.740
Further, birds with this evolutionary trait
can actually control the flow of blood to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.260
their extremities using a series of muscles
located at the top of their legs.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.090
In extreme circumstances, some can even cut
off the flow of blood completely, though only

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.890
for a short time without damage.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.990
They can also go the other way with it when
overheated to use their exposed feet and ability

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.750
to control blood flow to cool themselves down
when hot.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.561
However, this system is far from perfect and
it’s noted that, for instance, if a duck

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:23.390
is left in a warm environment before being
put directly into a freezing one, its feet

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.390
can sometimes struggle to adapt and may result
in the poor little guy getting frostbite.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.349
Yes, despite all the methods of keeping their
feet warm listed above, ducks and other birds

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.000
can get frostbite, and sometimes die from
the cold during particularly harsh winters.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.459
Bird poop is white due to their kidney’s
extracting nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.130
and subsequently excreting it in the form
of uric acid, which has a very low solubility

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:10.770
in water and emerges as a white paste-like
substance.
