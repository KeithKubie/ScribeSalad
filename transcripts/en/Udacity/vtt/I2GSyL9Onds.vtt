00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.030
So you would be 25% related to a grandparent, an aunt

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.830
or uncle, and a half sibling. Now what's the reason behind

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.930
this? Well let's start with the grandparent. You're 50% related to

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.420
each of your own parents. And that means each of your parents

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.954
are 50% related to each of their parents. And 50% of

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.668
50% in this case would be 25%. So you're 25% related

00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:23.080
to a parent of your parent. Or your grandparent. Now, in

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.280
the case of your aunt and uncle, there's something similar going on.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.675
The full sibling of your parent is related to them

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.380
50%, so this means your aunt are related to your

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.230
parents 50%. So, if you're 50% related to your parent,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.506
and they're 50% related to your parent, that's 50% and

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.450
50%. You're 25%, again, in this case. But the half-sibling

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.115
option is a little bit trickier. Of course, you share

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.035
50% with each of your parents, and your half-sibling also

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.410
shares 50% with each of their parents, and you share

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.100
that parent. The trick is, the same 50% that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.290
they give you is not the same 50% that they

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.100
gave your half-sibling. And the reason is because of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.950
recombination during meiosis. We learned about this in lesson five.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.340
Remember that when meiosis happens and the sex cells

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.640
are created, they must figure out how they're going to pass

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.200
on half the genome. And every time they do this,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.440
they mix and match the chromosomes slightly differently. So that

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.453
in the end, a half sibling shares 25% with you instead of a full 50%.
