00:39:05.326 --> 00:39:08.354
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It removed the 
process of drafting policy from 

00:39:08.355 --> 00:39:13.981
the eyes of the press and from 
the atmosphere of policy 

00:39:13.982 --> 00:39:16.308
politics.  It hid the process 
somewhat.

00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:19.523
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It was secret.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I would call a 

00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:21.362
benign  secrecy, and I don't 
think the history has ever been 

00:39:21.363 --> 00:39:26.385
written, but if you look at the 
15 members of the Carnying 

00:39:26.386 --> 00:39:31.047
Commission, you see the man, JC 
 Kellem, who headed the 

00:39:31.048 --> 00:39:36.742
television stations in Texas.  
You see a Texan, you see the 

00:39:36.743 --> 00:39:42.369
President of the United Auto 
Workers.  Why?  Because Johnson 

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:47.935
wanted a tremendous lobbying 
push, and if the chairman of the

00:39:47.936 --> 00:39:55.661
 UAW in Detroit was one of the 
people who crafted the idea for 

00:39:55.662 --> 00:39:59.776
the  Corporation of Public 
Broadcasting, that meant they 

00:39:59.777 --> 00:40:02.070
would be behind the bill when it
 came to the hill.  So, all of 

00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:06.741
this was apart of LBJ's 
legislative genius, and as I 

00:40:06.742 --> 00:40:09.539
said earlier, I hope someday, a 
historian will delve into these 

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.209
legislative task forces, because
 it seems to  me, one of the 

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.500
most creative, and really, 
praise-worthy, despite the 

00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:20.010
secrecy, one of the most praise-
worthy things in that history, 

00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:25.612
and it is all apart of a larger 
story.  Um, were it not for the 

00:40:25.613 --> 00:40:29.075
dark cloud of Vietnam, I think 
the LBJ presidency would be 

00:40:29.076 --> 00:40:33.701
remembered as, um, as the new 
deal is remembered, as a 

00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:38.363
flowering of creativity and 
positive legislation on behalf 

00:40:38.364 --> 00:40:39.543
of the well-being of the 
American people.  I see it, I 

00:40:39.544 --> 00:40:43.544
see the great society chapter, 
which really ended at about 

00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:49.317
1967, after the Congress changed
 its composition in 66.  I see 

00:40:49.318 --> 00:40:53.957
it as the concluding chapter of 
the new deal.  Johnson told Bill

00:40:53.958 --> 00:40:57.440
 Moyers on the plane coming back
 from Dallas that he wanted to 

00:40:57.441 --> 00:41:00.928
do all the things that Franklin 
had been unable to do, and so 

00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:04.404
there was this tremendous, um, 
election majority that brought 

00:41:04.405 --> 00:41:07.864
on the coat-tails into the 
Congress a tremendous working 

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:12.366
majority, and he used that 
majority to pass Medicare, more 

00:41:12.367 --> 00:41:17.024
than 60 education bills, 
including the great, um,  

00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:19.387
Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting bill.  The other 

00:41:19.388 --> 00:41:24.983
thing, and Newton mentioned it, 
was bipartisanship.  The 

00:41:24.984 --> 00:41:28.733
commission was made-up of 
Republicans and Democrats, the 

00:41:28.734 --> 00:41:33.402
support on  Capitol Hill came 
from Republicans and  Democrats.

00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:35.711
  To this day, if you look at 
the trustees of the stations 

00:41:35.712 --> 00:41:40.350
around the country, when I was 
traveling for PBS, I'd speak to 

00:41:40.351 --> 00:41:42.674
trustees at fundraising dinners 
around the country for the 

00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:47.309
stations, it was the civic arts 
and business leadership of every

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:51.935
 metropolitan area in the 
country, made-up largely of 

00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:55.468
Republicans, and they could be 
counted upon when these periodic

00:41:55.469 --> 00:42:01.304
 outbursts of insanity occur of 
misguided people, they can't 

00:42:01.305 --> 00:42:03.606
kill, but  wanted to wound 
public broadcasting.  These 

00:42:03.607 --> 00:42:05.907
Republican trustees from all 
over the country get on the 

00:42:05.908 --> 00:42:08.250
phone and say what are you 
doing?

00:42:08.251 --> 00:42:11.545
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  They're still doing
 it speak.

00:42:11.546 --> 00:42:13.881
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  They are, and we 
can count on that.  Senator 

00:42:15.053 --> 00:42:18.517
Warner from Virginia told me 
once that the Congress would 

00:42:18.518 --> 00:42:22.003
never kill public broadcasting, 
because it now is the only way 

00:42:22.004 --> 00:42:24.321
that a member of Congress can 
get on television in his local 

00:42:24.322 --> 00:42:26.617
community.
(Laughing.)

00:42:26.618 --> 00:42:28.950
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, I hope that 
they are inviting, um, their 

00:42:28.951 --> 00:42:34.699
members of Congress to appear 
frequently, but, um, I went to 

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.148
the White House after the great 
landslide of, um, 64, really, a 

00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:44.913
sort of gopher for Douglas Cater
, who was in charge of 

00:42:44.914 --> 00:42:48.377
shepherding the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting into reality

00:42:49.557 --> 00:42:51.872
, and our office, in the 
basement of the west wing, 

00:42:51.873 --> 00:42:55.325
really became a sort of workshop
 where the  members of the 

00:42:55.326 --> 00:42:58.801
Carnegie Commission, first, John
  Gardener of the Carnegie 

00:42:58.802 --> 00:43:04.386
Commission, and then Ellen 
Pifer, I would like to claim 

00:43:04.387 --> 00:43:06.698
some creative role in this, but 
I really was, you know, I came 

00:43:06.699 --> 00:43:10.193
to the White House, having been 
a green reporter for the 

00:43:10.194 --> 00:43:12.474
Washington Post, so I was a kind
 of gopher, but I was also a 

00:43:12.475 --> 00:43:15.933
watcher, and what I watched was 
visionary people, um, doing 

00:43:15.934 --> 00:43:21.571
amazing things, and it had a 
shaping influence, it was a 

00:43:21.572 --> 00:43:25.102
great graduate school of my 
life, and my boss hated to write

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:28.591
 speeches, and because I had 
been a newspaper reporter, he 

00:43:28.592 --> 00:43:32.108
would shove all the speech-
writing off to me, and, um, when

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:37.927
 we passed the legislation and 
Johnson had to make a speech, 

00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:40.259
signing the bill, I was given 
the task of writing the speech, 

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.763
and about 48 hours before the 
speech was locked up and sent 

00:43:43.764 --> 00:43:47.256
into what was called the 
President's night reading, John 

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:52.903
Gardener, by now, the secretary,
 called, and he said we need to 

00:43:52.904 --> 00:43:57.526
extend the vision of this speech
 beyond  broadcasting and talk 

00:43:57.527 --> 00:44:05.465
about all public media, and he 
didn't even know what that meant

00:44:05.466 --> 00:44:09.906
 at the time, but he suggested 
language, and I want to quote a 

00:44:09.907 --> 00:44:13.386
little bit of it, because it is 
so visionary and so symbolic of 

00:44:13.387 --> 00:44:19.176
all that was going on in that 
fertile period of our time.  

00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:20.334
Right in the middle of the 
speech, signing the bill, 

00:44:20.335 --> 00:44:24.972
Johnson said these words, "I 
want to create a great network 

00:44:24.973 --> 00:44:29.702
for knowledge.  Not just a  
broadcast system, but one that 

00:44:29.703 --> 00:44:33.181
employs every means of sending 
and storing information.  Think 

00:44:33.182 --> 00:44:37.813
of the lives that this could 
change; the student in a small 

00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:41.292
college could tap the resources 
of a great university; the 

00:44:41.293 --> 00:44:44.748
country doctor could get help 
from a distant laboratory or 

00:44:44.749 --> 00:44:48.280
teaching hospital; a scholar in 
Atlanta might draw instantly on 

00:44:48.281 --> 00:44:52.895
a library in New York."  Now, 
all this is 30 years before the 

00:44:52.896 --> 00:44:57.473
Internet, but suddenly, um, the 
chrysalis is beginning to form, 

00:44:57.474 --> 00:45:02.088
and the creative vision of a 
network for knowledge, the 

00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:05.515
stations of NPR and PBS had not 
always been receptive, I'm sorry

00:45:06.674 --> 00:45:11.286
 to say, to new technology, and 
a station manager once said to 

00:45:11.287 --> 00:45:14.843
me, when we were trying to 
create PBS.org, um, every hour 

00:45:14.844 --> 00:45:18.288
that a viewer spends looking at 
a computer screen is an hour 

00:45:18.289 --> 00:45:20.582
that he is not watching my 
station.

00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:21.755
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And, um, so, 

00:45:21.756 --> 00:45:26.209
there's been a certain 
hostility, but we know that 

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:30.846
right there in the womb, um, 
when the bill was signed, the 

00:45:30.847 --> 00:45:32.847
President of the United States 
was envisioning something called

00:45:33.176 --> 00:45:36.662
 networks for knowledge.  May 
that, um, increase, may it grow,

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:41.303
 may the commitment of all 
public broadcasters to public 

00:45:41.304 --> 00:45:45.930
media, um, flourish in the 
future, but, um, it was great 

00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:48.225
fun to be in on the beginning, 
though I can't claim anything 

00:45:48.226 --> 00:45:51.718
other than a gopher's role, but 
what a great thing we did.  It 

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:58.000
is now embedded in the culture, 
it is, um, apart of American 

00:45:58.001 --> 00:46:01.034
life in the way that Medicare, 
um, other great achievements of 

00:46:01.035 --> 00:46:04.584
that time are sewn into the 
fabric of American life, and 

00:46:04.585 --> 00:46:09.219
heroes of that movement are in 
this room.  May their tribe 

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.220
increase.
(Applause.)

00:46:18.561 --> 00:46:20.561
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, Nick,

00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:25.069
 what was the role of the FCC in
 all of this?

00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:26.671
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I would like 
to go back a little further.

00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:27.821
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Okay.
(Laughing.)

00:46:27.822 --> 00:46:31.859
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Since I believe Mr.
  Martin and I are amongst

00:46:36.057 --> 00:46:40.684
 the more, um, age of 
experience, you know, and, so --

00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:43.000
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The wise men.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  What?

00:46:43.001 --> 00:46:45.333
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The wise men.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, not 

00:46:45.334 --> 00:46:47.623
necessarily, as we often see.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'm just trying to 

00:46:47.624 --> 00:46:48.775
help.
(Laughing.)

00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:53.220
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But to go back to 
the 18th century, um, because --

00:46:54.371 --> 00:46:56.371
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  There are other 

00:46:56.668 --> 00:47:01.335
Presidents involved in this 
beside Lyndon Johnson, with 

00:47:01.336 --> 00:47:07.094
regard to whom I might add an 
anecdote that he brought me in 

00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:09.420
in February of 64, and shortly 
thereafter, a memo went out to 

00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:12.851
all presidential appointees, you
 may recall this, saying I want 

00:47:12.852 --> 00:47:17.435
you to tell me what you think 
would be in the best interest of

00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:21.878
 our nation with the area for 
which you have responsibility, 

00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:26.497
and in my case, at that time, it
 was ports and ship-building and

00:47:26.498 --> 00:47:32.178
 shipping.  He made me maritime 
administrator, just exactly what

00:47:32.179 --> 00:47:35.233
 you would think, a boy from 
Iowa.

00:47:35.234 --> 00:47:38.679
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The coast of Iowa.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.680
(Laughing.)

00:47:41.851 --> 00:47:44.179
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  With shipping 
experience limited to, um, 

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.605
operating a canoe on the Iowa  
River, but not very 

00:47:47.606 --> 00:47:51.126
successfully, something that, 
thankfully, the commerce 

00:47:51.127 --> 00:47:54.606
committee found fully adequate 
to justify the appointment, but,

00:47:58.606 --> 00:47:59.775
 um, I think that's another 
thing to say about Lyndon 

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:05.576
Johnson, that compared with, um,
 other Presidents, perhaps, who 

00:48:05.577 --> 00:48:09.002
will go unnamed, that there 
would actually be that focus on 

00:48:09.003 --> 00:48:11.286
what's in the best national 
interest, but I want to go back 

00:48:11.287 --> 00:48:15.910
to, um, Madison, who I just 
learned today is referred to by 

00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:20.550
those who work at the library of
 Congress as Jimmy Madison.

00:48:20.551 --> 00:48:25.071
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes, he was Jemmy.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Is that right?  Was

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:29.643
 it James Madison?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Jemmy.

00:48:29.644 --> 00:48:31.945
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'll be darned.  
Did your father tell you that?

00:48:31.946 --> 00:48:34.262
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  No, I write history
 books.

00:48:34.263 --> 00:48:36.579
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  They would be so 

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.884
proud of you now and everything 
you've done.  I'm serious

00:48:43.054 --> 00:48:44.916
.
(Laughing.)

00:48:44.917 --> 00:48:49.188
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, anyhow, I 
want to go back to, um, Jemmy 

00:48:49.189 --> 00:48:51.515
Madison, however you spell his 
name, and there's an inscription

00:48:52.671 --> 00:48:54.981
, as you came into this 
building, you may have noticed, 

00:48:54.982 --> 00:48:58.418
and I'm going to link this up 
with Thomas Jefferson, and then 

00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:01.919
ultimately with, um, public 
broadcasting and try to do it in

00:49:03.059 --> 00:49:04.203
 5 minutes or less, if that's 
all right.

00:49:04.204 --> 00:49:06.495
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's all right.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, less will be 

00:49:06.496 --> 00:49:12.382
better.  Less is more.  Yeah.  
Um, and it contains this line, 

00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:14.711
"a people who mean to be their 
own governors must arm them

00:49:16.873 --> 00:49:20.201
selves with the power which 
knowledge gives."  That's 

00:49:20.202 --> 00:49:24.838
Madison's  quote.  Jefferson, 
and many of you may know this, 

00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:29.762
but when writing his own epitaph
, chose to be remembered as the 

00:49:29.763 --> 00:49:34.216
father of the University of 
Virginia, and made no mention of

00:49:34.217 --> 00:49:36.217
 the fact that he'd been 
President of the United States

00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:41.878
.  Now, this is very significant
, I think, because what these 

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:47.999
folks were doing was recognizing
 and establishing and making 

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.817
efforts to maintain fundamental 
pillars of democracy, many of 

00:49:54.818 --> 00:49:59.669
which have always been and 
continue to be today, um, under 

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:05.687
attack.  One, obviously, is 
extending the franchise from 

00:50:05.688 --> 00:50:10.276
originally white, male, 
landowners over 21, um, to where

00:50:10.277 --> 00:50:13.557
 now, we even let women vote.
(Laughing.)

00:50:13.558 --> 00:50:16.848
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Took awhile.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It did take a long 

00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:25.674
while, um, and 18-year-olds, but
 then the addition of free 

00:50:25.675 --> 00:50:34.726
public education, a fundamental 
element and pillar of democracy,

00:50:34.727 --> 00:50:39.281
 and then the idea of 
independent media, protected by 

00:50:39.282 --> 00:50:41.282
the First Amendment

00:50:43.613 --> 00:50:49.995
, for Jefferson also said, 
famously, as you all know, "were

00:50:49.996 --> 00:50:52.029
 it left to me to decide whether
 we should have a government 

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:55.459
without newspapers or newspapers
 without a government, I should 

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.096
not hesitate a moment to prefer 
the latter."  And then went on 

00:51:00.097 --> 00:51:04.750
in the next sentence to say," 
but I should mean that every 

00:51:04.751 --> 00:51:07.098
person should receive those 
papers and be capable of reading

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:13.911
 them."  Again, tying it to 
education.  Subsequently, we 

00:51:13.912 --> 00:51:19.776
added the idea of free public 
libraries, where every American 

00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:24.490
could have access to the 
resources of kings, and indeed, 

00:51:24.491 --> 00:51:32.322
this library was contributed to 
by Jefferson in 1815, as you 

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:34.323
probably know

00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:44.854
.  Something that is often not 
thought about in this context, 

00:51:44.855 --> 00:51:49.506
but related to John Gardener, he
 wrote two  paperback books, one

00:51:50.654 --> 00:51:55.229
 called Excellence, one called 
Self-Renewal, which I think are 

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.544
always worth re-reading, at 
least every 20 or 30  years, um,

00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:05.328
 because the other thing we did 
was to establish reduced rates

00:52:08.498 --> 00:52:11.970
 for sending newspapers and 
books and magazines through the 

00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:19.538
postal system, subsidizing what 
was, at that time, the 

00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:24.165
communications network of the 
19th century, was the Post 

00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:28.587
Office, and then we added 
telegraph and telephones and so 

00:52:28.588 --> 00:52:35.494
on, but that was how it began, 
and as all of you know, the 

00:52:35.495 --> 00:52:39.965
early, um, time of radio, and I 
want to tell just one story 

00:52:39.966 --> 00:52:43.431
about Iowa City, and then I'm 
done, is that okay?  Okay.  Um, 

00:52:43.432 --> 00:52:46.891
the early days of radio involved
, um,

00:52:50.026 --> 00:52:54.491
 numerous, 72, in the very early
 days, educational institutions 

00:52:54.492 --> 00:52:59.141
that did not only the 
technological work of creating 

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:02.636
this box in which little people 
lived and could talk, but also, 

00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:07.995
the programming, and the focus 
on the use of this as an 

00:53:07.996 --> 00:53:11.330
instrument of education.  In

00:53:15.076 --> 00:53:17.393
 Iowa City, Iowa, a city 
designated by the United Nations

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:21.997
 as one of three global cities 
of literature, um, was created 

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:26.672
the first educational radio 
station west of the Mississippi.

00:53:26.673 --> 00:53:34.364
  That was in 1911.   So, this 
goes back before 1967, for those

00:53:34.365 --> 00:53:43.304
 who are younger among us here 
today.  Um, in 1971, WSUI became

00:53:43.305 --> 00:53:50.070
 a charter member of NPR, one 
of, um, the early few, and one 

00:53:50.071 --> 00:53:54.667
of the 90 stations to carry the 
inaugural broadcast of, um, Bill

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:02.004
's  All Things Considered.  In 
1916, it began transmitting 

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:06.207
educational content, ultimately 
including my father's lectures 

00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:10.857
in the 19 40s.  By the late 19 
20s, remember this, 19 20s, they

00:54:10.858 --> 00:54:17.578
 had educational television, um,
 broadcasting television images 

00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:24.374
of, um, classroom content, a 
station that would ultimately be

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:31.360
 one of the founding stations 
creating Iowa public television,

00:54:31.361 --> 00:54:33.361
 and thus

00:54:34.577 --> 00:54:37.243
 ends the reading for  today.
(Laughing.)

00:54:34.577 --> 00:54:36.577
(Applause.)

00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:45.349
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, Bill, that 
nicely gets us to you.  Um, the 

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.665
fact is, you know, we heard all 
about educational TV, and even 

00:54:47.666 --> 00:54:52.330
though radio came before, um, it
 was something of an  

00:54:52.331 --> 00:54:55.988
afterthought in terms of public 
broadcasting, and you were the 

00:54:55.989 --> 00:54:58.333
person who changed that.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It was actually 

00:54:58.334 --> 00:55:01.863
scotch-taped at the last minute 
on to the legislation.

00:55:01.864 --> 00:55:05.025
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And radio.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And radio.

00:55:05.026 --> 00:55:08.552
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It's like the Civil
 Rights  Law putting and sex in 

00:55:08.553 --> 00:55:12.029
and changing women's lives 
forever, but, um--

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:16.694
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If I can note, I 
took the position at that time 

00:55:16.695 --> 00:55:21.302
that we ought to forget about 
television and start with radio.

00:55:21.303 --> 00:55:27.072
  You got literally ten times 
more for your dollar with radio 

00:55:27.073 --> 00:55:29.414
than with television.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's still true.

00:55:29.415 --> 00:55:33.877
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's right.  
Build a really strong national 

00:55:33.878 --> 00:55:37.628
political base in support of 
public radio that would then 

00:55:37.629 --> 00:55:39.629
clamor

00:55:40.769 --> 00:55:44.246
 and demand of Congress public 
television, but to start with 

00:55:44.247 --> 00:55:46.598
public television and underfund 
it, I didn't think was the right

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.066
 political move.  Bill.
(Laughing.)

00:55:50.067 --> 00:55:52.067
(Applause.)

00:55:54.229 --> 00:55:58.830
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Because many of you
 are historians, and we've had, 

00:55:58.831 --> 00:56:02.292
um, history of universities, I'd
 like to just go back.  I was, a

00:56:02.293 --> 00:56:05.760
 couple weeks ago, I was out in 
Madison, Wisconsin, celebrating 

00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:10.353
the hundredth anniversary of the
 oldest station, the oldest 

00:56:10.354 --> 00:56:11.521
educational station, continuous 
broadcasting.

00:56:11.522 --> 00:56:12.686
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, but east of 
the Mississippi.

00:56:12.687 --> 00:56:16.184
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's right.  We 

00:56:16.185 --> 00:56:18.487
could  arm-wrestle about this.
(Laughing.)

00:56:18.488 --> 00:56:20.776
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, and, um, 
tracing this back to the 

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:24.250
universities, because I think 
this is very, a good point, 

00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:32.039
about 11 years before radio was 
invented, um, the university 

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.519
President said I was the 
beneficence of the university to

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.000
 be at every home in the state, 
and it became the motto of the 

00:56:39.001 --> 00:56:44.591
so-called Wisconsin Idea, the 
boundaries of the cappests are 

00:56:44.592 --> 00:56:48.021
the boundaries of the state.  
So, that was the idea of 

00:56:48.022 --> 00:56:52.517
extending those resources, and 
at that time, the very first 

00:56:52.518 --> 00:56:55.993
broadcast, east of the 
Mississippi, by an educational 

00:56:55.994 --> 00:57:02.757
station was information to 
farmers; weather information, 61

00:57:02.758 --> 00:57:06.195
 percent were, 61 percent  
literacy rate at that time in 

00:57:06.196 --> 00:57:11.705
Wisconsin.  Um, as just a side 
bar, um, she mentioned I have an

00:57:11.706 --> 00:57:15.148
 organization developing radio 
partners, and we're working in 

00:57:15.149 --> 00:57:19.612
Zambia to improve the weather 
and farming information, where 

00:57:19.613 --> 00:57:23.045
the literacy rate is 61 percent.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Back in the 

00:57:23.046 --> 00:57:24.194
beginning.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, radio continues

00:57:24.195 --> 00:57:30.970
 to be used this way.  So 
anyway, that idea continued, so 

00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:35.596
the beginnings really were there
, and I started my career in 

00:57:35.597 --> 00:57:41.401
public radio as an engineer in 
1952, working my way through the

00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:44.905
 University of Wisconsin, so, 
um, that's where  I, my roots 

00:57:44.906 --> 00:57:53.724
are there, and there was, um, a 
center for innovation and audio 

00:57:53.725 --> 00:57:59.874
innovation and so on there, 
producing, um, radio plays

00:58:06.078 --> 00:58:11.134
.  Anyway, it was that 
experience that informed  me.  

00:58:11.135 --> 00:58:15.762
Um, I left there and was in 
Buffalo and developed a 

00:58:15.763 --> 00:58:19.165
storefront center broadcast 
facility in the heart of the 

00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:21.549
Black Community, where, um, 27 
hours a week came from that 

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.277
source, so I was, at that time, 
giving voice, or helping give 

00:58:26.278 --> 00:58:28.591
voice to folks that had no, 
there were no people of color, 

00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:32.997
really, in media at that time.  
Um, and we had discussions about

00:58:32.998 --> 00:58:35.361
 race on air; what is it like

00:58:38.529 --> 00:58:39.671
 to be an African American in 
our society.

00:58:39.672 --> 00:58:40.834
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  What year are we in
 now?

00:58:40.835 --> 00:58:48.815
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We're in 1963 and 
64, and, um, I did a series on 

00:58:48.816 --> 00:58:54.411
the confederacy, nation within a
 nation.  Anyway, so, when I was

00:58:54.412 --> 00:58:57.845
  tasked, as a member of the 
founding board, to write the 

00:58:57.846 --> 00:59:04.583
mission statement, um, I felt 
very strongly about radio.  Our 

00:59:04.584 --> 00:59:08.033
first meeting, I was on the 
radio advisory committee, and 

00:59:08.034 --> 00:59:12.654
John macey said to us, well, you
 know, of course, television has

00:59:12.655 --> 00:59:16.106
 to go first.  Of course, 
television always goes first, 

00:59:16.107 --> 00:59:21.740
and, um, I was, um, really 
always frustrated by this, of  

00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:26.334
course, because, um, so, I 
started a program in  Buffalo 

00:59:26.335 --> 00:59:34.266
called This Is Radio.  This is 
radio, damn it, pay attention.  

00:59:34.267 --> 00:59:38.888
I'm still saying the same thing 
in development.  Anyway, so, the

00:59:38.889 --> 00:59:43.491
 task was to try to, for me, um,
 differentiate it from the 

00:59:43.492 --> 00:59:50.555
educational radio, from 
commercial radio, from PBS, to 

00:59:50.556 --> 00:59:56.371
capitalize the unique strengths 
of radio as a sound medium, 

00:59:56.372 --> 00:59:59.816
getting out of the studio, 
telling stories, and, um, to be 

00:59:59.817 --> 01:00:04.424
somewhat aspirational, but also 
practical.  So, that was what I 

01:00:04.425 --> 01:00:07.768
was trying to do when I wrote, 
um, the mission statement.  If 

01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:13.364
you don't mind, I'll just read a
 few paragraphs of that.  

01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:16.815
National public radio will serve
 the  individual.  It will 

01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:20.320
promote personal growth.  It 
will regard individual 

01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:22.845
differences with respect and joy

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:28.332
 rather than hate.  It will 
celebrate the human experiences 

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.837
infinitely varied rather than

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.160
 vackious bunow.  It will 
encourage a sense of active, 

01:00:35.161 --> 01:00:38.756
constructive participation 
rather than apathetic  

01:00:38.757 --> 01:00:44.413
helplessness.  The total service
 should be trustworthy, enhance 

01:00:44.414 --> 01:00:47.871
intellectual development, expand
 knowledge, deepen oral esthetic

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:54.642
 enjoyment, increase the 
pleasure of living in a 

01:00:54.643 --> 01:00:56.988
pluralistic society, and result 
in a service to listeners which 

01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:01.643
makes them more responsive, 
informed human beings, and 

01:01:01.644 --> 01:01:03.974
intelligent, responsible 
citizens of their communities 

01:01:03.975 --> 01:01:08.597
and the world.  And then in the 
first description of what became

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.750
 All Things Considered, I said

01:01:14.024 --> 01:01:17.824
 that it would not substitute 
superficial  blandness for 

01:01:14.024 --> 01:01:19.843
genuine diversity of regions,  
values and cultural and ethnic 

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:21.844
minorities, which comprised

01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:26.456
 American society.  It would 
speak with many voices and many 

01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:30.469
dialects.  The editorial 
attitude would be that of 

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:36.442
inquiry, curiosity, concern for 
the quality of life, critical, 

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:41.042
problem-solving, and life-loving
.  The listener should come to 

01:01:41.043 --> 01:01:44.523
rely upon it as a source of 
information of consequence, that

01:01:44.524 --> 01:01:46.865
 having listened has made a 
difference in their attitude 

01:01:46.866 --> 01:01:51.159
toward their environment and  
themselves.  And then the 

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.830
concluding paragraph for now, 
philosophically, time is 

01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:58.301
measured by the intensity of 
experience.  Waiting for a bus 

01:01:58.302 --> 01:02:01.785
and walking through an art 
gallery may occupy the same 

01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:06.354
duration of time, but not the 
same time experience.  Listeners

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:10.925
 should feel that the time spent
 with NPR was among their most 

01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:15.645
rewarding in media contact.  
National public radio will not 

01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:20.292
regard its audience as a market,
 or in terms of its disposable 

01:02:20.293 --> 01:02:26.114
income, but as curious, complex 
individuals who are looking for 

01:02:26.115 --> 01:02:29.424
some understanding, meaning, and
 joy in the human experience.

01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:32.661
(Applause.)

01:02:42.836 --> 01:02:47.460
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, so now you 
have a good sense of how it all 

01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:51.541
began, and since these gentlemen
 have been broadcasters, we're  

01:02:51.542 --> 01:02:56.019
finishing right on time, at 3:00
 o'clock, in time for the next 

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.020
panel.  Thank you, gentlemen, 
very,

01:03:01.542 --> 01:03:03.542
 very much.
(Applause.)

01:03:06.712 --> 01:03:10.148
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.  Thank 
you all very much.  That was 

01:03:10.149 --> 01:03:13.666
wonderful.  Um, as we setup for 
the next panelists, would the 

01:03:13.667 --> 01:03:18.378
next set of panelists please 
come on the stage?  We're going 

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:21.516
to show a clip.  The next panel 
is on news and public affairs 

01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:23.868
and talk shows, and while the 
panelists get ready, we're going

01:03:26.043 --> 01:03:29.513
 to show you coverage from the 
Watergate hearings.  We've just 

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:34.087
launched a curated exhibit on 
the  AAPB website about public 

01:03:34.088 --> 01:03:37.348
broadcasting's  coverage of the 
Watergate hearings, and that 

01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:40.680
will mark the first time the 
complete online access to the 

01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:45.164
hearings has been made available
 to the public online.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:05.607
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Good

01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:09.303
 afternoon, everyone.  I'm the 
chairman of the executive 

01:09:09.304 --> 01:09:14.546
advisory council for the 
American Archive of Public  

01:09:14.547 --> 01:09:17.846
Broadcasting, and when I arrived
 at WGBH, Henry  Morganthal was 

01:09:17.847 --> 01:09:22.472
in his heyday as an executive 
producer, so he was one of my 

01:09:22.473 --> 01:09:25.903
mentors, and one thing that 
Carla Hayden didn't have time to

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:28.201
 tell you is he still have the 
urge to create, he's just 

01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:31.511
published a book of his poetry, 
his first book of poetry, I've 

01:09:31.512 --> 01:09:35.009
got a copy over there, and what 
she didn't tell you is this is 

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:36.158
actually a stop on his book tour
 today.

01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:38.159
(Laughing.)

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.703
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It is my great 
pleasure to introduce this next 

01:09:41.704 --> 01:09:48.492
panel and its moderator, Judy 
Woodrough, one of our very 

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:55.118
special colleagues in public 
media.  Judy began her 

01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:59.714
distinguished career at the CBS 
affiliate in Atlanta and went on

01:09:59.715 --> 01:10:04.388

01:10:04.389 --> 01:10:09.694
Frontline in its early days,

01:10:21.158 --> 01:10:25.615
Judy, for helping us today, and 
we promise to get you out of 

01:10:25.616 --> 01:10:30.216
here and back ready to prep for 
the news hour tonight.

01:10:30.217 --> 01:10:31.354
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you very much
.

01:10:31.355 --> 01:10:33.355
(Applause.)

01:10:35.504 --> 01:10:37.504
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Henry Beckton, of 
course, being one of the pillars

01:10:37.835 --> 01:10:41.360
 for public media for so many 
years, um, Boston and the whole 

01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:44.818
country has so much to thank you
 for.  Thank you,  Henry.  So, 

01:10:44.819 --> 01:10:49.442
I'm the lucky one now, because I
 get to preside over this panel 

01:10:49.443 --> 01:10:54.087
of five mega stars in public 
media, the pantheon of news and 

01:10:54.088 --> 01:10:58.766
public affairs.  Each one of 
them has played an absolutely 

01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:02.280
essential role in keeping public
 media, public television, and 

01:11:02.281 --> 01:11:05.799
radio at the center of American 
life.  Um, none of them needs an

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.544
 introduction, so I'm going to 
be very brief, starting with my 

01:11:10.545 --> 01:11:13.987
mentor, um, the man you just saw
 in that clip, the former anchor

01:11:13.988 --> 01:11:20.811
 and executive editor of the 
news hour with Jim  Larer, and 

01:11:20.812 --> 01:11:26.609
before that, the co-anchor and 
executive editor of the McNeal 

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:28.951
News Hour, the face of and the 
singular

01:11:33.034 --> 01:11:41.013
 driving force behind daily 
journalism at PBS, Jim Larer.

01:11:41.014 --> 01:11:43.014
(Applause.)

01:11:57.225 --> 01:12:05.184
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Next, the President
 and CEO of WETA since 1989.  

01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:07.515
Before that, she served as a 
member and chair of the board of

01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:12.150
 Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, as well as the 

01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:15.608
member of the WETA board, 
following her service on the  

01:12:15.609 --> 01:12:20.246
West Virginia Educational 
Broadcasting  Authority, Sharon 

01:12:23.404 --> 01:12:26.703
Percy-Rockefeller.  The 
Executive Director and co-found

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:35.623

Public Radio Network in 1976, he

01:12:35.624 --> 01:12:39.095
 was the moving force of a group
 of Latino farm workers, 

01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:44.482
artists, activists, and teachers
 who founded this in California 

01:12:46.545 --> 01:12:48.545
Valley,

01:12:49.767 --> 01:12:53.336
 Hugo  Moralis.
(Applause.)

01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:55.337
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Someone who's

01:12:56.509 --> 01:13:03.384
 already been applauded here, 
the long-time host of the Dick 

01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:08.027
Kavitz show, has spanned 
networks from NBC,  USA, HBO, 

01:13:08.028 --> 01:13:11.466
and of course, PBS.  He's 
appeared in movies, TV specials,

01:13:11.467 --> 01:13:17.229
 and several Broadway  plays, 
Dick Kavit.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.230
(Applause.)

01:13:20.387 --> 01:13:24.818
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Finally, the 
aforementioned living legend, 

01:13:24.819 --> 01:13:27.144
the woman who moderated the last
 panel

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:39.598
 and commentator for ABC News, 
advisor to the American Archives

01:13:40.746 --> 01:13:42.746
 of Public Broadcasting,

01:13:45.073 --> 01:13:51.851
  Coce Roberts.  So, what we're 
charged with doing is looking at

01:13:51.852 --> 01:13:55.010
 how news and public affairs 
came into being and how it 

01:13:55.011 --> 01:13:57.306
evolved in public media.  Jim, 
I'm going to start with you.  

01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:03.023
You were there almost at the 
beginning.  When you came to 

01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:06.520
Washington, it was all about 
Watergate.  What happened?

01:14:06.521 --> 01:14:11.211
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, the Watergate
 hearings really did, that was 

01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:14.662
the watershed event for news and
 public affairs on public 

01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:18.140
television.  Up to that point, 
the, um, the stations and the 

01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:20.450
public was generally divided 
over whether you even

01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:26.954
 needed anymore news and public 
affairs on television beyond 

01:14:26.955 --> 01:14:29.277
what was already there on 
commercial television.  The 

01:14:29.278 --> 01:14:31.571
Nixon  Administration 
particularly didn't think there 

01:14:31.572 --> 01:14:35.065
was a need for anymore news and 
public affairs on public 

01:14:35.066 --> 01:14:38.538
broadcasting, but the Watergate 
 hearings changed everything, 

01:14:38.539 --> 01:14:44.171
and the reason it changed was 
because of, there's several 

01:14:44.172 --> 01:14:46.474
individuals who had the courage 
to make some really tough 

01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:51.144
decisions, and one of them was 
not to necessarily broadcast 

01:14:51.145 --> 01:14:54.602
them gavel to gavel, because 
many of the stations would not  

01:14:54.603 --> 01:14:58.181
broadcast it live, because they 
had educational TV on during the

01:14:59.319 --> 01:15:04.972
 daytime, but somebody, and I 
was part of the mix of the 

01:15:04.973 --> 01:15:09.422
somebodies, said why in the hell
 don't we run them at night?  

01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:12.871
Repeat them at night?  And that 
was a big, big deal.  It was a 

01:15:12.872 --> 01:15:15.205
big decision, and, um, the 
people who were running PBS were

01:15:15.206 --> 01:15:19.879
 nervous about it, so they said 
let's poll the stations, so but 

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.444
the, we did poll the stations, 
but we polled the stations in a 

01:15:23.445 --> 01:15:26.787
very clever way.
(Laughing.)

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:27.943
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We polled the 
stations with a question that 

01:15:27.944 --> 01:15:32.558
was kind of phrased in such a  
way, do you want to be 

01:15:32.559 --> 01:15:33.733
patriotic, or do you want to be 
a jerk.

01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:37.059
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And we still barely

01:15:38.212 --> 01:15:40.396
 won.
(Laughing.)

01:15:40.397 --> 01:15:45.972
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And, um, but as 
McNeal said at the time, and I 

01:15:45.973 --> 01:15:49.496
quote him almost verbatim, um, 
well, the option, because it was

01:15:49.497 --> 01:15:52.998
  summertime, and PBS didn't 
have that much to run at night, 

01:15:52.999 --> 01:15:57.613
they had no original programs to
 run at night anyhow, so he 

01:15:57.614 --> 01:16:01.965
said, well, all they would run, 
if they didn't run the hearings,

01:16:01.966 --> 01:16:10.984
 would be, how did he put it um,
  English-speaking people 

01:16:10.985 --> 01:16:14.277
talking, animals  mating.
(Laughing.)

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:17.757
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And occasionally,  
English-speaking people mating 

01:16:17.758 --> 01:16:19.758
and animals  talking.
(Laughing.)

01:16:24.068 --> 01:16:27.545
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, why not replace
 it with the Watergate hearings?

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:31.017
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's why when I 

01:16:31.018 --> 01:16:34.443
said 3:00 a.m., the hearings 
weren't going on till 3:00 a.m.,

01:16:34.444 --> 01:16:36.777
 that was the repeat every night
.  We would do it live all day, 

01:16:36.778 --> 01:16:41.449
but we only had  about, maybe 
half the stations were watching 

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:45.951
 it, were broadcasting it, but 
at night, um, and at first, it 

01:16:45.952 --> 01:16:51.587
wouldn't, you know, it was the 
old story, you know, um, the big

01:16:51.588 --> 01:16:56.256
 stations wouldn't take it, but 
then they started, because the 

01:16:56.257 --> 01:17:00.881
word got out, and then suddenly,
 it became a big deal, and the 

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:06.465
big deal was that it proved, 
beyond a shadow of a doubt, that

01:17:06.466 --> 01:17:11.321
 there was a role for news and 
public affairs on public 

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:13.922
broadcasting because of those 
hearings.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:16.772
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, when you and 
Robin cooked up the McNeal 

01:17:16.773 --> 01:17:20.838
Report, then quickly --
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It began, as I said

01:17:20.839 --> 01:17:26.528
 a million times, it began with 
the worst title in the history 

01:17:26.529 --> 01:17:29.998
of television, and I was the 
Washington correspondent, and 

01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:32.308
then it became, my mother 
interceded.

01:17:32.309 --> 01:17:34.638
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It was one story a 

01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:38.707
day for 30 minutes when we 
started, and then, that was 75, 

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:42.572
and then 83, it went to an hour.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And that's where I 

01:17:42.573 --> 01:17:46.067
want to bring in Sharon 
Rockefeller, because Sharon, you

01:17:46.068 --> 01:17:49.537
 were already active in public 
broadcasting, and you knew what 

01:17:49.538 --> 01:17:51.852
Jim and Robin were trying to do.
  What were you up against when 

01:17:51.853 --> 01:17:55.288
they tried to go to an hour?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The stations, in 

01:17:55.289 --> 01:18:01.092
many senses.  Um, I was working,
 I was familiar with West 

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:04.033
Virginia Education Broadcasting 
Authority, not on the board at 

01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:09.666
that time, because my husband 
wasn't governor, and that was a 

01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:11.965
governor appointment.  At the 
time, actually, I asked for one 

01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:14.310
thing from my husband, can I be 
 appointed to the

01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:19.727
 WVEBA, and he said yes, and no 
one ever thought twice about it,

01:18:20.874 --> 01:18:24.414
 but that was my training, 
that's where I learned, but the 

01:18:24.415 --> 01:18:31.209
Watergate hearings, actually, I 
watched every single day, all 

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:36.501
day long.  Jay had lost an 
election by the largest margin 

01:18:36.502 --> 01:18:38.862
in the history of the state.  We
 had four years in

01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:44.183
 exsile in  West Virginia, three
 hours north of Charleston, 

01:18:44.184 --> 01:18:46.494
three hours south of Pittsburgh,
 about an hour and a half from 

01:18:46.495 --> 01:18:51.080
the Morgantown West Virginia  
University Station, so when the 

01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:53.377
Watergate  hearings were on, I 
could not receive the Washington

01:18:54.533 --> 01:19:00.332
 Post by mail until two days 
after it was published, I 

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:04.828
started watching full-time.  My 
kids were watching Sesame 

01:19:04.829 --> 01:19:11.625
Street.  I loved history, but 
news and public affairs was my 

01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:17.403
main attraction, it was what we 
had to offer.  We, at that 

01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:21.849
point, was little ole public 
television, and it was the 

01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:26.495
turnaround.  I also came on the 
WETA board at the same time 

01:19:26.496 --> 01:19:30.023
through another vehicle, a 
friend of mine on the Stanford 

01:19:30.024 --> 01:19:33.824
University Board, which had one 
woman on the board, and I was 

01:19:33.825 --> 01:19:37.203
taking her place.  She was the 
founder of, this is in the

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.835
 70s, she was the founder of 
Caroline Charles.  So, she said 

01:19:43.836 --> 01:19:49.467
where do you live, I said West 
Virginia, and she said, where is

01:19:49.468 --> 01:19:51.468
 that?
(Laughing.)

01:19:52.614 --> 01:19:54.912
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  She said is it near
 the Dakotas?  I said no.  Is it

01:19:56.070 --> 01:20:00.687
 near the Carolinas?  No.  Um, 
but she knew Mrs.  Campbell, and

01:20:00.688 --> 01:20:04.614
 she called her immediately, I 
was 29, she said you have to 

01:20:04.615 --> 01:20:08.079
talk to this young woman.  I 
didn't know what about, but Mrs.

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:12.623
  Campbell called me, in a very 
authoritarian way, you must come

01:20:12.624 --> 01:20:17.105
 to Washington right now, which 
I did.  I've always taken my 

01:20:17.106 --> 01:20:21.301
orders from Elizabeth Campbell, 
and that's how I got involved 

01:20:21.302 --> 01:20:28.267
with WETA.  So, I had a very 
small poor rural state, and at 

01:20:28.268 --> 01:20:31.687
that point, WETA was not as 
wealthy as it is today, it had a

01:20:31.688 --> 01:20:36.920
 budget of $4 million, now we're
 at $97 million, but we've 

01:20:36.921 --> 01:20:40.413
clawed our way up, and it's 
really through news and public 

01:20:40.414 --> 01:20:43.898
affairs.  The Watergate hearings
 put public television on the 

01:20:43.899 --> 01:20:49.693
map, and WETA, and The News 
Hour, which came about in 1983, 

01:20:49.694 --> 01:20:51.694
because we thought we should be 
the

01:20:55.003 --> 01:20:59.069
 first and that all stations 
were going to go to one hour of 

01:20:55.003 --> 01:21:00.798
news.  In fact, they never did. 
 We did, but we won, if you 

01:21:00.799 --> 01:21:04.256
recall,  Robin and Jim and I 
went around to visit stations, 

01:21:04.257 --> 01:21:06.433
speak to them

01:21:11.598 --> 01:21:15.116
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We divided up the 

01:21:15.117 --> 01:21:19.725
300-some public television 
stations, and, um, we called 

01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:26.495
every station manager or program
 manager, because, um, the 

01:21:26.496 --> 01:21:31.080
President of PBS said, well, 
it's a great idea to go to an 

01:21:31.081 --> 01:21:33.429
hour, but I don't have the power
 to do it, you're going to have 

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.909
to get the stations to do it, so
 we physically called them on 

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:41.560
the phone, and then there was a 
vote, and we won by six votes.

01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:43.510
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's right.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  To go to an hour.

01:21:43.511 --> 01:21:47.516
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Mm-hmm.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And out of 

01:21:47.517 --> 01:21:49.850
300-something.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Exactly.

01:21:47.517 --> 01:21:49.818
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I felt like, oh, 
never mind.

01:21:49.819 --> 01:21:52.136
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  All you need is one
 more.

01:21:52.137 --> 01:21:56.625
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Absolutely.  
Democracy run.

01:21:56.626 --> 01:22:01.512
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, while all this 
was going on in the daily news, 

01:22:01.513 --> 01:22:05.499
daily journalism world, you had 
a very successful career as an 

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500
interviewer in commercial 
television.  What was the appeal

01:22:08.483 --> 01:22:10.483
 of public television?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I noticed

01:22:13.619 --> 01:22:15.619
 that among the things they 
thought might

01:22:18.482 --> 01:22:20.800
 come up would be the question 
of why I moved my show from, um,

01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:25.499
 network television to PBS.  I 
was fired.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.500
(Laughing.)

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.700
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That'll do it

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.161
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's pretty much 

01:22:36.162 --> 01:22:38.453
what happened.  So, that kind of
, um, opened the door, paved the

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.623
 way.
(Laughing.)

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:45.207
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Whatever cliche you
 prefer.  It was a wonderful 

01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:47.208
change

01:22:48.377 --> 01:22:51.870
.  I was, of course, delighted 
to get a show, terrified and 

01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:55.312
very nervous at first, and the 
trouble there, the kind that 

01:22:55.313 --> 01:22:59.907
would come up on network, so-
called non-public television, so

01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:05.718
 to speak, started on the first 
day.  I thought I had a 

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:09.210
wonderful show to present them 
as my first show, to be played 

01:23:09.211 --> 01:23:19.017
about a week later.  Mohammed 
Ali, Angela Lanesbury, did a 

01:23:19.018 --> 01:23:22.507
wonderful, lively show, and 
foolish boy from Nebraska that I

01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:24.508
 am

01:23:25.517 --> 01:23:29.068
, I went back stage to be 
congratulated by ABC Vice 

01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:33.648
President, and I saw his 
expression didn't seem 

01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:39.257
appropriate for a show that he 
loved.  I think it was worded 

01:23:39.258 --> 01:23:45.035
who the, let's say hell, um,  
gives a damn, that's a better 

01:23:45.036 --> 01:23:53.548
word, what Mohammed Ali and Gora
 Vedal think about  Vietnam?  

01:23:53.549 --> 01:23:57.048
Obviously, that had come up.  
Second brilliant part of his 

01:23:57.049 --> 01:24:01.083
reaction was we can't really air
 that as the first show because 

01:24:01.084 --> 01:24:06.113
of that, and we're going to air 
it as the second show, and I 

01:24:06.114 --> 01:24:08.114
seem to remember saying, are you
 going to be like this all along

01:24:09.141 --> 01:24:11.141
?
(Laughing.)

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:16.900
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I saw Agent Sam 
McCone wince over in the corner,

01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:23.723
 and they did that.  I did a 
second show that was nice.  We 

01:24:23.724 --> 01:24:26.059
had them both, and they aired 
the second show first, and it 

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.561
got mildly enthusiastic 
reaction, and then they aired 

01:24:31.562 --> 01:24:33.901
the first show the second night,
 and reviewers were reviewing 

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:39.543
the whole week.  Almost 
everybody said about the second 

01:24:39.544 --> 01:24:44.198
show, the Kavit Show really 
found itself on the second show.

01:24:44.199 --> 01:24:46.199
(Laughing.)

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:50.836
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I was sure that, 
the man who had been waiting 

01:24:50.837 --> 01:24:55.426
back stage to congratulate me 
got a copy of that.  So, that 

01:24:55.427 --> 01:24:58.902
sort of thing happened, and then
 there were other kinds of 

01:24:58.903 --> 01:25:06.700
troubles that I would not have 
gotten on, and didn't, on PBS.  

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:13.436
One involved that lovable old 
couple, the John Lenins, and 

01:25:13.437 --> 01:25:15.768
they came on, and other people 
were jealous, and the reviews 

01:25:15.769 --> 01:25:20.381
and ratings were big, and that 
was nice, and they even came 

01:25:20.382 --> 01:25:25.471
back.  John, when I met him a 
week earlier, said, I said why 

01:25:25.472 --> 01:25:28.973
do you want to do this, really? 
 There can't be much you need at

01:25:28.974 --> 01:25:34.725
 this point, and he said, well, 
you have the  only halfway 

01:25:34.726 --> 01:25:37.028
intelligent show on television, 
and I said, why would you want 

01:25:37.029 --> 01:25:39.348
to be on a  halfway intelligent 
show?

01:25:39.349 --> 01:25:41.349
(Laughing.)

01:25:42.497 --> 01:25:44.829
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  He laughed, as many
 of you did, and we were friends

01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:49.473
 from that point on, but on the 
second show, who would have 

01:25:49.474 --> 01:25:51.785
guessed, the agreement had been 
that we would do one of their 

01:25:51.786 --> 01:25:58.781
songs, and John said, well, do 
one of  Yoku's songs, and it had

01:25:58.782 --> 01:26:05.695
 the catchy title Woman is the 
Nigger of the World, and, um, I 

01:26:05.696 --> 01:26:07.696
thought

01:26:08.873 --> 01:26:15.703
, by god, we did this song, and 
nothing happened, but before it 

01:26:15.704 --> 01:26:20.356
was aired, I was told that it 
would not be aired, the song, 

01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:24.627
and I complained, and they said,
 well, all right, we will air 

01:26:24.628 --> 01:26:28.123
it, but our decision is that you
 will make a statement 

01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:30.436
beforehand about the dangers of 
 watching it, I guess.

01:26:30.437 --> 01:26:32.437
(Laughing.)

01:26:34.626 --> 01:26:36.958
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I remember one of 
the, well, oh, and there were

01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:44.623
 412, perhaps, protests about 
the song.  None of them about 

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:49.211
the song though, but as one 
woman put it, about that mille-

01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:52.379
mouth speech you delivered.
(Laughing.)

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:58.138
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  My delivery sort of
 encouraged that, I think.  So, 

01:26:58.139 --> 01:27:04.093
getting to PBS was going into a 
green meadow, in a way.

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.094
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I want to 
hear more about the green meadow

01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:10.652
, but Coce, I want to come to 
you, because we heard Bill 

01:27:11.808 --> 01:27:15.310
Simmering say words to the 
effect that they felt that NPR 

01:27:15.311 --> 01:27:21.962
should have had a, the early 
head-start that  PBS did.  Did 

01:27:21.963 --> 01:27:25.447
you feel that?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Oh, sure.  It's 

01:27:25.448 --> 01:27:28.918
still true, to some degree, but 
it turned out to be a  blessing,

01:27:28.919 --> 01:27:32.366
 I think, and Bill can probably 
talk about this more, that it 

01:27:32.367 --> 01:27:38.041
was kind of a secret at first, 
because at the point when Nixon 

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:42.765
did go after television, and 
basically, the television 

01:27:42.766 --> 01:27:48.442
network committed suicide, NPR 
was still there, and there was 

01:27:48.443 --> 01:27:51.910
no necessity to disband it, 
because it wasn't on the radar, 

01:27:51.911 --> 01:27:53.911
 and, so, um,

01:27:56.268 --> 01:28:00.972
 the ability to just grow and 
thrive was much easier in that 

01:28:00.973 --> 01:28:03.284
environment, but then the 
growing and thriving, um, became

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:09.072
 something quite dramatic, and 
as of today, we are listened to 

01:28:09.073 --> 01:28:13.732
by more people than the three, 
you know, it's listened to by 

01:28:13.733 --> 01:28:18.102
more people than the three 
network morning shows combined. 

01:28:18.103 --> 01:28:23.964
 It is listened to by more 
people other than anything but 

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:28.612
Rush Limbal.  The difference in 
ratings is about a half a 

01:28:28.613 --> 01:28:30.799
million people

01:28:33.982 --> 01:28:37.416
.  So, it is wildly successful, 
and really, the primary source 

01:28:37.417 --> 01:28:40.658
of news for millions of people 
around the world.

01:28:40.659 --> 01:28:41.822
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And commercial 
radio has  pulled back from this

01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:44.111
 dramatically over the years.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's also true.

01:28:44.112 --> 01:28:47.601
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Leaving a big 
opening.  So, you were paying 

01:28:47.602 --> 01:28:51.940
attention to all this in 
California, but you and some of 

01:28:51.941 --> 01:28:55.935
your friends, um, decided there 
was something missing.  What did

01:28:55.936 --> 01:28:58.225
 you see?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, first of all,

01:28:58.226 --> 01:29:01.724
 there was little, at that time,
 little or no news on radio, and

01:29:02.893 --> 01:29:04.893
 that is true today

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:10.684
.  Spanish language commercial 
radio, there is no news.  I 

01:29:10.685 --> 01:29:14.173
mean, it sounds maybe sort of 
shocking, most of us believe in 

01:29:14.174 --> 01:29:17.624
the mission, but it's absent.  
It's a shocking truth, that 

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:23.341
there is no news in Spanish 
language radio, and when we got 

01:29:23.342 --> 01:29:25.482
started back in

01:29:29.681 --> 01:29:36.542
 76, we got started on July 4th,
 1980.  The population of 

01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:42.345
Latinos in the U.S. was around 
15 million, which is around 6.5 

01:29:42.346 --> 01:29:48.051
percent of the U.S. population. 
 Now, it's 58 million, and 18 

01:29:48.052 --> 01:29:51.540
percent of the population,  and 
72 percent of Latinos speak 

01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:59.496
Spanish at home home.  So, this 
is not something of the past.  

01:29:59.497 --> 01:30:01.800
You know, some of us were young 
at that time, right?  And we had

01:30:02.947 --> 01:30:08.457
 big dreams, but rather it's 
something that is very relevant 

01:30:08.458 --> 01:30:16.284
today, and yet there is no news 
in Spanish language commercial 

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:19.609
radio.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Stunning.

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.907
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Very stunning.  
It's a story that, um, some of 

01:30:21.908 --> 01:30:26.345
us don't want to, perhaps, 
believe, but it is true, and, 

01:30:26.346 --> 01:30:30.956
um, so, back  in 1976, when we 
started organizing, I started 

01:30:30.957 --> 01:30:32.957
organizing

01:30:34.158 --> 01:30:37.679
 this in Fresno, um, you know, 
it's a community that I came to,

01:30:38.852 --> 01:30:45.634
 because I was born in esh 
raised in Sonoma County, where 

01:30:45.635 --> 01:30:50.276
the fires were recently, and 
then went to the Silicon  Valley

01:30:52.456 --> 01:30:56.943
.  You know, it's, the amount of
 people that I came in contact 

01:30:56.944 --> 01:31:01.590
with, they saw the same thing, 
all these Mexican Americans, all

01:31:02.729 --> 01:31:05.039
 of us, all of them were 
U.S.-born, except for me, I was 

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.609
the only immigrant, and all of 
us were bilingual

01:31:11.784 --> 01:31:17.468
 and educated.  We were the 
first generation of Latinos to 

01:31:17.469 --> 01:31:21.906
be opened the doors to higher 
education.  So, that contributed

01:31:21.907 --> 01:31:26.536
 a lot to why it was founded, 
because we saw this degree of 

01:31:26.537 --> 01:31:30.042
limitation of public 
broadcasting, but not just 

01:31:30.043 --> 01:31:35.471
public broadcasting, but, you  
know, English language media 

01:31:35.472 --> 01:31:38.442
that we, as luteen ors or

01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:46.525
 asLatinos, could not access 
because of the language, but not

01:31:46.526 --> 01:31:50.738
 just the language, and I see 
everybody here, you know, 

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:53.050
there's much more than the 
language.  There's the culture, 

01:31:53.051 --> 01:31:56.503
the history, the nuances of 
language, the literature, the 

01:31:56.504 --> 01:32:01.134
poetry, the arts, all that, and 
that was absent in terms of, and

01:32:01.135 --> 01:32:05.791
 we, as young people, thought, 
well, wow, you know, it seems 

01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:10.421
like our treasures, our 
community treasures are hidden 

01:32:10.422 --> 01:32:13.875
treasures.  We have so much, um,
 you know, wealth of history, we

01:32:13.876 --> 01:32:20.956
 have so much wealth of art and 
so forth in our communities, and

01:32:20.957 --> 01:32:23.057
 we should be able to share that
 and learn from one another.  So

01:32:24.234 --> 01:32:27.710
, that's why we established this
 in 1976, then went on the air 

01:32:27.711 --> 01:32:28.892
in 1980.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And it's still 

01:32:28.893 --> 01:32:31.210
going?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It's still going, 

01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:36.857
and we also believed public 
affairs had to be part of it, 

01:32:36.858 --> 01:32:38.989
because what we wanted to do is,
 just like in this situation, we

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:44.810
 wanted, um, us, as Mexican 
Americans and Latinos, to tell 

01:32:44.811 --> 01:32:48.313
the story, have our own 
narrative, to be inclusive.  I 

01:32:48.314 --> 01:32:52.960
mean, if you look at, for 
example, the prison population 

01:32:52.961 --> 01:32:58.497
today in the United States, you 
know, something like 19 percent 

01:32:58.498 --> 01:33:00.839
of the, um, imprisoned  
population in the U.S. is Latino

01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:07.821
.  So, a lot of our communities 
in need.  The highest drop-out 

01:33:07.822 --> 01:33:10.110
rates from high schools continue
 to be Latinos in the United 

01:33:10.111 --> 01:33:16.896
States, and yet you see the 
figures of how a significant 

01:33:16.897 --> 01:33:20.343
number of Latinos, and we're 
projected to grow even larger.  

01:33:20.344 --> 01:33:23.832
So, that's why we founded it, 
because we wanted that to 

01:33:23.833 --> 01:33:26.173
happen.  So, we've been able to 
document and follow some of the 

01:33:26.174 --> 01:33:30.851
stories that some of the other 
media have not.  For example, 

01:33:30.852 --> 01:33:36.522
there's a case of, um, of an 
indigenous woman living in the 

01:33:36.523 --> 01:33:43.293
south, who was the, you know, 
parenting her child

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.867
, not parenting her child at 
birth because she could not 

01:33:49.868 --> 01:33:53.355
communicate in English or 
Spanish, because she spoke a 

01:33:53.356 --> 01:34:01.215
native language from my home 
state.  So, it's, um, you know, 

01:34:01.216 --> 01:34:05.883
it's that kind of a case, where 
some community, um, folks there 

01:34:05.884 --> 01:34:10.316
from, I think it was Alabama, 
called our station and told them

01:34:10.317 --> 01:34:13.816
 the story, and we broke the 
story, and the mainstream media 

01:34:13.817 --> 01:34:18.958
picked it up, and eventually, 
she recovered her child, but 

01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:20.993
that's the kind of stories that 
we recover, or right now, what's

01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:26.414
 happening, talk about the need,
 there's, um, a lot of fear 

01:34:26.415 --> 01:34:33.053
among our families about, you 
know, deportations, and maybe to

01:34:33.054 --> 01:34:35.349
 those of us in this room, it's 
just another topic, but to 

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:38.804
people who listen to us, our 
listeners, it's very, very 

01:34:38.805 --> 01:34:42.324
personal.  I mean, just, um, I 
think about a month, a couple 

01:34:42.325 --> 01:34:47.948
months ago, we had a call from, 
um, a mother from Tracy, 

01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:53.602
California, when we opened the  
lines, and we were also giving 

01:34:53.603 --> 01:34:57.105
out information at that time, 
and she was saying that her son 

01:34:57.106 --> 01:35:00.558
had gone into depression after 
the election.  He knew what was 

01:35:00.559 --> 01:35:07.389
about to happen, and he was a 
DACA recipient, and he had quit 

01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:10.864
his college upon, after the 
election, and then soon, later, 

01:35:10.865 --> 01:35:15.481
he quit his job.  So, the mother
 was very worried about her son 

01:35:15.482 --> 01:35:18.980
and what was about to happen.  
So, this is the kind of stories 

01:35:18.981 --> 01:35:22.419
and narratives that are carried.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You're touching, 

01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:25.924
um, stories of all American 
lives, and that's what public 

01:35:25.925 --> 01:35:30.588
broadcasting, public media, was 
founded to do.  Jim, let's talk 

01:35:30.589 --> 01:35:34.114
next, um, for a few minutes 
about how hard, or not, it's 

01:35:34.115 --> 01:35:39.948
been to survive as public media,
 as news and public affairs in 

01:35:39.949 --> 01:35:41.949
public media.

01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.930
  A lot of competition out 
there.  The news, the commercial

01:35:45.931 --> 01:35:49.438
 news environment has changed so
 drastically.  Um, why has 

01:35:49.439 --> 01:35:52.909
public media remained, news and 
public affairs  remained as 

01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:55.959
strong as it has, do you think?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, first of all,

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.747
 McNeal and I said at the very 
beginning, um, that if people 

01:36:01.748 --> 01:36:04.077
started, if commercial 
television came along, when 

01:36:04.078 --> 01:36:07.546
cable started growing, in fact, 
particularly, if they started 

01:36:07.547 --> 01:36:11.963
doing what we're doing, we'd 
quit doing it.  There's no point

01:36:11.964 --> 01:36:16.437
 in our doing, um, what's 
already, what's available else 

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:18.445
where.  We'll go on and do 
something else, and, um, we had 

01:36:18.446 --> 01:36:23.448
a lot of ideas of other things 
that we could do, but as we sit 

01:36:23.449 --> 01:36:30.963
here now, nobody's done it, and,
 um, in fact, there is more, now

01:36:30.964 --> 01:36:37.092
 more than ever, they would say,
 the kind of journalism that is 

01:36:37.093 --> 01:36:41.594
practiced on the news hour is 
more needed now than ever 

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:45.047
before, because journalism on 
television has had its own 

01:36:45.048 --> 01:36:50.638
growth and its own kinds of, um,
 changes, and those changes have

01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:55.121
 been away from the kind of 
separation of straight reporting

01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:58.581
, from analysis, from opinion, 
that sort of thing, which is 

01:36:58.582 --> 01:37:03.238
still true of the news hour, but
 not true in some elements of 

01:37:03.239 --> 01:37:06.556
commercial television, 
particularly cable television, 

01:37:06.557 --> 01:37:12.141
and, so, the reason for our 
being, let's just cut to the 

01:37:12.142 --> 01:37:16.770
chase, the reason for our being 
is stronger now than it has ever

01:37:16.771 --> 01:37:18.771
 been

01:37:19.963 --> 01:37:22.133
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Good point.

01:37:22.134 --> 01:37:23.288
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We'll let that just
 sit  there, because I think 

01:37:23.289 --> 01:37:26.489
it's right.
(Applause.)

01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:27.669
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But Sharon, as 
somebody who has to look at this

01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:32.264
 both, you know, as you know 
journalists very well, but you 

01:37:32.265 --> 01:37:38.458
have to think about it as a 
manager, as an executive, how 

01:37:38.459 --> 01:37:40.762
hard has it been to keep news 
and public affairs going?  And 

01:37:40.763 --> 01:37:45.453
we should add, you oversee  The 
Ken Burns, it's not just The 

01:37:45.454 --> 01:37:50.083
News Hour and Washington Week, 
it's that show and many  others.

01:37:50.084 --> 01:37:51.240
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I think one 
of the things that's great about

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:54.748
 the public television audience 
is that it's pretty 

01:37:54.749 --> 01:37:59.367
well-educated.  Above all, it 
continues to want to learn.  So,

01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:04.036
 keeping up on a daily basis is 
important, but putting in 

01:38:04.037 --> 01:38:08.674
context weekly, as we do on 
Washington Week, is very 

01:38:08.675 --> 01:38:15.669
important, and  history, the 
arts, science, kids, all of the 

01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:20.297
rest means we serve so many 
different people in so many 

01:38:20.298 --> 01:38:23.739
different ways, but our 
signature is the news and public

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:28.331
 affairs.  It's the hardest to 
fund, and yet our membership 

01:38:28.332 --> 01:38:32.463
money essentially helps 
subsidize, although we raise a 

01:38:32.464 --> 01:38:35.889
lot for the news hour, we raise 
a good bit for Washington Week, 

01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:39.355
but we never make a  profit, 
let's put it that way, we always

01:38:40.503 --> 01:38:45.148
  reinvest in the product and 
could spend a lot more than we 

01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:48.120
take in.  I think it is our  
trademark, our signature.  We're

01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:52.205
 very proud of it, and I think 
our audience is proud to be 

01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:56.587
associated with what we do.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But it's always 

01:38:56.588 --> 01:39:00.075
been difficult to keep it 
funded.  Always.  We've never 

01:39:00.076 --> 01:39:03.522
had, we don't even, the word 
surplus doesn't even, it's not 

01:39:03.523 --> 01:39:10.464
even in our vocabulary.  We're 
always either over budget or 

01:39:10.465 --> 01:39:13.946
having to cut back, and that's 
been from day one, and I hate to

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:19.959
 say this, but, um, at the very 
beginning, when we first 

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.164
started, which was now 38 years 
ago, there was a commercial 

01:39:23.165 --> 01:39:28.784
television guy named Marvin 
Kalb, I ran into him socially, 

01:39:28.785 --> 01:39:29.937
we'd been on the air a year or 
two at that point, and I didn't 

01:39:29.938 --> 01:39:35.579
know Marvin  Kalb, and he said, 
yeah, well, you guys are doing 

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:39.044
things, but let me give you a 
warning, and I said, what's 

01:39:39.045 --> 01:39:42.504
that?  He said don't let them 
give you too much money, and I 

01:39:42.505 --> 01:39:47.964
said, that's not a problem, but 
just for the hell of it, tell

01:39:51.017 --> 01:39:53.949
 me why, and he told a quick 
story, and he had scads of them,

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:59.124
 but one in particular, um, CBS 
News,

01:40:02.287 --> 01:40:06.609
 he was going to do a minute and
 a half, it was going to be a 

01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:10.508
major story, they kept cutting 
it back, complainting cutting it

01:40:10.509 --> 01:40:15.172
 back, and a minute or two 
before air, they got some great 

01:40:15.173 --> 01:40:18.640
fire footage from downtown 
Little Rock.  Now, nobody was 

01:40:18.641 --> 01:40:23.439
hurt in the fire, just great 
pictures of fires, and they cut 

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.611
his report back to 20 seconds, 
and he said if they hadn't had 

01:40:27.612 --> 01:40:32.122
the money to buy that fire 
footage, I would have had my 

01:40:32.123 --> 01:40:36.800
minute and a half.  So, and it 
was, but it was, clearly, it 

01:40:36.801 --> 01:40:40.255
stuck in my mind, because I just
 told the story again, but it, 

01:40:40.256 --> 01:40:43.461
and McNeal always said that too,
 you know, if you get too fat 

01:40:43.462 --> 01:40:49.106
and sassy, you will, you'll do 
things that you will do, you'll 

01:40:49.107 --> 01:40:54.433
do things that you, that are not
 required.  This way, when 

01:40:54.434 --> 01:41:00.318
you're limited by money, it 
limits you to do what you must 

01:41:00.319 --> 01:41:02.634
rather than what you just kind 
of want to do.

01:41:02.635 --> 01:41:04.932
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, in radio, 
that's really not true, because 

01:41:04.933 --> 01:41:08.410
what we're doing is opening 
bureaus all over the place, and 

01:41:08.411 --> 01:41:14.143
when we're living in a world 
where what happens in sin tog 

01:41:14.144 --> 01:41:17.615
muSquare in Athens affects your 
401K, then you need to have more

01:41:18.805 --> 01:41:21.113
 international coverage rather 
than less, and of course, more 

01:41:21.114 --> 01:41:23.422
national  coverage, 
understanding what's going on in

01:41:23.423 --> 01:41:29.208
 this country, and, so, really, 
the money goes to those very 

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:33.651
expensive foreign bureaus, which
 are very, very difficult to do,

01:41:33.652 --> 01:41:39.304
 but I would argue it's 
essential in this time.  So, we 

01:41:39.305 --> 01:41:41.590
need all the money we can get.  
Thank you.

01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:43.866
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, it's probably

01:41:43.867 --> 01:41:48.390
 a story I shouldn't have told.
(Laughing.) speak

01:41:48.391 --> 01:41:51.848
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The one thing I 
would say is, um, that 

01:41:51.849 --> 01:41:56.498
corporations, in the early days,
 we went to AT&amp;T, etc., etc., we

01:41:56.499 --> 01:42:01.732
 got huge amounts of money in 
retrospect.  That has diminished

01:42:02.919 --> 01:42:08.457
 drastically, but foundations 
have really upped the ante, and 

01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:09.611
they understand, they're more 
visionary, they have a lot of 

01:42:09.612 --> 01:42:15.372
money now, and it's not that 
we've never had a surplus, but 

01:42:15.373 --> 01:42:18.859
foundations, and individuals, 
who support the program now, we 

01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:22.339
have, you know, you can give as 
an individual to support the PBS

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:25.803
 News Hour, which was never 
possible before, but we're doing

01:42:25.804 --> 01:42:30.288
 that in a membership kind of 
way.

01:42:30.289 --> 01:42:33.738
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Did the funding 
situation affect the work you 

01:42:33.739 --> 01:42:38.402
were able to do, do you think, 
in any way?  You, Dick.

01:42:38.403 --> 01:42:39.564
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I recognize my 
name.

01:42:39.565 --> 01:42:42.855
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Gee, I like fires.

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:44.856
(Laughing.)

01:42:50.049 --> 01:42:53.939
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, I was never 
thoughtful or thinking about 

01:42:53.940 --> 01:43:01.941
such things as funding.  That's 
a bad habit, sort of frame of 

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:04.262
mind for me, and I had to be 
urged every now and then to make

01:43:05.419 --> 01:43:10.105
 a phone call or make an effort 
or something like that, but I 

01:43:10.106 --> 01:43:13.582
was thinking of shows that I was
 able to do.  People said, oh, 

01:43:13.583 --> 01:43:18.230
you're going into public 
television now, that's for  

01:43:18.231 --> 01:43:21.694
intellectuals.  Intellectual is 
a very dangerous label to have 

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:25.197
put on you when you're in 
television, whether it's public 

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:33.177
or the other sort, but I 
remember appreciating the fact 

01:43:33.178 --> 01:43:36.610
that ABC would have gotten a 
little nervous when I would have

01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:42.434
 on England's great entertaining
 performer/actor/philosopher

01:43:43.578 --> 01:43:48.980
/teacher, Jonathan Miller, one 
of the greatest intellectuals in

01:43:48.981 --> 01:43:54.463
 captivity, and would have him 
on five nights in a row, and 

01:43:54.464 --> 01:43:57.598
people wanted more.  I can 
imagine trying to do that, um, 

01:43:57.599 --> 01:44:02.731
else where.  So, I really wasn't
 conscious of funding in ways 

01:44:02.732 --> 01:44:05.000
that probably were harmful to 
me, because I'm sure I might 

01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:09.595
have been able to help with it, 
if I had pitched in in certain 

01:44:09.596 --> 01:44:10.746
ways.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But did you feel 

01:44:10.747 --> 01:44:14.932
the freedom to do pretty much 
what you wanted when you were 

01:44:14.933 --> 01:44:20.621
working at PBS?  Interview the 
people you  wanted and do the 

01:44:20.622 --> 01:44:22.469
kind of programming you  wanted 
to do?

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:25.972
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Oh, I did.  Yes.  I
 usually just did the kind of 

01:44:25.973 --> 01:44:29.954
programming I wanted to  do, and
 I got away with it.  I'm not 

01:44:29.955 --> 01:44:33.461
aware of any particular gripes 
of the sort I was used to on ABC

01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:36.806
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, good.  We'll 

01:44:36.807 --> 01:44:38.807
take that.
(Laughing.)

01:44:39.946 --> 01:44:42.275
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Am I disgustingly 
happy?

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.593
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's good.

01:44:44.594 --> 01:44:48.089
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'm going to come 
back to  Hugo.  How do you see 

01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:51.151
this question of  resources?  
How much of an issue is it?  Are

01:44:51.152 --> 01:44:55.605
 you able to ignore it?  I mean,
 how does it affect what you're 

01:44:55.606 --> 01:44:57.606
able to do?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, first of all,

01:44:57.914 --> 01:45:00.217
 I want to say that it's really,
 really important that we 

01:45:00.218 --> 01:45:03.442
maintain that independence of 
public  broadcasting, whether it

01:45:03.443 --> 01:45:05.741
 be on radio or television.  
That's a value that we always 

01:45:05.742 --> 01:45:11.379
have shared and something we 
have to be careful about.  So, 

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.705
how do you build not just a  
station, but in this case, a 

01:45:14.896 --> 01:45:19.489
network?  We  have 60 
affiliates.  How do you build a 

01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:24.180
network when you're serving 
people with, literally, no 

01:45:24.181 --> 01:45:28.874
disposable income, right?  I 
mean, so, it's, you know, so, 

01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:34.732
part of it is the employees 
subsidize the service in part, 

01:45:34.733 --> 01:45:38.165
which spans the history of 
public television, public radio.

01:45:38.166 --> 01:45:41.620
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Subsidize how?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Lower salaries, for

01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:47.310
 example, for starters, and the 
other is to be able to keep 

01:45:47.311 --> 01:45:49.612
those employees, you know, 
that's a real, real challenge 

01:45:49.613 --> 01:45:54.232
for us.  Um, but the other is 
that, um, it's foundations that 

01:45:54.233 --> 01:45:58.818
have, we manage to attract, but,
 um, as the competition for that

01:45:59.976 --> 01:46:05.611
 has grown, our share of that 
has gone lower for public 

01:46:05.612 --> 01:46:07.958
affairs and for news and 
information from the foundation

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:16.454
ations.  So, it's really, really
 difficult for us, and, so, I 

01:46:16.455 --> 01:46:23.576
would say that for news 
information in Spanish, it's 

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:25.908
really difficult for us to 
maintain that.

01:46:25.909 --> 01:46:28.182
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, that leads to 
my last question.  How do you 

01:46:28.183 --> 01:46:30.545
see the future of news?  The 
future of public affairs in 

01:46:30.546 --> 01:46:33.439
radio and television.  Do you 
feel confident about it?  I 

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.738
mean, I like to feel very 
confident about it, because 

01:46:35.739 --> 01:46:40.346
wherever I go, I get, I hear 
good  things about The News 

01:46:40.347 --> 01:46:43.842
Hour, but what do you feel?  
What do you hear?

01:46:43.843 --> 01:46:47.259
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think that, um, 
one of the things that we're 

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:53.960
learning is that Congress 
actually likes NPR, and they 

01:46:53.961 --> 01:46:57.090
can't always say it out loud, 
but, um, the truth is is that, 

01:46:57.091 --> 01:47:01.462
um, it gets back to what Nick 
was saying earlier, they're all,

01:47:01.463 --> 01:47:03.793
 you know, they're on, and it's 
in all of their districts, and 

01:47:03.794 --> 01:47:08.942
it is the source of news, but, 
of course, the federal funding 

01:47:08.943 --> 01:47:14.804
is a tiny percentage of NPR 
money, it's really just for the 

01:47:14.805 --> 01:47:18.366
satellite, but the stations rely
 on it a lot, particularly the 

01:47:18.367 --> 01:47:24.936
small rural stations, and that's
 an important thing to keepin 

01:47:24.937 --> 01:47:28.260
mind, that these are people who 
really are desperate for this 

01:47:28.261 --> 01:47:32.716
kind of information, and 
sometimes, it's also the only, 

01:47:32.717 --> 01:47:36.192
um, emergency signal, you know, 
all of that, and, so, um, I 

01:47:36.193 --> 01:47:43.130
think that the fact of the 
service is so widespread and 

01:47:43.131 --> 01:47:48.713
diverse and so well listened to 
by people in all areas of 

01:47:48.714 --> 01:47:51.014
American life that I feel very 
confident about the future, but 

01:47:51.015 --> 01:47:54.511
I do think it requires resources
.

01:47:54.512 --> 01:47:56.812
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I was going to say 
that the last two years, the 

01:47:56.813 --> 01:48:00.321
last year and a half have proven
 more than ever the need for 

01:48:00.322 --> 01:48:08.143
what we do.  It is so complex, 
depressing to many, hopeful to 

01:48:08.144 --> 01:48:11.448
those who thought they were 
electing someone who would stand

01:48:11.449 --> 01:48:17.452
 for them, but the country is 
changing so fast, the political 

01:48:17.453 --> 01:48:22.752
system is  practically 
impossible to understand.  We, 

01:48:22.753 --> 01:48:24.753
despair being

01:48:26.474 --> 01:48:30.446
 despair being ungovernable, but
 who brings some sense and order

01:48:30.447 --> 01:48:33.429
 and rationale to what happened 
today and this week and this 

01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:39.154
year, plus analysis, plus 
thoughtful, complex, sensitive, 

01:48:39.155 --> 01:48:43.798
um, ideas about what might 
happen in the  future, we are 

01:48:43.799 --> 01:48:47.241
doing that in a way that nobody 
else is, and if we just stay 

01:48:47.242 --> 01:48:51.746
true to our mission, stick to 
the straight and narrow, I think

01:48:51.747 --> 01:48:55.173
 we've got a great future in 
news and public affairs.

01:48:55.174 --> 01:48:56.338
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I agree 100 
percent.

01:48:56.339 --> 01:48:58.339
(Applause.)

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.798
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Every one of us --

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:17.762
, I was just going to say amen 
and add a couple lines.  The 

01:49:17.763 --> 01:49:22.186
basic need for the free press 
was setup by the founders, and 

01:49:22.187 --> 01:49:26.784
the key to our Democratic 
society is an informed 

01:49:26.785 --> 01:49:31.380
electorate, an informed public. 
 The only device that the 

01:49:31.381 --> 01:49:37.278
founders created through the 
First Amendment was the free 

01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:38.943
press.  That's the device for 
people to get  information, to 

01:49:38.944 --> 01:49:45.453
cast and form votes, and all 
levels in government, and we 

01:49:45.454 --> 01:49:51.422
are, what we, public 
broadcasting, but we in 

01:49:51.423 --> 01:49:54.886
journalism, we who facilitate it
 and practice it and participate

01:49:54.887 --> 01:50:00.259
 in it at any level are part of 
a Democratic process that is 

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.581
particularly  critical right now
 with this explosion of 

01:50:02.582 --> 01:50:06.030
information that's coming out, 
with the tsunami of electronic 

01:50:06.031 --> 01:50:09.548
this and that gadget and this 
and all this stuff, this is a 

01:50:09.549 --> 01:50:16.980
critical time, and I agree with 
what Sharon said, we must not 

01:50:16.981 --> 01:50:19.936
lose sight of what our purpose 
is, and it isn't about making 

01:50:19.937 --> 01:50:25.763
people laugh, it isn't about 
people making, making them cry, 

01:50:25.764 --> 01:50:29.306
it's about  keeping them 
informed enough to function as 

01:50:29.307 --> 01:50:31.620
informed people in this country,
 informed citizens.

01:50:33.465 --> 01:50:35.465
(Applause.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.

01:50:37.614 --> 01:50:39.429
  Dick?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I, too, agree with 

01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:42.894
Sharon on that, particularly in 
this, um--

01:50:42.895 --> 01:50:46.265
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You don't agree 
with me?

01:50:46.266 --> 01:50:49.076
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'll get to you in 

01:50:49.077 --> 01:50:50.227
a minute.
(Laughing.)

01:50:50.228 --> 01:50:56.918
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, as we are all 
living in this seeming time of 

01:50:56.919 --> 01:51:02.540
plague, um, certainly, there has
 to be the service that only 

01:51:02.541 --> 01:51:07.575
public broadcasting can do so 
well and continue to be the 

01:51:07.576 --> 01:51:14.079
great garden of thrilling, 
varied, wonderful things that 

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:21.433
are not available else where on 
television.  They're still not  

01:51:21.434 --> 01:51:26.049
beholden, and they are, public 
television is still vital to our

01:51:27.205 --> 01:51:30.527
 lives.  Sounds corny, but I 
believe it.

01:51:30.528 --> 01:51:32.528
(Applause.)

01:51:35.713 --> 01:51:38.025
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If you're not 
optimistic, you can't speak.

01:51:38.026 --> 01:51:41.962
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I am, and I agree 

01:51:41.963 --> 01:51:46.615
with, um, these distinguished 
panelists, and in terms of, um, 

01:51:46.616 --> 01:51:52.337
Spanish language news and 
information, I think the need is

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:56.612
 there for basic information, 
along with, you know, news and 

01:51:56.613 --> 01:52:00.055
information to the Latino 
community, and I think the 

01:52:00.056 --> 01:52:04.794
future, um, for Spanish language
 media is to be able to 

01:52:04.795 --> 01:52:10.313
communicate that at forums, so 
thank you for the invitation, 

01:52:10.314 --> 01:52:12.619
um, of what the reality is and 
the need for that, because it's 

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.924
so critical, and, so, thank you 
very, very much.

01:52:14.925 --> 01:52:17.237
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So critical.  I 
just want to thank all of the 

01:52:17.238 --> 01:52:20.675
panelists, but I also want to 
quickly read a little bit of an 

01:52:20.676 --> 01:52:25.427
e-mail, um, we at The News Hour 
got yesterday from our 

01:52:25.428 --> 01:52:28.938
colleague, Jeff Brown, who had 
been  interviewing inmates at 

01:52:28.939 --> 01:52:33.552
San Quintin Prison for a story 
they're working on about a 

01:52:33.553 --> 01:52:35.881
podcast they're producing, which
 is going to appear, but what I 

01:52:35.882 --> 01:52:40.486
want to share with you is Jeff 
wrote all of us to say that 

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:43.795
several dozen inmates in 
different parts of the prison, 

01:52:43.796 --> 01:52:46.922
different  places, from 
different parts of the country, 

01:52:46.923 --> 01:52:48.921
came up to him and the crew 
while they were there to say, 

01:52:48.922 --> 01:52:56.931
hey, PBS, we don't know what we 
would do without PBS.

01:52:56.932 --> 01:52:58.932
(Laughing.)

01:53:03.090 --> 01:53:06.542
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  They went on to say
 how much the program means.  

01:53:06.543 --> 01:53:09.973
While Jeff is interviewing an 
inmate in one cell, they can 

01:53:09.974 --> 01:53:13.934
hear the program in the next 
cell being listened to, so I 

01:53:13.935 --> 01:53:18.578
just want to say that we are, we
 reach people in public media in

01:53:18.579 --> 01:53:20.891
 every corner of this  country. 
 We're not just in the intellec

01:53:23.052 --> 01:53:26.089
tual capitols and the political 
capitols and the places of great

01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:28.401
 wealth, we are in parts of the 
country where people are 

01:53:28.402 --> 01:53:31.836
struggling and trying to get 
their lives back together, and 

01:53:31.837 --> 01:53:35.280
those are the stories that we 
will always tell, along with all

01:53:35.281 --> 01:53:38.830
 the others.  So, what an 
amazing  panel.  Thank you.

01:53:38.831 --> 01:53:42.296
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If they were, some 
of those inmates were to, um, 

01:53:42.297 --> 01:53:48.185
join their local public 
broadcasts, it would be a 

01:53:48.186 --> 01:53:50.498
wonderful funding.
(Laughing.)

01:53:50.499 --> 01:53:52.818
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We thought about 
that.

01:53:52.819 --> 01:53:55.986
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I will tell you one
 quick story, because it gets to

01:53:55.987 --> 01:53:58.155
 the excellent point you just 
made.  At one point, when Susan 

01:53:59.325 --> 01:54:02.782
 Stanburg was the regular host 
of All Things  Considered, and 

01:54:02.783 --> 01:54:05.914
she took a leave to write a 
book, a farmer wrote to her and 

01:54:05.915 --> 01:54:08.207
said my cows won't give milk.
(Laughing.)

01:54:11.933 --> 01:54:15.431
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And he was always 
going into the milking barn and 

01:54:15.432 --> 01:54:17.766
turning on All Things  
Considered, and they heard Susan

01:54:18.928 --> 01:54:21.083
 and gave milk.
(Laughing.)

01:54:21.084 --> 01:54:22.228
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And without Susan, 
no milk.

01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:24.229
(Laughing.)

01:54:25.426 --> 01:54:27.420
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Okay.  We've heard 
it.

01:54:27.421 --> 01:54:29.421
(Applause.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you all.

01:54:37.608 --> 01:54:39.425
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you, 
everybody, and thank you to the 

01:54:39.426 --> 01:54:41.426
panels.  We're going to take a 
short

01:54:43.939 --> 01:54:48.005
 break now.  However, we hope 
you will stay to watch some of 

01:54:43.939 --> 01:54:46.234
the clips we've put together to 
wrap-up this previous panel and 

01:54:46.235 --> 01:54:51.832
launch the next panel, which is 
documentary, style, and use of 

01:54:51.833 --> 01:54:55.289
archives, which will begin at 
4:00 o'clock.  Thank you.

02:04:12.379 --> 02:04:14.379
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If everyone

02:04:15.444 --> 02:04:18.921
 could get to their seats and 
settle down so we can start the 

02:04:18.922 --> 02:04:20.922
next session

02:04:44.173 --> 02:04:49.850
.  If everybody could take their
 seats so we could get started.

02:05:55.376 --> 02:05:58.880
  Could everyone get seated, 
please?

02:06:27.174 --> 02:06:30.588
  There are more seats upfront 
now, since some of the speakers 

02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:32.764
have left, if people want to 
fill in

02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:48.542
.  We're going to get started 
now, so if people could sit  

02:06:48.543 --> 02:06:51.562
down.  We're not on as tight of 
a schedule, because Judy is 

02:06:51.563 --> 02:06:55.278
going to make it to The News  
Hour, but we would still like to

02:06:55.279 --> 02:06:57.279
 keep the time.

02:07:11.687 --> 02:07:15.145
  Our next panel is called 
documentaries:  Style and the 

02:07:15.146 --> 02:07:20.780
use of archives, and Pat 
Aufderheide will moderate.  She 

02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:24.255
is a communications professor at
 American University in 

02:07:24.256 --> 02:07:26.769
Washington, DC.  She founded the
 school center for media and 

02:07:26.770 --> 02:07:31.258
social impact.  Her books 
include  Reclaiming Fair Use, 

02:07:31.259 --> 02:07:38.199
How to Put Balance Back In  
Copyright.  She coordinates the 

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:43.769
free speech --  Pat, take it 
away.

02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:44.926
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  What a great 
pleasure it is.  I feel like my 

02:07:44.927 --> 02:07:50.408
entire life is passing before me
 as I look around the crowd, but

02:07:50.409 --> 02:07:56.026
 this, to be on a panel with 
these people is really 

02:07:56.027 --> 02:08:03.906
extraordinary.  Um, each of the 
people here has been able to not

02:08:03.907 --> 02:08:07.357
 merely make great documentary, 
but create a future for a 

02:08:07.358 --> 02:08:10.796
different kind of documentary 
than was ever possible on any 

02:08:10.797 --> 02:08:18.895
other kind of television to be 
made, and each of them has, um, 

02:08:18.896 --> 02:08:24.037
has contributed differently to 
doing that, and also, in some 

02:08:24.038 --> 02:08:28.644
cases, supporting each other, 
which is really, um, I don't 

02:08:28.645 --> 02:08:30.927
know if I'm giving away secrets 
here, but that doesn't always 

02:08:30.928 --> 02:08:34.399
happen in public television.
(Laughing.)

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.702
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Anyway, um, and 
I've had the pleasure of working

02:08:37.869 --> 02:08:42.309
 with some of these people as 
well, because, um, as Karen 

02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:47.574
mentioned, over the last decade,
 Peter and I have been working 

02:08:47.575 --> 02:08:49.893
with different organizations to 
make fair use more available, 

02:08:49.894 --> 02:08:56.823
particularly in archival ways, 
to, um, to makers and public TV 

02:08:56.824 --> 02:09:00.297
broadcasters, including some of 
these people have really  been, 

02:09:00.298 --> 02:09:04.820
um, incredibly supportive and 
early  adopters in being able to

02:09:04.821 --> 02:09:11.624
 make, um, better use of 
material, third-party material 

02:09:11.625 --> 02:09:15.096
to tell America's story in so 
many different ways.  I want to 

02:09:15.097 --> 02:09:18.549
start, first, with Clayborne 
Carson.  So, Clayborne Carson is

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:22.016
 the founder, director of the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Research

02:09:22.017 --> 02:09:27.801
 and  Education Institute.  He, 
um, was the senior advisor for 

02:09:27.802 --> 02:09:34.510
Eyes On The Prize at a time when
 no one thought it could be made

02:09:37.667 --> 02:09:41.107
.  I would like to ask each of 
you, starting with Clayborne, to

02:09:42.236 --> 02:09:47.895
 talk about what did you have in
 mind for these series, each of 

02:09:47.896 --> 02:09:52.354
you have this experience, of 
these series that ended up 

02:09:52.355 --> 02:09:54.661
really providing a template for 
how to do things in the future 

02:09:54.662 --> 02:09:56.662
for

02:09:57.845 --> 02:10:01.315
 film makers that really hadn't 
been done.

02:10:01.316 --> 02:10:03.604
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  To start out, one 
of the things that's so 

02:10:03.605 --> 02:10:05.918
interesting, to listen to the 
previous panel, is that, um, you

02:10:05.919 --> 02:10:10.529
 know, just yesterday, I was 
lecturing at Stanford to my 

02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:13.965
students who were born well 
after all this had happened, 

02:10:13.966 --> 02:10:17.548
and, um, I think that they were 
 telling me about a period 

02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:23.401
before I came on the scene, so I
 suddenly felt younger, in the 

02:10:23.402 --> 02:10:29.567
sense that when, um, I was, I 
got a call from Henry  Hampton, 

02:10:29.568 --> 02:10:34.178
who should be here.  He,  
unfortunately, passed away, died

02:10:34.179 --> 02:10:38.673
 way too early, but he was the 
visionary

02:10:42.872 --> 02:10:46.356
, and I had just  accepted an 
invitation to edit Martin Luther

02:10:46.357 --> 02:10:48.662
 King's papers, so it wasn't

02:10:52.429 --> 02:10:55.251
 like I was looking for work.  I
 realized that this was going to

02:10:55.252 --> 02:10:58.608
 take decades, and it has taken 
decades, to edit and publish his

02:10:58.609 --> 02:11:05.415
 papers, but what he was, he 
talked about his idea for a 

02:11:05.416 --> 02:11:09.626
series, and I think one of the 
themes that I see running 

02:11:09.627 --> 02:11:13.741
through all the discussions this
 afternoon is about democrat

02:11:15.914 --> 02:11:20.421
ization of information and the 
interpretation of history

02:11:23.577 --> 02:11:26.585
, of the way in which, if you 
think back to the days before 

02:11:26.586 --> 02:11:33.704
PBS, before NPR, before the 
modern documentary  style, most 

02:11:33.705 --> 02:11:40.213
information about the past came 
from a few sources.  If you saw 

02:11:40.214 --> 02:11:47.886
a documentary, it was usually 
made by a, well, they didn't 

02:11:47.887 --> 02:11:51.350
have large-scale documentaries 
made by anything other than 

02:11:51.351 --> 02:11:55.963
large corporations.  A lot of 
them, things like CBS Reports, 

02:11:55.964 --> 02:12:00.434
things like that, they were done
 by the commercial networks, and

02:12:00.435 --> 02:12:05.057
 what he was proposing was to do
 something very  radical, and 

02:12:05.058 --> 02:12:08.382
that is to get away from the 
notion of history as a master 

02:12:08.383 --> 02:12:15.104
narrative told by a handful of 
people and written in textbooks 

02:12:15.105 --> 02:12:19.616
andbooks, and everyone kind of 
took that as  authoritative.  

02:12:19.617 --> 02:12:24.105
One of the first things he said 
is there's not going to be any 

02:12:24.106 --> 02:12:29.888
what we now call talking heads 
in Eyes On The Prize, that our 

02:12:29.889 --> 02:12:34.468
job was not to come there and 
pontif Kate, and, you know, the 

02:12:34.469 --> 02:12:38.743
four of us who were the senior 
advisors were all really young, 

02:12:38.744 --> 02:12:42.058
and I don't think we would have 
welcomed that role in the first 

02:12:42.059 --> 02:12:50.700
place, but what our job was, to 
go and find how history was made

02:12:50.701 --> 02:12:52.949
 during the nineteen 60s, fifty 
and

02:12:56.115 --> 02:12:59.552
 fifty and 60s, and to go to the
 sources and find those people 

02:12:59.553 --> 02:13:03.062
and let them tell the story of 
how they made history, not to 

02:13:03.063 --> 02:13:05.063
interpret it

02:13:07.402 --> 02:13:08.652
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That was a 

02:13:08.653 --> 02:13:10.991
breakthrough.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes, because even 

02:13:10.992 --> 02:13:12.992
now, when you look at 
documentaries, you see that many

02:13:13.328 --> 02:13:19.191
 of them kind of go back to that
 notion, by having the 

02:13:19.192 --> 02:13:22.063
authoritative historian kind of 
give this interpretation that's 

02:13:22.064 --> 02:13:27.695
going to guide you through, but 
there's this other story of 

02:13:27.696 --> 02:13:30.923
these ordinary people who make 
history

02:13:34.088 --> 02:13:38.665
, and the real joy of doing it 
was that for us, as historians, 

02:13:38.666 --> 02:13:42.888
we were in our own work, you 
know, my first book was on the 

02:13:42.889 --> 02:13:45.206
student on violent coordinating 
committee, which was not about 

02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:50.943
King, it was kind of the 
counter-King story.  So, I 

02:13:50.944 --> 02:13:53.249
welcome that kind of an 
approach, and I think that that 

02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:57.872
has influenced the documentaries
 that have been made since then

02:14:01.247 --> 02:14:04.831
, that many of them do take up 
that mantle of allowing ordinary

02:14:05.984 --> 02:14:08.287
 people to tell the story of 
making history.

02:14:08.288 --> 02:14:11.731
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  From what you're 
telling me as well, not that, 

02:14:11.732 --> 02:14:15.004
so, one characteristic, this is 
ordinary people telling this 

02:14:15.005 --> 02:14:19.622
story, and  also, in an oral 
history way.  I mean, there was 

02:14:19.623 --> 02:14:23.092
so much rich oral history that 
had not, that would have escaped

02:14:24.238 --> 02:14:26.552
 us forever.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And now it's

02:14:29.739 --> 02:14:31.739
 interesting, because I can go 
into

02:14:32.934 --> 02:14:37.412
 my classroom and use those, um,
 interviews.  I rarely use Eyes 

02:14:39.565 --> 02:14:44.067
On  The Prize, but I use the 
interviews we did, and often, 

02:14:44.068 --> 02:14:47.557
that works so much better in the
 sense that it'll, I get it to 

02:14:47.558 --> 02:14:51.039
the point where it fits what I 
want to talk about.  If I want 

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.198
to talk about

02:14:56.373 --> 02:14:59.855
 Karetta Scott King, for 
example, there's this wonderful 

02:14:59.856 --> 02:15:05.702
extended interview we did with 
her, where maybe we used, at 

02:15:05.703 --> 02:15:10.258
most, 5 minutes of it, and I 
find that my students are so 

02:15:10.259 --> 02:15:15.894
drawn to just seeing her talk 
about ordinary things, you 

02:15:15.895 --> 02:15:17.895
knowerse

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:23.400
 you know, what was it like 
talking to the President of the 

02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:25.401
United States when

02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:28.441
 your husband is in jail, and 
you've never spoken to him 

02:15:28.442 --> 02:15:32.431
before, and he calls on the 
phone, and your young son 

02:15:32.432 --> 02:15:37.420
answers the phone and starts 
babbling away, and you have to 

02:15:37.421 --> 02:15:40.898
kind of get him off and say the 
President's there, and, um, you 

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:44.380
know, that kind of a story is 
going to get through and stick 

02:15:44.381 --> 02:15:49.999
in the minds of students far 
more than simply me giving a 

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.334
lecture about Martin Luther King
, going to jail and writing the 

02:15:53.335 --> 02:15:56.465
letter from Birmingham jail.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Something else I 

02:15:56.466 --> 02:15:59.964
think was so important about 
eyes on the prize in terms of 

02:15:59.965 --> 02:16:06.430
standard-setting was really 
arguing that every single image 

02:16:06.431 --> 02:16:10.923
had to be exactly what you 
claimed it was.  It couldn't be,

02:16:10.924 --> 02:16:13.208
 like, something that looked 
sort of like that, which was 

02:16:13.209 --> 02:16:18.854
very common common.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  There was no

02:16:18.855 --> 02:16:22.347
 reconstruction.  We had to, and
 in fact, that was when, there's

02:16:22.348 --> 02:16:29.281
 a story, actually, that kind of
 illustrates that.  We were 

02:16:29.282 --> 02:16:36.038
interviewing Ralph Abernathy 
about the March on Washington, 

02:16:36.039 --> 02:16:40.738
and he told this wonderful story
 about coming back after that 

02:16:40.739 --> 02:16:43.754
day at the march, I was there 
too

02:16:46.996 --> 02:16:50.062
, and it had particular meaning 
when he  talked about coming 

02:16:50.063 --> 02:16:53.899
back after all the people had 
departed, and in the evening, 

02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:58.510
seeing the rustling of the 
papers and all the leftover 

02:16:58.511 --> 02:17:00.811
things, and then he says, you 
know, it was just the most 

02:17:00.812 --> 02:17:07.463
beautiful day of my entire life,
 and I remember David Garro, um,

02:17:08.606 --> 02:17:15.385
 kind of saying but it couldn't 
have happened that way.  Why?  

02:17:15.386 --> 02:17:19.851
Because we know where Ralph 
Abernathy was every moment of 

02:17:19.852 --> 02:17:24.608
that day.  So, we had this 
debate about whether to trust 

02:17:24.609 --> 02:17:31.835
his recollection as opposed to 
our historical reconstruction, 

02:17:31.836 --> 02:17:37.637
and, um, we decided to use it.  
We said history might not have 

02:17:37.638 --> 02:17:39.946
happened that way, maybe it 
should have.

02:17:39.947 --> 02:17:41.947
(Laughing.)

02:17:48.148 --> 02:17:51.686
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Let me jump to 
David, if you don't mind, who I 

02:17:51.687 --> 02:17:55.176
remember when he was the brash, 
young Australian

02:17:58.348 --> 02:18:00.348
.  South Africa, sorry

02:18:02.681 --> 02:18:05.011
.  Us Americans, what's the 
difference?

02:18:05.012 --> 02:18:06.174
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Here to bring us a 

02:18:06.175 --> 02:18:10.586
whole new, um, format that was 
possibly too challenging for 

02:18:10.587 --> 02:18:15.080
public television.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You know, I'm a 

02:18:15.081 --> 02:18:18.561
creature of, I'm a baby of 
public television.  I walked 

02:18:18.562 --> 02:18:26.588
into a television station in 
1973 in Huntington Beach, and I 

02:18:26.589 --> 02:18:31.237
walked in and volunteered, got 
my hands on the tools, that 

02:18:31.238 --> 02:18:34.684
camera that was there and began 
working there.  Peter McGuire

02:18:38.238 --> 02:18:43.242
 McGhee found me there in 1977 
and brought me to start a 

02:18:43.243 --> 02:18:45.397
series, and the idea was to do a
 series about the world as 

02:18:45.398 --> 02:18:54.297
others see it, and I came to 
WBGH to find a place that was 

02:18:54.298 --> 02:18:56.613
this extraordinary institution 
that was dedicated to ideas, and

02:18:56.614 --> 02:19:00.132
 I had never been around 
anything quite like it.  It was 

02:19:00.133 --> 02:19:02.459
also that each of the people 
that were working in the 

02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:08.217
different genres, from signs to 
history to, um, even Julia 

02:19:08.218 --> 02:19:12.789
Child, who was in the back 
corner of our offices, um, were 

02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:16.261
doing things because of, um, 
they cared about the ideas,  

02:19:16.262 --> 02:19:20.835
and, um, it was an extraordinary
 privilege, and it is to this 

02:19:20.836 --> 02:19:25.320
day, this amazing privilege.  
The reason there's a Frontline 

02:19:25.321 --> 02:19:29.909
is because we were trusted with 
enough resources for long enough

02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:34.500
 to work it out, to try to 
figure out how to do the best 

02:19:34.501 --> 02:19:37.956
work, and the privilege of being
 able to give them that resource

02:19:37.957 --> 02:19:40.249
 and to say how are you going to
 spend it and justify it, and if

02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:43.712
 you can't make the best film 
you could make about the 

02:19:43.713 --> 02:19:46.894
subject, then don't make it, and
 it was as simple as that.  It 

02:19:46.895 --> 02:19:50.908
wasn't me, it was all the 
talented people that I could go 

02:19:50.909 --> 02:19:55.459
out and bring to public 
television.  I tried that out.  

02:19:55.460 --> 02:20:01.199
We did 60 films along the way, 
but there was a moment when I 

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.528
sat in a meeting at the  
Corporation of Public 

02:20:03.529 --> 02:20:06.460
Broadcasting, with a man who 
must be remembered, Lewis 

02:20:07.603 --> 02:20:13.347
Freedman was then the head of, 
um, of programming, and he had 

02:20:13.348 --> 02:20:17.958
walked into it, and he said he 
was inenidated with thousands of

02:20:17.959 --> 02:20:20.279
 proposals, and he just couldn't
 sort through it all, and he 

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:23.760
made a decision to do three big 
strands.  One was going to be 

02:20:23.761 --> 02:20:26.068
drama, and it became American  
Playhouse.  The second was 

02:20:26.069 --> 02:20:31.821
Children's, and it became 
Wonder-works, and the third was 

02:20:31.822 --> 02:20:35.121
a news and documentary idea, and
 I walked in looking for a 

02:20:35.122 --> 02:20:38.580
little bit of funding to do 
eight shows for the next 

02:20:38.581 --> 02:20:43.196
seasons, and he made me sit down
 at his table with a sandwich 

02:20:43.197 --> 02:20:46.423
and figure out what the budget 
for a 26-week series would look 

02:20:46.424 --> 02:20:49.892
like, and we counted it up to $3
 million at the time in

02:20:55.153 --> 02:20:57.463
 1981, and we came up with that 
figure and said, well, we could 

02:20:57.464 --> 02:20:59.809
probably do it for that much 
money, and he said, great, I'm 

02:20:59.810 --> 02:21:04.382
going to put out a request for 
proposals, and he put out a 

02:21:04.383 --> 02:21:11.421
proposal to various people, and 
we proposed it and got the 

02:21:11.422 --> 02:21:13.903
money, and the guarantee was 
that we would have the money for

02:21:15.042 --> 02:21:18.510
 three years, if we could 
persuade the stations to match 

02:21:18.511 --> 02:21:20.820
the money progressively over the
 course of the three years.  It 

02:21:20.821 --> 02:21:25.451
was a visionary idea, and it 
left us the freedom to do that, 

02:21:25.452 --> 02:21:32.234
and we made our mistakes, and 
we, you know, bumped our heads, 

02:21:32.235 --> 02:21:36.863
and we did some good things and 
found some smart people, and 

02:21:36.864 --> 02:21:42.734
slowly, this idea grew.  So, to 
Lewis, to Peter McGhee, who 

02:21:42.735 --> 02:21:45.054
found me on the beach and 
brought me to Boston, you know, 

02:21:45.055 --> 02:21:47.359
are the people I thank for 
Frontline.  That's what made it 

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:52.916
happen, and, um, it really has 
been, um, as simple as that and 

02:21:52.917 --> 02:21:56.416
as  complicated as that.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Although Frontline 

02:21:56.417 --> 02:21:58.417
has

02:21:59.426 --> 02:22:01.757
, it developed almost a brand, 
that you really did put your 

02:22:01.758 --> 02:22:04.065
stamp on a kind of documentary 
--

02:22:04.066 --> 02:22:07.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But I'd like to say
 that the films were very, well,

02:22:07.551 --> 02:22:10.404
 I don't know, see, I think 
there were lots and lots of 

02:22:10.405 --> 02:22:13.542
different styles of films within
 them.  They were observational 

02:22:13.543 --> 02:22:19.757
films, investigative films, they
 were, um, films like, um, you 

02:22:19.758 --> 02:22:21.758
know,

02:22:26.239 --> 02:22:28.549
 there were extraordinarily 
different films that came  

02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:32.083
about, and I always thought that
 we needed to make the series 

02:22:32.084 --> 02:22:35.537
that young and older producers, 
reporters, and film makers would

02:22:35.538 --> 02:22:40.227
 look at and say I can learn 
from that, and the people would 

02:22:40.228 --> 02:22:43.709
come to me and say how do you 
make these films, I'd like to 

02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:46.041
get into documentaries, I'd say 
just watch a lot of them and try

02:22:46.042 --> 02:22:48.364
 to deconstruct them and look 
for the different ones that suit

02:22:48.365 --> 02:22:51.798
 you for who you are and the 
kind of film you make, because 

02:22:51.799 --> 02:22:55.244
ultimately, these are works of 
authorship, and if you encourage

02:22:55.245 --> 02:22:58.830
 authors and then encourage them
 because they do good work by 

02:22:58.831 --> 02:23:01.138
giving them another film to 
make, then you begin to build a 

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:06.883
body of work over time.  
Frontline has, initially, we, 

02:23:06.884 --> 02:23:12.491
um, you know, Judy was anchoring
 the series after Jessica  

02:23:12.492 --> 02:23:15.948
Sabage, but at a certain point, 
we felt like, um, we would sort 

02:23:15.949 --> 02:23:23.214
of take the extra time, and we 
began to use Will Limen as a 

02:23:23.215 --> 02:23:25.542
voice, and we made that 
strategic decision, that there 

02:23:25.543 --> 02:23:27.865
would be something in the 
quality of the words, or the 

02:23:27.866 --> 02:23:30.194
quality of the story-telling 
that would say that's that 

02:23:30.195 --> 02:23:33.726
different thing, that's that 
show, and, so, there was a value

02:23:34.897 --> 02:23:37.237
 to that.  There were people who
 questioned that Will is kind of

02:23:38.394 --> 02:23:43.016
  old-fashioned and, um, the 
patriarchy and all kinds of 

02:23:43.017 --> 02:23:45.331
reasons that people would say we
 should be using other voices, 

02:23:45.332 --> 02:23:48.827
and we do, but ultimately, you 
needed to have some kind of 

02:23:48.828 --> 02:23:52.331
connective tissue at times that 
would hold the string through 

02:23:52.332 --> 02:23:55.848
the sets of films.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, you're arguing 

02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:58.131
if you could have some of these 
marking features, then you could

02:23:58.132 --> 02:24:03.914
 have a lot more freedom, 
artistic freedom in other areas.

02:24:03.915 --> 02:24:07.567
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, but something
 other than an anthology series,

02:24:07.568 --> 02:24:10.980
 and the most important thing 
about it was it was going to be 

02:24:10.981 --> 02:24:13.319
a work of journalism, not an 
anthology series made by 

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.651
independent film makers who 
would come to us with

02:24:18.812 --> 02:24:22.330
 films pretty much made, we 
would initiate and subject them 

02:24:22.331 --> 02:24:25.788
to the an editorial process, 
which meant that the journalism 

02:24:25.789 --> 02:24:28.084
had to be transparent, and we 
needed to be, go right deep into

02:24:28.085 --> 02:24:32.245
 it at any point and be able to 
understand the source materials 

02:24:32.246 --> 02:24:35.721
inside that film, and that was 
at the heart of Frontline.

02:24:35.722 --> 02:24:36.851
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Margaret wants to 
--

02:24:36.852 --> 02:24:38.852
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Margaret

02:24:41.064 --> 02:24:44.537
I also wanted to add that there 
is another binding agent in 

02:24:44.538 --> 02:24:48.063
Frontline, and when I came here,
 I discovered this, because I 

02:24:48.064 --> 02:24:51.548
had come from CBS, where I 
worked at CBS Reports and then a

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:56.187
 couple of iterations of 
magazine shows, and, um, CBS 

02:24:56.188 --> 02:25:00.820
Reports closed, shut down, 
because, um, TV Guide, you 

02:25:00.821 --> 02:25:04.291
remember TV Guide?  An artifact 
of the past.  They ran a 

02:25:04.292 --> 02:25:07.735
front-page story, I mean a cover
 story saying the documentary is

02:25:07.736 --> 02:25:09.736
 dead, and this was in

02:25:12.029 --> 02:25:14.371
 1985.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's when 

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:16.671
documentary was still a bad 
word.

02:25:16.672 --> 02:25:18.965
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  So, 
everybody went scurrying, and I 

02:25:18.966 --> 02:25:23.599
got a great job offer from Peter
 McGhee, who really needs to be 

02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:27.730
mentioned as many times as 
possible, because he sort of set

02:25:29.063 --> 02:25:37.226
 the standards at WGBH, and, um,
 they  wanted, Peter and, Judy 

02:25:37.227 --> 02:25:39.755
Kriten was the original 
executive producer, they wanted 

02:25:39.756 --> 02:25:43.253
to do a history series, but the 
binding agent in the history 

02:25:43.254 --> 02:25:45.254
series

02:25:46.455 --> 02:25:47.612
 was good story-telling.  It had
 to have a beginning, a middle, 

02:25:47.613 --> 02:25:51.187
and an end.  Narrative, 
narrative, narrative.  We even 

02:25:51.188 --> 02:25:53.338
constructed the documentaries

02:25:56.491 --> 02:25:58.801
 an ax, which was something that
 most had not been doing.  They 

02:25:58.802 --> 02:26:02.246
had, um, on commercial 
television, you had a lot of 

02:26:02.247 --> 02:26:06.948
documentaries that were, like, 
NBC White Paper and ABC, I 

02:26:06.949 --> 02:26:10.418
forget what that series was 
called, and they were surveys.  

02:26:10.419 --> 02:26:13.387
They were mostly  surveys from 
the top-down, they weren't  

02:26:13.388 --> 02:26:14.535
stories, they weren't actual 
stories, where you had 

02:26:14.536 --> 02:26:20.302
characters that you could follow
, and I think, um, that was an 

02:26:20.303 --> 02:26:24.955
element that was emphasized at 
GBH, and in particular, I know 

02:26:24.956 --> 02:26:29.392
at American Experience, because 
as we were talking before, you 

02:26:29.393 --> 02:26:31.725
want to hear from as many people
 as possible who are as close to

02:26:32.954 --> 02:26:36.247
 the subject as possible and 
that construct it very carefully

02:26:36.248 --> 02:26:40.734
 to have a story arc, what 
happened, then what happened 

02:26:40.735 --> 02:26:46.091
next, what happened after that.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, let's point out

02:26:46.092 --> 02:26:51.727
 then that public television is 
the real innovator of this 

02:26:51.728 --> 02:26:55.178
character-driven story model 
that now is standard expectation

02:26:55.179 --> 02:26:57.476
 for documentary.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, I think so, 

02:26:57.477 --> 02:26:59.786
because, I mean, I don't want to
 take the credit for it, because

02:26:59.787 --> 02:27:03.286
 it was, I didn't invent the 
narrative style, um, but it was 

02:27:03.287 --> 02:27:07.944
something that was embraced 
whole-heartedly by WGBH, and 

02:27:07.945 --> 02:27:10.293
they gave all of us the 
resources to figure it out, 

02:27:10.294 --> 02:27:12.623
because when you tell, when 
you're in the process of telling

02:27:12.624 --> 02:27:14.951
 a story, you need time to 
figure out what the story is, 

02:27:14.952 --> 02:27:19.062
who the main characters are, who
 the secondary characters are, 

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:22.510
where the break is, what's going
 to happen next, how to conclude

02:27:22.511 --> 02:27:28.203
 it, and without being, um, you 
don't have to tell the entire 

02:27:28.204 --> 02:27:30.801
story, because everybody used to
 agonize about what's left out. 

02:27:30.802 --> 02:27:33.082
 Well, if you did your job 
properly, no one would even 

02:27:33.083 --> 02:27:37.521
notice notice that you left 
anything out.  Our

02:27:41.673 --> 02:27:45.136
 philosophy was just go narrow 
and go deep.  I did want to 

02:27:45.137 --> 02:27:47.466
comment on something you said 
before about getting first-hand 

02:27:47.467 --> 02:27:52.059
witnesses, because I admired 
that in, um, Henry Hampton's 

02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:55.504
shop and Eyes on the Prize, and 
I thought it was terrific.  We 

02:27:55.505 --> 02:28:00.135
had a challenge, because our 
mandate was to tell all American

02:28:01.292 --> 02:28:08.092
 history, you know, go back in 
the 17th and 18th century, and 

02:28:08.093 --> 02:28:12.521
we were terrified.  We avoided 
anything that was pre-archival 

02:28:12.522 --> 02:28:15.954
at the beginning, and you can't 
find witnesses who were, one of 

02:28:15.955 --> 02:28:22.755
our first shows was on the 1906 
San Francisco earthquake.  We 

02:28:22.756 --> 02:28:25.027
barely got a couple of people to
 make an appearance, and as soon

02:28:26.155 --> 02:28:30.377
 as we found them, we shot them 
immediately, you know, and put 

02:28:30.378 --> 02:28:32.421
them in the bank, because we 
didn't even know we were going 

02:28:32.422 --> 02:28:36.395
to go ahead with this story, but
 it was a real stretch for us, 

02:28:36.396 --> 02:28:40.703
and we had to challenge 
ourselves to go back into the 

02:28:40.704 --> 02:28:45.373
19th century and even back into 
the revolutionary period, so 

02:28:45.374 --> 02:28:48.839
what we relied on, since we're 
here to talk about the archives,

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:52.298
 is letters,  diaries, 
first-hand accounts that could 

02:28:52.299 --> 02:28:57.948
then be employed in many 
different ways to recall, maybe 

02:28:57.949 --> 02:29:02.416
it was the Donner Party, I mean,
 you  know, there's no 

02:29:02.417 --> 02:29:08.174
first-hand witnesses there, one 
of our most suck esful films, 

02:29:08.175 --> 02:29:11.702
and what did we rely on?  
Diaries and letters.

02:29:11.703 --> 02:29:17.347
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, one of the 
things that is so, um, I think 

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:21.953
impressive about what both of 
your series, and all of your 

02:29:21.954 --> 02:29:26.586
work in  documentaries did was 
to, I think, create a sense of 

02:29:26.587 --> 02:29:28.912
trust among the stations, for 
something that they had dreaded 

02:29:28.913 --> 02:29:33.531
and feared ever since the days 
of NET, which was before there 

02:29:33.532 --> 02:29:41.479
was a PBS and, you know, shows 
like the  red-lining show, so 

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:47.244
you sort of created, um, a sense
 of quality, dignity, 

02:29:47.245 --> 02:29:50.694
reliability,  turn-key and so on
.  Something else that is 

02:29:50.695 --> 02:29:56.406
actually really interesting to 
me is that public television, in

02:29:56.407 --> 02:30:01.030
 building upon that, has been 
able to actually foster a kind 

02:30:01.031 --> 02:30:09.138
of, um, and as you describe it, 
anthology show for independent 

02:30:09.139 --> 02:30:14.756
voices as well, and impressively
, I have to say thank you to 

02:30:14.757 --> 02:30:17.063
David Fanning for being so 
supportive of anthology shows, 

02:30:17.064 --> 02:30:19.064
as well as, um,

02:30:21.397 --> 02:30:27.165
 these executive-produced 
journalism series, and Steven 

02:30:27.166 --> 02:30:29.460
Gong, one of the minority

02:30:34.731 --> 02:30:36.731
 consortia of

02:30:39.907 --> 02:30:43.052
 PPB, has also been involved in,
 um, creating archives that we 

02:30:43.053 --> 02:30:48.187
can all draw on.  So, I'd love 
to hear you talk a little bit 

02:30:48.188 --> 02:30:53.394
about the, um, film-making that 
goes to fuel the two big 

02:30:53.395 --> 02:30:55.395
anthology series, POV and

02:30:56.562 --> 02:30:58.562
 independent lens

02:31:01.748 --> 02:31:03.681
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Actually, if I 

02:31:01.748 --> 02:31:05.241
could, I'd like to make a 
reference to the panels we heard

02:31:05.242 --> 02:31:10.899
 earlier, because the seeds of 
the minority consortia, 

02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:14.346
independent and diverse film
-makers really goes back to the 

02:31:14.347 --> 02:31:16.682
same era of the great society, 
so many of these entities were 

02:31:16.683 --> 02:31:21.329
founded in the 70s, and it came 
out of both Civil  Rights, and 

02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:28.092
in many of our cases, Moralis  
touched on this also, of the 

02:31:28.093 --> 02:31:30.419
rapidly-changing demographics of
 the country, which was starting

02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:35.054
 to be recognized even then.  
You know, the  Immigration Act 

02:31:35.055 --> 02:31:39.520
was rewritten in 1965,and even 
though it would take the rest of

02:31:40.655 --> 02:31:42.970
 the  generation, it has 
reshaped America.  So, in this 

02:31:42.971 --> 02:31:47.619
time period I'm talking about, 
the  Asian-American community 

02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:51.093
went from 1 percent of the 
population, and now we're 6 

02:31:51.094 --> 02:31:56.418
percent,  over 20 million, and 
it's growing, and he mentioned 

02:31:56.419 --> 02:31:59.756
the statistics for the Latino 
community.  So, the premise that

02:31:59.757 --> 02:32:05.399
 we all had as this whole 
enterprise was getting underway 

02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:09.902
was where were these voices of 
other communities for whom our 

02:32:09.903 --> 02:32:13.338
presence in media overall was an
 absence or was one of stereo

02:32:15.505 --> 02:32:20.322
types.  So, for Asian-Americans,
 in entertainment media, we are 

02:32:20.323 --> 02:32:23.772
only, you know, the villains in 
war movies, or we're house boys 

02:32:23.773 --> 02:32:28.392
or gangsters in Chinatown or 
laundrymen, and, um, and yet we 

02:32:28.393 --> 02:32:33.023
have this inspiration of the 
Civil Rights Movement to 

02:32:33.024 --> 02:32:36.332
recognize how important it was 
for us to be able to participate

02:32:37.502 --> 02:32:41.917
 in society.  So, the mechanism 
for us in the minority consortia

02:32:43.048 --> 02:32:46.025
 and the wisdom for the 
Corporation for Public 

02:32:46.026 --> 02:32:48.344
Broadcasting was to help ensure 
that there was a pipeline of 

02:32:48.345 --> 02:32:52.976
programming by and about these 
new minority communities, and 

02:32:52.977 --> 02:32:57.626
we'd been doing this between 35 
and 40 years, all of us, the 

02:32:57.627 --> 02:33:00.957
five members of the 
organization.  One of the things

02:33:00.958 --> 02:33:04.444
 that I, one of the first points
 I want to make though, and in 

02:33:04.445 --> 02:33:08.962
response to your question, was 
that we have learned something 

02:33:08.963 --> 02:33:14.751
deeper in this construct, that 
it was important to, um, include

02:33:14.752 --> 02:33:18.191
 the perspectives of people of 
color in telling, um, diverse 

02:33:18.192 --> 02:33:25.112
kinds of stories, be they about 
history or social issues or even

02:33:25.113 --> 02:33:30.571
 our cultural history, and I 
think at first, we thought we 

02:33:30.572 --> 02:33:38.411
were presenting authentic images
 that our own communities could 

02:33:38.412 --> 02:33:39.577
recognize.  So, one piece that's
 really important is you can't 

02:33:39.578 --> 02:33:43.036
fully participate in the society
 unless, in some ways, you see 

02:33:43.037 --> 02:33:46.515
yourself and your stories told 
in the society.  The second 

02:33:46.516 --> 02:33:51.152
point I think we came to 
understand relatively quickly 

02:33:51.153 --> 02:33:53.441
after that was that these 
stories needed to be for all 

02:33:53.442 --> 02:33:56.912
Americans though and not just 
for our own communities.  The 

02:33:56.913 --> 02:33:58.913
Asian-American community would 
be a good example, because we're

02:33:59.231 --> 02:34:03.867
 so diverse and so different in 
language and cultural 

02:34:03.868 --> 02:34:08.331
backgrounds that in some ways, 
where you know, you're an expert

02:34:08.332 --> 02:34:13.016
 in no other culture, in a sense
, in this construct of 

02:34:13.017 --> 02:34:16.559
Asian-America, but I would say 
in the recent years, and this is

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:21.173
 where I want to end my thoughts
 on this, I think we now, where 

02:34:21.174 --> 02:34:24.677
we are today, in this question 
of, really, who is an American 

02:34:24.678 --> 02:34:30.333
and what is it that makes 
America great, it's clear that, 

02:34:30.334 --> 02:34:33.816
I think in some ways, we took 
for granted that there was an 

02:34:33.817 --> 02:34:37.174
acceptance that diversity was an
 important and a key factor of 

02:34:37.175 --> 02:34:41.845
the American experience, but it 
is vital that we stand in for 

02:34:41.846 --> 02:34:47.453
this notion of what this country
 can be and that we're not just 

02:34:47.454 --> 02:34:50.947
about our racial stories.  You 
know, diversity is within each 

02:34:50.948 --> 02:34:55.585
of our communities as well, and 
I think that's the larger piece 

02:34:55.586 --> 02:34:57.899
to reshift the way we all talk 
about what is our common 

02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:04.062
history, the way we examine 
things, and I think we're still 

02:35:04.063 --> 02:35:07.566
exploring what these different 
points of view mean, and it's a 

02:35:07.567 --> 02:35:11.014
journey we'll all need to be on,
 because we don't have the guide

02:35:11.015 --> 02:35:16.817
 stone of a, you know, sort of 
white, European,  male-dominated

02:35:18.988 --> 02:35:20.131
 through history.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you very 

02:35:20.132 --> 02:35:24.600
much.  Does anybody want to jump
 in before I, yes?

02:35:24.601 --> 02:35:26.911
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think one of the 
points I'd make is that all of 

02:35:26.912 --> 02:35:31.407
us, in some ways, are 
beneficiaries of the

02:35:34.567 --> 02:35:40.166
 technological changes that have
 lessened the cost and the, um, 

02:35:40.167 --> 02:35:44.772
some would say even the skill 
level to get into  film-making, 

02:35:44.773 --> 02:35:50.534
so that it has become much, much
 easier to do what, you know, a 

02:35:50.535 --> 02:35:55.189
film like Eyes on the Prize 
today, you could probably do it 

02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:59.856
for much less money, simply 
because the equipment would be 

02:35:59.857 --> 02:36:02.176
so much less, the editing 
equipment, all of that sort of 

02:36:02.177 --> 02:36:08.527
thing, and I think that looking 
forward into the future, what I 

02:36:08.528 --> 02:36:10.528
see coming out of

02:36:15.953 --> 02:36:21.572
African American film-making is 
that poliferation is kind of 

02:36:21.573 --> 02:36:26.051
pulling us, even within the 
African American community, now 

02:36:26.052 --> 02:36:32.883
you have gay film-makers, black 
film-makers, might be trying to 

02:36:32.884 --> 02:36:35.192
explain that experience, you 
have so much diversity within 

02:36:35.193 --> 02:36:40.907
each of these communities that 
one thing I fear is that it's 

02:36:40.908 --> 02:36:45.616
very difficult to get a sense, 
you know, right now, for 

02:36:45.617 --> 02:36:49.084
example, I've been involved in 
more than two dozen documentary 

02:36:49.085 --> 02:36:56.005
films about Black American life,
 and most of it 20th century, 

02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:59.326
and it seems like the pace of 
that keeps increasing

02:37:02.442 --> 02:37:06.946
, and I think there is that 
concern that we're losing a 

02:37:06.947 --> 02:37:12.586
sense of even the commonality of
 being black, much less being 

02:37:12.587 --> 02:37:18.386
American, and maybe that's good,
 because  otherwise, you would 

02:37:18.387 --> 02:37:24.003
not have a sense that these 
communities exist, but in terms 

02:37:24.004 --> 02:37:28.613
of trying to get a sense of it, 
you know, for many of my 

02:37:28.614 --> 02:37:33.223
students, I teach, in fact, I'll
 be teaching next quarter a 

02:37:33.224 --> 02:37:37.714
course on Black independent  
film, and I find that

02:37:40.884 --> 02:37:46.708
 maybe one student might have 
seen some of these fairly famous

02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:54.696
 films.  Charles Burnette, 
people who really made major 

02:37:54.697 --> 02:37:59.818
contributions, they haven't even
 seen early  Spike Lee, so it's,

02:37:59.819 --> 02:38:03.295
 um, they might have seen 
Malcolm X, but that's it.  So, I

02:38:03.296 --> 02:38:07.769
 think that one of the problems 
we're going to have is that 

02:38:07.770 --> 02:38:11.233
there are audiences, but it's 
going to be  smaller and smaller

02:38:11.234 --> 02:38:14.711
 rather than larger and larger.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, let me actually

02:38:14.712 --> 02:38:17.046
 address the changing 
marketplace for documentaries, 

02:38:17.047 --> 02:38:22.676
and I'd love to have any of your
 responses.  So, this is a point

02:38:22.677 --> 02:38:26.127
 at which Netflix is busy giving
 people

02:38:29.272 --> 02:38:35.041
 money, and, um, is launching, 
you know, entire lines, you've 

02:38:35.042 --> 02:38:44.136
got, um, Vice and Vulture doing 
instant journalism, Buzzfeed 

02:38:44.137 --> 02:38:46.468
explainers apparently educating 
an entire new generation, and 

02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:49.968
you've got cable channels just 
stuffed with wall-to-wall, 

02:38:49.969 --> 02:38:54.041
something that looks sort of 
like maybe documentary.  Um, and

02:38:54.042 --> 02:38:58.659
 you have a legacy that's been 
built-up largely through the 

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:03.136
hard work of public television 
that is, that honors the notion 

02:39:03.137 --> 02:39:07.770
of documentary as, like, a 
really authentic true thing.  At

02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:13.249
 the same time, you have an 
enormous proliferation and 

02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:17.372
leaping into the marketplace of 
Netflix, Amazon, and so many 

02:39:17.373 --> 02:39:22.541
more, so what's the role now of 
public television documentary?  

02:39:22.542 --> 02:39:27.262
You know, surely not the only 
game in town.  Um, expensive, oh

02:39:27.263 --> 02:39:34.882
 my god, compared to, like, 
almost any other source for 

02:39:34.883 --> 02:39:40.356
documentary, and, um, relatively
 slow compared to some of the 

02:39:40.357 --> 02:39:42.691
others.  What's the role?  No 
pressure.

02:39:42.692 --> 02:39:44.977
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But if you could 

02:39:44.978 --> 02:39:46.978
provide us the answer.
(Laughing.)

02:39:50.307 --> 02:39:51.443
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It's an enormous 
challenge.  One of the great 

02:39:51.444 --> 02:39:53.724
challenges is going to be, you 
know, how do you pick your way 

02:39:53.725 --> 02:39:57.128
through all of this stuff and 
know what's true and what's 

02:39:57.129 --> 02:40:00.586
trustworthy, and people maybe 
won't care about that as much.  

02:40:00.587 --> 02:40:05.047
There's going to be an enormous 
amount of material that's out 

02:40:05.048 --> 02:40:06.178
there in the world, being 
produced in all these different 

02:40:06.179 --> 02:40:10.805
areas, and, um, it's going to be
 manipulated and used, because 

02:40:10.806 --> 02:40:14.100
this is the most manipulative of
 media, and it's going to be, so

02:40:15.242 --> 02:40:17.529
 we're going to have a harder 
and harder time trying to figure

02:40:18.698 --> 02:40:20.698
 out what we can trust

02:40:22.885 --> 02:40:24.885
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The

02:40:25.898 --> 02:40:28.764
 trust brand.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The trust brand, 

02:40:25.898 --> 02:40:31.001
and that goes to very expensive,
 um, you know, high octane 

02:40:31.002 --> 02:40:36.867
documentaries, made with big 
budgets for HBO and for, um, 

02:40:36.868 --> 02:40:39.181
Netflix and others as well.  
There are, you know, it's very 

02:40:39.182 --> 02:40:43.626
easy to put your hand on the 
scale, you know, in 

02:40:43.627 --> 02:40:47.059
documentaries and to be able to 
manipulate this medium towards 

02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:51.418
certain points of view.  There's
 nothing easier than to kind of,

02:40:51.419 --> 02:40:57.248
 um, you know, Michael Moore's 
famous film of, you know,

02:41:00.390 --> 02:41:05.020
  Fahrenheit 911, being able to 
sort of get that sequences, it's

02:41:05.021 --> 02:41:09.637
 not hard to do, it's very easy 
to be able to manipulate 

02:41:09.638 --> 02:41:11.948
archival material and to use it 
in different ways, to lay a 

02:41:11.949 --> 02:41:16.998
voice over it, so we have a deep
 worry, I think, behind all of 

02:41:16.999 --> 02:41:22.780
this as to what lies behind it 
and where you have trust.  The 

02:41:22.781 --> 02:41:25.053
only thing that we can hold on 
to is to say we really believe 

02:41:25.054 --> 02:41:28.582
that you can trust us, and the 
way in which you trust us is the

02:41:29.749 --> 02:41:33.201
 body of work and the way in 
which we keep doing it, and 

02:41:33.202 --> 02:41:36.650
also, to make it as transparent 
as possible.  So, we made, for 

02:41:36.651 --> 02:41:41.911
me, one of the great moments in 
the life of  Frontline was 1995,

02:41:41.912 --> 02:41:46.506
 we'd just done a film on Waco, 
the inside story, and, um, we'd 

02:41:46.507 --> 02:41:51.114
done all these interviews with, 
um, major FBI guys who were part

02:41:51.115 --> 02:41:56.671
 of negotiating with Karesh, we 
even had the audio tapes of the 

02:41:56.672 --> 02:42:01.129
actual negotiations, and I kept 
saying can't we make a radio 

02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:03.421
show, and somebody said, you can
 put it on the web.  What's that

02:42:04.586 --> 02:42:06.886
?  1995, we built --
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That was still 

02:42:06.887 --> 02:42:10.312
mosaic.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We built a website 

02:42:10.313 --> 02:42:13.524
for Waco, the inside story, with
 that archival material, plus I 

02:42:13.525 --> 02:42:17.496
said, well, can't we put the 
whole film on there?  And they 

02:42:17.497 --> 02:42:21.568
said, well, you can't do that 
yet, and, so, then we put the 

02:42:21.569 --> 02:42:25.742
interviews up, and all the 
interviews for these were, and 

02:42:25.743 --> 02:42:29.273
that website exists today, 
people still actually write to 

02:42:29.274 --> 02:42:36.021
us about that website, and from 
then on, we began publishing all

02:42:36.022 --> 02:42:40.202
 of the edited, longer versions 
of the primary source materials 

02:42:40.203 --> 02:42:45.544
behind the Frontline, so that 
last week, the second film that 

02:42:45.545 --> 02:42:52.422
ran of Puti n's  Revenge, there 
were 65 interviews, a body of 

02:42:52.423 --> 02:42:55.939
work that's both historically 
important, now, that's not going

02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:58.226
 to persuade the average person 
that's doing it that they're 

02:42:58.227 --> 02:43:03.867
going to go off and hunt through
 the interview material, but 

02:43:03.868 --> 02:43:07.382
you've made it completely 
transparent.  In some way, that 

02:43:07.383 --> 02:43:09.694
seeps deeply into the culture, 
that if we raise the bar really 

02:43:09.695 --> 02:43:14.309
high, and hold to that bar, then
 we begin to hold on to who we 

02:43:14.310 --> 02:43:17.805
are and why we remain the only 
place anywhere in the media 

02:43:17.806 --> 02:43:24.362
culture that does that, and, so,
 that's our, um--

02:43:24.363 --> 02:43:26.674
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Okay, so, that's 
your answer.  You want to go, 

02:43:26.675 --> 02:43:27.818
Margaret?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  What I just 

02:43:27.819 --> 02:43:31.224
wanted to say is that you can 
take that trust too, and we all 

02:43:31.225 --> 02:43:36.882
had to learn, um, using new 
platforms, and it was 

02:43:36.883 --> 02:43:39.187
challenging, in many ways, 
because we had been so schooled 

02:43:39.188 --> 02:43:43.692
in the delivery of hour- 
hour-long documentaries, or in 

02:43:43.693 --> 02:43:47.178
the case of American Experience,
 six-hour long  documentaries or

02:43:47.179 --> 02:43:50.643
 four-hour long documentaries, 
which were big biographies of 

02:43:50.644 --> 02:43:54.087
Presidents.  Um, so, we had to 
learn how to use the material on

02:43:54.088 --> 02:43:57.561
 YouTube, and we had to learn 
podcasting, and we had to learn 

02:43:57.562 --> 02:44:00.984
all of the different platforms, 
mobile platforms, where we could

02:44:00.985 --> 02:44:08.989
 deliver the same kind of 
context, shorter, but carries 

02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:11.373
the same branding and the same, 
um, scrutiny that goes into an 

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:17.149
hour-long documentary and 
deliver it to your students, who

02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:21.606
 are not going to be watching 
hour-long documentaries 

02:44:21.607 --> 02:44:23.901
documentaries, I mean unless 
somebody leads them to it and 

02:44:23.902 --> 02:44:28.521
shows them what the benefits are
 and what the range of interest 

02:44:28.522 --> 02:44:29.675
is.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And we're doing 

02:44:29.676 --> 02:44:33.987
that.  We're getting millions of
 viewers through Facebook.

02:44:33.988 --> 02:44:38.522
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think we're 
sitting in an archive.  I think 

02:44:38.523 --> 02:44:44.208
for any documentary, one of the 
most important tasks is what do 

02:44:44.209 --> 02:44:46.541
you do with all the material 
that you've brought together, 

02:44:46.542 --> 02:44:50.013
especially the video material, 
and I think one of the most 

02:44:50.014 --> 02:44:55.780
important decisions for Eyes on 
the Prize was to put it in an 

02:44:55.781 --> 02:44:59.244
archive, where now you can go 
and, um, watch the entire

02:45:02.410 --> 02:45:05.882
 Coretta  King interview or any 
other interview done during that

02:45:05.883 --> 02:45:07.051
 time.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, we're going to 

02:45:07.052 --> 02:45:10.479
run out of time.  I want to make
 sure we get your answer, Steve,

02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:14.951
 for the, the answer for trust 
has been partly transparency, 

02:45:14.952 --> 02:45:20.741
but it's also been partly brand.
  Trust us, because we are PBS, 

02:45:20.742 --> 02:45:24.215
we are American Experience, we 
are Frontline, and you're 

02:45:24.216 --> 02:45:26.516
dealing with a different 
community, who are, um, 

02:45:26.517 --> 02:45:32.291
independent film-makers of, um, 
in your case, specifically 

02:45:32.292 --> 02:45:36.901
Asian-American  film-makers, but
 each consortia does, in the 

02:45:36.902 --> 02:45:42.647
series, they showcase their work
, all of this work which is very

02:45:43.823 --> 02:45:49.410
, very different, so how do you 
address Clay's point about a 

02:45:49.411 --> 02:45:55.008
sintriffial universe of 
information out there?

02:45:55.009 --> 02:45:57.390
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You know, 
historically, our stuff shows up

02:45:57.391 --> 02:45:59.706
 into the system through a 
variety of ways, not through one

02:45:59.707 --> 02:46:04.326
 particular strand, you know, 
one brand, although in recent 

02:46:04.327 --> 02:46:08.914
times, in fact, we have a 
project that's going on American

02:46:08.915 --> 02:46:11.261
 Experience next May that makes 
extensive use of archival 

02:46:11.262 --> 02:46:14.817
materials, and we're also 
participating in the, um, 

02:46:14.818 --> 02:46:18.304
archives of public broadcasting,
 I'm really proud of, but to 

02:46:18.305 --> 02:46:24.086
speak in general of this, you 
know, a hundred titles a year 

02:46:24.087 --> 02:46:27.575
that collectively come from 
independent sources, and we put 

02:46:27.576 --> 02:46:31.702
our stuff on POV, that many of 
you may know about, um, you 

02:46:31.703 --> 02:46:37.377
know, it is a, I am optimistic 
moving into the future, because 

02:46:37.378 --> 02:46:42.952
this is what we all have to 
learn, how to incorporate many 

02:46:42.953 --> 02:46:45.268
more points of view and many 
more voices in public  

02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:47.634
broadcasting, and if you stay 
true to that, and it's 

02:46:47.635 --> 02:46:51.109
absolutely mission-driven, what 
we heard earlier, it is the 

02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:54.586
future, and then make use of 
this incredible education 

02:46:54.587 --> 02:46:58.035
network.  I'm going to setup the
 next panel for you, PBS 

02:46:58.036 --> 02:47:01.501
learning media, which we, you 
know, put our materials on and 

02:47:01.502 --> 02:47:05.948
make available to teachers, um, 
that I feel very confident about

02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:12.489
 the future of this enterprise, 
because there are thousands, 

02:47:12.490 --> 02:47:16.531
tens of thousands of young 
makers who really want to speak 

02:47:16.532 --> 02:47:18.835
authentic stories, that don't 
necessarily have to be in 

02:47:18.836 --> 02:47:25.495
commercial media and be all 
about selling a product, or even

02:47:25.496 --> 02:47:27.799
 in the best sense, just to 
entertain alone.  I think there 

02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.402
are so many issues that we share
 in public  broadcasting, if it 

02:47:32.403 --> 02:47:35.865
stays true to the mission, is 
that singular place.

02:47:35.866 --> 02:47:38.166
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, we're going to,
 um, we've got, like, 3 more 

02:47:38.167 --> 02:47:42.782
minutes, and I'd like to be able
 to use them to talk to the 

02:47:42.783 --> 02:47:48.419
issue you addressed, which is 
archives, and Clay has told us 

02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:54.080
about, is Eyes on the Prize work
 in APB somewhere?

02:47:54.081 --> 02:47:56.081
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes.  Same as 
always

02:47:58.377 --> 02:48:00.547
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Is D Den

02:48:03.709 --> 02:48:04.858
 Show?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's an online 

02:48:04.859 --> 02:48:08.390
digital archive, and we have 
placed a number of our

02:48:12.546 --> 02:48:15.817
 collections, the collection 
where he  interviewed hundreds 

02:48:15.818 --> 02:48:20.327
and hundreds of veterans, we've 
placed all those interviews on 

02:48:20.328 --> 02:48:23.821
that source, but all of the 
other kinds of works, they're 

02:48:23.822 --> 02:48:26.096
going to go into library of 
Congress as part of our 

02:48:26.097 --> 02:48:28.471
collections.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Fantastic.  You?

02:48:28.472 --> 02:48:30.783
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I would just 
recommend seeing the

02:48:33.978 --> 02:48:38.567
 Putin's Revenge stuff.  It was 
done with  Duke, and it's state 

02:48:38.568 --> 02:48:42.024
of the art technology.  65 
interviews, they're all video 

02:48:42.025 --> 02:48:46.518
interviews, you can both read it
 and be able to track the video 

02:48:46.519 --> 02:48:48.826
at the same time.  You can reach
 in and clip a piece out and 

02:48:48.827 --> 02:48:54.419
share it, and, um, it's the most
 interactive, profoundly sort 

02:48:54.420 --> 02:49:02.238
of, um, impressive archive.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Fantastic.  And in 

02:49:02.239 --> 02:49:06.013
terms of  APB, is there 
Frontline material?

02:49:06.014 --> 02:49:11.612
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think it's due.  
Karen  tells me it's in the 

02:49:11.613 --> 02:49:13.928
pipeline.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Can I, I just want 

02:49:13.929 --> 02:49:17.415
to go back a little bit to 
something he had said about the 

02:49:17.416 --> 02:49:21.482
appetite for documentaries.  I 
also am on the board of POV, the

02:49:21.483 --> 02:49:26.345
 independent documentary series,
 and I am astonished, every 

02:49:26.346 --> 02:49:28.662
year, we have an open call, and 
we get more than a thousand 

02:49:28.663 --> 02:49:33.126
entries from independent 
producers, and of those, it has 

02:49:33.127 --> 02:49:37.736
to be called to, like, we've got
 18 slots, so that's every 

02:49:37.737 --> 02:49:41.202
single  year, and even in the, 
after the, during the, you know,

02:49:41.203 --> 02:49:45.795
 in the middle of the year, when
 there's no entry date, they get

02:49:47.016 --> 02:49:51.637
 inundated with phone calls, or 
they get tapes or, you know, um,

02:49:52.793 --> 02:49:54.902
 links to films that have been 
produced, so there's something 

02:49:54.903 --> 02:49:59.520
going on.  It reminds me of the 
time when, you know, I was at 

02:49:59.521 --> 02:50:01.812
CBS, and they announced the 
death of the documentary, I 

02:50:01.813 --> 02:50:05.910
don't think we can say that the 
documentary is dying.  I see 

02:50:05.911 --> 02:50:11.704
quite the opposite.  I see this 
hunger in young people, made 

02:50:11.705 --> 02:50:16.328
possible by technology, in some 
cases, and also, just this kind 

02:50:16.329 --> 02:50:19.775
of, um, incessant, fervent 
curiosity that they have about 

02:50:19.776 --> 02:50:23.225
their world, and they're making 
these films for practically 

02:50:23.226 --> 02:50:26.628
nothing, and some of them are 
really terrific.  So, I'm 

02:50:26.629 --> 02:50:28.629
optimistic.

02:50:30.789 --> 02:50:33.075
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, I interrupted 
you, Clay.

02:50:33.076 --> 02:50:35.360
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Two words that have
 not come up and that are really

02:50:35.361 --> 02:50:40.003
 central in this is intellectual
 property, and I think that, in 

02:50:40.004 --> 02:50:46.602
general, scholarship and 
documentary film- film-makers 

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:50.038
have not been aggressive enough 
in using fair use.  I think that

02:50:51.170 --> 02:50:57.847
 in part, that comes from when, 
a particular film that I was 

02:50:57.848 --> 02:51:03.576
involved in, when it came to 
being shown on  PBS, PBS 

02:51:03.577 --> 02:51:08.216
required certain kinds of 
coverage, you know, for obvious 

02:51:08.217 --> 02:51:11.680
reasons, legal reasons, and that
 forced them to go back, and in 

02:51:11.681 --> 02:51:17.414
this case, you know, have to 
take out, um, things, so I think

02:51:18.581 --> 02:51:22.847
 at every level, intellectual 
property issues have been 

02:51:22.848 --> 02:51:30.629
crucial.  Not so much in terms 
of cost, but just uncertainty 

02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:32.948
about use.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And people all 

02:51:32.949 --> 02:51:36.459
being on the same page about 
what they regard as acceptable, 

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:37.611
which is where the best 
practices have been somewhat 

02:51:37.612 --> 02:51:42.066
helpful.  All right, last 
comments?  Because we have, 

02:51:42.067 --> 02:51:45.565
like, 15 seconds left.  Go.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.

02:51:45.566 --> 02:51:47.883
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Your 15 seconds?

02:51:47.884 --> 02:51:50.208
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I thank you.  Yes. 

02:51:50.209 --> 02:51:52.209
 Thank  you.
(Applause.)

02:52:01.461 --> 02:52:03.765
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you, 
everybody.  Our next panel is 

02:52:03.766 --> 02:52:07.256
going to begin.  We're going to 
show some clips, which I hope 

02:52:07.257 --> 02:52:09.257
you'll stay 

02:52:10.377 --> 02:52:12.738
 seated this time to watch.  Um,
 it's on educational uses of 

02:52:12.739 --> 02:52:16.224
public broadcasting, and it will
 begin, the panel will begin at 

02:52:16.225 --> 02:52:21.850
5:10, but we're going to start 
clips right now.  And will the 

02:52:21.851 --> 02:52:23.851
panelists please come and get 
mic

02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.160
'd?  Thank you.

02:59:05.217 --> 02:59:07.778
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, our moderator 
for our next panel on the 

02:59:07.779 --> 02:59:13.386
educational uses of public 
broadcasting is the person who 

02:59:13.387 --> 02:59:16.837
during most of my tenure as the 
head of WGBH held the purse 

02:59:16.838 --> 02:59:21.510
strings, first at PBS and then 
at CBB, because she had the most

02:59:22.674 --> 02:59:29.463
 important programming jobs in 
those two institutions, not 

02:59:29.464 --> 02:59:31.766
simultaneously, I would say.  
Jennifer Lawson was the 

02:59:31.767 --> 02:59:36.266
Executive Vice President of 
programming and commercial 

02:59:36.267 --> 02:59:39.558
services at PBS, and then was 
Senior Vice President for 

02:59:39.559 --> 02:59:42.838
television and digital content 
at CBP, and during a little bit 

02:59:42.839 --> 02:59:47.001
of time between those two, she 
ran the Howard University public

02:59:47.002 --> 02:59:52.684
 station, WHUT.  Jennifer has 
received numerous awards and 

02:59:52.685 --> 02:59:57.381
honors for her work in public 
media.  The Hollywood Reporter 

02:59:57.382 --> 03:00:02.093
named her, at one point, one of 
the 50 most influential women in

03:00:02.094 --> 03:00:07.704
 entertainment in the world.  
So, Jennifer, take it away.

03:00:07.705 --> 03:00:12.024
(Applause.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you very 

03:00:12.025 --> 03:00:16.662
much.  Education is a 
fundamental element of public 

03:00:16.663 --> 03:00:20.161
broadcasting.  Public television
 was  established as educational

03:00:22.302 --> 03:00:26.834
 television first in many places
 around the country, the E in 

03:00:26.835 --> 03:00:32.393
the call letters of many 
stations, like WETA, or  KCET in

03:00:32.394 --> 03:00:34.394
 Los Angeles

03:00:35.562 --> 03:00:41.860
, references education, and 
several of the 362 public 

03:00:41.861 --> 03:00:45.307
television stations are licensed
 to universities, such as the 

03:00:45.308 --> 03:00:52.120
one Henry just mentioned, W WGBH
 at Howard  University, or 

03:00:52.121 --> 03:00:57.718
Arizona PBS, which originated at
 Arizona State University.  

03:00:57.719 --> 03:00:59.719
Public

03:01:00.918 --> 03:01:02.109
 television, together with 
public non-commercial radio, 

03:01:02.110 --> 03:01:06.759
combined to serve as the most 
consistent and significant place

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:12.610
 for informal learning for 
listeners and viewers of all 

03:01:12.611 --> 03:01:15.941
ages.  We'll discuss public 
broadcasting's educational 

03:01:15.942 --> 03:01:21.177
underpinnings, its legacy, and 
how the preservation of this 

03:01:21.178 --> 03:01:23.482
content creates future 
opportunities.  I have the 

03:01:23.483 --> 03:01:29.290
privilege now of introducing our
 distinguished panel, and we 

03:01:29.291 --> 03:01:31.291

 Columbia Gold Baton, as well as
 an academy award nomination.  

03:01:58.675 --> 03:02:07.614
She has also been recognized 
with numerous personal awards

03:02:08.754 --> 03:02:13.379

teachers who make extensive use 

03:02:13.380 --> 03:02:19.121
of its high-quality educational 
materials and its website, with 

03:02:19.122 --> 03:02:23.756

 television studies, the history
 of race and ethnicity, and the 

03:03:41.350 --> 03:03:47.129
history of media and 
communications.  She is also 

03:03:47.130 --> 03:03:50.607
working to preserve audio, 
visual, and paper archival 

03:03:50.608 --> 03:03:54.076
sources related to children's 
television.  She has a doctorate

03:03:54.077 --> 03:03:58.753
 in history from the University 
of Pennsylvania, and her oral 

03:03:58.754 --> 03:04:04.410
history of the the 1970s through
 the sounds of Sesame Street has

03:04:04.411 --> 03:04:07.910
 led to numerous speaking 
engagements and conference 

03:04:07.911 --> 03:04:11.393
presentations.  She is under 
contract with the University of 

03:04:11.394 --> 03:04:17.175
California  Press for a book on 
this topic.  I'd like to start 

03:04:17.176 --> 03:04:23.953
with Lloyd Morrisett and to talk
 a bit about the origins of 

03:04:23.954 --> 03:04:29.611
Sesame Street, and I know that 
you were at the Carnegie 

03:04:29.612 --> 03:04:33.071
Foundation and had a very good 
overview of the state of 

03:04:33.072 --> 03:04:36.566
education in America at that 
time, and I would just, I think 

03:04:36.567 --> 03:04:39.837
it would be really useful if you
 would put Sesame Street in 

03:04:39.838 --> 03:04:43.296
that, in the context of those 
times and tell us a little bit 

03:04:43.297 --> 03:04:48.644
about what led to its creation.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, those of you 

03:04:48.645 --> 03:04:50.645
who are expecting

03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:55.126
 Elmo, I'm not Elmo.
(Laughing.)

03:04:55.127 --> 03:04:58.470
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think, to talk 
about the origins of Sesame 

03:04:58.471 --> 03:05:07.382
Street, you have to re-create in
 your minds the events of that 

03:05:07.383 --> 03:05:10.843
decade, and I'm going to list 
them here, and I'm going to read

03:05:11.973 --> 03:05:16.457
 the list, because I don't want 
to leave anything out.  1960, 

03:05:16.458 --> 03:05:19.919
television may have given  
Senator John F. Kennedy the edge

03:05:21.077 --> 03:05:25.469
 he needed to defeat Vice 
President Nixon in the first 

03:05:25.470 --> 03:05:29.004
televised presidential debate.  
Kennedy wins the election by a 

03:05:29.005 --> 03:05:37.988
margin of 113,000 votes out of 
69 million votes cast.  1961,

03:05:39.131 --> 03:05:43.331
 FCC chairman makes his famous 
speech, declaring that 

03:05:43.332 --> 03:05:50.059
television is a vast wasteland. 
  1962, 90 percent of Americans 

03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:54.681
own a television set.  ABC 
begins broadcasting in color.  

03:05:54.682 --> 03:06:02.517
The federal government funds 
public broadcasting through the 

03:06:02.518 --> 03:06:05.952
Education Television Facilities 
 Act.  June of

03:06:10.125 --> 03:06:15.838
 1962, President Kennedy 
federalizes Alabama's National 

03:06:15.839 --> 03:06:20.503
Guard and orders  Governor 
George Wallace to allow two 

03:06:20.504 --> 03:06:22.834
black students to be enrolled at
 the university

03:06:26.987 --> 03:06:35.111
.  Just recounting these events,
 I find I'm very emotional.  In 

03:06:35.112 --> 03:06:37.112
January of

03:06:38.278 --> 03:06:45.057
 1962, Martin Luther King 
delivers his I Have A Dream 

03:06:45.058 --> 03:06:49.516
speech.  In August, more than 
200,000 Americans march on 

03:06:49.517 --> 03:06:52.995
Washington in support of civil 
rights.

03:06:58.199 --> 03:07:01.665
  1964, the 24th Amendment to 
the Constitution makes U.S. poll

03:07:01.666 --> 03:07:09.487
 taxes unconstitutional.  March 
1964, President Johnson declares

03:07:09.488 --> 03:07:17.955
 a war on poverty.  He signs an 
Economic Opportunity Act in 

03:07:17.956 --> 03:07:22.575
August.  Again, in 1964, 
President Johnson signs the bill

03:07:23.730 --> 03:07:29.534
 enacting Medicare.  The great 
society is underway.  In August 

03:07:29.535 --> 03:07:31.535
of

03:07:32.725 --> 03:07:38.339
 1964, Congress approves the 
resolution authorizing President

03:07:39.497 --> 03:07:42.066
 Johnson to take all necessary 
majors to repel any armed attack

03:07:43.255 --> 03:07:45.599
 against forces of the United 
States and to prevent further 

03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:50.078
aggression.  December of of 
1964, President

03:07:53.846 --> 03:07:55.846
 Johnson announces a substantial
 increase

03:07:58.663 --> 03:08:00.826
 in -- inaudible --

03:08:04.844 --> 03:08:06.844
 in

03:08:09.166 --> 03:08:13.610
 in 1965, January, in a state of
 the union message, President 

03:08:13.611 --> 03:08:15.905
Johnson outlines the program for
 the great society that will 

03:08:15.906 --> 03:08:21.506
eliminate  poverty in America.  
In February, Dr. Martin Luther 

03:08:21.507 --> 03:08:24.863
King is arrested in Selma, 
Alabama

03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:35.675
.  In February, also, Malcolm X 
is assassinated

03:08:42.875 --> 03:08:46.292
 coincidentally during national 
brotherhood  week.  June of 

03:08:46.293 --> 03:08:48.623
1965, Congress authorizes the 
use of ground troops in Vietnam,

03:08:50.791 --> 03:08:56.626
.  A complete ground defense is 
underway, and the column will 

03:08:56.627 --> 03:09:04.679
collapse in a few weeks weeks 
weeks.  Not months, but

03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:11.812
  weeks.  125,000 troops are in 
Vietnam.  In August that year, 

03:09:11.813 --> 03:09:15.235
the Voting Rights Act becomes 
law, and in August of that year,

03:09:15.236 --> 03:09:19.905
 the Carnegie  Commission on 
educational television begins 

03:09:19.906 --> 03:09:27.832
its landmark study of broadcast.
  In 1967, public broadcasting 

03:09:27.833 --> 03:09:32.468
laboratory airs over national 
educational television.  It is a

03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:35.891
 Sunday night magazine program 
designed to showcase the 

03:09:35.892 --> 03:09:41.487
relevance and importance of 
public television.  We'll come 

03:09:41.488 --> 03:09:44.982
back to that, because that was 
much more important historically

03:09:44.983 --> 03:09:51.459
 in public  broadcasting than is
 generally recognized.  In March

03:09:51.460 --> 03:10:00.368
 of 1968, President Johnson 
announces that he will not 

03:10:00.369 --> 03:10:02.697
accept the nomination for 
another term.  His presidency 

03:10:02.698 --> 03:10:09.614
has become another  casualty of 
Vietnam War.  In 1968 in April, 

03:10:09.615 --> 03:10:11.923
Martin Luther King is 
assassinated

03:10:18.094 --> 03:10:20.094
.  In

03:10:22.271 --> 03:10:26.902
 1969 -- inaudible -- begins, 
five nights a week.  In November

03:10:26.903 --> 03:10:30.212
 of that year, Sesame Street 
goes on the air

03:10:33.357 --> 03:10:39.118
.  Now, as you can tell from my 
 emotions, this was a very 

03:10:39.119 --> 03:10:41.119
turbulent time

03:10:44.474 --> 03:10:47.963
.  It strongly affected all of 
us, all of us who were alive 

03:10:47.964 --> 03:10:53.765
then, and it was out of that in 
part that Sesame Street was born

03:10:54.929 --> 03:10:57.235
.  We started working on the 
idea in

03:11:00.407 --> 03:11:04.909
 1966, and the people that came 
to us to help, our Executive 

03:11:04.910 --> 03:11:12.882
Vice President, for example, 
Joan Kuney obviously joined me 

03:11:12.883 --> 03:11:17.518
in the original idea, all of us 
were very affected by the events

03:11:17.519 --> 03:11:24.452
 I've discussed, and so Sesame 
Street was in part born out of a

03:11:24.453 --> 03:11:27.785
 belief in civil rights that we 
all had

03:11:31.962 --> 03:11:34.299
.  The fact that it appeared on 
public television was somewhat 

03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:39.904
of an accident.  When we first 
started to raise money for it in

03:11:43.051 --> 03:11:48.877
 1966, Doc Hal had become 
commissioner of education, and 

03:11:48.878 --> 03:11:53.343
he had been  formally 
superintendent of schools in  

03:11:53.344 --> 03:11:56.816
scarsdale, and he was one of the
 first people we talked to about

03:11:56.817 --> 03:12:01.300
 it.  He, after some 
deliberation, overruled his 

03:12:01.301 --> 03:12:03.607
staff and said that he would 
find

03:12:06.784 --> 03:12:11.472
 $4 million to help us get on 
the air.  So, with that $4 

03:12:11.473 --> 03:12:13.786
million, plus the million 
dollars that Carnegie had 

03:12:13.787 --> 03:12:15.787
already

03:12:16.848 --> 03:12:18.848
 put up, we had

03:12:20.014 --> 03:12:26.478
 $5 million.  Lou Halesman, who 
was  Doc Hal's point person in

03:12:32.712 --> 03:12:36.145
, Lou came out of NBC 
television, and he strongly 

03:12:36.146 --> 03:12:40.179
believed that the program should
 be on commercial television.  

03:12:40.180 --> 03:12:42.507
He said where are the people 
going?  They're on commercial 

03:12:42.508 --> 03:12:49.557
television, that's where you 
have to be.  So, we took that 

03:12:49.558 --> 03:12:58.678
advice seriously, and I met 
with, um, NBC, CBS, Group W 

03:12:58.679 --> 03:13:04.784
Broadcasting, and got very nice,
 um, a very nice reception, but 

03:13:04.785 --> 03:13:09.126
no money, no airtime.  The 
program was  fully funded, but 

03:13:09.127 --> 03:13:13.392
we couldn't understand, I 
couldn't understand, in my 

03:13:13.393 --> 03:13:15.670
naivety, why, with a fully 
funded program, we couldn't have

03:13:16.823 --> 03:13:21.430
 any  airtime.  Later, I 
realized, and I've realized it 

03:13:21.431 --> 03:13:25.903
ever since, that the advertising
 part wasn't interested in 

03:13:25.904 --> 03:13:28.189
having those minutes sold that 
way.  They wanted to raise money

03:13:29.336 --> 03:13:32.829
 around the program, and they 
couldn't, so the commercial 

03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:38.517
broadcasters turned us down, and
 just at that point, the Public 

03:13:38.518 --> 03:13:40.818
Broadcasting Act had been 
signed, and public broadcasting 

03:13:40.819 --> 03:13:47.161
needed programming, we needed 
airtime, it was a, I won't say 

03:13:47.162 --> 03:13:51.622
it was made in heaven, but it 
was certainly made by an 

03:13:51.623 --> 03:14:00.516
accident of history.  So, the 
things that made it

03:14:01.675 --> 03:14:04.017
 possible, in addition to the 
one that I've already cited, are

03:14:04.018 --> 03:14:09.624
 that the people, essentially, 
who created the climate to 

03:14:09.625 --> 03:14:14.107
accept the idea of a children's 
television program were all in 

03:14:14.108 --> 03:14:19.815
their place.  John Gardener had 
been my boss at Carnegie, was a 

03:14:19.816 --> 03:14:25.538
good friend.  Doc Hal had also 
become a friend.  Other people 

03:14:25.539 --> 03:14:32.196
who were not directly, um, 
involved in the origins, but 

03:14:32.197 --> 03:14:34.496
created the climate in 
Washington that made it possible

03:14:36.657 --> 03:14:43.596
, he's been a friend the rest of
 his life for me.  Henry Gellar,

03:14:43.597 --> 03:14:48.189
 who some of you may remember 
was an ardent fan of the 

03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:52.807
public's use of  broadcasting 
and not giving it away free to 

03:14:52.808 --> 03:14:57.260
commercial broadcasters.  The 
other person I'd mention, whose 

03:14:57.261 --> 03:15:01.875
name has already come up, is 
Doug Cater.  Doug Cater was 

03:15:01.876 --> 03:15:06.490
Lyndon Johnson's special 
assistant for education.  He 

03:15:06.491 --> 03:15:08.805
shepherded the Public 
Broadcasting Act through the 

03:15:08.806 --> 03:15:13.435
process of getting it to 
Congress, and he was also a 

03:15:13.436 --> 03:15:16.895
great friend of the kinds of 
things that we were trying to do

03:15:19.052 --> 03:15:23.805
.  Joan Kuney had been at NBC, 
and then she had been at Channel

03:15:27.007 --> 03:15:29.294
 13, where she was a commercial,
 not a commercial, a  

03:15:29.295 --> 03:15:34.921
documentary producer and had 
three good documentaries to her 

03:15:34.922 --> 03:15:39.504
name.  So, essentially, not only
 had the climate of opinion in 

03:15:39.505 --> 03:15:45.309
the country been, um, 
fertilized, I'll say, by the 

03:15:45.310 --> 03:15:50.012
events of the 19 60s, but the 
particular people I've mentioned

03:15:50.013 --> 03:15:55.663
 were all interested in the 
public's use of public 

03:15:55.664 --> 03:16:01.334
facilities and public education.
  They are what made the idea 

03:16:01.335 --> 03:16:03.618
become possible.  I think I'll 
stop there, Jennifer.

03:16:03.619 --> 03:16:05.899
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Terrific.  Thank 
you.

03:16:05.900 --> 03:16:07.900
(Applause.)

03:16:14.094 --> 03:16:17.548
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Paula, your work 
exemplifies informal education. 

03:16:17.549 --> 03:16:22.211
 You've helped popularize and 
demystify science and science 

03:16:22.212 --> 03:16:25.681
education, and you've given 
exposure to some scientists that

03:16:25.682 --> 03:16:29.021
 has made them as popular as 
rockstars

03:16:34.203 --> 03:16:38.875
.  It's easy to go places, and 
people go, oh, wow,  Brian 

03:16:38.876 --> 03:16:43.434
Green, string theory, you know, 
and, so, it's, um, and then 

03:16:43.435 --> 03:16:49.085
you've also shown us women and 
people of color in the sciences 

03:16:49.086 --> 03:16:54.817
routinely throughout your series
.  With Nova, what's the origin,

03:16:54.818 --> 03:16:57.124
 how did we get from there to 
here?

03:16:57.125 --> 03:16:59.408
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That's good.  First
 of all, I just want to say, I'm

03:17:00.584 --> 03:17:05.048
 just awed to be sitting next to
 Lloyd, because my daughter, 

03:17:05.049 --> 03:17:08.513
Natalie, is here with me today, 
and I just can see in my mind's 

03:17:08.514 --> 03:17:11.965
eye, and this makes me 
emotional, when she and her 

03:17:11.966 --> 03:17:15.533
sisters would be sitting on that
 couch every single day at 4:00 

03:17:15.534 --> 03:17:19.038
o'clock, their thumbs in their 
mouth, a bomb could have gone 

03:17:19.039 --> 03:17:22.559
off in that room, and they would
 not have  moved, and what they 

03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:26.112
learned from Sesame  Street, way
 beyond the importance of the 

03:17:26.113 --> 03:17:30.745
letters, the lessons about life,
 about ethics, about morality, 

03:17:30.746 --> 03:17:33.833
about how you treat other people
 of all different kinds, even if

03:17:33.834 --> 03:17:38.410
 they're not familiar to you, 
and now, as everyone  knows, I 

03:17:38.411 --> 03:17:45.472
have a grandson, and he watches 
The  Science Kid and also Sesame

03:17:45.473 --> 03:17:49.003
 Street and the other programs 
on PBS, so as well as being a 

03:17:49.004 --> 03:17:54.716
content-generator, I'm a 
recipient of all the good things

03:17:54.717 --> 03:18:00.320
 that PBS does for kids and 
educationally, and it's just, 

03:18:00.321 --> 03:18:03.888
really, it's just overwhelming. 
 I feel so fortunate to be apart

03:18:03.889 --> 03:18:11.156
 of this.  Now, on to Nova.  So,
 education is in  Nova's DNA.  

03:18:11.157 --> 03:18:13.661
We've been producing content for
 teachers and students for as 

03:18:13.662 --> 03:18:18.284
long as we've been on PBS, and 
that's 44 years, which is kind 

03:18:18.285 --> 03:18:21.718
of an eternity in television, 
and now I have to mention 

03:18:21.719 --> 03:18:24.020
another man that I think is a 
really great person, and that is

03:18:25.788 --> 03:18:31.356
 Michael Ambersino, who started 
Nova, and Michael just had --

03:18:31.357 --> 03:18:34.720
(Applause.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Michael just had a 

03:18:34.721 --> 03:18:41.154
really good idea.  Very simple. 
 His idea was science is not a 

03:18:41.155 --> 03:18:44.621
collection of facts, it's a 
story, and if you tell the story

03:18:44.622 --> 03:18:48.079
 right, with characters and with
 visuals, then people will 

03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:52.701
watch, and they will learn, but 
they will enjoy, and it will 

03:18:52.702 --> 03:18:57.345
change their opinion about 
science and make, help them to 

03:18:57.346 --> 03:19:00.822
understand what an important 
part of our lives and what an 

03:19:00.823 --> 03:19:06.508
important, I would say cultural 
institution, that it is really a

03:19:06.509 --> 03:19:10.959
 thrill to get a better 
understanding of our world, and 

03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:14.418
Michael always knew that, um, 
that it was very important for 

03:19:15.578 --> 03:19:19.056
Nova to go out to teachers as 
well, and that they should have 

03:19:19.057 --> 03:19:21.417
supplementary materials that 
would help them use Nova in the 

03:19:21.418 --> 03:19:26.000
classroom.  So, for years and 
years and years, we made 

03:19:26.001 --> 03:19:29.593
teachers' plans, which had all 
sorts of suggestions and tips 

03:19:29.594 --> 03:19:33.025
and activities for the classroom
, but teaching changes, 

03:19:33.026 --> 03:19:36.362
education changes, and 
technology changes

03:19:39.524 --> 03:19:44.156
, and now, it began as teacher's
 domain at WGBH, went to PBS as 

03:19:44.157 --> 03:19:47.631
learning media, a   fabulous 
digital library, the central hub

03:19:48.798 --> 03:19:52.259
 for all the educational content
 produced by all the PBS brands,

03:19:53.397 --> 03:19:57.859
 and it now reaches more than 2 
million educators, which is 

03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:04.646
amazing, and WGBH is the stem 
lead for PBSLM, and Nova itself 

03:20:04.647 --> 03:20:09.290
has contributed more than 900 
resources, mainly video clips, 

03:20:09.291 --> 03:20:14.947
lots of animation, and these are
 all contextualized with, um, 

03:20:14.948 --> 03:20:17.291
teaching standards and 
discussion questions and 

03:20:17.292 --> 03:20:21.915
background essays, and we 
promote these, um, clips really 

03:20:23.076 --> 03:20:27.319
 rigorously to teachers at 
conferences.  We also create new

03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:31.478
 digital content, like Nova Labs
, which is a platform of science

03:20:31.479 --> 03:20:36.146
 games and interactives that 
uses real scientific data, and 

03:20:36.147 --> 03:20:40.850
these are actually, they were 
originally designed for teens to

03:20:40.851 --> 03:20:45.566
 use at home and, you  know, not
 as an in-school activity, but 

03:20:45.567 --> 03:20:49.018
they turned out to be really 
popular with teachers, which, 

03:20:49.019 --> 03:20:52.481
um, which use them all the time 
and actually assign them to 

03:20:52.482 --> 03:20:55.926
their students to do as 
homework.  So, to date, that 

03:20:55.927 --> 03:20:59.379
platform has engaged nearly more
 than 4 million unique  viewers,

03:21:00.581 --> 03:21:04.073
 and our education lab, and I 
just find this amazing, is Nova

03:21:05.224 --> 03:21:09.975
's most visited page, so I find 
that amazing.  We have an 

03:21:09.976 --> 03:21:14.605
upcoming  two-hour program on 
black holes, which is  hosted by

03:21:15.793 --> 03:21:21.606
 astrophysicist, Jana Levin, and
 to go with that, we create an 

03:21:21.607 --> 03:21:23.952
iPad app that allows players to 
navigate the

03:21:29.170 --> 03:21:34.903
 cosmos by hurling stars at 
various sulest real objects.  

03:21:34.904 --> 03:21:40.564
That's what we call our our 
educational content, whether 

03:21:40.565 --> 03:21:44.052
formal or informal, but science 
is for everyone, and so is Nova,

03:21:45.201 --> 03:21:52.179
 and, so, of course, I love it 
when people tell me I went into 

03:21:52.180 --> 03:21:55.675
science or  engineering as a 
result of watching Nova, but 

03:21:55.676 --> 03:22:01.297
really, we want to stoke 
curiosity and excitement about 

03:22:01.298 --> 03:22:04.821
science in people of all ages.  
So, we have a very rich historic

03:22:04.822 --> 03:22:08.338
 archive that chronicles 
scientific research over four 

03:22:08.339 --> 03:22:11.920
decades.  If you want to know 
the origins of genetic 

03:22:11.921 --> 03:22:13.921
engineering or

03:22:15.100 --> 03:22:18.665
 how artificial intelligence got
 started, we've been covering 

03:22:18.666 --> 03:22:22.135
that throughout the 20th century
 and now  the 21st century on 

03:22:22.136 --> 03:22:25.612
Nova, and at any given time, we 
have about a hundred full-length

03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:31.479
 programs available to everyone 
to watch online on PBS.org for 

03:22:31.480 --> 03:22:36.112
free.  We also reach out into 
the community.  We've created a 

03:22:36.113 --> 03:22:41.910
coalition of science, um, cafes,
 more than 400 of them, and we 

03:22:41.911 --> 03:22:47.324
ourselves, every month at WGBH's
 studio at the Boston Public 

03:22:47.325 --> 03:22:50.809
Library, we hold a science cafe 
for anyone who wants to come, 

03:22:50.810 --> 03:22:54.973
and these science cafes are 
usually held at, um,  

03:22:54.974 --> 03:22:57.291
non-traditional settings.  
They're a chance for people to 

03:22:57.292 --> 03:23:00.800
actually interact with real  
scientists, and it's really kind

03:23:00.801 --> 03:23:04.330
 of amazing to know how many 
people in their daily life don't

03:23:04.331 --> 03:23:09.028
 get a chance to really meet a 
scientist and talk to them, and 

03:23:09.029 --> 03:23:14.511
I think that's why people get 
very wrong ideas about 

03:23:14.512 --> 03:23:17.989
scientists and about science, 
and, so, and people really enjoy

03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:22.598
 these settings when they're 
held, and an example of this is 

03:23:22.599 --> 03:23:27.824
we also, of our reaching out 
into the community is our 

03:23:27.825 --> 03:23:30.165
program, School of the Future, 
which actually looked at the 

03:23:30.166 --> 03:23:32.166
issue of the

03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:34.513
 educational equity and what 
kinds of new techniques and 

03:23:34.514 --> 03:23:42.396
technologies can be used to help
 equalize things.  We organized 

03:23:42.397 --> 03:23:47.007
293 community screenings at K12 
settings, at community 

03:23:47.008 --> 03:23:50.546
organizations, and really, all 
over the place, and people came,

03:23:50.547 --> 03:23:55.406
 and they really engaged in the 
discussion of how education can 

03:23:55.407 --> 03:23:59.156
be made better for everyone.  
And finally, and this really 

03:23:59.157 --> 03:24:02.488
touches the point that you made,
 Jennifer, we want people from 

03:24:02.489 --> 03:24:06.925
all backgrounds to appreciate 
the importance of science in our

03:24:08.076 --> 03:24:13.845
 lives and the crucial role that
 science literacy plays in a 

03:24:13.846 --> 03:24:17.300
democracy.  And now, CPB, with 
their help, we've been able to 

03:24:17.301 --> 03:24:20.790
develop short-form video that 
explains the science behind many

03:24:20.791 --> 03:24:24.275
 of the stories that are 
dominating the news cycle.  If 

03:24:24.276 --> 03:24:30.018
you, um, and embedded on all of 
our work is the mandate that we 

03:24:30.019 --> 03:24:34.636
have in public media, to reflect
 the diversity of all people and

03:24:34.637 --> 03:24:39.249
 experiences in our country.  We
 are a hundred percent committed

03:24:39.250 --> 03:24:43.878
 to increasing diversity in 
front of and behind the camera, 

03:24:43.879 --> 03:24:48.570
by actively cultivating both 
producers and scientists of 

03:24:48.571 --> 03:24:52.125
color, and I really invite you 
to take a look at any current 

03:24:52.126 --> 03:24:55.563
Nova, and you'll be able to see 
what we're doing, but equally 

03:24:55.564 --> 03:25:00.065
important to  that, we're 
actually expanding the scope of 

03:25:00.066 --> 03:25:05.921
the stories we tell, focusing 
more on the ways that science 

03:25:05.922 --> 03:25:12.524
impacts social justice.  In our 
episode last spring, poise 

03:25:12.525 --> 03:25:14.913
poison water, about the Flint, 
Michigan water crisis is an 

03:25:14.914 --> 03:25:20.613
example of that, with all its 
associated content, and I also 

03:25:20.614 --> 03:25:25.273
believe that this really 
illustrates the importance of 

03:25:25.274 --> 03:25:29.885
education being embedded in a 
production unit like Nova.  Our 

03:25:29.886 --> 03:25:35.710
education director, Ralph Bukae,
 who taught biology in an inner 

03:25:35.711 --> 03:25:38.084
city high school in Philadelphia
 and can really share that 

03:25:38.085 --> 03:25:41.618
experience with all of us, he 
has a leadership role in our 

03:25:41.619 --> 03:25:46.289
unit, and not only does this 
integration drive many of our 

03:25:46.290 --> 03:25:48.605
initiatives, but the lessons 
that we

03:25:51.782 --> 03:25:53.825
 learn in educational and 
digital and broadcast go back 

03:25:53.826 --> 03:25:58.529
and forth, and they are all 
enriched by this integration, 

03:25:58.530 --> 03:26:03.119
and that helps us better to 
serve the American people.  

03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:05.120
Thank you.
(Applause.)

03:26:11.341 --> 03:26:14.837
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Kathryn, you've 
studied children's television 

03:26:14.838 --> 03:26:18.283
and Sesame Street in real depth,
 and you've learned a lot about 

03:26:18.284 --> 03:26:22.873
the role of the series and 
educating preschoolers, but 

03:26:22.874 --> 03:26:26.003
through your work and through 
the particular angles that you 

03:26:26.004 --> 03:26:29.468
have approached Sesame Street, 
you've learned a lot about our 

03:26:29.469 --> 03:26:32.956
society as well, and could you 
share some of your observations 

03:26:32.957 --> 03:26:34.798
with us?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  I think I'm 

03:26:34.799 --> 03:26:38.818
here to represent the generation
 that did grow up on  PBS.

03:26:38.819 --> 03:26:41.093
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And, um, and my 

03:26:41.094 --> 03:26:43.406
education, of course, started 
with Sesame Street and is 

03:26:43.407 --> 03:26:45.709
continuing with Sesame Street 
through my graduate school, and 

03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:48.020
now in my teaching.
(Laughing.)

03:26:48.021 --> 03:26:53.312
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I just never 
stopped watching it.  Um, so, 

03:26:53.313 --> 03:26:56.813
I've been asked to talk about 
public broadcasting as history, 

03:26:56.814 --> 03:27:00.275
and that's why I use Sesame 
Street as a historical source, 

03:27:00.276 --> 03:27:03.768
but so much of public 
broadcasting, of course, can be 

03:27:03.769 --> 03:27:08.230
used as historical sources, and 
the way that we often think 

03:27:08.231 --> 03:27:12.853
about that is that public 
broadcasting recorded our past, 

03:27:12.854 --> 03:27:16.307
um, the public affairs shows, 
the talk shows, recordings of 

03:27:16.308 --> 03:27:22.085
great performances, um, are now 
an archive of our history, and 

03:27:22.086 --> 03:27:26.691
that is true, but as a scholar 
and as a teacher, I am more 

03:27:26.692 --> 03:27:29.820
interested in  thinking about 
the ways that public  

03:27:29.821 --> 03:27:33.267
broadcasting our history because
 it is a forum, a vehicle, a 

03:27:33.268 --> 03:27:35.552
tool through which we seek to 
understand our past and our 

03:27:35.553 --> 03:27:39.240
present and shape our future.  I
 think this is a theme that's 

03:27:39.241 --> 03:27:42.711
been running throughout all the 
panels this afternoon, the theme

03:27:42.712 --> 03:27:49.213
 of democatization and 
interactivity, so this happens, 

03:27:49.214 --> 03:27:55.447
um, from both angles, from the 
producers, as well as from the 

03:27:55.448 --> 03:27:58.901
audiences.  From the producers, 
the way that they approach their

03:27:58.902 --> 03:28:02.363
 programs, they don't just 
report the news, they analyze 

03:28:02.364 --> 03:28:05.816
it, they don't just ask boiler 
plate questions of celebrities, 

03:28:05.817 --> 03:28:07.817
they engage them in a 
conversation that can take

03:28:10.151 --> 03:28:15.436
 any turn, even, um, almost 
coming to physical blows.  Um, 

03:28:15.437 --> 03:28:22.255
Lloyd Morrisett did not just use
 television to teach letters and

03:28:22.256 --> 03:28:26.748
  numbers, they designed a 
program that reflected

03:28:29.927 --> 03:28:32.198
flected -- they built the 
program to be able to evolve and

03:28:32.199 --> 03:28:35.680
 to, um, be responsive to  
society's changing educational 

03:28:35.681 --> 03:28:41.336
needs and cultural needs.  So, 
all of these programs, they're 

03:28:41.337 --> 03:28:45.944
not just series of short 
conversations or presentations, 

03:28:45.945 --> 03:28:49.934
rather they are decades-long 
conversations between producers 

03:28:49.935 --> 03:28:56.651
and audiences about issues that 
matter to us.  So, public 

03:28:56.652 --> 03:29:02.797
broadcasting creates, in 
particular creates a really rich

03:29:02.798 --> 03:29:07.314
 record of these discussions of 
these long conversations, 

03:29:07.315 --> 03:29:10.762
because its funding comes from 
the government and philanthropic

03:29:10.763 --> 03:29:14.206
 foundations, um, and viewers 
like you --

03:29:14.207 --> 03:29:16.527
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Producers and 

03:29:16.528 --> 03:29:19.963
stations constantly have to 
articulate to their  audiences 

03:29:19.964 --> 03:29:22.873
and to their funders what 
they're doing, why they're doing

03:29:22.874 --> 03:29:26.326
 it like that, and what impact 
it's having.  This creates a 

03:29:26.327 --> 03:29:32.982
paper trail that is amazing for 
historians.  Um, because public 

03:29:32.983 --> 03:29:37.083
broadcasting is for the people 
and, um, it's mobilizing this 

03:29:37.084 --> 03:29:42.294
technology, not for advertisers,
 but for the audiences 

03:29:42.295 --> 03:29:46.935
themselves, educators, social 
activists, have, through the 

03:29:46.936 --> 03:29:51.113
years, felt that they could and 
should make their voices heard 

03:29:51.114 --> 03:29:55.555
in public media as a 
collaborative effort to improve 

03:29:55.556 --> 03:30:01.017
programs or to use public 
broadcasting as a tool for 

03:30:01.018 --> 03:30:03.018
broader social change.  So, they
 do talk back to their

03:30:05.362 --> 03:30:11.747
 televisions, as Nicholas 
Johnson suggested, suggested.   

03:30:11.748 --> 03:30:14.021
So, in the case of Sesame 
Street, the producers and the 

03:30:14.022 --> 03:30:18.635
audiences agreed that the show 
should provide models for ideal 

03:30:18.636 --> 03:30:25.138
community  interactions, but as 
Lloyd was just talking about, 

03:30:25.139 --> 03:30:28.627
there's a lot going on in the 
60s and the 70s.  There's civil 

03:30:28.628 --> 03:30:32.086
rights, cultural pride 
movements, proliferating and 

03:30:32.087 --> 03:30:35.566
fragmenting in the 1970s, so all
 of these people who are 

03:30:35.567 --> 03:30:39.040
invested in Sesame Street in 
some way don't agree on what 

03:30:39.041 --> 03:30:44.641
that ideal community should look
 like or sound like, how those 

03:30:44.642 --> 03:30:48.175
people should behave.  So, cast 
members, staff, parents,  

03:30:48.176 --> 03:30:52.649
critics, advocacy groups, like 
the National  Organization Group

03:30:52.650 --> 03:30:58.274
 of Women had ongoing 
discussions about how characters

03:30:59.442 --> 03:31:03.467
 should speak, what musical 
guests to feature, how to 

03:31:03.468 --> 03:31:07.795
represent and celebrate 
diversity without perpetuating 

03:31:07.796 --> 03:31:11.238
stereotypes, and there was no 
easy answers, and luckily, 

03:31:11.239 --> 03:31:14.693
Sesame Street is a variety show,
 so they could sort of do, 

03:31:14.694 --> 03:31:19.383
experiment with all these things
 at the same time and see what 

03:31:19.384 --> 03:31:23.831
worked.  So, but this  
engagement with social issues 

03:31:23.832 --> 03:31:31.603
also happens long after the 
program's first air, and it's, 

03:31:31.604 --> 03:31:37.412
it has become cliche to say that
 documentaries bring the past to

03:31:37.413 --> 03:31:43.178
 life, but they certainly do in 
my classroom, not just 

03:31:43.179 --> 03:31:47.502
metaphorically, but, um, these 
programs often have the power to

03:31:47.503 --> 03:31:50.472
 continue the traditions that 
they discuss.  The first episode

03:31:50.473 --> 03:31:53.340
 of Eyes on the Prize, for 
example, it's called Awakenings,

03:31:53.341 --> 03:31:57.809
 and it shows how media  
coverage of the lynchings, um, 

03:31:57.810 --> 03:32:03.615
lynching of Emmett Till and the 
sham trial that allowed his 

03:32:03.616 --> 03:32:09.805
murderers to go free led to a, 
um, public consciousness about 

03:32:09.806 --> 03:32:16.783
the conditions of Jim Crow and 
it inspired Civil Rights 

03:32:16.784 --> 03:32:20.080
actions.  Watching the 
documentary itself is a  

03:32:20.081 --> 03:32:22.383
consciousness-raising experience
 for my students, and there's no

03:32:22.384 --> 03:32:25.859
 more powerful demonstration for
 why so many people risked their

03:32:27.001 --> 03:32:30.454
 lives for Civil Rights.  One 
episode of the American 

03:32:30.455 --> 03:32:33.898
Experience series on Latino 
Americans covers the 1968 

03:32:33.899 --> 03:32:37.957
walk-outs through which the high
 school students took control of

03:32:37.958 --> 03:32:41.437
 their education and sought to 
understand their place, the 

03:32:41.438 --> 03:32:44.904
place of themselves in their 
families in American history and

03:32:44.905 --> 03:32:47.197
 American society, and for one 
of my students a couple of years

03:32:48.355 --> 03:32:50.684
 ago, she had heard about the 
walk-outs from her mother who 

03:32:50.685 --> 03:32:56.469
had participated in them, but to
 see, um, those events depicted 

03:32:56.470 --> 03:33:03.429
on  national television, in a 
U.S. history survey class, um, 

03:33:03.430 --> 03:33:06.944
did the same thing for her, it 
inspired her to take her own 

03:33:06.945 --> 03:33:11.392
education into her own hands 
and, um, figure out her place in

03:33:12.539 --> 03:33:16.027
 society.  So, um, public 
television, we're here talking 

03:33:16.028 --> 03:33:20.656
about preservation, public 
television and radio need to be 

03:33:20.657 --> 03:33:22.957
preserved, not just because they
 have recorded our history, 

03:33:22.958 --> 03:33:27.625
because they continue to be the 
material that we use every day 

03:33:27.626 --> 03:33:33.455
to engage with our past or our  
future, shape our future.

03:33:33.456 --> 03:33:35.456
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Absolutely.
(Applause.)

03:33:39.627 --> 03:33:41.956
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think your 
comments underscore what has 

03:33:41.957 --> 03:33:46.637
been said too at some of the 
other panels about the 

03:33:46.638 --> 03:33:50.093
incredible importance of the 
material, not just during the 

03:33:50.094 --> 03:33:54.684
time that it is broadcast, but 
its archival  value into the 

03:33:54.685 --> 03:33:58.201
future.  Um, before we come back
 to preservation, I'd like to go

03:33:58.202 --> 03:34:02.811
 back to Lloyd for a quick 
question that relates to your  

03:34:02.812 --> 03:34:06.319
background in psychology too, 
and that is that, um, for 

03:34:06.320 --> 03:34:10.956
example, a national study 
recently revealed that 50 

03:34:10.957 --> 03:34:14.290
percent of American children 
under the age of 18 have 

03:34:14.291 --> 03:34:18.954
experienced a  traumatic event, 
such as witnessing violent acts 

03:34:18.955 --> 03:34:24.575
or experiencing natural 
disasters.  Last month, Sesame 

03:34:24.576 --> 03:34:29.180
Street, Sesame Workshop launched
 an initiative to help children 

03:34:29.181 --> 03:34:32.699
cope with these traumatic 
experiences, and Sesame Street 

03:34:32.700 --> 03:34:37.306
puppets have often in the past 
been used to help children talk 

03:34:37.307 --> 03:34:42.993
about events, like a death in 
the family or divorce, and when 

03:34:42.994 --> 03:34:48.604
you and Joan were starting 
Sesame, did you envision this 

03:34:48.605 --> 03:34:53.264
kind of therapeutic role for the
 series in its early days, or 

03:34:53.265 --> 03:34:55.608
did that, is that something that
 evolved?

03:34:55.609 --> 03:35:00.270
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It evolved.  The 
early days, the question we were

03:35:00.271 --> 03:35:05.873
 tasked with answering, can 
television teach anything?  We 

03:35:05.874 --> 03:35:11.671
had to answer that with a 
positive in order to gain more  

03:35:11.672 --> 03:35:13.998
funding.
(Laughing.)

03:35:13.999 --> 03:35:18.671
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, that was the 
hard work of it.  So, initially,

03:35:18.672 --> 03:35:20.672
 we concentrated on thing

03:35:24.061 --> 03:35:28.739
 things that were taught in 
school, or needed to be taught 

03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:32.207
in school, letters, numbers, so 
on, and could it be easily 

03:35:32.208 --> 03:35:35.685
measured.  Those were the things
 we were really trying to look 

03:35:35.686 --> 03:35:38.062
at, and fortunately, the study 
that came out showed that people

03:35:38.063 --> 03:35:43.807
 that watched more, learned 
more.  With that started, with 

03:35:43.808 --> 03:35:46.129
the confidence that we were 
going to be able to continue, 

03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:49.648
once we got a second season's 
funding, we then began to 

03:35:49.649 --> 03:35:53.114
broaden the curriculum to take 
into account some of the things 

03:35:53.115 --> 03:36:02.217
that you're talking about, 
although the, um, the real 

03:36:02.218 --> 03:36:07.973
change probably came much later.
  The military families project 

03:36:07.974 --> 03:36:13.762
was probably the most important 
change in that regard, and now, 

03:36:13.763 --> 03:36:19.214
of course, as you mentioned, 
traumatic events

03:36:22.357 --> 03:36:24.669
, autism would be another 
example, where we would not have

03:36:24.670 --> 03:36:28.164
 been able to do that initially,
 but as the program evolved, we 

03:36:28.165 --> 03:36:32.856
have been able to do more of it.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  All right.

03:36:32.857 --> 03:36:34.017
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'd like to address
 that issue.

03:36:34.018 --> 03:36:36.332
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Please.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Of can television 

03:36:36.333 --> 03:36:38.624
teach anything, because I think 
it's really an important 

03:36:38.625 --> 03:36:42.125
question, and it's very 
important for  Nova, in a way, 

03:36:42.126 --> 03:36:44.126
because part of our, you know,

03:36:46.449 --> 03:36:49.923
 we were, you know, 40 years 
ago, and we're still discussing 

03:36:49.924 --> 03:36:54.175
it, is is our primary function 
to educate or to entertain, and 

03:36:54.176 --> 03:36:56.501
we're always kind of talking 
about how you blend those two 

03:36:56.502 --> 03:37:02.798
things, but when you think back 
to your own science classes and 

03:37:02.799 --> 03:37:06.341
how the teacher was always 
talking about things that you 

03:37:06.342 --> 03:37:09.820
couldn't understand what he or 
she was talking about, because 

03:37:09.821 --> 03:37:13.305
you couldn't visualize it, you 
had absolutely no frame of 

03:37:13.306 --> 03:37:21.368
reference for it, and I think 
it's one of the huge values to 

03:37:21.369 --> 03:37:30.191
PBS  Learning Media and to their
 huge stem collection, because 

03:37:30.192 --> 03:37:34.854
it helps, it provides visuals, 
so when you're talking about a 

03:37:34.855 --> 03:37:42.691
volcano and what's going on, the
 molten magnum under the Earth, 

03:37:42.692 --> 03:37:44.992
who really knows what that means
 when you're a kid?  But here, 

03:37:44.993 --> 03:37:48.442
you can have an animation, and 
it can be contextualized by your

03:37:49.617 --> 03:37:54.244
 teacher, because there are, you
 know, the archive helps.  So, I

03:37:54.245 --> 03:38:01.042
 really, I just think, in terms 
of science, visuals are just so 

03:38:01.043 --> 03:38:06.709
 important, and they also help 
both kids and everyone take the 

03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:10.198
world from another  perspective.
  They're designed to show you 

03:38:10.199 --> 03:38:14.856
things that you can't see for 
yourself, and that, in a way, 

03:38:14.857 --> 03:38:19.355
expands your world, and that, to
 me, is just really one of the 

03:38:19.356 --> 03:38:24.978
benefits of the educational uses
 of our material and of the fact

03:38:24.979 --> 03:38:27.318
 that we are fortunate enough to
 be able to produce these things

03:38:28.484 --> 03:38:32.946
 and have the resources to do 
so, even though it's always a 

03:38:32.947 --> 03:38:36.422
struggle in the first place.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And you've had, in 

03:38:36.423 --> 03:38:39.891
many  cases, the nature of your 
funding from places like the 

03:38:39.892 --> 03:38:44.362
National Science Foundation, or 
the funding that you've received

03:38:46.542 --> 03:38:50.004
 or Sesame Workshop has received
 has required rigorous 

03:38:50.005 --> 03:38:55.826
evaluation, right, and testing 
as part of the proving that it 

03:38:55.827 --> 03:39:00.451
has this educational benefit.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Oh, rigorous 

03:39:00.452 --> 03:39:02.738
evaluation.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And costly.

03:39:02.739 --> 03:39:06.234
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But it's not, you 
know, now, one thing that the 

03:39:06.235 --> 03:39:09.689
National Science Foundation, and
 actually, a lot of other 

03:39:09.690 --> 03:39:11.994
funders are going off to is they
 want you to use your material 

03:39:11.995 --> 03:39:15.473
not just to evaluate it, to see 
if it's any good, but they 

03:39:15.474 --> 03:39:21.120
wanted they want it to add to 
the body of learning of how 

03:39:21.121 --> 03:39:26.992
people learn from the visual 
media, whether they get more out

03:39:26.993 --> 03:39:30.433
 of an  hour-long documentary, 
whether they get more out of 

03:39:30.434 --> 03:39:32.751
short-form video, what the 
difference  is, what the 

03:39:32.752 --> 03:39:37.385
difference is in their attitudes
 towards science, so we're 

03:39:37.386 --> 03:39:41.978
really accumulating with some of
 our projects, and we're working

03:39:41.979 --> 03:39:46.702
 with academics on this, because
 we're not, I mean, I'm a TV 

03:39:46.703 --> 03:39:51.323
producer, trust me, I couldn't 
begin to figure out how to do 

03:39:51.324 --> 03:39:55.928
these projects, but to use them 
to really understand the 

03:39:55.929 --> 03:39:59.410
fundamentals of science 
learning, and it's very 

03:39:59.411 --> 03:40:00.552
gratifying that our material can
 be used for that.

03:40:00.553 --> 03:40:02.864
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Right.  Kathryn, 
you had mentioned to me a little

03:40:04.011 --> 03:40:06.303
 earlier that in addition to the
 audio visual materials being so

03:40:07.474 --> 03:40:10.955
 incredibly important, that 
there are other resources, like 

03:40:10.956 --> 03:40:14.456
the kind that Paula just 
mentioned, or the notes from the

03:40:14.457 --> 03:40:18.929
 creation of a program work that
 producers do that they might 

03:40:18.930 --> 03:40:23.580
just think is a real throw-away,
 that some of that has archival 

03:40:23.581 --> 03:40:28.050
value for scholars like you.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes.  I've been 

03:40:28.051 --> 03:40:30.051
using, um,

03:40:33.341 --> 03:40:37.276
 the Sesame Street's research 
notes too.  I'm struck by the 

03:40:37.277 --> 03:40:41.476
parallels between the studies 
and the outreach that Nova and 

03:40:41.477 --> 03:40:45.492
Sesame Street have had.  They're
 also a paper trail for learning

03:40:45.493 --> 03:40:49.649
 about how we learn from media, 
learning about what, um, the 

03:40:49.650 --> 03:40:54.224
history of the discipline of 
psychology or education or 

03:40:54.225 --> 03:40:57.288
whoever's doing these studies, 
um, is

03:41:00.515 --> 03:41:04.644
, and they're also fun for me to
 look at from a humanities 

03:41:04.645 --> 03:41:09.056
perspective, because you do have
 certain things that you're 

03:41:09.057 --> 03:41:11.360
testing for your show, but that 
doesn't mean that's all we can 

03:41:11.361 --> 03:41:17.148
learn from that data.  So, I go 
in and read it from a 

03:41:17.149 --> 03:41:21.663
historian's point of view and 
find completely different 

03:41:21.664 --> 03:41:27.105
information about, for instance,
 cultural differences between 

03:41:27.106 --> 03:41:30.428
the Spanish-speaking and English
 English-speaking kids, about 

03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:34.994
how they're responding to music,
 which is not what was being 

03:41:34.995 --> 03:41:39.459
tested, it was how they were 
learning the Spanish language, 

03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:43.936
but there's more information 
there than is used in your 

03:41:43.937 --> 03:41:47.406
studies.  So, your studies have 
broader impact beyond what 

03:41:47.407 --> 03:41:51.988
you're doing with them.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And as we talk 

03:41:51.989 --> 03:41:53.989
about these

03:41:55.219 --> 03:41:58.665
, preserving content and 
material from public media and 

03:41:58.666 --> 03:42:00.996
these documents, I also want to 
mention that we probably haven't

03:42:00.997 --> 03:42:05.434
 represented fully enough the 
broadest range of public  media,

03:42:05.435 --> 03:42:11.088
 because there's also culture 
and the arts, and there is so 

03:42:11.089 --> 03:42:15.763
much, I think, in terms of 
performance program, cultural 

03:42:15.764 --> 03:42:18.064
programs that are created by 
producers, both at the national 

03:42:18.065 --> 03:42:23.726
and local level, and so I also 
want to bring that into the 

03:42:23.727 --> 03:42:28.204
discussion, as well as, um, 
public media creating a really, 

03:42:28.205 --> 03:42:33.858
really robust archive of local 
content.  Most public media 

03:42:33.859 --> 03:42:37.319
stations and public radio really
 do an incredible amount at the 

03:42:37.320 --> 03:42:39.649
local level, and so there's a 
wealth of material and a history

03:42:40.789 --> 03:42:45.421
 of communities that's being 
created there as well.  Now, we 

03:42:45.422 --> 03:42:51.031
have talked, though, about 
reaching the youngest viewers, 

03:42:51.032 --> 03:42:55.453
and we've also talked about 
adults, in many ways, although I

03:42:55.454 --> 03:43:00.072
 must say that you're going far 
beyond adults, when I look at 

03:43:00.073 --> 03:43:06.269
slimy, gross science programs 
that Nova is apart of.

03:43:06.270 --> 03:43:08.291
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Gross science.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes, gross science.

03:43:08.292 --> 03:43:10.570
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Call it what it is.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, or some of 

03:43:10.571 --> 03:43:14.024
your other programs that are, 
you know, what makes you vomit, 

03:43:14.025 --> 03:43:15.779
you know.
(Laughing.)

03:43:15.780 --> 03:43:18.069
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It's your body, 
you've got to understand it.

03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:21.546
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  So, I could 
imagine you attracting a much 

03:43:21.547 --> 03:43:25.572
broader age range, but that has 
been one of the challenges, I 

03:43:25.573 --> 03:43:29.052
think, that has plagued public 
media for a number of years, and

03:43:29.053 --> 03:43:32.303
 I want to start with you, 
Lloyd, and just going back to 

03:43:32.304 --> 03:43:35.790
the question of did Sesame  
Workshop, as the children's 

03:43:35.791 --> 03:43:41.574
television  workshop, what 
efforts were made in the sort of

03:43:41.575 --> 03:43:44.896
 earlier years in trying to go 
beyond  preschoolers and to 

03:43:44.897 --> 03:43:50.553
reach the pre-teens and 
teenagers?

03:43:50.554 --> 03:43:52.876
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, as Paula has 
mentioned, in producing a 

03:43:52.877 --> 03:43:56.337
television show, you have to 
attract the audience, as well as

03:43:56.338 --> 03:44:02.087
 teach them something, and, so, 
Sesame Street was designed in 

03:44:02.088 --> 03:44:05.549
the beginning, I need to start 
that again.  The viewing 

03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:10.787
conditions in 1969 are extremely
 different than they are today. 

03:44:10.788 --> 03:44:14.776
 In 1969, typically, families 
had one television set, the 

03:44:14.777 --> 03:44:17.936
family watched together, and the
 parents could act as an 

03:44:17.937 --> 03:44:21.442
intermediary between what was on
 the television set and what the

03:44:21.443 --> 03:44:28.208
 child learned, say, Johnny, did
 you see that A?  Or Johnny, 

03:44:28.209 --> 03:44:31.672
take a look at what's coming up 
next, it's going to be like, and

03:44:31.673 --> 03:44:33.977
 that gets Johnny's attention to
 something on the set that you 

03:44:33.978 --> 03:44:36.133
want to teach about

03:44:40.329 --> 03:44:45.348
.  Now, I think I saw that  
maybe 90 percent of adolescents 

03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:51.362
and above have smart phones, 
television sets are numerous, 

03:44:51.363 --> 03:44:55.457
and often, the child, at 
whatever age, 2 or 3 even, 

03:44:55.458 --> 03:44:58.295
controls the set himself or 
herself

03:45:01.449 --> 03:45:03.759
, so the problem of maintaining 
an audience and know what 

03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:07.248
audience you're really trying to
 reach is much harder.  I don't 

03:45:07.249 --> 03:45:11.640
think we've figured it out yet, 
but we certainly had the idea 

03:45:11.641 --> 03:45:14.782
from the beginning that the 
adults had to be attracted to 

03:45:14.783 --> 03:45:17.089
the program as well as their 
children.

03:45:17.090 --> 03:45:21.588
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I used to, like I 
said, 4:00 o'clock, I was pretty

03:45:21.589 --> 03:45:25.083
 tired, sit there, and we'd 
watch Sesame Street.  It 

03:45:25.084 --> 03:45:28.564
appealed to adults as well.  I 
mean, I felt like there were two

03:45:28.565 --> 03:45:31.882
 levels that it was operating on
.

03:45:31.883 --> 03:45:35.182
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  There were.  There 
was a very important precursor 

03:45:35.183 --> 03:45:40.976
to what we did.  We used a lot 
of the laugh-in techniques in 

03:45:40.977 --> 03:45:43.312
the early shows.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And I think it very

03:45:43.313 --> 03:45:47.810
  definitely did, one piece that
 I remember, I think it was 

03:45:47.811 --> 03:45:55.749
Patty Label singing I love my X,
 I miss my X, and there's, of 

03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:58.050
course, the letter X on the 
screen, but the look in her eyes

03:45:59.192 --> 03:46:01.192
  suggested otherwise.
(Laughing.)

03:46:02.355 --> 03:46:04.672
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, it seemed as if
 it was very consciously 

03:46:04.673 --> 03:46:06.967
designed to --
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It was.

03:46:06.968 --> 03:46:10.449
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  To work for both 
levels.

03:46:10.450 --> 03:46:12.761
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And the writers 
particularly enjoyed doing that.

03:46:12.762 --> 03:46:15.077
  They liked to write  
one-liners, and kids didn't get 

03:46:15.078 --> 03:46:18.532
it, but the adults did.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  But in terms of the

03:46:18.533 --> 03:46:25.457
 ages,  yes, I mean, we all 
worry in public media about an 

03:46:25.458 --> 03:46:28.932
aging audience.  I mean, it's, 
like,  discussed constantly, and

03:46:31.093 --> 03:46:33.424
 we sweat it  constantly.  We 
try to really figure it out, how

03:46:33.425 --> 03:46:36.889
 we can appeal to younger 
people.  Well, one thing we find

03:46:38.038 --> 03:46:41.348
 is that we have a very 
different audience online, that 

03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:44.778
the audience online is much 
younger, and, so, the idea is 

03:46:44.779 --> 03:46:49.234
that the audience online, we do 
know that they love to watch our

03:46:49.235 --> 03:46:52.408
 shows on their computer, they 
love short-form video, I guess 

03:46:52.409 --> 03:46:54.714
that's the whole thing about the
 attention span, I don't know, 

03:46:54.715 --> 03:47:00.268
but, um, they also like to watch
 our short-form videos, and if 

03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:05.275
we take them off, oh, our 
lawyers are right there, but I 

03:47:05.276 --> 03:47:08.748
have to say, in two minutes, 
they're pirated and put on  

03:47:08.749 --> 03:47:13.062
YouTube, and you take them down,
 and they go back up.  It is 

03:47:13.063 --> 03:47:20.145
really amazing.  So, I think 
this is a key to us; young 

03:47:20.146 --> 03:47:22.510
people we know do not have 
televisions, they don't watch 

03:47:22.511 --> 03:47:24.917
television that much, they watch
 on their  phone, they watch on 

03:47:24.918 --> 03:47:28.275
their computer.  The hope is

03:47:31.443 --> 03:47:35.862
 they will, youngsters do grow 
up, and very often, they have 

03:47:35.863 --> 03:47:40.540
families, and their life 
changes, and it starts to, um, 

03:47:40.541 --> 03:47:44.775
they start to realize the value 
of public media, and they start 

03:47:44.776 --> 03:47:50.396
to join their local station, and
 I think that there is, maybe 

03:47:50.397 --> 03:47:55.010
I'm just an optimist, but I 
think that, I think if we can 

03:47:55.011 --> 03:48:00.838
keep reaching out to them and 
hold them close to us by various

03:48:00.839 --> 03:48:08.478
 different forms of what we do, 
we will migrate them in a 

03:48:08.479 --> 03:48:11.915
direction that many of them will
 be watching our programs.  

03:48:11.916 --> 03:48:17.387
Maybe that's just optimistic.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think there's an 

03:48:17.388 --> 03:48:20.694
untapped potential for that 
middle audience between children

03:48:20.695 --> 03:48:28.589
 and adults.  Um, certainly, my 
students, they're adults, but 

03:48:28.590 --> 03:48:32.063
they, um, one of the things that
 I try to do with the document 

03:48:32.064 --> 03:48:36.698
documentaries is, that I show in
 class is to not just show a 

03:48:36.699 --> 03:48:40.144
documentary, but do something 
with it, and there are a few 

03:48:40.145 --> 03:48:42.423
documentaries that tell us 
something about the historical

03:48:45.587 --> 03:48:53.482
 profession.  My freshmen are 
watching A  Midwife's Tale, but,

03:48:54.624 --> 03:48:56.624
 um,

03:48:57.775 --> 03:49:04.295
 you can use these documentaries
 to teach about narrative 

03:49:04.296 --> 03:49:05.464
structure, since they use 
narrative structure, we just 

03:49:05.465 --> 03:49:08.914
heard, you can teach them about 
media literacy, which I think 

03:49:08.915 --> 03:49:13.348
is, um, a really important skill
 that they are not coming to 

03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:19.954
college with these days, and we 
need it more than ever.  Um, so,

03:49:21.773 --> 03:49:26.062
 there are creative ways to use 
these programs beyond simply the

03:49:26.063 --> 03:49:30.704
 formal education or informal 
education that they were 

03:49:30.705 --> 03:49:32.705
designed for

03:49:33.799 --> 03:49:34.964
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Jennifer, you 

03:49:34.965 --> 03:49:38.443
haven't said anything about it, 
but the title, preserving public

03:49:40.616 --> 03:49:42.932
 media, has two meanings

03:49:46.119 --> 03:49:53.002
.  It means archivaly, it also 
means continuing it, and we do 

03:49:53.003 --> 03:49:55.003
not

03:49:56.147 --> 03:50:01.917
 have Newt at the FCC, we do not
 have John Gardener, and I would

03:50:01.918 --> 03:50:04.754
 think there should be a 
considerable amount of concern 

03:50:04.755 --> 03:50:06.755
about the enduring

03:50:07.921 --> 03:50:12.380
 health under the current 
offices of public media.

03:50:12.381 --> 03:50:14.696
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I thought 
that it was really quite 

03:50:14.697 --> 03:50:16.985
heartening to hear, with some of
 the earlier panels who 

03:50:16.986 --> 03:50:21.289
addressed that, I thought it was
 really quite heartening to hear

03:50:21.290 --> 03:50:24.706
 their level of optimism about 
public broadcasting and its 

03:50:24.707 --> 03:50:28.779
future and its potential in that
 way, but I welcome your 

03:50:28.780 --> 03:50:31.119
thoughts about this.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I think, I 

03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:34.605
was going to say one thing, that
 I think, you know, we just 

03:50:34.606 --> 03:50:41.269
talked a minute or so about age.
  I mean, the hope is that the 

03:50:41.270 --> 03:50:44.453
American public will demand the 
preservation of public media.  

03:50:44.454 --> 03:50:47.920
You know, we have to have our 
fans out there, they are our 

03:50:47.921 --> 03:50:52.547
biggest asset, and I think many 
of you in this room will 

03:50:52.548 --> 03:50:58.081
remember, um, under a few years 
ago, decades ago, I don't even 

03:50:58.082 --> 03:51:01.304
remember when it was, in the 
90s, when public media was 

03:51:01.305 --> 03:51:04.390
really  threatened, and people 
wrote letters, millions of 

03:51:04.391 --> 03:51:08.248
letters, and said, no, 
absolutely not, you cannot take 

03:51:08.249 --> 03:51:12.256
this away from us.  That is our 
preservation, that is our 

03:51:12.257 --> 03:51:15.271
guarantee.  So, the concern I 
have is, yes, indeed, we want to

03:51:15.272 --> 03:51:20.656
 expand and get younger people, 
listen, I love my older viewers,

03:51:20.657 --> 03:51:23.775
 keep watching.
(Laughing.)

03:51:23.776 --> 03:51:26.090
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Oldies, but 
goodies.  I love you, okay?  

03:51:26.091 --> 03:51:29.602
Don't stop watching.  People are
 living longer and longer, so 

03:51:29.603 --> 03:51:33.127
it's great.  We do want to get 
younger people, but we also want

03:51:35.271 --> 03:51:37.590
 to get, and I know this is near
 and dear to your heart, we want

03:51:37.591 --> 03:51:42.519
 to get more diversity, not just
 because we're ethical people, 

03:51:42.520 --> 03:51:48.272
but also because that is our 
survival.  The American 

03:51:48.273 --> 03:51:54.027
demographic is changing, and we 
have to change with it, and my 

03:51:54.028 --> 03:51:59.671
job is to really find ways to 
and choose  topics that show 

03:51:59.672 --> 03:52:06.432
people science belongs to you, 
not just to me, not, listen, 

03:52:06.433 --> 03:52:12.063
science has been white, we all 
know that.  It's changing, it's 

03:52:12.064 --> 03:52:15.544
bringing many more minorities 
into it.  We used to tear our 

03:52:15.545 --> 03:52:19.038
hair out to try to find minority
 scientists to put on the 

03:52:19.039 --> 03:52:23.532
screen.  Now, it's really, you 
know, in some fields, it's 

03:52:23.533 --> 03:52:28.146
challenging, but in many, it's 
really not hard at all.  That's 

03:52:28.147 --> 03:52:32.773
great.  So, one way is to really
 make sure that we have 

03:52:32.774 --> 03:52:36.269
scientists of all different 
colors and all different 

03:52:36.270 --> 03:52:42.265
backgrounds on the screen.  
Another way is in the choice of 

03:52:42.266 --> 03:52:46.594
topics, that we have to choose 
topics that take into account 

03:52:46.595 --> 03:52:51.076
people's concerns, and, so,  
hopefully, this is not something

03:52:51.077 --> 03:52:53.388
 that's going to be 
accomplished.  We're not going 

03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:59.016
to expand our percentage of 
minorities from 9  or 10 percent

03:52:59.017 --> 03:53:02.530
 to 25 percent overnight, but my
 hope is that if we do it right,

03:53:03.700 --> 03:53:07.185
 we tell good stories, we're 
much more inclusive in topic 

03:53:07.186 --> 03:53:10.650
choice and people, that people 
will respond by watching.  You 

03:53:10.651 --> 03:53:16.428
know, when we took our show, 
poison water to Flint, and we 

03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:19.880
showed it in  Flint, and, you 
know, that community, it was, 

03:53:19.881 --> 03:53:24.346
the reaction was just so amazing
, that this group of people, 

03:53:24.347 --> 03:53:27.850
these people were citizen 
scientists, they did not wait 

03:53:27.851 --> 03:53:33.456
and rely on scientists to come 
in and do it for them, they 

03:53:33.457 --> 03:53:36.959
figured out more than the 
scientists in a lot of that 

03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:40.391
agencies what was going wrong 
with their pipes, and then to 

03:53:40.392 --> 03:53:46.101
see themselves  reflected in a 
documentary, how they had taken 

03:53:46.102 --> 03:53:52.202
a role in their own survival and
 the survival of their children,

03:53:52.203 --> 03:53:54.510
 I think they were really amazed
, and I think it gave them a 

03:53:54.511 --> 03:53:58.800
different feeling about public 
media, that it became theirs, 

03:53:58.801 --> 03:54:03.265
and, you know, it's not easy, 
there are not zillions of topics

03:54:03.266 --> 03:54:06.745
 that you can do it with, but I 
think it's imperative.

03:54:06.746 --> 03:54:10.227
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I want to come back
 to  Lloyd's, you know, really 

03:54:10.228 --> 03:54:13.683
appropriate question about 
preserving public media for the 

03:54:13.684 --> 03:54:18.324
future, but before I do that, I 
want to just also get your 

03:54:18.325 --> 03:54:21.821
thoughts, you know, we have just
 a quick minute, I want to get 

03:54:21.822 --> 03:54:26.404
your thoughts about, um, beyond 
the screen, because we've talked

03:54:26.405 --> 03:54:29.850
 about public broadcasting, and 
we're talking about 

03:54:29.851 --> 03:54:35.203
broadcasting, and I know that 
all of you are aware of public 

03:54:35.204 --> 03:54:39.576
media, and you do your work on 
so many other platforms as well,

03:54:39.577 --> 03:54:43.043
 and I just would welcome your 
speaking about the importance of

03:54:43.044 --> 03:54:46.510
 public media on those 
additional platforms.  I think 

03:54:46.511 --> 03:54:51.071
that you've spoken to that, you 
know, in a very articulate way, 

03:54:51.072 --> 03:54:57.811
Paula, about what Nova has been 
doing, but other thoughts about 

03:54:57.812 --> 03:55:00.141
beyond broadcast?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, we get, we 

03:55:00.142 --> 03:55:05.651
now get an enormous number of 
hits on YouTube, where we've 

03:55:05.652 --> 03:55:07.949
provided a lot of clips, so 
that's a reuse of something 

03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:12.539
that's been done before, but 
it's a very useful one.

03:55:12.540 --> 03:55:14.540
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, thoughtful

03:55:20.777 --> 03:55:22.788
 curation of the things that are
 available really helps the 

03:55:22.789 --> 03:55:25.772
professors that are at most 
colleges and universities that 

03:55:25.773 --> 03:55:29.793
have a lot of students and not a
 lot of time to prepare outside 

03:55:29.794 --> 03:55:35.465
of their fields in teaching, so 
I would say, yeah, it's 

03:55:35.466 --> 03:55:37.466
extremely important.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So so

03:55:40.879 --> 03:55:43.896
, like, with PBS Learning  
Media, where there's already the

03:55:43.897 --> 03:55:46.217
 thought given to what age 
group, what level, what the 

03:55:46.218 --> 03:55:48.553
topic is, all of these --
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If there are any --

03:55:48.554 --> 03:55:50.887
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Nicely tagged and 
everything.

03:55:50.888 --> 03:55:54.342
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes, properly 
tagged, and if there are --

03:55:54.343 --> 03:55:56.678
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Keywords.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If there are any 

03:55:56.679 --> 03:56:00.927
interactive things that can go 
along with, um, there used to be

03:56:00.928 --> 03:56:06.276
 an interactive game of 
pretending you were in the Gold 

03:56:06.277 --> 03:56:08.583
Rush and taking on a character 
and seeing if you survived, and 

03:56:08.584 --> 03:56:10.930
it took about two minutes to 
play, and it went along with the

03:56:10.931 --> 03:56:14.366
 documentary for the Gold Rush. 
 I can't find it anymore.  I 

03:56:14.367 --> 03:56:19.017
hope it's there.  It may have  
moved, or it may have just been 

03:56:19.018 --> 03:56:20.227
old, and  that's, of course, a 
problem.

03:56:20.228 --> 03:56:24.712
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You have to ask a 
10-year-old to find it for you. 

03:56:24.713 --> 03:56:26.994
 They won't have any problem at 
all.

03:56:26.995 --> 03:56:31.078
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, as a final 
question, just to come back to 

03:56:31.079 --> 03:56:36.744
this all-important point, we're 
at the end of this wonderful day

03:56:36.745 --> 03:56:42.491
 and all of these really very, 
very rich panels, um, what about

03:56:43.651 --> 03:56:48.111
 preserving public media for the
 future?

03:56:48.112 --> 03:56:52.582
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I would worry most 
about just not having the budget

03:56:54.737 --> 03:56:59.219
 go up.  Costs are going up for 
everything else, there are a lot

03:56:59.220 --> 03:57:02.410
 of things that the budget can 
be used for, and we just keep it

03:57:02.411 --> 03:57:08.406
 the same.  So, it's a, in my 
view, the strategy is slow 

03:57:08.407 --> 03:57:11.738
starvation.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I don't want to 

03:57:11.739 --> 03:57:13.739
starve.
(Laughing.)

03:57:14.786 --> 03:57:16.779
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  As I always say, 
I'm on the spending side, and I 

03:57:16.780 --> 03:57:20.233
like that side, but here is what
 I worry about, and you just 

03:57:20.234 --> 03:57:23.449
mentioned something I think is 
very important, which is the 

03:57:23.450 --> 03:57:29.779
non-broadcast aspect of series 
like the ones that we do, and I 

03:57:29.780 --> 03:57:32.125
know my, um, documentary friends
 from the previous panel will 

03:57:32.126 --> 03:57:38.411
really appreciate.  When we 
started our website  in 1996, we

03:57:38.412 --> 03:57:40.717
 just figured, okay, we'll just 
take the same stuff, and we'll 

03:57:40.718 --> 03:57:46.448
put it online, and maybe we'll, 
you know, put a few, you know, 

03:57:46.449 --> 03:57:51.783
it felt like it was just going 
to be a free addition to Nova.  

03:57:51.784 --> 03:57:57.463
Now, it's its own mouth to feed,
 and it's getting to be a 

03:57:57.464 --> 03:58:02.110
gigantic mouth, and, um, so, the
 question is, and it's so 

03:58:02.111 --> 03:58:05.578
important, because it is a way 
to attract so many people who 

03:58:05.579 --> 03:58:10.283
are not going to turn on the 
television set, and I think, we 

03:58:10.284 --> 03:58:16.023
certainly find it's much harder 
to raise money for digital than 

03:58:16.024 --> 03:58:18.372
it is to raise money for 
broadcast.  So, I think that's 

03:58:18.373 --> 03:58:21.886
something we really have to 
figure out and figure out with 

03:58:21.887 --> 03:58:25.340
the foundations and the other 
funders that have supported 

03:58:25.341 --> 03:58:30.027
public media in the past, 
because this is the new world.  

03:58:30.028 --> 03:58:32.322
This is it.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Kathryn?

03:58:32.323 --> 03:58:37.574
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, oftentimes, 
academics and broadcasters and 

03:58:37.575 --> 03:58:41.103
archivists live in different 
worlds, so I think we need more 

03:58:41.104 --> 03:58:45.580
events like this to bring all of
 us together, and that's the 

03:58:45.581 --> 03:58:49.120
first step, conversations like 
the one we've had today.

03:58:49.121 --> 03:58:51.121
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.
(Applause.)

03:58:57.302 --> 03:59:01.273
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We have one more 
element to this panel.  We're 

03:59:01.274 --> 03:59:07.020
going to let Newt Minno have the
 last word, but before we do, 

03:59:07.021 --> 03:59:09.436
first of all, my thanks to all 
of you, and to you, Jennifer, 

03:59:09.437 --> 03:59:14.619
for the work on this panel.  I 
hope you have found this 

03:59:14.620 --> 03:59:19.097
afternoon as fascinating as I 
have, being with these founders 

03:59:19.098 --> 03:59:24.753
of public media and creators of 
some of the most iconic and 

03:59:24.754 --> 03:59:29.384
important content in public 
media, and I'd be remiss if I 

03:59:29.385 --> 03:59:31.755
didn't take us back at the very 
end to the other meaning of the 

03:59:31.756 --> 03:59:36.369
word preserve and to talk, just 
a say a few words about the 

03:59:36.370 --> 03:59:38.655
American Archive of Public 
Broadcasting, although I can't 

03:59:38.656 --> 03:59:44.593
be quite as articulate as 
Kathryn was, I think, but we, 

03:59:44.594 --> 03:59:50.455
this is really the, um, archive 
of our times times, not just our

03:59:50.456 --> 03:59:53.957
 national times, as you heard, 
as Jennifer alluded to, but 

03:59:53.958 --> 03:59:58.290
also, the times of our 
communities, geographically 

03:59:58.291 --> 04:00:02.594
around the country from coast to
 coast, um, and culturally, and 

04:00:02.595 --> 04:00:06.084
believe me, um, local commercial
 broadcasters have not been able

04:00:06.085 --> 04:00:11.733
 to preserve their archives.  It
 has been too expensive for 

04:00:11.734 --> 04:00:16.204
them, it doesn't, you know, they
 had to reuse those tapes or 

04:00:16.205 --> 04:00:20.863
couldn't spend the staff time, 
given news cycles, and 

04:00:20.864 --> 04:00:24.372
especially now, given news 
cycles, endless news cycles, so,

04:00:25.538 --> 04:00:27.852
 um, commercial  broadcasters 
really have not, with a few 

04:00:27.853 --> 04:00:31.902
exceptions, been able to 
preserve their  archives.  It 

04:00:31.903 --> 04:00:35.794
just wasn't their business plan.
  So, it's more important than 

04:00:35.795 --> 04:00:40.083
ever that public media preserve 
its archives, and it's also a 

04:00:40.084 --> 04:00:43.558
very critical part of our 
mission that we make that 

04:00:43.559 --> 04:00:47.009
archive accessible.  It's been 
part of the core mission of 

04:00:47.010 --> 04:00:50.489
public media from the very 
beginning, that we make our work

04:00:52.249 --> 04:00:54.535
 available to everyone, no 
matter where they are, no matter

04:00:55.691 --> 04:00:59.041
 what their means are, their 
ability to pay, and especially, 

04:00:59.042 --> 04:01:03.410
in this universe now, where 
almost everything is behind a 

04:01:03.411 --> 04:01:07.757
pay wall in media else where.  
So, I'm very proud of the 

04:01:07.758 --> 04:01:13.734
progress we've been making 
through the American Archive of 

04:01:13.735 --> 04:01:16.059
Public Broadcasting to put these
 works up  online and make them 

04:01:16.060 --> 04:01:21.446
accessible.  Um, I want  to, as 
we close, make a special thank 

04:01:21.447 --> 04:01:24.920
you again to the two co-heads of
 the American Archive of Public 

04:01:24.921 --> 04:01:30.610
Broadcasting, Alan Gevinson in 
the back for the Library of 

04:01:30.611 --> 04:01:33.964
Congress.
(Applause.)

04:01:33.965 --> 04:01:38.481
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And Karen Cariani 
from WGBH, who shared the podium

04:01:39.636 --> 04:01:41.636
 with me.
(Applause.)

04:01:42.813 --> 04:01:46.347
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, following Newt
's last clip, which is, I think 

04:01:46.348 --> 04:01:52.565
you'll find fun, there is a 
reception in that room right 

04:01:52.566 --> 04:01:54.891
over there.  So, we thank you 
again for joining us, and we 

04:01:54.892 --> 04:01:58.369
welcome you to the reception, 
but first, the last word from 

04:01:58.370 --> 04:02:00.370
Newt.
