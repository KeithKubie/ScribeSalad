00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.910
We're told that the measure
of angle QPR-- so that's

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.860
this angle right over
here-- is 2x plus 122.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.220
And I'll assume that
these are in degrees.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.870
So it's 2x plus 122 degrees.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.800
And the measure of
angle RPS-- so that's

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.840
this angle right over here--
is 2x plus 22 degrees.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.840
And they ask us to find
the measure of angle RPS.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.617
So we need to figure out
this right over here.

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.200
So we would be able
to figure that out

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.010
if we just knew what x is.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.390
And lucky for us, we
can use the information

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.960
given to solve for
x and then figure

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.620
out what 2 times x plus 22 is.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.200
And the main big idea here,
the thing that pops out here,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.720
is that the outside rays
for both of these angle

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.930
form a line.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.210
These two angles form a line.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.006
You could say that
they are supplementary.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:56.630
Both of these angles
are supplementary.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.150
2x plus 22 plus another 2x plus
122 is going to add up to 180.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.350
We know that this entire angle
right over here is 180 degrees.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.200
So we can say that the measure
of angle QPR, this angle

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.090
right over here, 2x plus
122, plus the green angle,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.970
plus angle RPS-- so
plus 2x plus 22-- is

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.225
going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.690
And now we can start
simplifying this.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.510
We have two x's.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.100
We have another two x's.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.560
So those are going
to add up to be 4x.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.000
And then we have 122 plus 22.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.400
So that's going to be 144.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.710
And the sum of
those two are going

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.900
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.660
We can subtract 144
from both sides.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140
On the left-hand
side, we're just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.870
going to be left with a
4x, this 4x right here.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.530
And on the right-hand
side, we're

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.910
going to have-- let's see,
if we were subtracting 140,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.005
we would have 40 left.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:07.630
And then we have to
subtract another 4,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.410
so it's going to be 36.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.955
Divide both sides by 4,
and we get x is equal to 9.

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:18.330
Now remember,
we're not done yet.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.890
They didn't say solve for x.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
They said find the measure of
angle RPS, which is 2 times

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.530
x plus 22 or 2 times
9 plus 22, which

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.390
is 18 plus 22, which
is equal to 40.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.210
So the measure of angle
RPS is 40 degrees.
