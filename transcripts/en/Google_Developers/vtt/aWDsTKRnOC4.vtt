00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:02.970
KUNAL SONI: All right.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.960
I'm back.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.320
So so far, you've been hearing
a lot about cool product

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.250
initiatives,
features, tools, etc,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.550
that can help you
improve the quality

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.900
of your mobile presence.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.160
What we're going to do now
is something different.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.680
We're going to talk to a
set of industry leaders,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.280
practitioners who've
embraced mobile

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.030
and who've actually
built a very, very

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.560
solid, successful presence
across the platform.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.580
So without further
ado, please join me

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.030
in welcoming our panelists.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.700
First up we've got
Manish Agarwal.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.570
Manish is a CEO of
Nazara Games, one

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.400
of the largest gaming
publishers in the country today.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.300
Welcome, Manish.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.909
Manish is feeling
very happy these days.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.700
Two out of the top 10
titles on Google Play

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.986
right now belong to
Nazara, so good job.

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:59.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.710
Next up, we have
got Varun Khurana,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.080
who's the CTO of
Grofers, India's leading

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.276
online on-demand
delivery service.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.564
Grofers has about
12,000 suppliers, right?

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:15.730
VARUN KHURANA: That's right.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.510
KUNAL SONI: And services
about 35,000 orders a day.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.250
So great job.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.790
And finally, we've got
Deepak, Deepak Abbot.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.540
Deepak heads-- welcome, Deepak.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.410
Deepak is the head
of mobile growth

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.880
at Times Internet, which is a
digital arm of the Times Group.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.820
Deepak oversees
mobile initiatives

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610
for Gaana, "Economic
Times," "Times of India"

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.040
and a host of other apps which
are part of the umbrella.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.240
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.370
ALL: Thank you.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.130
KUNAL SONI: Great.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.750
So the way I was hoping that
we could do this was probably

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.060
have each of you
talk about one thing

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.460
that excites you about
the smartphone opportunity

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.830
in the country today,
and what's that one

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.802
big bet that you have for 2016.

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.010
Let's start with you, Deepak.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.801
DEEPAK ABBOT: Yeah.

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.360
I think sheer
numbers, India is yet

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.080
to actually see the
real revolution.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.970
70% are yet to come online,
so that's a big number,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.250
while we have 30% online,
which is 300 million,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.540
which is good enough
for us to create

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.150
some great things, great
games so that we've

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.770
got millions of users already.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.590
But 70% have yet to come online,
plus 200 million people who

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.950
are on 2G.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.980
They're yet to experience
faster internet.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.290
So once that happens, we
see the scale of growth

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.700
that you're seeing now
growing exponentially.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.269
So for me, I think that's what
excites me for years to come.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.185
KUNAL SONI: Fantastic.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:44.340
Varun, how about you?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
VARUN KHURANA: So in
our case, our use case

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.230
I think is fundamentally
very, very mobile.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.880
Because when you're ordering
groceries or things that you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.820
use on a day to day basis,
you realize most of the things

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.320
when you're probably in the
kitchen or somewhere else,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.240
right?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.310
So I think just the fundamental
use case of ours is very,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.120
very-- it is just a
smartphone use case,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.280
and-- which is the
biggest reason why

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.920
we're mobile only
till date continues

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.270
to be a part of our plan.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.310
And just the fact
that how smartphones

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.020
have been growing in India
across tier one is great.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.890
We're now in, like, 25
cities across India.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.780
And you know, we're kind
of continuously seeing

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.400
all the growth there, as well.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.850
So this presents a
great opportunity for us

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.740
to kind of take this use
case all across India.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.030
So you know that's--

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.150
KUNAL SONI: [INAUDIBLE] million
smartphones every month, right?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.390
That's, like, a huge number.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.376
VARUN KHURANA: Yeah.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:50.620
KUNAL SONI: All right, great.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.360
Manish?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.930
MANISH AGARWAL: I
think my biggest

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.610
bet is I believe that gaming is
going to be far bigger than TV,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.840
Bollywood, everything
here in this country,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.490
because it's a device which
you carry all the time.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.710
Share of time is highest,
snacky content is highest.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.460
I've been going to a lot of
forums of media entertainment

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.190
sector where gaming really
gets some shady corner.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.029
I believe that the biggest
bet, which a lot of people

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.540
are not really looking at, is
gaming becoming a mainstream

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.130
entertainment.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.850
That's the biggest bet
which is going to happen.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.430
And that's the
exciting opportunity

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.960
which, what Deepak
spoke about, millions

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.960
of smartphone data [INAUDIBLE]
are really going to happen.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.650
And you're seeing green
shoots of it already.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.140
For Nazara, the
biggest bet is we

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.590
believe that in entertainment,
content is local.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.270
In movies, it's local,
in TV, it's local.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.650
There is no reason
why on your Play Store

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.810
there should be any foreign
games in top 10, top 20.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.830
So my biggest bet
is I would love

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.610
to speak here in the
same conference in a year

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.480
and change that.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.610
That's my bet.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.250
KUNAL SONI: OK.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.600
Good.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.730
You've set the bar high.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.286
Good.

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:06.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.780
Tell me, so Manish,
just building on that,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.250
thinking about user
trends, you believe

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.390
that gaming is going to
be like a big opportunity.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.350
What are those one
or two user trends

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.380
that you've seen specifically
on smartphones that you

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.240
think will help that phenomena?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.930
MANISH AGARWAL: I think
a couple of things

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.340
from a gaming perspective.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.530
The Indian gamers are not the
gamers which a lot of people

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.070
think are the gamers of
US or Europe or wherever.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.900
We are not a gaming
nation, and we

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.780
are having our first brush
of gaming with smartphones.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.060
And hence, if any
of you are looking

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.710
at building games
for India, don't

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.700
get influenced by
your own likings,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.480
by your own things in which
you think that, hey, listen,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.380
I was playing this
quality of game on console

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.050
or I love "Clash of Clans,"
and hence I need to do that.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.690
Think of that guy who
has no idea of gaming,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.670
it's his first
brush with gaming.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.550
Keep it simple.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.220
Keep it easy.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.510
Keep it casual.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.230
The things like text-based,
narrative-based, FTUE-based--

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.060
first time user
experience-based--

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.860
doesn't work.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.270
It's an easy pick up and
play game mechanics which--

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.950
just keep it simple.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.810
You may sometimes
feel that hey listen,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.570
my game is really dumbed now.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.240
That's fine, guys.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.270
Your users need
to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.610
If you are making for
that 200 million people,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.290
then that's what
you need to look at.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.970
And second thing, I think I was
listening to previous session,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.870
app optimization
for low-end devices.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.240
Keeping each and every
KB of the file size

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.120
as like a [INAUDIBLE]
state, and really kind

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.200
of valuing that every
KB and saying that boss,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.080
that needs to be optimized
and optimized and optimized

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.870
relentlessly.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.453
I think these are the two things
which I kind of put in there.

00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:54.396
KUNAL SONI: OK, great.

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:55.270
Varun, how about you?

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.070
What are those two
interesting user

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.920
insights that you're seeing,
given that you are a startup?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.255
You've grown very quickly.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.550
It would be great to
understand what you're seeing

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.151
as far as users are concerned.

00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:09.750
VARUN KHURANA: So in our
case, the biggest thing

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.840
that we have seen, and which
we kind of expected and was

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.800
validated as a part
of the process,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.240
was just the repeated
behavior of consumers.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.370
And you know, there's
this big worry that,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.700
when you have an app and if
a user does not continuously

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.897
use it, then it
kind of gets lost

00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:33.230
in the maze of all the apps
that are there on the phone.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.900
And you know, God knows when
he or she will open it up next.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.560
So that was one big thing that
was on our minds at the time.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.987
But I think, in
our case-- and you

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:45.070
know, I'm glad we were
proved wrong in this case--

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.920
that just the repeat
purchase of users

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.020
was so high that, in most cases,
what we see is that Grofers,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.530
once a guy gets the hang
of it, so it kind of

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.250
is amongst those apps that
is placed on the home screen.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.839
So I think that was huge for us.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.130
KUNAL SONI: That's interesting.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.280
So have you done
anything in particular

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.270
or launched a new
feature that's helped

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.270
you drive repeat consumption
or repeat purchases?

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.020
VARUN KHURANA: OK.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.996
So we continuously think
about all the things

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.120
that we can do to kind of
get the guy to, you know,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.240
shop more and more and more.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.000
And we have like a huge
roadmap, right, simple things.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.870
So in the most basic thing--
and which is like brain-dead,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.540
right-- is just notifications.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:37.159
Fortunately or unfortunately, I
think they really work for us.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.230
And I think this is
something that you'll

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.250
kind of hear from a lot of
e-commerce companies out there.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.120
You know, that is the reality.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.070
The other things
which are increasingly

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.390
getting huge for us is
just, like, basic reorder

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.975
functionality.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:53.350
So this is stuff which we are
kind of very, very actively

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.180
working on.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.430
Basically all the functionality,
being able to predict like,

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.680
if I know every so often
you buy atta from Grofers.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.190
So even before you know that
you're running out of it,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.790
we'll tell you that hey,
you'll be running out of it,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.440
so order now.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.850
So I think these are some
of the things or use cases

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.340
that we are now starting
to move towards.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.170
KUNAL SONI: Excellent.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.650
Deepak, over to you.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.770
DEEPAK ABBOT: For us, vernacular
has grown like 4x in last one

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.270
year.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.480
KUNAL SONI: Wow.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.860
DEEPAK ABBOT: So
just to give you

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.570
some numbers,
"Navbharat Times" used

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.430
to do about 4 million active
users on their mobile browser

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.170
site.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.675
Now they do around 21 million,
just on the mobile browser.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:30.960
KUNAL SONI: Wow.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.410
OK.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.826
DEEPAK ABBOT: So
in last one year,

00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:34.620
because of better
phone support for Hindi

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.160
and obviously a lot of
people coming online,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.620
so that is really
working for us.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.620
Not just Hindi, in fact.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.602
We launched in Tamil,
Telugu element.

00:09:43.602 --> 00:09:45.060
They have been the
fastest growing.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.950
So TIO has grown, let's say,
about 45%, which is good.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.870
But considering what
"Navbharat Times" and all

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.500
these local languages
are growing,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.860
that's like a huge opportunity
still because we believe

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.430
that at least we can take
"Navbharat Times" alone

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.157
to about 100 million users.

00:10:02.157 --> 00:10:02.990
So that's one thing.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.333
And time spent.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:08.190
So overall, for Times internet,
we have about 50 million users.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.170
Last year, we had
about 25 million MAUs.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.432
100% growth on MAUs, but
300% growth on time spent.

00:10:14.432 --> 00:10:16.390
So people are actually
spending a lot more time

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.690
on their smartphones.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.362
So that's really one thing
which is standing out.

00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:22.820
KUNAL SONI: So the point of
vernacular is very interesting.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.280
is there something
that you've done

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.210
to make on-boarding of
vernacular users easier?

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.440
Do you think they
behave differently

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.370
compared to the traditional
English language

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.995
consumers, or--

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:36.578
DEEPAK ABBOT: It's
actually different.

00:10:36.578 --> 00:10:38.966
So they spend less time, but
they create more sessions.

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:39.590
KUNAL SONI: OK.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.298
DEEPAK ABBOT: So that's
why we focus more

00:10:41.298 --> 00:10:42.980
on the mobile browser
site than apps.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.110
For example, "Navbharat Times"
is about 2 million app users,

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.920
but that's 21 million
on mobile browser.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.690
That's like 10x.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.550
And we've tried-- and most of
them are on Android, actually.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.640
They have Android phones.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.670
But somehow they don't
upgrade to an app,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.090
which is OK with us as long
as they are staying with us.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.405
So we made sure that the
site which loads for them

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.530
is really, really fast,
because you understand they

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.730
come from tier two.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.120
They come from [INAUDIBLE]
where the connectivity is not

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.910
that high.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.826
So just make sure the first
bite is delivered instantly.

00:11:12.826 --> 00:11:16.424
We use less images, and we
use more snacky content,

00:11:16.424 --> 00:11:18.090
I mean rather than
having long articles,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.190
because you know that's
how they like to read.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.980
Keep it short, use
more Bollywood,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.340
use content which
they relate to easily.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.480
So obviously improving
the infrastructure,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.480
for example, our caching
Indians have really dramatically

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.400
changed the last one year.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.350
And that actually
had not just NBT,

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.830
but all of their apps,
which we've been serving.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:44.039
And we see great change in
the way the images are served

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.830
or text is served, so
that really helps us.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.920
And plus, of course,
on the app side

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.890
we've been making sure
that since NBT users,

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.260
they come from tier two.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.550
The devices they
use, very low end.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.880
So we test for almost
170 low end devices.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.520
We only use libraries,
which are actually working

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.760
on most of the handsets.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.410
So we eliminate
libraries on average--

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.531
we have [INAUDIBLE]
focus on features,

00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:10.280
but make sure that it
works for everybody.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.113
KUNAL SONI: It works
for at least the lowest

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:14.710
common denominator in terms
of-- OK, great, fantastic.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.100
So what would be your number
one challenge getting into 2016?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.090
DEEPAK ABBOT: I think
a challenge right now

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.420
is for us-- not just for
us, but for the industry,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.754
I'm believing, everyone must
be facing that challenge

00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:29.670
on the retention side.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.190
While you are acquiring users,
but also losing a lot of users.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.425
And there are reasons
which are internal,

00:12:35.425 --> 00:12:36.800
as are a lot of
external reasons,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.909
like this huge noise
about, he stole my app,

00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:40.950
this land grab happening.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.616
There are at least
50 companies shouting

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:44.130
about who stole my apps.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.860
Handsets are still limited.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.280
Connectivity is still limited.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.690
Space on device is still
very, very limited.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.427
So while everyone
focuses on the app size

00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:54.510
to make it less so that
we will install more apps.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.340
But I think the space
it takes on the device

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.290
is far more important,
because that's

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.300
what forces users to
uninstall the app.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.550
For example, for TOI
the caching alone

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.510
would be 100 MB
about a year back.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.590
So now we brought it
down to about 21 MB.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.550
But that's still high.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.310
We're seeing how
do we still-- it

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.520
has to be a balance between
maintaining a cache,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.145
so that people can actually
browse it easily, and still not

00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:18.840
consume a lot of
space on the phone

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.670
so that people don't
uninstall the apps.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.260
KUNAL SONI: So since you operate
a portfolio of very different

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.720
apps, is there something
that's worked particularly well

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.870
in terms of keeping
the size optimal,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.960
or taking something from X to Y,
in terms of reducing the size,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.460
that the audience
would find useful.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.550
DEEPAK ABBOT: We focus
more on UX, less on UI.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.397
So I think the prime
example is CricBuzz

00:13:37.397 --> 00:13:38.980
and a lot of people
come to me saying,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.820
hey, it's a very bad looking UI.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.290
But that's by far the number
one cricket app in India.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.949
It's about 40 million
monthly active.

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:49.240
We don't really care about
if people don't like our UI,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.120
as long as they're coming
back, 75% retention.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:58.420
We spend less than maybe
$10,000 in the entire year

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.680
on marketing.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.830
So people are coming
back again, and again.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:07.400
And for us, UX matters, and
that's where we focus on.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.710
When I say UI, I think
there are a lot of sexy apps

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.680
out then in places where
people-- on Twitter,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.702
on Facebook, you
meet in your circle.

00:14:14.702 --> 00:14:16.910
They would compare that with
some of the Google apps.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.790
But I think for Indians,
they want their content

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.080
to be served instantly.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.062
They want it to work.

00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:27.040
Our belief is make
it for masses.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.370
I think that's what works.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.205
KUNAL SONI: Good,
that's interesting.

00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:31.080
How about you, Varun?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.830
What would be your
number one challenge

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.240
as you step into 2016?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.230
VARUN KHURANA: For 2016, OK.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.480
So see, we have kind of--
it's very interesting.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.410
Our journey goes, we started
off from the more affluent

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.199
customers to now we are
going down the chain.

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.490
So it's a little bit different.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.900
We started off from
Gurgaon and then

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.970
Delhi NCR, then
Mumbai, then Bangalore,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.152
which is like all the metros.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:05.440
And data connectivity
is relatively better,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.950
people have better handsets.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.420
So we did focus
on the aesthetic.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.580
So I've heard a
lot of good things.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.240
People tell me all the time
about just the feel of the app.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.443
So that has worked very
well for us so far.

00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:25.994
But now increasingly what is
happening is that Grofers,

00:15:25.994 --> 00:15:29.080
we've seen a lot of
explosive growth.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.610
So up until two,
three months back,

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.055
we were barely in 10 cities.

00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:36.250
Now we're in like 25.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.980
So now we are starting
to see that change where

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.460
optimizing on the APK
size, the bandwidth

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.284
that we do over the
wire are now going

00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:48.450
to start becoming important.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.841
So that is now going to
be the focus for 2016.

00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:54.395
So we have already started
doing all of that stuff.

00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:57.710
So get all the images
converted to [INAUDIBLE] that

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.560
was just talked about.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.440
Our app is very,
very image heavy.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.600
It helps make it look
aesthetically appealing.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.340
So those are, I would
say, the bigger areas

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.415
from our technology standpoint.

00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:15.800
And one way we're
very different, also,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.380
is that we have a big
offline component.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.360
If you look at our
app reviews, you'll

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.280
rarely find anything
about the app, per se.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.600
It's more about
delivery in the area.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.850
These are things that the
offline component of the app

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.650
that becomes more important.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.440
So that is, I would say,
an equally important chunk

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.140
that is going to be a
focus for us for 2016.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.280
Just optimizing that
for the bigger cities,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.391
and the tier two cities as well.

00:16:42.391 --> 00:16:43.765
KUNAL SONI: How
about you Manish?

00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:45.830
MANISH AGARWAL: I
think for us begins

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.320
distribution [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.250
If you want to reach to masses,
it's going to be via devices.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.860
So we are talking to all the
OEMs and we are saying, hey,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.620
can we embed games
in your devices.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.100
Because we want to prevent
the final drop off,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.770
people not having
enough balance,

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.990
not having enough money on
data, and can availability

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.829
to drive consumption.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.089
And that's where,
absolutely what Deepak said,

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.869
is even getting
into an MB space.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.980
Usually you think that because
you're using smartphones,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.550
they're also
selling smartphones.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.380
You believe that
an MB is nothing,

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.089
but then you realize that
10 MB is a huge thing.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.869
And then they say, sorry,
we can't embed your game.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.170
And the challenge
which we face is,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.210
how therefore you make a
game in 5 MB, 3 MB, 4 MB,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.350
and still really
look at it, which

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.060
had some semblance of graphics,
some semblance of something.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.390
So we are constantly
grappling with that situation,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.960
that at one point you're trying
to really raise the quality

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.600
while another time the belly
of your market cannot support

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.870
the install.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.980
Now extended problem, even
if he downloads over there,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.260
it's ultimately going
to reside in his phone.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.590
And if it's taking 18
MB, 15 MB, then uninstall

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.840
is going to be very high.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.626
So you're acquiring users,
you are spending money,

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.750
but uninstall is happening.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.850
And then it doesn't
create a [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.060
So that's the challenge
is, how do we really

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.570
create a game which
can have retention, yet

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.500
be part of the constraints which
the ecosystem really offers.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.060
KUNAL SONI: So as a
successful game publisher

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.390
with two top titles, what
would be your advice to people

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.170
who are looking at
building out a large user

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.560
base for their content?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.730
MANISH AGARWAL: In fact,
we are dabbling with this.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.720
We have done a couple of things.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.540
Common game development
platforms like Unity or Cocoa,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.740
make a strategy choice.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.190
If you are India-focused,
you may actually

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.800
go with the Cocoa Studio
2D and don't have Unity,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.360
because 5, 6 MB
of Unity gives you

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.930
the baggage, as an
additional baggage.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.530
Now you can stretch the
argument even further.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:00.190
If you are looking at
India, 90% Android market,

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.839
your game is not of
the highest quality.

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:04.880
Maybe then you can take
a call that, hey, listen.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.700
IOS I will figure out later.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.850
I'll only make Android.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.450
Then you can make some
calls off native apps.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.620
And that also saves you 2 or
3 MB of further development.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.700
So we are continuously
debating, should we

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.520
start making games in
native so that the 6 MB,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.100
7 MB baggage of the development
platform we can get away.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.110
Because writing SDK
plugins and whatever it is,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.930
it's not a very
difficult kind of job.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.040
So my advice is be
clear about your market,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.600
be clear about your
strategy, and then

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.930
the choices which you make
for the tech stack are going

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.300
to be a very big success
factor as you really

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.305
evolve into-- you're creating a
scalable, sustainable business.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.490
KUNAL SONI: So Deepak,
a question for you.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.740
As somebody who runs
a portfolio, again,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.160
of different apps,
can you share a couple

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.970
of examples of things that
have worked for The Times Group

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.507
to drive up user
acquisition and engagement.

00:20:00.507 --> 00:20:02.590
Maybe name a couple of
apps and see what's worked.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.485
DEEPAK ABBOT: Yeah, so for
us since most of our apps

00:20:06.485 --> 00:20:10.578
are around content, so
content is one of the biggest

00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:11.786
source of acquisition for us.

00:20:11.786 --> 00:20:14.850
So breaking news, and bringing
the latest content, latest

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.890
Bollywood music, latest video.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.895
So that really helps us and
plus using the technology.

00:20:20.895 --> 00:20:22.745
So for example, we've
been staying ahead

00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:24.690
of the curve-- so app indexing.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.221
For example, one and
a half years back AT&amp;T

00:20:27.221 --> 00:20:29.920
were the first apps to do that.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.150
Music actions, which Google
launched about six months back.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.660
Gaana was the first one
to bring in music actions.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.095
Why search on Android.

00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:39.000
Gaana was the first
one to integrate that.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.797
So things like
technologies, Google

00:20:41.797 --> 00:20:44.085
is coming out with things
to bring in organic users.

00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:46.900
So just make sure that
you leverage all that.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.880
And acquire users using your--
obviously the app quality

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.560
has to be good,
content has to be good.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.100
But what we've also seen
is that the biggest source

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.690
of acquisition for
us, thankfully,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.950
has been Play Store
featuring most of our apps.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.900
And that doesn't happen
just because they like us.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.250
You need to make good apps.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.640
You need to use best practices.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.340
And their review process is
really, really stringent.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.594
They'll send you a
thousand things to fix.

00:21:12.594 --> 00:21:14.010
So even if they
don't feature you,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.649
at least the review
you get from them

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:16.940
will help you improve your app.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.570
So we make sure that we work
very closely with Google team.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.650
All our apps are following
the best practices.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.483
Even if they don't
feature it, at least they

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:26.885
keep sharing feedback with
us, and make sure that all

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.640
of the technology that is
available to us through Google,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.910
or otherwise, we
just embrace that.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.570
So for us acquisition, I think
content, using good technology.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.280
And we focus more
on, like I mentioned,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.270
retention is
becoming a big issue.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.310
So we focus a lot
on the engagement.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.530
So last one year, we
shifted our marketing budget

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.240
from acquisition to engagement.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.950
Now it's 60-40, so we
spend 60% on re-engagement.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.000
And not just spending money, but
also the tools which we build.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.670
We are focusing mostly on
the customer life cycle,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.084
and where do people drop.

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:01.000
So most of the people
would drop on day three,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.183
day five, day seven.

00:22:02.183 --> 00:22:06.680
So what can we do to actually
stop them, and either

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.160
use push notifications, or SMS,
email, or any other channel

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.460
where we can bring them back?

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.780
We've been using re-marketing
on Google extensively.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.992
And surprisingly, we're
getting a CPC of one rupee,

00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:20.950
one rupee 50 paise just
to bring the user back,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.850
which is really, really cheap.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.200
So considering that the cost of
re-acquiring a user, especially

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.800
if the user uninstalls the app,
then getting him to re-install

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.310
is very, very expensive.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.315
So it's better that while he has
the app installed for first two

00:22:36.315 --> 00:22:37.920
or three days, or
four days-- even

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.503
if you if use external
channels-- just

00:22:39.503 --> 00:22:41.870
make sure that you engage
with them and bring them back.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.700
So re-engagement definitely
is the biggest focus.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.060
Acquisition is happening,
thanks to a lot of new users

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.169
coming in every month.

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:51.710
So just make sure
you make good apps.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.340
Acquisition for me is
relatively less challenging.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.010
Retention is, I think,
the biggest focus here.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.330
KUNAL SONI: So to Deepak's
point about quality,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.050
I strongly recommend-- I'm
sure lots of you already know,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.890
we have a portal.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.910
It's developer.android.com,
which actually

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.700
has all the core app quality
guidelines that we typically

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.840
recommend for apps on Play.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.540
So do spend time understanding
those guidelines in case you

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.260
haven't.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.760
Great.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.270
So Varun, a question for you.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.030
As somebody who is now seen as
a leader in the very interesting

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.037
offline-- well, online
to offline space,

00:23:27.037 --> 00:23:28.985
hyper local online to offline.

00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:30.100
DEEPAK ABBOT: Offline to
online or online to offline?

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.050
KUNAL SONI: It's
online to offline.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.710
Well, whatever.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.545
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:35.954
DEEPAK ABBOT: O
to O. It's safer.

00:23:35.954 --> 00:23:37.980
KUNAL SONI: So what
would be your advice

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.465
to people who are thinking
of hyper local services

00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:42.960
and succeeding in that space?

00:23:46.637 --> 00:23:47.470
VARUN KHURANA: Yeah.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.400
So the interesting challenge
in this whole offline

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.343
to online thing is
that you are kind

00:23:55.343 --> 00:23:59.300
of enabling the
whole something which

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.760
is done in the physical
world, and you're kind of

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:09.250
trying to make the users
do it in the digital world.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.320
It kind of becomes a
chicken and egg problem.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.770
So first you need to get enough
offline so that it makes sense

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.890
to a consumer.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.900
Because I mean
otherwise, if you don't

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.440
have enough of that
meat, then to a consumer

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.870
the value proposition
decreases big time.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.890
So with us, I guess one of the
things that worked very well

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.880
was that when we started
off as a B2B player--

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.040
So initially we were
doing deliveries

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.970
for the offline merchants, and
we had a whole bunch that we

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:45.860
were doing them for.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.580
And then I guess the
transition to online became--

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.086
and when we first
launched the app.

00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:53.960
So we were building the
business for a while,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.165
and then we launched the app
and into the consumer business.

00:24:57.165 --> 00:25:01.940
So that helped in a way, because
a whole plethora of merchants

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.575
were already on board, and
getting that hook was easier.

00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:08.950
In the hyper local
space, I guess

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.340
the one thing which all
of you should think about

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.910
is getting that hook.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.930
Because I mean otherwise,
it's like I said,

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.820
it's going to be a
chicken and egg problem.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.187
Who do I attack first,
and how do I reach out?

00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:22.770
And so I think that
hook is important.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:29.992
Other than that, in the mobile
world I mean in general,

00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:32.450
user acquisition is not cheap.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.170
At least for the kind
of users that we go

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.200
it goes north of like
$100, so it's not cheap.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.210
And we have done all
kinds of mediums,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.930
all the newspapers, the
radios, Google of course.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.670
We have done a whole plethora.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.380
It is expensive.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:55.600
I think that hook that
you create I think

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.664
can go a long way.

00:25:57.664 --> 00:25:58.580
KUNAL SONI: Fantastic.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.930
So one last question
for all of you.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.565
Please share with the
audience one winning tip,

00:26:04.565 --> 00:26:07.050
or one winning
strategy that you think

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.650
people can start implementing
based on your experience.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.860
Let's start with you, Manish.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.742
One thing that's worked
really well for you.

00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:18.260
You'll have to be
a little louder.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.760
MANISH AGARWAL: I
think staying true

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.080
to-- A, first being very clear
who is your target audience.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.250
And then staying true to
needs of that target audience

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:35.440
in all aspects, whether it's as
I said tech, UI, UX, retention,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.130
your content, since
gaming is content.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.780
My piece of advice
is, just be very razor

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.810
sharp clear on who is your
user, whom are you targeting.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.670
Because if you are
confused on that,

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.060
then everything else will
be garbage in garbage out.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.070
KUNAL SONI: Good, Varun.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.320
VARUN KHURANA: So
what worked for us?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.440
I mean, like I said, business
kind of has a digital component

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.720
and it has an online component,
it has an offline component.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.490
KUNAL SONI: But specifically
on Play and Android.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:15.100
VARUN KHURANA: So on Play, I
would say the initial success

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.640
that we got was just a lot of
people talking about the wow

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.692
factor when the Grofers
app just came out.

00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:25.650
The experience was amazing
that when you order,

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.810
within an hour the
thing was at your door.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.290
In some cases, we did it in
like 30 minutes or something.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.820
So I think that
initial experience

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.530
that we were able to
create created lot of buzz

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.917
where a lot of people were
just talking about it.

00:27:37.917 --> 00:27:40.000
KUNAL SONI: So sort of
quantity and utility that--

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.720
VARUN KHURANA: I think that
was the one that created

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.270
that initial buzz about it.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:51.760
And then after that, good
old means to get to users.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.620
KUNAL SONI: Deepak.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.881
DEEPAK ABBOT: I think
I'll repeat what I said

00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:55.180
earlier, made for the masses.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.263
Just make sure that you
know that your app appeals

00:27:57.263 --> 00:27:58.300
to millions of users.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.600
And luckily we are in this space
where we have Bollywood, news,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.930
cricket, which actually has
us bring millions of users.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.570
So for us, I think making it
for the masses is something

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.400
which has really worked.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.220
KUNAL SONI: Great, fantastic.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.730
With that, we come to the
end of the discussion.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.250
I hope you found that useful.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.615
Please give a round of
applause for our panelists

00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:19.740
for sharing their insights.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.890
