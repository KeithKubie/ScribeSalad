00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.870
The area is 28.26.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.040
Remember that the diameter is
twice the length of the radius.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.660
If the diameter is equal to 6, we know
the radius will have to be half of that.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.690
So the radius would be 3.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.877
So now we can plug
that into our formula,

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:26.010
A equals pi r squared,
which gives us 3.14 x 3 squared.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.124
Square the three,
multiply it by 3.14 and you get 28.26.
