00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.600
PRESENTER: All right.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.960
Welcome, everyone, and thanks
for coming to this talk.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.450
My name's [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.160
Hudsley, obviously, and I'm
actually very happy to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.850
introduce today's talk and to
have helped in arranging it.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.560
Actually, Leslie, thank you for
really doing everything

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.820
and for enabling us to have
a special showing.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.440
Who has seen the movie?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.420
I assume pretty much everyone,
all right?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.660
And so it's great to have
Jeff actually here

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.070
to talk about it.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.520
I wanted to say just a few
things why I think it's kind

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.170
of particularly interesting for
us, as Google, to host you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.630
today, and I think it's
sort of two parts.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.250
One is that clearly, for us,
renewable energy has been a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.180
topic for a long time and
energy use, et cetera.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.360
We're trying hard in our
corporate operations and in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.690
our data center operations to
save energy and power things

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.890
with renewable energy, be that
here with the solar panels on

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.090
the roof or in data centers,
where we've done [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.710
And where we also worked
really hard to save,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.060
literally, a factor of two in
terms of the amount of power

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.670
required to run a certain
workload.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.510
So that's one kind of sort of
obvious parallel, I think,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.870
over the past few years.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.680
And obviously, as a company,
we're committed to being

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.300
carbon neutral, have
been since 2007.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.470
So that clearly is a relevant
sort of comparison.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.620
And the other thing, though,
that struck me when I saw the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.040
movie was that I think it's
really striking that climate

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.300
change is something you
can't really grasp

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.860
This is abstract concept.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.190
And the movie does really an
excellent job in sort of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.640
translating to that something
that you can see, right?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.960
Translating something that
really doesn't have an easy

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.570
way for you to relate
to it, right?

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.720
And this is the first time
that I've seen a really

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.140
compelling way of seeing
what actually happens.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.930
And this morning, actually, I
had an interview with two

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.509
journalists, and they're
writing a story.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.200
And their story is about where
the internet lives.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560
And the internet, actually, has
kind of the same property.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.410
Like everyone uses it,
like climate, right?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.820
Everyone's affected by it.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.670
But it's actually not very
graspable, right?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.990
You see your laptop and it's
connected to your internet,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.410
but, like, you actually don't
see anything else.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.160
Maybe you see a Wi-Fi router
somewhere and a cable coming

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.530
out from it.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.100
But that's kind of, for most
people, the end of the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.140
understanding really where the
internet really lives, right?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.630
And so making that visible was
actually, last year, the goal

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.565
of our where the internet lives
data center site, like,

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.210
with the pictures, et cetera.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.050
And we got a lot of response,
too, where people said, oh,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.650
finally, I can actually kind of
understand, visually, what

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.570
happens when I use
the internet.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.430
So lots of parallels.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.550
So let me briefly
introduce Jeff.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.550
I got to go look at my notes.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.690
Jeff Orlowski.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.090
I think most of you have
seen the screening.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.830
If you haven't seen the
screening, it's still playing

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.310
in a number of theaters,
and I saw it in

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.140
Palo Alto before Christmas.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.910
And Jeff won the Excellence in
Cinematography Award at the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.510
Sundance Film Festival, a
premiere, obviously, festival

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.930
for independent movies.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.840
And if you've seen the
movie, you know why.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.210
It really is just visually
stunning and, at the same

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.180
time, moving in more
than one way.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.990
And so I'm very happy
that he's here.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.690
His work, obviously, has
helped lots of people.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.830
I don't know, do you have your
count of, like, how many

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.650
people have seen the movie?

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.490
JEFF ORLOWSKI: We're
working on that.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.320
I don't have an explicit
count.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.140
PRESENTER: So my guess would
be at least hundreds of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.610
thousands of people
already see it.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.940
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah, easily.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.290
PRESENTER: The trailer
on YouTube is

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.150
actually very popular.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.520
It's a four-minute trailer
on YouTube.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.705
So I'm very pleased here to have
Jeff Orlowski, and please

00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:58.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.490
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Thank you.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.420
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.310
Thanks for having--

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.610
we're using the [INAUDIBLE],
right, not this one?

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.840
Thank you, guys, very
much for being here.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.200
I went to Stanford.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.899
I spent a bunch of time here
during undergrad, and it's

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.910
just really cool to
be back on campus.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.500
On campus, this isn't
my campus.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.630
But yeah, we're just thrilled
to have the opportunity to

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.380
share the film with you guys and
that you got a chance to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.160
see the film yesterday.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.740
It's something where we went
into this without really

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.820
knowing what we were
going to do.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.620
We didn't go into it with
the intention of

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.410
making a film, in fact.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.140
When I first met James, the
goal was really just to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.730
document him and to document
his project.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.260
But I'll kind of get
into that with some

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.380
images in a little bit.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.770
I've got a bunch of photographs
here that I wanted

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.890
to show and kind of keep it free
form, and then we'll kind

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.650
of jump into Q and A's
pretty quickly.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.420
So I want to try and address any
kind of questions you guys

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.150
have as soon as possible.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.470
If you haven't had a chance to
see the film, this is the

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.360
whole film right here.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.770
That's the final
cut time line.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.710
That's not all of the audio
tracks, in fact.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.990
I think we ended up getting
into, like, the 20s or 30s in

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.280
terms of the number
of audio tracks.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.410
And I just took a screen grab
of this one day and I showed

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.330
it to some friends, and then
realized this is the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.840
complexity that goes into
the editing process.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.740
And the more impressive thing,
just conceptually, is that

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.350
each one of those lines, each
one of those slices, is

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.920
another creative decision that
you have to make in the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.790
process of editing the film.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.940
It is, in part, very technical,
but at the same

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.030
time, it's artistic, and you
have to make all these

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.680
decisions on the fly.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.810
And there's, literally, an
infinite number of ways you

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.500
can edit a film.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.920
We spent three years editing
"Chasing Ice." There's some

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.840
reasons and some stories as to
why it took that long and some

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.770
of the concepts that we were
shifting as we went through

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.910
the development of the film,
but we can save that for

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.730
later, if you want.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.060
I'm going to show the
trailer real fast.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.740
Just in case anybody hasn't
seen it, it's a short,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.602
two-minute, little trailer
for the film.

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.460
-I'm on the phone with Jim on
one of our regular check-ins.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.400
Like, Jim, nothing's
happening.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.790
-It's starting, Adam, I think.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.834
Adam, it's starting.

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:12.730
-Look at that.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.980
Look at the whole face.

00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:20.010
-It all started in Iceland.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.850
-I think I'm so certain to get
wet, I'll take my boots off.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.410
-I never imagined that you could
see glaciers this big

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.680
disappearing in such
a short time.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.410
There's a powerful piece of
history that's unfolding in

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.400
these pictures, and
I have to go back.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.530
The initial goal was to put
out 25 cameras for three

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.150
years, shoot every hour as long
as it was daylight that

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.880
would show you how the landscape
was changing.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.970
-Ah, this is the way to
travel, my friend.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.500
-Putting really delicate
electronics in the harshest

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.600
conditions on the planet.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.650
-It's not the nicest environment
for technology.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.115
-I do not want to go any
lower than this.

00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:01.030
It's just bottomless.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.820
-I'm going out here on this
broken fin, and I assume it

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.070
won't collapse.

00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:11.090
-Every once in a while,
I hear the same,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.040
what were you thinking?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.560
Maybe that office job
wasn't so bad.

00:07:17.715 --> 00:07:19.410
This thing is just rock.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.435
-It's not working.

00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:20.720
God.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.750
-All of that obsession means
nothing if it doesn't work.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.530
-Just be careful.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.770
Don't get too close to
the edge, all right?

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.200
-This is terrifying.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.990
-This knee's had two surgeries,

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.520
really could use a third.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.860
-He goes to that point where
he can't anymore, and

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.472
sometimes he's going further.

00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:42.800
-We have low oil pressure
in Engine #2,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.960
-This is big stuff.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.900
-I think right now.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.150
-OK, onward.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.790
-This is the memory
of the landscape.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.030
That landscape is gone.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.190
It may never be seen again in
the history of civilization,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.510
and it's stored right here.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.180
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.450
So I just saw the reference
to the original

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.390
song that we had scored.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.250
The film has just been nominated
for an Academy Award

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.570
in the category of Best
Original Song.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.560
We're actually trying to get
Scarlett Johansson, who

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.250
performed the song, trying
to get her to do a live

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.159
performance at the Academy
Awards, which would be really

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.600
awesome if we can pull that
off, but we're trying to

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.990
figure that out.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.220
So as [INAUDIBLE] was saying
earlier, what James was really

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.670
trying to do was to create a
visualization of climate

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.680
change from his perspective.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.760
He's a photographer.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.970
He was out in the field.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.010
He saw these landscapes
changing, and he wanted to

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.850
figure out how could he, as a
photographer, use his skills

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.020
and tools to make this happen.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.990
And in the process--

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.450
and you can kind of get a sense
of it for the feel that

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.070
we were going for with
the trailer--

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.860
we didn't want this to be a very
science-heavy film about

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.900
climate change.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.640
In fact, at the beginning, we
didn't want it to be about

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.700
climate change at all.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.500
We were really considering it
a film about a photographer.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.430
We called it "The Photographer."
It was about

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.120
James's entire life's work
and a lot of different

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.540
photographic projects
that he had done

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.910
over his whole career.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.950
And we were using the story of
the ice as a through line,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:25.890
effectively.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.360
And in the editing process, we
realized that we needed to

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.775
shift that.

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:32.420
And we wanted to switch that
around to make it much more

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.940
focused on the Extreme Ice
Survey and what James

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.260
accomplished with these
time lapses.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.130
But it brings up the issue of,
how do you communicate climate

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.280
change to the public?

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.080
And this is something that we
spent a lot of time thinking

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.970
about because we didn't want
to approach it as though,

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.210
here's a science-heavy film.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.350
You're going to sit and be
lectured to and listen to

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.050
experts, talking heads,
about the issue.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.740
We really tried to frame it in
terms of the adventure and the

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.380
experience that we had.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.840
Now when we first set
off, that wasn't

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.060
really the goal at all.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.280
Like I said, we weren't planning
on making a film.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.370
James wanted to set up these
time-lapse cameras, put them

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.280
out there, and just document
what was going on.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.500
And I met James when I was
a junior at Stanford.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.530
The project was getting started
when I was a senior,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.990
and I had the fortune of joining
him and going out into

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.000
the field with him.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.170
And my role was just
to shoot video.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.290
That was the intention
at the beginning.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.770
So somebody else shot
this time lapse.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.030
This is a time lapse of the
camera being built, so a time

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.100
lapse of the time lapse.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.840
But this is something that was
founded in his garage.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.050
He had random parts from the
hardware store that he put

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.110
together, and he built something
that he thought

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.110
could be installed and would,
hopefully, last for a long

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.640
period of time.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.380
And the first trip that
we did to Iceland--

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.650
it was in March of 2007--

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.350
it was a team of these six guys,
and we had the cameras

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.960
that James had designed
out in the field.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.690
And we got to Iceland.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.810
We had these tripods.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.170
We were going to mount
them to the ground.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.520
We were going to secure
them with guy wires.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.110
And when we got there,
we realized the

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.390
ground was way too soft.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.550
The cameras wouldn't be, like,
they wouldn't stay sturdy.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.020
Like, we were going to hardware
stores, trying to

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.970
find lumber so that we could
build a bracket that could be

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.280
mounted to the wall.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.030
And you couldn't find

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.520
pressure-treated lumber in Iceland.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.030
And then everything was metric
units, and all of our tools

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.880
didn't work.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.920
It was just all these seemingly
small, easy, little,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.030
minuscule details were really
putting the whole project into

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.490
jeopardy from the very, very
first installation in Iceland.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.050
And, ultimately, we found
enough parts at

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.610
the hardware store.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.180
We were able to jury-rig
a system, and we

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.340
installed the cameras.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.270
And those rigs have been
out there now--

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.700
with a bunch of problems and
rockfalls and interruptions in

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.320
the process-- but they've
been out there now for

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.910
just about six years.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.840
In two more months, it'll have
been six years of photography

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.530
that we've captured.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.390
But this is--

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.460
I had very short hair
back then--

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.550
back in March of 2007.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.440
The goal, from my perspective,
was just to follow James and

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.050
to document what he was doing.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.150
The video was intended for
YouTube videos, for

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.800
promotional materials for him
to help get funds raised by

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.250
showing people what
he was doing.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.670
And we weren't planning
on making a film.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.120
But for me, it was just being
23 years old and having the

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.680
opportunity to go to Greenland,
and then having the

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.200
chance to go to Iceland and get
to shoot and explore these

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.140
landscapes.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.400
That's what got me hooked on it,
and that's why I wanted to

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.460
work with him in the
first place.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.170
And it wasn't until about a
year and a half into the

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.020
project, where James had been
doing a lot of lectures.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.690
He had been showing the time
lapses at that point, and we

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.400
were seeing the response
from audiences.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.350
Between the response from the
audience of the power of the

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.090
time-lapse photography combined
with over 100 hours

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.680
of video footage that we had
collected at that point, we

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.330
knew that we had the materials
to go ahead and

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.690
start making a film.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.990
So that's when I really started
pushing James heavily.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.720
Give me the green light.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.660
Let me make the film.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.800
He didn't want to be the
subject of the film.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.520
You know, he's a guy who's
normally behind the camera,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.160
and he's the one who wants to
take pictures of other things.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.230
So the whole time, he was always
reluctant to be in

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.470
front of the camera.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.570
It was uncomfortable for him.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.860
He got used to it over time.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.250
He got comfortable with--

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.800
just when the camera's there
that often and always filming

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.590
him, you kind of have
to get used to it.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.010
So that was the upside.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.365
But finally, he recognized
the potential and

00:13:17.365 --> 00:13:18.920
the value for a film.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.010
Gave me the green light.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.360
And we started building a team,
and we started going

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.480
ahead and editing it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.280
I just want to show a bunch
of other images out in the

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.670
fields, some of the stuff that's
not in the film, and

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.490
try and give you some anecdotes
behind some of the

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.750
key events that happened.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.530
But one of the most amazing
things for me was going ice

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.000
climbing for the first time.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.690
I had done a lot of
outdoor stuff.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.830
I had done a lot of camping
and done a lot of rock

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.530
climbing, but never
ice climbing.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.070
So you're wearing crampons,
these huge, spike things that

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.920
will secure you on the ice,
and you're using these ice

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.120
axes and climbing around.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.570
And this one flank right here,
that's the very first piece of

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.200
ice I ever climbed.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.730
And it was an incredible--

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.410
like, it was so much fun.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.300
I was so thrilled just by having
this completely new

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.610
experience of your hands and
your feet attaching to a wall

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.730
in a different way.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.260
And a couple months after we
were in this landscape taking

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.410
these photographs, we
got the update from

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.940
the time-lapse camera.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.250
And this landscape here, all of
the dark ice, the black ice

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.670
here with all the dirt on it,
it's called dead ice, and the

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.200
white behind it is the actual
main glacier that's flowing.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.090
So if you imagine, the
glacier's flowing.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.630
It's going next to
the mountainside.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.990
And what happens, a lot of the
darkness is debris from the

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.390
glacier kind of scraping
the mountain and it

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.730
falling onto the ice.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.660
But then, sometimes, there are
these little eddies that are

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.480
frozen in place, and
they're not flowing

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.330
with the regular glacier.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.500
So they call that dead
ice, and it's old.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.660
It's pretty stable.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.590
And all of this in the
foreground was that dead ice.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.810
And a couple months after this,
we got the images from

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.150
the time-lapse camera, and all
of this had disappeared.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.880
I mean, this entire landscape
that we had spent days and

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.200
days climbing on, exploring
those, like, first experiences

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.480
ice climbing, it was all gone.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.750
And the realization that these
landscapes are changing that

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.370
fast in such a big fashion,
that was a huge

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.760
revelation for me.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.200
So the cameras are out there,
and we look at them as our

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.230
little sentinels, our little
R2D2s, shooting every-- now

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.500
they're shooting every half
hour of daylight.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.930
So 18 minutes ago, we had 34
cameras around the world turn

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.280
their sensor on, check to see
if there's enough light.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.430
The timers that we designed,
that we redesigned in the

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.150
process of working on improving
the technology, the

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.660
timer has a light
sensor in it.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.830
And that's allowing the system
to save a lot of power in the

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.180
long, cold winters that
have no daylight.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.470
So it checks to see if there's
enough light, will turn the

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.650
camera system on.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.890
It'll take one exposure.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.960
It'll wait 30 seconds and
put the whole thing into

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.670
hibernation and wait for the
next half hour to take the

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.130
next photograph.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.710
Originally, the camera boxes
were all grey because we were

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.120
concerned about vandalism.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.360
We were concerned that, in
Iceland, there are places

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.770
where people can come.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.170
They might steal the cameras.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.310
There's a warning on the
back of the camera box.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.410
And we installed a bunch
of these grey cameras.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.750
And then we got to certain
places, and we couldn't find

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.750
them when we were looking
for them.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.750
We were, like, flying around in
a helicopter trying to find

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.640
the camera.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.630
So, ultimately, we switched to
these orange camera boxes for

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.930
the very remote ones, which
made a big difference in

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.890
spotting them in these
landscapes.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.900
But this here is another shot
from that Columbia Glacier.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.500
And this here, the dead ice that
I was referencing, is in

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.440
this foreground.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.990
This glacier has now retreated
all the way back to that

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.000
mountain ridge, and it's split
into two separate glaciers.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.580
So now there are two different
branches to the Columbia

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.880
Glacier, and that's all
documented from that camera

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.250
right there.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.710
This camera, it's been panned.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.900
In the film, it's the one that
was panned a couple of times.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.290
And this one has also been
moved, as well, to a location

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.520
to continue the record.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.840
This next shot is from an
iceberg that calved off the

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.359
Columbia Glacier, so that's
the same kind of

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.190
island in the back.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.250
And this here--

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.810
this was even shot in
the summertime--

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.710
but it's so backed up with ice
that, although this is the

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.480
surface of the Atlantic
Ocean--

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.589
sorry, the Pacific Ocean--

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.150
it's filled with icebergs
all the way back.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.950
So that is the surface of the
Pacific Ocean, all those

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.319
icebergs that are kind
of stuck in there.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.850
And this was one of the stupider
things that we did,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.020
one of the riskier things, but
because these pieces of ice do

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.010
roll over, and they'll break
and roll at any given time.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.030
So we had a helicopter.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.040
We flew around.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.010
We put Adam on the
piece of ice.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.440
He had a walkie-talkie.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.460
If he wanted to bail at any
moment, he could've just

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.780
called us and said, I'm done.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.340
And we tried to keep it
really, really quick.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.660
We did a couple of passes,
filming Adam on the piece of

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.960
ice and photographing
it as well.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.280
And the reason why he's there
is for scale, and it's

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.680
something that we talked
about in the film.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.730
And it's something that's
really, really difficult to

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.410
communicate in these landscapes
because they are

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.260
far larger than anything you
can possibly experience

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.960
in the Lower 48.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.440
I've been to Glacier
National Park.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.640
We installed cameras there.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.820
It doesn't compare whatsoever
to Glacier National Park.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.670
These landscapes are huge.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.900
And the only way you can get a
sense of how big they are is

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.980
through some scale reference.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.280
So we would regularly try to
put people in, boats or

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.210
helicopters or any sort of human
reference that gives you

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.300
a sense of it.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.350
On the Greenland Ice
Sheet, which we

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.000
filmed for quite a bit--

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.300
it's in the middle of the film
where it's the landscape of

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.500
literally just ice in
all directions--

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.450
that's all you see.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.970
There's no wildlife.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.800
There's no plants whatsoever.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.290
There's algae, which is the
only other living matter

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.440
whatsoever.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.500
And then all you hear is the
sound of wind and the sound of

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.890
water as it's running across
the surface of the

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.230
Greenland Ice Sheet.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.610
The only way you can get
there is by helicopter.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.850
We did spend quite a bit of time
in the helicopter to get

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.460
to these locations because
that's the only

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.350
way you can get there.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.910
And when that helicopter takes
off, and you're there with

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.530
your pile of gear and you hear
the choppers fading off in the

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:14.340
distance, it's a very,
very lonely feeling.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.260
You have the full deep
appreciation for the fact that

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.090
you've got a limited
set of resources.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.230
You've got limited supplies.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.040
It's you and three
other people.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.480
And your survival is based on
you guys being able to work

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.280
together, trust each other, make
sure your food and your

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.900
fuel and everything lasts for
the time that you need it to.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.130
We've been out on the Greenland
Ice Sheet and at

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.680
other places in Greenland, where
we get stuck there due

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.940
to bad weather.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.200
Even times when the weather is
crystal-clear blue skies just

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.630
like this, they call us from
the airport and say, it's

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.200
foggy here.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.490
We can't take off.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.110
And there were times where I
almost missed my graduation

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.320
because we were delayed a day
of helicopter flights.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.890
James was stuck in Greenland for
five days one time because

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.260
they couldn't get the
helicopter to him.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.450
The way they do their scheduling
there, if you miss

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.470
your time slot, they put you
at the end of the list.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.510
So they do all the other
reservations, and then they

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.360
come and get you at the
next available slot.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.840
Not really ideal, but certainly
when you're, like,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.910
down to your last couple packets
of food, but it always

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.790
worked out in the end.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.350
But they do give you access to
incredible places that you

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.650
would not be able to
see anywhere else.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.490
And once again, imagine
what this place--

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.690
what it would look like without
Adam standing there,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.550
without that scale reference.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.580
I actually was just thinking of
Photoshopping him out just

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.440
to show the picture first
and just imagining

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.040
what it looks like.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.830
And then when you see
the human scale, it

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.670
really changes things.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.550
The black stuff at the bottom,
if you remember from the film,

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.050
it's that stuff called
cryonkonite.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.270
So that is soot.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.140
It's black carbon.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.580
It's a lot of other dust and
pollutants, along with

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.840
meteorite dust and some dust
from, kind of, Asia

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.460
that gets blown in.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.690
And that's causing the ice to
melt faster, but it also

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.180
creates these really,
really beautiful

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.970
landscapes and features.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:06.420
This is where we shot in that
moulin in the film, and this

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.750
was one of the days where
we were scouting it.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.690
The photo looks rather
treacherous and, like, I could

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.810
just slide right off,
but I felt secure

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.780
at the time, I recall.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.020
You can just barely make out, on
the right-hand side at the

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.640
top, a couple little dots,
little, black dots.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.150
So those are people standing
up there who

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.540
were setting up anchors.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.520
We had gone to that side.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.690
We hiked around and came to this
side of the moulin, and

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.890
we assessed from this
side as well.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.100
And we decided we were going to
shoot from there for better

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.470
lighting conditions and the way
the light would come in

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.590
through the canyon.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.910
We set the anchors up
on the first day.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.560
We set all the anchors
up in triplicate.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.840
So you see a bit of that in
the film, where there's a

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.910
drill that goes in and two
different drill holes are

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.920
made, and they're connected.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.560
And it's called a V-thread.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.510
And if you go ice climbing,
typically you would do that

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.720
with a six-inch or an eight-inch
deep ice screw, and

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.960
you would make a connection
like that.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.900
But in respect for James's
paranoia, we used these

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.650
one-meter long drills, and we
had them in triplicate.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.940
So those columns of ice could
haul a lot of weight.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.270
You could pull a car up
with those anchors.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.430
So one person was tied into
those three separate anchors

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.820
on one rope.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.300
And then you have a second rope
going to a belayer, who

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.840
is also tied into another
set of three anchors.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.290
And whenever people went down,
certainly over the hole

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.980
itself, they had two ropes.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.900
In some other cases, because
we only had four people, if

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.650
three of us were down at the
same time we took some other

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.260
precautions.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.000
But when you're there with
only one rope, it is

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.210
significantly dangerous.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.460
You swing your ice axe the wrong
way and you hit that

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.960
rope, you're in some pretty
deep trouble.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.870
So you have to be very, very
careful and conscious when

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.660
you're climbing on ice, how
you're using the tools, where

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.190
you're walking.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.190
You can't just step around and
walk normally because if your

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.370
crampon steps on the rope,
that rope is damaged.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.990
It's very, very vulnerable.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.260
So you have to be paranoid
about those things.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.430
James has lost a lot of friends
out in the wilderness

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.840
due to light aircraft accidents
and also climbing

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.430
accidents, where people--

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.980
they're walking and their
crampon hits the inside of

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.500
their pant leg, and they
trip and fall and

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.780
you go off a cliff.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.090
It's also a very easy
to get confused--

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.550
not get confused, but have a
false sense of security from

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.250
the camera because you're
shooting, and you're like, oh,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.370
I can go up to the edge here.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.060
This is safe.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.320
And actually I need to be
a little bit closer.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.120
And there was one time I was
standing on this ice bridge,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.300
and there was another piece of
ice right in front of me.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.140
And I thought it was pinned on
the beach, and I thought I

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.490
could step on it securely.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.030
And so I've got the camera in my
hand, and I shift my weight

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.680
over, and I'm shifting.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.830
And once I committed my weight,
I felt the ice start

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.530
to sink underneath my foot.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.730
And I'm holding the camera and
I've got these huge rain

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.900
slickers on, and it's totally
bulky and I can't move

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.870
effectively, and I start
feeling myself

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.200
sinking into the water.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.370
I slide off the ice bridge and
completely going up to my neck

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.550
in ice water.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.440
I took the camera.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.980
I like turned, I saved
the camera.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.710
I put it on where
I was standing.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.090
It was, like, the
top priority.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.860
And then I, like, struggled
and climbed out.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.840
That was one of the first
trips to Alaska.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.350
What I didn't even know
or didn't even

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.210
realize at the time--

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.920
that was actually the scene
where James, he's holding up

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.860
the memory card, and he's,
like, the memory of the

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.890
landscape is stored
right here.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.270
It may be gone forever,
but it's stored here.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.730
I shot that while I had these
cotton base layers on, which I

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.370
didn't even know, at the time,
you shouldn't be wearing

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.830
cotton or whatever.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.650
I was freezing the whole
day, shivering.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.090
And when we got back to the
little motel we were staying

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.630
at, I was peeling these
layers off.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.290
James saw me take off, like, a
regular pair of jeans and a

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.100
cotton T-shirt.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.480
And he started yelling at me,
what are you doing wearing

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:45.970
this stuff?

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.340
You need to wear
fleece or wool.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.750
So you learn those
lessons quickly.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.130
Yeah.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.520
Yeah?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.950
JEFF ORLOWSKI: I mean, I was
surprised by how effective the

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.840
rain slickers were at
keeping heat in.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.440
They were very, very heavy,
and they're waterproof and

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.210
they're very insulated.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.540
So it did a surprisingly good
job of keeping that in.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.960
But separate from that, we were
just running around the

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.460
whole time, and then I filmed
him for a little bit.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.360
We were hiking around.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.750
We got back into the canoes
pretty soon, and we were

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.540
paddling back.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.110
And once we got in the car, it
was, like, blast the heater.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.050
So all that was fun.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.490
But anyway, so we spent a lot
of time in this landscape

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.830
making sure that everything
was safe and secure.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.670
And we went down there the first
day of shooting, and

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.140
James got his photographs.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.980
I got my video.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.650
And I had some problems
with the video.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.310
I had set the camera to
autofocus because I wasn't

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.320
sure what the camera would see
looking down into that hole.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.300
And so I set it like that.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.890
We got back to the tent that
night, and we were reviewing

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.230
the photographs and James
didn't like his stuff.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.780
And I looked at my photos--

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.060
the video-- and I saw that the
camera had focused on the

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.290
water droplets on the lens.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.990
The waterfall had put all this
mist and moisture on the lens,

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.980
and I had really beautiful
photographs

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.000
of these water droplets.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.010
And everything beyond was just
blurry, out of focus,

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.070
completely out of focus.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.070
So James said that he wanted
to go back the next day

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.110
because he wasn't happy
with his photos.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.630
I was perfectly fine
with that.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.880
I wanted to get some
more video myself.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.980
So we ended up spending three
days shooting down there.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.460
This is a photo that I took
of James when he went

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.480
down there as well.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.540
And ultimately-- you guys
remember some of the footage

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.810
that was from this scene--

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.360
it's one of my favorite
scenes in the film.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.310
All the credit has to go to
James for figuring this out,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.480
but it's a place where you can
very visually tell the story

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.130
of climate change, or you can
take the concept of how this

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.510
ice is melting and
how it's being

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.900
transferred to the ocean.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.370
This is one of those key places
where it's happening.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.630
This is how it's happening,
and he was able to make a

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.210
photograph.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.060
And in the same process, the
adventure was compelling

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.360
enough that it's been a very
strong scene in the film.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.190
Another big scene was the
big glacier calving.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.720
Where this here is from the
Llulissat Glacier, where Adam

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.050
and I spent--

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.470
we were planning to spend about
a month, three to four

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.410
weeks camped out there, and on
day 17 is when the calving

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:10.950
actually happened.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.020
This is another location
but just showing

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.070
some more of the cameras.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.030
The two of us maintained
a 24-hour vigil.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.990
So we had three eight-hour
shifts, and we would be up

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.410
together for eight hours.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.820
And then I would have the night
shift, up until, like,

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.930
five or six--

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.450
I forget, like the wee early
hours in the morning.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.740
And then Adam had the morning
shift, and then we were up for

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.220
dinner again every day.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.530
In the summertime in May in
Greenland, you have 24 hours

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.110
of daylight.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.120
So if there was a big calving
event that happened at 2:00

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.200
AM, we wanted somebody
awake to capture it.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.560
Because of the distance to the
glacier-- we were about two

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.940
miles away from the glacier--
you don't necessarily hear

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.320
when something starts to
happen all the time.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.200
That's typically the first
indicator, when you do hear a

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.880
large pop or noise or rumble,
and that's when you would

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.280
stick your head out
of the tent and

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.590
start checking on things.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.460
But many times, we had
discovered, we

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.540
would be at a glacier.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.680
We'd have a time-lapse
camera set up.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.400
We'd spend the whole
day working.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.280
We would think that nothing
happened to the glacier.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.410
We'd review the time lapse
footage and see that a bunch

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.160
of pieces broke off, and the
glacier had advanced a whole

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.170
lot and we didn't
recognize it.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.050
We didn't see it happen
with our own eyes.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.530
And even on that short period
of time, it's amazing to see

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.730
how the cameras can capture
something that you can't

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.980
experience yourself.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.040
And so we really tried to keep
a very ongoing vigil going.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.550
In the middle of the night, I
was definitely in the tent

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.000
more often than not.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.030
It was still very, very cold.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.310
This is one of the tents that
we used for all of our gear.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.520
We had a kind of communal
tent, and then

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.360
each of us had a tent.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.070
And then this was the
gear tent with--

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.550
the orange cable is a long
extension cord coming from our

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.530
little 1,000 watt generator,
which powered the computers,

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.750
the whole rat's nest of charges
for all the cameras,

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.360
all the hard drives.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.770
This case here carried four
terabytes worth of data in

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.970
eight 500-gigabyte-powered
hard drives.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.330
We couldn't afford to get
a whole bunch of small,

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.690
portable, bus-powered drives at
the time, so they were all

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.380
wall-powered units.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.050
It was a suitcase that was very,
very carefully padded

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:17.870
and protected.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.310
It was, like, this is
the thing that we're

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.280
guarding with our lives.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.990
And it was a very heavy case
with all those hard drives.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.540
But this is, basically,
all the sensitive

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.980
gear in this tent.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.050
Always having backups of every
single piece of electronic

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.560
gear, spare cameras.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.000
We had nine cameras on this
particular trip for video and

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.730
five time-lapse cameras, my
computer and Adam's computer.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.110
Just the level of redundancy was
really, really important

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.210
for this trip.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.930
I think we're just about
out of time.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.480
There's not much more.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.620
The film has been really
well-received at a lot of

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.750
different festivals.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.640
It's been getting out there.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.730
We've won about 30
awards right now.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.290
As I mentioned, the Academy
Award nomination as well.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.700
We have launched an iOS app that
came out about a couple

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.110
weeks ago, maybe
two months ago.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:11.910
We're going to be putting a lot
more photos and video and

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.680
content on there, trying to keep
that updated and figuring

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.770
out a lot more ways just to
keep the imagery going and

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.240
keep it alive online.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.390
Really, the time lapses are
continuing to shoot.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.440
And as James updates the time
lapses, we want to make those

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.210
available to the public, so
they can see them and

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.120
interact with them.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.340
And in the iOS app, you can,
like, scrub your finger back

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.390
and forth and see the glacier
moved forward

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.690
and backward in time.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.700
So I just wanted to close with
a couple of other photos.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.800
This here, we call it kissing
bergs, and this is from a

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.020
location in Greenland by
the Llulissat Glacier.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.520
And those are some very, very
massive pieces of ice.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.090
It's one of my favorite shots
from the collection.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:54.010
And this shot here is from a
beach in Iceland, and it's

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.000
interesting because James fell
in love with this landscape.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.230
There are these black--

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.630
just black sand beaches.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.460
And when you're walking around
and you see these crystal

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.450
pieces of ice sitting on the
beach, it looks like a diamond

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.630
on the beach.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.635
And he did a whole series
of photographs that

00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:12.150
he calls ice diamonds.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.340
We would shoot at night.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.520
He would backlight them.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.250
They would just be glowing,
really, really

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.650
spectacularly-lit
pieces of ice.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.290
In one of the time lapses, the
nighttime scene in the film,

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.950
there's a first shot where
you see this--

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.080
I call it space berg--

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.150
it's this glowing
piece of ice.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.050
And James actually used that
technique of lighting it from

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.510
behind to get that effect, and
we used that in some of the

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.380
night time lapses as well.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.650
But it really was discovered
on this beach where--

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.530
he calls it the place where
the ice goes to die.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.750
It's part of that cycle.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.170
It's part of that kind of
mortality theme that he was

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.440
kind of reflective about, and
it's something that always

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.200
left a strong impression on me,
seeing these pieces of ice

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.940
melting away.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.910
That's it in terms of what I
wanted to share with you guys,

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.420
and I'd love to answer any
questions that you might have.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.880
We do have wireless mics
to record all of it.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.212
Thank you guys very much.

00:32:04.212 --> 00:32:11.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.580
So going back to the main
calving event, I know you said

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.690
that you were about
two miles away.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.980
How did it feel like it was
getting closer once the ice

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.160
started to turn over?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.620
And then my other question is,
was there a plan B if nothing

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.690
had happened within the month
that you were planning?

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.660
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yes.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.230
The plan B was that
we wouldn't have

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.880
gotten anything, really.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.630
And we were wanting to wait
for as long as we possibly

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.870
could, but you can't predict
those things.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.810
It was a trip where Adam and I
went, we donated our time to

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.910
go out there.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.150
And it was a $40,000 trip to
send two guys to the middle of

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.640
Nowhere, Greenland and to keep
us alive for a month.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.790
So the expenses were really,
really high.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.810
There was no other
real option.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.150
We were a bit strategic in that
we went to a different

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.370
glacier first, and then we went
to the Llulissat Glacier.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.510
And so we were really trying
to figure out between these

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.140
two glaciers, optimizing the

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.870
opportunity to capture something.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.900
At the Store Glacier, we did
capture a small calving event

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.400
that we thought was valuable.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.680
If nothing else happened, that
was a pretty decent one.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.640
But we still wanted to go to
the bigger glacier, the

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.420
Llulissat Glacier, with the
hopes of capturing something

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.330
much larger.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.840
And quite honestly, it was
just serendipity, and the

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.760
timing worked out well.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.180
We had the knowledge of an
entire year's worth of

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.620
photography prior to that, so
we knew what happened to the

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.920
glacier in the year earlier.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.390
And typically, the scientists
are aware that there are

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:35.290
spring break-ups.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.310
So typically, in the May period
of time, is when the

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.680
glacier would have
calving events.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.770
Everything is kind of thawing
out from the spring.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.860
Things are thawing out.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.310
That's when the glacier's
starting to pick

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.730
up some speed again.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.190
That bay, in particular, starts
clearing out around

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.040
that time, so we were really
trying to aim around spending

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.820
that time in May
to capture it.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.250
It still was far bigger
than anything

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.110
we expected to capture.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:00.890
Your other question again?

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.930
AUDIENCE: You were two
miles away but--

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.860
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Oh, distance So
we were on solid bedrock.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.020
We were very, very safe
where we were.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.940
There was no risk
of the glacier

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.179
affecting us at that location.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.080
It would actually take about a
half hour to hike from where

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.500
we were standing to where the
glacier was, where the dead

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.050
ice begins, where we would
even be at any risk

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.449
whatsoever, and part of that
was so that we could get a

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.489
better vantage.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.560
We wanted to be in a spot where
we could look down at

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.920
the glacier to get a better
perspective on it.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.199
And we zoomed the camera lenses
in all the way we could

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.780
to capture it, but that's how
we were able to capture it.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.070
That said, the dead ice next
to that glacier is another

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.480
place where we spent
a lot of time.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.750
We had cameras mounted there up
until the day prior to the

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.260
calving event, trying
to capture things

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.690
on a smaller scale.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.420
And it was interesting because,
from those time

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.710
lapses, you could see the
glacier flowing in the

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.000
background, but the ice in the
foreground was stagnant, and

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.900
you can see kind of the
relationship of those two

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.090
different sections of ice.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.240
But we were very safe.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.290
I'll just add one other comment
about that in regards

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.030
to the sound.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.180
A lot of people ask questions
about the

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.650
sound for the calving.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.400
Because we were so far away,
the actual audio that we

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.690
captured on our cameras
was very poor.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:12.850
There's a lot of wind noise.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.000
There's a lot of distance.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
There's also a lot of us yelling
and screaming and

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.900
being, like, ridiculously
excited that finally something

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.040
was happening.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.980
And the way it's cut
in the film is

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.010
exactly how it happened.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.260
We were on the phone
with James.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.360
We were doing a regular check
in, just giving him an update.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.480
And during the phone
call is when the

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.000
glacier started to move.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.920
We called him back three or four
times during the span of

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.230
the calving event, just
giving him an update.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.090
It's been 20 minutes.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:40.900
It's still happening.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.310
You won't believe
it, it's huge.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.710
40 minutes, it's still
happening.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.710
So we called him a bunch of
times to give him the updates,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.300
and we could definitely feel
that James was upset that he

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.460
wasn't there watching
it himself.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.220
He's, like, back in the
office in Boulder,

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.380
like, why am I here?

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.980
But the audio came from
three main sources.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.000
We used audio that we had
captured from other calving

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.730
events where we were
a lot closer.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.070
So typically, in Alaska, and
then also in other places in

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.790
Greenland, we were much close
to the glacier and got very

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.420
good sound from the calving.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.610
The second main source is from
Skywalker, in that they have

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.570
an incredible library of
ice-calving sounds.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.470
Skywalker Sound, that's why
they're the best in the world.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.620
They've done a bunch of
projects, where Ben Burtt has

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.360
gone out to Alaska to film ice
calving, and they had a great

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.680
library for that.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.490
And the third thing was
kind of interesting.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.620
Some of the scientists that we
worked, they use this device

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.060
called a seismometer,
which anybody in

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.540
California is aware of.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.450
That's what's used to
measure earthquakes.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.610
So they mount it to the bedrock,
and the device can

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.530
pick up any vibration
on the planet.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.520
And it will pick up--

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.610
they call them ice quakes,
when the glacier lurches

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.900
forward or when a calving
event happens--

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.220
the scientists can tell how
violent the shaking was, the

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.060
rumbling was.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.100
And they can take that
information in those waves,

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.040
and they can convert
it into sound.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.000
And you can actually hear the
sound of the planet shaking

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.780
when the ice is calving.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.610
And we had the sound from that
exact event, and we worked

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.900
that into the film as well
to mix it into there.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.870
AUDIENCE: Did you feel
any rumbling?

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.420
JEFF ORLOWSKI: At that distance,
we didn't feel any

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.070
distinct rumbling.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.860
I can't recall.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.230
I don't think Adam would
say that he did either.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.160
In part because of the noise
and the wind and everything

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.720
else and just the distraction
of, are the cameras running?

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.210
Make sure, all right, batteries
and memory cards.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.670
And hold on, we have
to swap a tape.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.890
And you're so distracted with
all of that that we didn't

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.240
have that much opportunity
to really just--

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.130
I think we both tried to milk
those real experiences of,

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.485
like, holy crap, look at what's
happening, and we're

00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:42.620
the only two people here.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.850
But it was also actively
working hard.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.760
AUDIENCE: This is such an
enormous project, both in

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.280
topic and in terms of all the
hours that were, probably,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.460
filmed, thousands of hours.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.310
How do you even take something
so enormous and begin editing

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.520
it, begin, like, having it
all tie in together?

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.660
It seems so intimidating to me
to think about it, but how did

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.920
your project?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.670
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Thank
you for that.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.640
I think it's something that both
James and I experienced

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.960
many times over the course of
the project, and a number of

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.550
times where we both felt like,
OK, it's time to give up or

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.070
should we give up or why are
we doing this to ourselves.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.670
It was one of those scenarios
where, to some degree,

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.470
ignorance is bliss.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.850
And had I known how difficult
it would have been at the

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.140
beginning, I'd like to think
that I would have wanted to

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:33.870
still do it.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.920
But it was so, so hard.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.960
I think from James's
perspective, the biggest

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.040
struggle for him was the
technology not working and the

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.850
constant struggle for
funding and keeping

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.370
the whole thing alive.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.510
It was incredibly difficult for
him to fund the project.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.370
It was hard for us to fund
the film as well.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.550
It was all friends and family
who paid for the film and a

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.420
lot of donated time that
kept it going.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.280
But it was really one of those
things where we felt a

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.950
responsibility to get
it out there.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.950
We knew that we needed to get it
out there, and we just had

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.260
to figure out, how could
we get to that goal?

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.540
The beginning processes for
the editing was very

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.260
difficult, and I worked with a
writer who helped to give me a

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.240
structure to work with.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.800
And he and I were talking
through what we wanted from a

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.250
big-picture perspective.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.380
And we decided, here's a scene,
or we're going to cut

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.370
this one scene, and
we tried it.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.820
And then we cut another scene,
and OK, that was good.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.260
And probably the first
half-dozen scenes that we cut

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.470
aren't in the film
at all anymore.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.070
It had gone through so
many iterations.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.010
But it was really trying to
tackle it scene by scene,

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.370
trying to keep one specific goal
in mind that's tangible

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.070
that you can accomplish.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.370
This is what we want
to do today.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:42.510
It's just this one thing.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:46.634
And really, all those million
steps add up.

00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:47.500
Yes?

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.570
Do we need the microphone?

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.710
We have the microphone
over there.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.109
We'll get the mic down here.

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:54.590
Go ahead.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.990
I just wanted to hear about--

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.000
the film's so powerful.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.160
As you've been showing it to
political leaders, what type

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.380
of response you've
been getting.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.060
And a small, just technical
question in how you decided on

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.090
the interval for the lapse.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:08.600
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.400
So the intervals were based on,
how many could we possibly

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.770
milk out before the memory
cards ran out of space?

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.710
OK, are we going to get back
to this camera in a year?

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.100
Are we going to get back
here in two years?

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.180
Using 32-gigabyte cards, with
calculating how many photos it

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.520
would take.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.540
We started off doing one
every hour, and that

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.760
was kind of the rubric.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.320
As the memory cards got larger
and larger in capacity, as the

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.780
system became more reliable,
we upped that

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.850
to every half hour.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.890
If we were there with the
cameras, where when Adam and I

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.770
are shooting or the whole team
is shooting something, we

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.940
would set the cameras to shoot
very, very quickly, in some

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.300
cases, every five minutes
watching the glacier.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.480
Or, if we were doing kind of
more aesthetic time lapses of

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.040
ice moving, they would be
sometimes every second, every

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.960
two seconds, every 10 seconds.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.140
So the interval was really
dependent on what we were

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.810
trying to capture.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.250
And conceptually, we broke them
up into the long-term

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.360
time lapses and short-term
time lapses.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.700
That's the language that
we always used.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.030
Because most people think of
time lapses as a one-hour time

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.150
lapse or a one-day-long
time lapse.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.670
And we would do those, but that
wasn't the core project.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:23.370
So for us, those were all
short-term time lapses.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.290
And then the political response
to the film has been

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.080
interesting.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.510
We did a screening before
Congress, which doesn't mean

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.310
that all of Congress came
to see the film.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.890
But we did give out DVDs to
every senator and every

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:38.560
congressman in Washington, so
we feel like we upheld some

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.900
sense of responsibility
with that.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.840
We've had a very good response
from our senators and

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.300
congressmen in Colorado that
we're connected to and have

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.380
seen the film and have been
trying to support getting the

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.030
film out there.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.400
One of the issues is
that it is such a

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.270
political subject, right?

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.630
From my perspective as
a filmmaker, making a

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.210
documentary about this subject
is particularly challenging.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.170
You can choose a subject where
people don't know anything

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.590
about the issue, and they come
in to see the film and they

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.630
learn about your issue.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.560
And you can convey whatever you
want, and they leave the

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.100
film learning more about
that subject.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.780
Here, everybody comes into the
film with the preconceived

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.560
notion of climate change,
whether it's happening or

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.150
whether it isn't, their stance
on the policy issues, what we

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.350
should be doing about it.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.180
So we have this huge, huge
uphill battle to win an

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.360
audience over and to get them
to even kind of think about

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.130
what we could do next.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.610
We didn't want the film
to be political.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.490
We really tried to keep
that out of the

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:37.700
content of the film.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.540
There are some news clips that
are in the film that are

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.150
really just establishing, this
is where we are socially,

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.700
culturally.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.300
This is where the conversation
about this issue is happening.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.600
There is still this childlike
debate among some media

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.980
outlets as to whether or not it
is or isn't happening, and

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.240
we needed that in the film
because that's the only reason

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.770
why James did the project
in the first place.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.180
If it wasn't for that lack of
consensus in the public's eye,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.880
not from the scientific
perspective, but from the

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.680
public's eye, James would have
had no reason to make the time

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.130
lapses in the first place.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:12.110
So it's been interesting to see
what kind of influence the

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.540
film can have in the
political space.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.410
There are more and more groups
that are trying to leverage

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.870
the film to advance awareness
about the issue.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.410
We want the film to be used as
a tool for that purpose.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.450
I mean, that's kind of
our mindset now.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.950
Like I said, that wasn't
the intention

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:26.700
when we made the film.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.110
We wanted it to be
James's story.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.140
This is his experience.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.080
This is what he saw.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.870
This is what his cameras
captured.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:34.350
You can't argue with the
photography, like, this is

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.480
what's going on, and you can
make your own assessment as to

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.180
what this means from the
long-term perspective.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.400
James's opinion is stated in the
film in regards to that.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.750
But it's something where we
really wanted to give people--

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.990
we want the film to be used as
a tool to get the awareness

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.470
out there about the issue.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:56.280
We did a screening before the
United Nations as well.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.440
We haven't done a screening
for Fox News.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.160
We did an interview
with Fox News.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.240
It was expected, but
disappointing, that all of the

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.320
questions that they asked were
just about our experience

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.480
about the project, about the
aesthetics and the photography

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.040
and the adventure.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.130
They didn't ask any questions
about policy or what needs to

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.370
be done or why is there a
debate about this issue.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.630
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Did you all
hear the question?

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:28.530
The question was about when we
were out there, how did we

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.120
survive psychologically with
the limited resources?

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.670
It was surprisingly easy from
my perspective, and I think

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.000
most of the team would agree
because we had such a specific

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.390
mission all the time.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.940
Well, OK.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.960
There are a couple different
trips, and I guess different

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.410
ones fit different categories.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.450
The glacier-watching
trip was unique.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.350
That was the only time where we
were out there, and it was

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.320
just me and Adam waiting for
that period of time.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.330
All the other trips,
we were with James.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:02.000
James had a specific photograph
that he had a

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.850
conceptual idea over, and every
day was about trying to

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.890
capture that one image.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:10.500
So we were very occupied with
the work of the photography.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.200
And even that long
glacier-watching trip, we did

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.720
bring a very big stack
of books, definitely.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.260
We actually had to agree on
which books we would bring

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.370
because we had limited-weight
capacity that we could bring.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:27.320
So Adam and I, we both had to
sign off on every book that we

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.380
took out there.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.130
But you're so busy, like,
cooking for yourself and,

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.090
like, keeping yourself fed and
keeping yourself warm and

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.300
checking cameras, downloading
cards,

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.650
backing up all the data.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.160
You're doing so much of that
to keep the camp life going

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.510
and keep the cameras running,
that there were only a couple

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.220
hours every day of downtime.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.950
And honestly, like, right now,
I wish I could just be back

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.460
out there, and, like, have
some rest and relaxation.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:56.340
But yeah, it was something
where it wasn't, from my

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.970
perspective, it wasn't
that hard to keep

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.072
focused on the work.

00:46:00.072 --> 00:46:00.550
Yeah?

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.310
And we need to pass the
mic around just

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.870
for the video stream.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.006
AUDIENCE: Since this
is Google, I'll

00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:08.320
ask a technical question.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.345
So I'm actually pretty
interested in the rig you used

00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:13.160
for shooting these
long exposures.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.185
Because I know one of the first
things I thought looking

00:46:15.185 --> 00:46:18.090
at this when you had this device
was why you didn't get

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.380
some cooperation from the vendor
in terms of writing,

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.170
like, custom firmware for
the camera because

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:23.720
I know that's possible.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.260
And my second question
is just more general.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.420
Could you comment a little bit
about sort of the special

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.020
challenges of operating an SLR
in the middle of minus 40

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.780
degree Fahrenheit temperature
because that can't be like

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.990
walking down the street?

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.460
JEFF ORLOWSKI: No, it's
very, very different.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.760
So Nikon sponsored the project,
and they gave us 25

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.590
Nikon D200s, which was one of
their leading cameras at the

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:53.450
time, their leading DSLR, for
what we could use en masse.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.740
The timers that were available
from Nikon were timers that

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.610
kept the camera running 24/7.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.320
So the power drain was very,
very high, and we couldn't

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.660
afford to use those timers
because the battery supply--

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.750
we couldn't bring enough
batteries out there to keep

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.990
that alive.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.010
James talked with Nikon, for
sure, but their team wasn't

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.660
available to be designing
the hardware for us.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.350
So James had worked with a guy
privately to build the

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:24.900
original intervalometer
to do that.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.200
Nikon is a bit more
restrictive.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.470
I believe, the Canon cameras are
a lot more open in terms

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.560
of fiddling with the firmware.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.440
But I don't know if it's as
open for the Nikon system.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.564
So that's about all I can
speak to on that.

00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:39.500
Yeah?

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:39.710
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:41.060
Was there another question?

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.157
The long exposures.

00:47:42.157 --> 00:47:44.000
AUDIENCE: I was looking for fun
anecdotes about, like--

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.580
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Oh, shooting?

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.460
in 40-degree weather?

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.160
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Well, the worst
thing that would happen is

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.140
there was one time where we were
shooting on the beach,

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.420
and James had his camera in
a waterproof housing.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.370
And he got so frustrated with
the bulk of the waterproof

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.680
housing and not being able to
operate it that he took it out

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.510
of the bag.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.180
He kept shooting, then a rogue
wave came and splashed the

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.510
camera, fried the camera.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:10.650
So he was a little upset that
day, just, like, wasting an

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.540
$8,000 camera.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.810
But the biggest difficulty is
that they're not designed to

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.260
be used with layers and
layers of gloves.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.550
Like, that's honestly the
biggest complication for the

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.330
still photo cameras and the
video cameras because you've

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.650
got, like, a Sony EX1 with these
little switches that you

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.040
flick with your fingernail,
typically, and these tiny,

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.380
little buttons that you, like,
you need your pinkie to press.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.740
And when you have a mid-weight
glove, then a heavy glove, and

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.190
then a huge mitten on top of it,
being able to press any of

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.260
those things with accuracy
isn't possible.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.190
The Sony cameras worked
amazingly well in the cold.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.140
They held up.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.640
The batteries held up.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.460
You keep the batteries warm
inside your jacket pocket.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.830
You swap them out kind of
regularly, and that keeps the

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.050
batteries going as
long as possible.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.070
But I kept a little pen in my
coat or available, and I'd use

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:03.610
the pen in my mitten to, like,
poke at different buttons and

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.990
mess with little switches.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:09.070
And that was really, a simple
device like that became, like,

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.700
so much easier to operate
than having to

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.860
take off your mitten.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.780
Then you have to fold it in
half so snow doesn't get

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.530
inside, and you put it between
your legs or under your arm so

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.440
that snow doesn't get inside
your glove and you don't drop

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.460
it or lose it.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.600
And now you've got still two
layers of gloves on, and it's

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.780
still too bulky to really
operate everything.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.330
James would often take his
gloves off because he got so

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.300
frustrated, but he did get
frostnip a number of times on

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.490
his fingertips, yeah.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:33.990
Yeah?

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have time
for one more question.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.782
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah?

00:49:35.782 --> 00:49:37.140
Last question?

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.210
AUDIENCE: I was curious about
this one big glacier where you

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.670
had to move the camera because
it's receding.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.640
Just how many years are
left on that glacier?

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.900
JEFF ORLOWSKI: How many years
are left on the glacier?

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.680
It's an interesting question.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.680
It's a tough one for me to
answer specifically.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.280
The glacier has gone through
incredible retreat.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.460
In my lifetime, I think it's
retreated something like 13

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.130
miles, 12 to 14 miles,
in that range.

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.620
It is expected to continue
to retreat.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.680
But based on the topography of
the land underneath, I believe

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.710
that there are some, like,
natural points where it will

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.240
no longer be ocean-terminating,
and it'll,

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.450
basically, kind of--

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.570
I'm not fully aware
of the long-term

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:18.690
projections on that one.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.630
The glacier is called the
Columbia Glacier.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.090
Our scientist, Tad Pfeffer,
has done a bunch

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.510
of papers on that.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.690
The best I can advise is to look
up Tad Pfeffer and the

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.260
Columbia Glacier to see future
predictions on that because

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.196
I'm not a glaciologist.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:32.550
Yeah.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:33.640
AUDIENCE: Very quickly.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.470
So I had to ask, too.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.960
I noticed you had
some lead acid

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.370
batteries and solar panels.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:39.580
Don't those freeze up?

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.220
Do they work at all?

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.700
JEFF ORLOWSKI: The lead acid
batteries were out there.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.800
They performed poorly, but
they were, at some cases,

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.540
like, the only option
we had available.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.020
There were times where
we couldn't--

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.980
I don't know if it can be done,
if Google can do this--

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.480
but we couldn't be shipping
batteries to Greenland.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.040
We have to buy batteries locally
in Iceland and in

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.230
Greenland, so you're kind of
stuck with whatever you can

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.030
get locally.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:06.650
There were times where we had
lead acid batteries in hiking

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.670
packs, and Adam was skiing
around with a lead acid

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.560
battery on his back.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.640
He was the best skier of the
group, which is why he was

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.610
doing that.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.870
I didn't want to volunteer
for that position.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.700
But yeah, they didn't
perform very well.

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.220
James really tried to work
them out of the system.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.870
We had one battery that
exploded in a

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:26.590
camera box in Alaska.

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:27.720
We just opened it, and
there was, like,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.980
smoke inside the whole--

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.290
I mean, it had settled at that
point, but there was just the

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:35.410
dust lining the inside
of the pelican case.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.280
But yeah, it was really
difficult to get the right

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.820
tools in those places.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.180
AUDIENCE: You said you
cycled them out.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.020
What were you using instead?

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.090
JEFF ORLOWSKI: There are
other batteries.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.550
I don't know the battery
technology explicitly, but we

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.520
ended up using smaller--

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.390
effectively now, we just use,
like, motorcycle batteries.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.990
And I don't know what kind
of technology behind the

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.320
batteries, but the solar
panels are smaller.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.530
The batteries are smaller.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.580
And they're at the point now
where they can last for a long

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.980
period of time because of the
way the timer is designed,

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.983
because they can hibernate
for so long.

00:52:03.983 --> 00:52:04.376
AUDIENCE: All right,
thank you.

00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:05.260
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah, thanks.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: I want
to thank you for--

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.780
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah,
thank you.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: --your
time today.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.220
Jeff's going to be available if
you want to informally chat

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.050
with him, but we need
to close the talk.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.130
And thank you so much.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.210
JEFF ORLOWSKI: Yeah, thank
you, guys, very much.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:21.403
[APPLAUSE]
