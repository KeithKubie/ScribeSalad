Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radiolab from [inaudible]. W. N. Y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Alright. Three two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. O. K. I'm Robert Krulwich. You're a cheery today. I was curious. This is radio land. This is our podcast version. Yes, and today on the podcast, stay in that cheery frame of mind because we're going to talk about pain today. So here's the quandary. It is really hard to put words to pain, like to describe to somebody. I have this pain in my back and it feels like, wow, like odd or really hurting. It's like it's really difficult to describe to someone in a way that would let them feel it too. It's like one of these classic empathy barriers. Right? That's true. But if you could quantify it, measure it. If I could know exactly numerically what you're going through, maybe that would help. Maybe we could be better friends if, if you could, do you think you could is that know Oregon to try? See our producer, Tim Howard over the last few months has encountered three different people who in different ways are trying to measure pain, share it. So we're going to do three episodes of pain calibration calibration, a triptych of pain calibration. Okay. Bring it on.

Speaker 2:          01:27          You used to, uh, well I got started with all this when I met this guy. Yeah. I'm Justin Schmidt. I'm a research biologist, but he's really a bug guy. I like to try to get into the head of the stinging insect. He lives in, in Tucson, Arizona, and um, works in this one story building on a residential street. Right now we're in my laboratory at southwestern biological institute. Could we, could we just, uh, take a quick like glance around? I'd love to, I'd love to just like what? No, no. What it is though, we're looking at, underneath those cabinets are 48 drawers of insect specimen. So these are, wow, he's got wasp that's a Poco and it's a nocturnal wasp is terrifying. This one here, different kinds of weird foreign it. That's actually a flightless grasshopper. It's got a lot of ants. Wow. There's some little furry, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Those are velvet ants. They're huge of you pick up one of these things and get stung by. It's going to feel like, oh my goodness. That could kill a cow. Okay. So this all started for Justin back in the 70s when he was a grad student. And I just thought for a Lark, I took a seminar course in entomology. We, we had one entomologist in the whole university. This is of course in bug signs. Yeah. This was in Georgia and he was outside one day in the field and he was trying to get a sample of, um, harvest strand harvests or in, what does that look like? About a third of an inch long. And they're bright, pretty good sized ants actually. And he was trying to get one into a jar and uh, I got stung by [inaudible] the night I kind of, oh, it's odd. It didn't really hurt at first. Okay. It sort of felt like somebody was using a dental, a syringe or really fine needles. Slowly injecting a little bit of water. It had this kind of Crystalyn feeling. It wasn't an immediate pain. This was a delayed thing. And so then I thought, oh, okay. But after about a minute,

Speaker 2:          03:36          he started really hurting

Speaker 3:          03:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:41          oh, this really hurts. Is this really deep sort of visceral pain. Something was going in and tearing out your nerves and your muscles and your tendons.

Speaker 3:          03:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:59          what struck me was how dramatically different this was from anything that I'd experienced from a Bumblebee, honeybee sweat, B yellow jacket paper was in. Once the pain subsided, he thought, man, I need to study that. Yeah. You know, he had all these kind of higher level science questions about, you know, evolution of pain and insects and how different stinging in sex develops. But the problem was, oh, O k pain. What do we do about measuring pain if he was really gonna get to the bottom of why one insect was more or less painful than another, he couldn't do that with just words like more or less. I need numbers with numbers. He could do all kinds of research. Not to mention it would make working with other bug scientists just a lot easier. And I started looking into this and found out, oh, this wasn't anything new.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Nobody really knows how to measure pain because you know, no two people feel pain the same way. Some people I'm hired pain tolerance than others. On the other hand, that harvest rent was objectively way more painful than anything he'd ever been stung by. Oh yeah. So Justin realized what I need is a universal insects thing, pain scale [inaudible] so Justin starts traveling all around the world and he's, you know, every time he hears about a bug, especially a stinging bug, uh, he goes looking for it and in order to be stung by it, well, I don't like pain. And so he says he's not trying to get stung, but it usually happens. And as far as he's concerned, that's a good thing. For example, I was petrified of this. The SINICA, which I call the warrior wasp a sneaker, is this a black wasp with this metallic sheen down in Central America and they're known for this warning sound that they make with their nest. They have this big carton carton being kind of paper kind of goes, yeah.

Speaker 4:          06:03          [inaudible]. Justin

Speaker 2:          06:03          was there with another scientist and they're tromping through the jungle and then they find a nest. Here we are this nest and it starts to make that sound. Well, sure enough, we eventually got a kamikaze that came out and nailed me. Wait, where did this thing you kind of on my forehead and I just sort of sat on the stump and sir, Ooh, this really hurts it. It hurt like a yellow jacket or a horn, but it was just a whole lot more and it kept hurting for an hour and so I, you know, recorded what the feeling was for this hour, but you're sitting there in a stump or something and your forehead is throbbing and you're taking notes. Well, what else can you do? He talks about getting stung by something that makes him hurt so much that he just starts screaming and pain for like an hour in lying on the ground because that'll make the pain less I guess.

Speaker 2:          06:58          Then my left hands sitting here shaking, it's trembling, you know, it's going up and down and I say, Oh darn your hand stop that. Then with his other hand, he's taking notes about exactly what, how it feels this left once you flapping away. And I'm in any case, how many times has he been stung? He told me he's been stung by like 150 species and probably about a thousand times and he's used all those experiences to build up a scale, which he could say is a five point scale, zero one, two, three and four zero being that's essentially trivial and four being really hurts. But wait, how does he deal with the whole subjectivity thing? Cause like your four is going to be different in my fourth here's something pretty clever, which is that he took that one sting that we pretty much all know and decided, I mean he used that as a reference.

Speaker 2:          07:51          So I anchored it with the honeybee, which is ouch, which I, you can talk about with anybody. Anybody who's been stung by a honeybee, it also doesn't hurt too much and it doesn't hurt too little. So it's like a mid point. Exactly. And a middle point in this case was easier than a top or a bottom because I didn't know what the top or bottom where. There's no way to know where the top or the bottom is. So a honeybee was was that, and see, give that a two two out of four the prime meridian of pain and every time he gets stung by a new bug, he'll ask himself, is it more than a honeybee? Less than a honeybee, about the same as a honey bee, a whole lot more, a whole lot less then it gives that thing its own number. Big. This 1.0 sweat like a femoral almost fruity, 1.8 bullhorn occasion and a rare piercing, elevated sort of pain.

Speaker 2:          08:42          Someone is fired. A staple into your cheek. 2.0 bald faced Hornet. Rich Hardy, slightly crunchy, similar to getting your hand mash in a revolving door. How three red harvests are in bold and unrelenting. Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail. Huh? This is his pain scale. Justin calls. This is tongue in cheek first. That was, you know, more fun. But yeah, these are some of these things that he's measured. And what's the, uh, what's the worst? What's the top of the scale? Uh, the bullet and it sends excruciating waves of burning pain that are undiminished for 12 hours. And you get these pulsations, you get this, this pain crescendo that goes to you just about wanting to scream. It backs off a little bit and say, say, ah, you kind of give it a little bit of a sigh or we leave and then it sends back up and it keeps doing this, these hills and valleys of ascending pain and then decrease even the decreasing to the lowest still hurts.

Speaker 1:          09:42          So this scale, uh, works for him and he uses it to communicate with bug scientists.

Speaker 5:          09:46          Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, all right. That's kind of cool. But I gotta be honest. I, I, this is, I'm wanting more right now because I, uh, I liked the scale, but I'm thinking actually beyond bugs to like, let me just put my cards on the table, like childbirth. Okay. Like,

Speaker 1:          10:09          oh, okay. I know. But we talked about the gap between like, uh, to people feeling pain. And being able to share pain. That's where the rubber meets the road.

Speaker 6:          10:18          It's used in a lot of marriages as a constant. You don't know. You don't know what exactly. Yeah. Thank you Robert. This tame argues it the way Carla uses it. Well, I can't say that in another recording. No, not at all. It really never crossed my mind.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Carla, who is a very sort of understating lady when it comes to this subject, she'll be like, you have no idea. You don't even begin to know what you don't know about what we just went through. Well that brings me to my second store. Can I, can I take it from the top for this one? We go back a few years. So where in 1948

Speaker 7:          10:57          oh

Speaker 1:          10:58          well who is this lady? This is Paula Michaels. She's a professor of the history of medicine. I teach at the University of Iowa. And she told me this story that takes place in New York at New York hospital in 1948 right. So there's James D. Hardy, there's Carl t Jeff air hardy handover doctors, and they're trying to test drugs. You know what drugs are going to be useful to alleviate the pain of childbirth. And in this period there's a whole range of things that are being used. What are some of the ones that they're using? Well, like more Phoenix Cupola mean. Um, demerol is a big thing. Nice and heroin, which to me sounds completely crazy. They play on crack too. They, they would have, if they knew about it. The problem is they want to be able to test all of these drugs so that they can use them in a standard way, but they weren't actually sure how much pain women were really in.

Speaker 1:          11:50          And I guess you kind of have to know that in order to know how much drugs to give them. Yeah. They had no idea. And it was a source of a lot of debate. Yes. One man Grantly decreed a British physician basically said straight out, it's in women's minds, not their bodies. What childbirth is a completely painless experience. Entirely psychological in origin. Wow. That is an incredibly bold thing for Amanda. Say yes, that's Chutzpah. Now Hardy and Java or didn't take it that far, but they wanted to get past the whole messy psychological part of childbirth and eliminate that woman's subjective experience of pain from the calculation of whether these drugs are effective or not and how are they going to do this? Well, their method is pretty crazy.

Speaker 8:          12:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:41          They had this apparatus called a doll Ramadan. It was this little wood box that had dials and knobs plugged into the wall and then was connected by a wire to another part, what they called the exposure unit. That was like a heat gun with an aperture that can shoot out heat. Then they got some volunteers, some of them are nurses, some of them were the wives of obstetricians or other physicians, all very pregnant and they told these women, this might not be very pleasant, but by participating you are going to be making childbirth just so much better for every woman to follow. That's right. And the women were excited to help. And then when the woman went into labor, hardy and Java would show up bedside with the dolor arbiter and they'd wait for the contraction to finish. And then between contractions during that pause, they take the heat gun and they put it against the back of the woman's hand and they'd say to her, all right, we want to know about that contraction. The one you just had. Yeah, we want to know how much it hurt. Nate. Say, is it more like a

Speaker 9:          13:45          one more like it?

Speaker 1:          13:47          And then the woman would respond because B as closer. Then they would say, is it more like B or more like c? See maybe that was a way of then saying, okay, well that was a contraction of three dolls dolls with the doll. The Dole is their unit of pain. They're their standard unit that they use for everybody. [inaudible] and so over the course of labor, after every contraction, they would repeat this process. Same drill. Is it more like a or more like bit again a B and again beat one more like c and again over the course of her whole labor. So we on top of all the labor pains, they're just cranking this heat up and up. Yeah. Wow. In the case of one patient,

Speaker 8:          14:31          Oh,

Speaker 1:          14:32          who insisted on going the distance at pain intensity of 10 and a half dolls with measured

Speaker 1:          14:38          hardy and Java are called this the ceiling. This is the most intense pain which can be experienced. Second degree burns were inflicted upon the hands of this patient by the four tests made at levels than nine dolls. Second degree burns. Yeah. I mean I like what these guys are trying to do, but wow, that is sadistic. It seems totally twisted, but it's in the name of science. It's for a greater good. Uh Huh. All right. So then the doctor is, they took all of the data from all of the women and they start going through it, looking for patterns, looking for things in common. And then the most incredible part to me is that they converted all that information into a mathematical formula. Doles of pain equals 10.5 minus 1.5 times contraction intervals in minutes. What? Well, so they're saying if you tell us the amount of time between the contractions at any point in our labor, we can tell you exactly how much pain the woman is in no more mystery.

Speaker 1:          15:48          There's no more wondering problem-solve. The code is cracked and what happens? Uh, this is a breakthrough sweep. The medical establishment, I'm guessing it doesn't, uh, no other people could not achieve the same results that they achieved using the Deloitte, I don't know, like at the lot [inaudible] using the dull ramen or they were not able to achieve the same results when other doctors tried to do it. That formula didn't seem to apply to the women that they looked at. Shocker. Obviously there's a lot of problems with the entire approach that these guys had, right? No. Yeah. I mean, for starters, they were trying to compare pain in the abdomen to, you know, like a burning sensation on the arm. Yeah. I mean, that's a, that's like a translation problem. Yeah. Well, I mean in my opinion there's kind of a bigger translation issue happening, which is in order to talk about a pain you're feeling, you need to be able to observe it and, and kind of stand apart from it in your own head, if that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          16:52          Sure. And when you hear women talk about the pain of childbirth, my name is Sarah, I'm in Sacramento, California. We asked people to submit theirs through the radio lab app. And when you listen to these different accounts, my experience of childbirth pain was, it sounds like there's a certain point where everything shifts and one woman said it was at about late [inaudible] seven centimeters dilated and that's when you like lose your mind and you can't think you can't talk. Suddenly the pain becomes so great, so bad, but there's no more reference point. I just remember there's no more objective distance making these noises that were just on earthly. And in these submissions, it's usually at this point in the story where the woman neither just draws a blank wow. Or resorts to some crazy analogy. I felt like there was a freight train

Speaker 10:         17:50          bearing down on my vagina from inside my body, and then I could almost hear it building

Speaker 11:         18:00          to come to [inaudible]. I felt like I was being dragged out to sea. That's when I actually heard a couple times waves, waves of pain. And it was kind of like that for, for Paula too. I turned very much inward in a way that, that made time feel like it stopped.

Speaker 3:          18:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         18:24          I was drowning,

Speaker 11:         18:27          drowning in this lake of pain and there was a horizon and when the contractions were intense, I would swim towards the horizon. This is Eula. I'm Eula Biss. I'm a nonfiction writer and she's our third pain. Calibrator and for me, you look kind of gets the closest at finding a way to communicate pain. If, if I could see you have a relationship with pain, uh, when did that, when did that start for you? Let's see. About almost 10 years ago, I think I was about 26 at the time. Ula was a Grad student in Iowa and uh, I just woke up one morning in the fall and I had a terrible pain and the side of my neck, upper back side of my face, she had no idea what it was. It was a burning pain with this nauseatingly tingling sensation. I've really never felt anything else like it.

Speaker 11:         19:27          And months past, and it didn't go away and it was making it very difficult for me to sleep. It started to interfere with my thinking too. I couldn't concentrate. So one day she went to the hospital and by this point she was a total mess. So I was kind of teary and shaking and I said, you, you need to give me something to help me with this. And so the doc said, all right, well take a look at this thing up here on the wall. This is called the pain scale. It had the numbers zero to 10. At one end it said no pain at the other end it said the worst pain imaginable. And the doctor says to her, okay, what number is your pain? Ula starts to think about it. The worst pain imaginable is kind of vague. Is this the worst pain you yourself can imagine? Or is it the worst pain imaginable on earth? You know, this was around the time that I think a man had died being dragged behind a truck in Texas. And I, I remember sitting in the exam room thinking about that. And then I was trying to do some rudimentary mathematics if being dragged behind a truck a to your death is the worst pain imaginable. What, what proportion of that do I feel? And I thought, you know, a third of that seemed pretty significant to me.

Speaker 1:          20:48          So she says three, I guess. And the is like, all right. And he does some tests. He tries to figure out exactly what's going on, can't really, but since she said three anyway, he's like, all right, well, you know, have some aspirin, go home. And this happened a few times. She wasn't getting any better. So at a certain point, she calls up her dad who's also a doctor and she starts complaining.

Speaker 11:         21:10          I was telling him how frustrated I was that, um, the doctors didn't seem to be taking this very seriously. And he said, well, when they ask you to rate your pain, what, what do you tell them? [inaudible] and I said, I usually say three. And he said, well, there's your problem.

Speaker 1:          21:26          Her Dad tells her you should say eight, even if you're not feeling it. That's what you gotta say. And Ula thinks, you know, this is ridiculous. Why do we even have a pain scale if I'm not supposed to take the numbers seriously?

Speaker 11:         21:39          And, um, he said, in part, it's a tool that's meant to protect practitioners because it's emotionally difficult to have someone say to you, um, it feels like someone's jamming a red hot poker through my eyeball rather than, I've got a nine.

Speaker 1:          21:58          But then he made a suggestion, which I think is really clever.

Speaker 11:         22:03          He suggested one scale where that would measure what you're willing to do to get rid of your pain. What would you trade for pain relief? Would you give up your sense of sight for five years? Would you relinquish your ability to walk? Did you come up with any answers at that point? I did. I, they were disturbing answers, you know, when my father asked, would you accept a shorter lifespan? At that point in time I thought, yeah, I would have how many years? I was thinking I'd take 10 years off my life.

Speaker 12:         22:46          Wow. For me,

Speaker 11:         22:49          that was basically the first time I felt like I understood her pain. But you know, I was 26 and life seems really long when you're 26 now I'm in a much difference, but my pain is not nearly as bad as it was then. So now I'm not really in the bargaining mood anymore.

Speaker 1:          23:11          I bet. Like how about a bad haircut? Would you take it really bad haircut? A Mohawk?

Speaker 3:          23:16          Huh?

Speaker 11:         23:18          Okay. Yeah. Actually it would.

Speaker 1:          23:24          And these days you'll, is kind of pessimistic about the idea that we're ever going to really have a useful pain scale.

Speaker 11:         23:31          At the end of the day, I'm not sure. Pain is a quantity that is measurable.

Speaker 3:          23:38          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          23:39          Thinking that kind of bums her out

Speaker 11:         23:41          because part of me wanted to believe in the project of quantification. Y I, I'm not sure. Um, I think because not believing in it is a little bit lonelier. The idea that we cannot feel, cannot understand and cannot imagine each other's pain is a really isolating thought.

Speaker 3:          24:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         24:09          by the way, what was her pain from? Did she get a diagnosis? Well, her doctor tried a lot of stuff actually. They did a brain scan. They checked for a spinal infection, and ultimately he said, you know, unfortunately, we, we don't know what causes this. We don't know how to treat it. We don't know if it will ever get better. Um, but we do know it's real. And that was my final conversation with him and he said, um, good luck out there.

Speaker 3:          24:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         24:57          thanks to producer Tim Howard, Justin Schmidt, Paula Michaels, and you'll abyss. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
