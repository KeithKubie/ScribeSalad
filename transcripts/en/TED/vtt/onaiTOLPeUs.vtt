00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.174
You know, my friends,
I look at this photograph

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:18.643
and I have to ask myself,

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.277
you know, I think I've seen this
somewhere before.

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:24.457
People marching in the street for justice.

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:28.354
But I know it's not the same photograph
that I would have seen,

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:32.845
because I wouldn't take my oath
to be a police officer until 1989.

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:36.649
And I've been in the business
for over 25 years.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:39.045
And identifying
as an African-American woman,

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:41.244
I know things have gotten better.

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:43.691
But even as I learned about public safety,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:46.660
I wondered if what
I was doing on the street

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:48.991
was hurting or harming the community.

00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:53.680
And I often wondered if, you know,
how did they perceive me,

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:55.585
this woman in uniform?

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.888
But there is one thing that I knew.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.619
I knew there was a way that we could
do this, probably, different or better.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.291
A way that preserved dignity
and guaranteed justice.

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.283
But I also knew that police
could not do it alone.

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.933
It's the coproduction of public safety.

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.020
There is a lot of history with us.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.973
You know, we know loss.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.296
The relationship between

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.459
the African American community
and the police is a painful one.

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.204
Often filled with mistrust.

00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:37.903
It has been studied by social scientists,

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:40.982
it has been studied by government,

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.859
all both promising, you know,
hopeful new ways and long-term fixes.

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.593
But all we want is to be safe.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.899
And our safety is intertwined.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.138
And that we know,
in order to have great relationships

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:56.748
and relationships built on trust,

00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:59.198
that we're going to have
to have communication.

00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:04.990
And in this advent and this text
of the world that we've got going on,

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:07.283
trying to do this with social media,

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:09.574
it's a very difficult thing to do.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.737
We also have to examine
our current policing practices,

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.869
and we have to set those things aside
that no longer serve us.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:19.465
So, in New York, that meant
"stop, question and frisk."

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:24.966
That meant really holding up
the numbers as opposed to relationships.

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:28.484
And it really didn't allow
the officers the opportunity

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:32.161
to get to know the community
in which they serve.

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:35.442
But you see, there is a better way.

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:38.596
And we know -- it's called coproduction.

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.559
So in the 1970s, Elinor Ostrom
came up with this theory,

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.260
really called coproduction,
and this is how it works.

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:50.879
You bring people into the space
that come with separate expertise,

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:54.956
and you also come with new ideas
and lived experience,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.367
and you produce a new knowledge.

00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.551
And when you produce that new knowledge,

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.424
and you apply this theory
to public safety,

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.115
you produce a new type of public safety.

00:03:05.657 --> 00:03:09.888
And so, in New York, it feels like this.

00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:15.732
It is called building relationships,
literally one block at a time.

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:17.738
And it's "Build the Block."

00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:19.500
So this is how it works.

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:23.602
You go to buildtheblock.nyc,
you put in your address.

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:27.954
And up pops location, date and time
of your neighborhood meeting.

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:32.410
The important part of this
is you've got to go to the meeting.

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:34.561
And once you go to that meeting,

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:37.156
there, of course, will be NYPD,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.447
along with officers
and other community members.

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:44.536
What's important about bringing, now,
the lived experience into this space

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.312
to produce new knowledge

00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:48.780
is that we have to have
a new way of delivering it.

00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:50.807
So the new way of delivering it

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.680
is through what we call neighborhood
coordinating officers, or NCOs.

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:58.625
And so, also in this meeting are the NCOs,

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.561
the what we call 911 response cars,

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:04.490
sector cars, detectives,

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:07.969
all of us working together
to collaborate in this new way

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:09.643
to reduce crime.

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:14.746
And what's interesting about this
is that we know that it works.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.188
So, for example, in Washington Heights.

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:20.323
At a community meeting, there was a bar,
up in Washington Heights,

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:23.291
and the neighbors were complaining
about outcry and noises.

00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:26.410
So in their conversations with their NCO,

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:28.760
they talked about, you know,
sound barriers,

00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:30.916
different ways to sort of approach this.

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.442
Is there a different way
we can direct traffic?

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:37.400
And of course now they have
relatively quieter bar nights.

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:41.490
So, another issue that always
comes up in neighborhoods is speeding.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.163
How many of you in here
have ever had a speeding ticket?

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:45.339
Raise your hand.

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:46.505
Oh, higher, come on!

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.674
There's more than that, this is New York.

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:51.492
So those are other issues
that brought to the NCO.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.280
Speeding -- what the NCOs do

00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:56.039
is they collaborate
with the Department of Transportation,

00:04:56.063 --> 00:05:00.643
they look at issues such as speed bumps
and signage and all types of things.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:04.421
And when we come together to create
this different type of policing,

00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:06.524
it also feels different.

00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:10.243
The coproduction
of public safety also means

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:12.093
that officers need to understand

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:14.935
the history and the power
of their uniforms.

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:18.276
They're going to have to set aside
old historical narratives

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.855
that do not serve them well.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.878
And that means they have to learn
about implicit bias.

00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:26.142
Implicit biases are shortcuts
the brain makes

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.903
without us really knowing it.

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:31.767
They're stereotypes
that often influence our decision making.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:33.671
And so, you can imagine,

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:37.061
for police officers who have to make
split-second decisions

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:40.352
can be a very detrimental
decision-making point.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:45.885
That's why the NYPD, along with other
departments throughout the United States,

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.936
are training all of their officers
in implicit bias.

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:54.528
They have to understand
that learning about their implicit biases,

00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:58.711
having good training, tactics
and deescalation

00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:01.910
and understanding how it impacts
your decision making

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.513
makes us all safer.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.387
We also know how officers
are treated inside the organization

00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.887
impacts how they're going to behave
with the community at large.

00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:13.362
This is critical.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.385
Especially if you want to have
a new way forward.

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:21.372
And we know that we have to care
for those folks that are on the frontline.

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:24.576
And they have to recognize
their own trauma.

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:28.755
And in order to do that,
us as leaders have to lift them up

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.073
and let them know that the narratives
of being strong men and women --

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:35.161
you can set those aside,
and it's OK to say you need help.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:38.236
And we do that by providing peer support,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.283
employee assistance,
mental health services.

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.525
We make sure all
of those things are in place,

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:44.942
because without it --

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.761
it's a critical component
to the coproduction of public safety.

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:52.633
Equally as important
is that we also have social issues

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:55.625
that are often laid at the feet
of law enforcement.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.790
So, for example,
mental health and education.

00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:02.517
Historically, we've been
pulled into those spaces

00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.287
where we have not necessarily
provided public safety

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:11.464
but have enforced long, historical
legislative racial desegregation.

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:16.167
We have to own our part in history.

00:07:16.672 --> 00:07:19.529
But we also have to have
those folks at the table

00:07:19.553 --> 00:07:23.114
when we're talking about
how do we move forward with coproduction.

00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:25.941
But understanding this,

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:30.782
we also have to understand
that we need to have voices come to us

00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:31.956
in a different way.

00:07:32.998 --> 00:07:34.642
We also have to recognize

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:37.926
that the community
may not be willing or ready

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.958
to come to the table
to have the conversation.

00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:42.132
And that's OK.

00:07:42.498 --> 00:07:44.529
We have to be able to accept that.

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:48.731
By acknowledging it, it also means
that we care for the community's health

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:50.862
and for their resiliency as well.

00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:52.819
That's another key component.

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:54.983
We also have to acknowledge

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:58.252
that there are those folks
that are in our community that are here --

00:07:58.276 --> 00:07:59.607
they do want to do us harm.

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:03.499
We also have to recognize
that we have community members

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:07.732
who did not get the benefits
of a long-ago dream.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.871
We also have to acknowledge

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:14.193
that we have put faith in a system
that sometimes is broken,

00:08:14.217 --> 00:08:17.133
hoping that it would give us
solutions for better.

00:08:18.486 --> 00:08:20.565
But we cannot walk away.

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:23.177
Because there is a better way.

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:29.102
And we know this because the NYPD's
neighborhood policing philosophy

00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:32.451
is grounded in the coproduction
of public safety.

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:36.061
And in order for us
to move forward together,

00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:39.903
with our family, our friends
and for our health,

00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:42.927
we have to make sure
that we focus this way.

00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:45.172
And in order to do that,

00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:49.926
there are three fundamental ideologies
that we must all agree to.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.100
Are you ready?

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.847
Oh, I'm sorry, one more time --
are you ready?

00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:55.052
Audience: Yes!

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.085
Tracie Keesee:
Now, that's better, alright.

00:08:57.109 --> 00:09:00.206
The first one: There's no more
wallowing in the why.

00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:02.775
We know why.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.443
We must move forward together.
There's no more us versus them.

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:09.969
Number two:

00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:15.946
We must embrace the lived experience
and our histories,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.798
and we must make sure we never go back
to a place where we cannot move forward.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.970
And number three:

00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:26.280
We must also make sure

00:09:26.304 --> 00:09:31.486
that truth and telling facts is painful.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.250
But we also know that no action
is no longer acceptable.

00:09:37.274 --> 00:09:38.424
And agree?

00:09:38.836 --> 00:09:39.987
Audience: Yes.

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:42.363
TK: Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you,
do you agree?

00:09:42.387 --> 00:09:43.537
Audience: Yes!

00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:45.482
TK: So we do know there is a better way.

00:09:45.506 --> 00:09:48.663
And the better way
is the coproduction of public safety.

00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:50.267
Thank you.

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:54.613
(Applause)
