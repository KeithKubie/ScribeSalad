00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.300
We have the word “tarnation” thanks to
societal taboos against saying certain words-

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.150
instead substituting in other words that often
mean the exact same thing, but for some reason

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.030
we find it acceptable to say the one rather
than the other…

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.030
Humans…

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.030
😉

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.130
In this case, the pertinent word is “damn,”
or more precisely the derivative “damnation,”

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.120
which gave rise to the euphemism “darnation.”

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.360
How did the leading ‘d’ get replaced with
a ‘t’?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.660
In the 18th century in colonial America, the
word “tarnal” was often used as a more

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.190
acceptable alternative to “eternal,” which
for a time could itself be used as a form

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.360
of profanity- from the full expression “eternal
God,” not unlike the modern “Jesus Christ!”

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
when used in this sense.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.350
To clean up the former, “eternal God”
got shortened to “eternal.”

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.920
The aphetic form of this, “ternal,” ultimately
resulted in “tarnal.”

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.129
At some point, nobody knows exactly when,
someone got the bright idea of combining the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.880
exclamation “tarnal” with “darnation,”
and the result was “tarnation.”

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
The first documented instance of “tarnation”
was in Royall Tyler’s 1790 play Contrast,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.920
where the character Jonathan uses it three
times (along with the word “tarnal”):

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.549
“Why, such a tarnal cross tike you never
saw!

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.760
You would have counted she had lived upon
crab-apples and vinegar for a fortnight.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.390
But what the rattle makes you look so tarnation
glum?”

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.390
“Tarnation!

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.689
That’s no laughing matter though.”

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.940
“Now the Colonel told father and brother,—you
must know there are, let me see—there is

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.240
Elnathan, Silas, and Barnabas, Tabitha—no,
no, she’s a she—tarnation, now I have

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.350
it—there’s Elnathan…”

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.880
Another interesting note is that while today
“tarnation” is most closely associated

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.770
with the South, and particularly cowboys,
it was originally a New Englandism that ultimately

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.280
spread throughout the new country.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.880
Ever wondered what the symbols used instead
of spelling out a swear word explicitly, as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.149
in “F*@k”, are named?

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.920
In this context, the symbols are known as
“grawlixes.”

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.150
A paper, “The Utility and Ubiquity of Taboo
Words” from the Massachusetts College of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.420
Liberal Arts, surveyed the various studies
that have been done on swear word rates in

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.350
every day English conversation.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.409
They found that based on all the studies done
on the subject to date, approximately 0.5%-0.7%

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.340
of all spoken words are swear words.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:46.670
This rate is only slightly less than the rate
that English speakers say “we,” “us,”

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.639
and “our.”
