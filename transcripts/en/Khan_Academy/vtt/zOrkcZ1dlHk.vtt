00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.521
- [Voiceover] Let inverted, or upside down

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.909
triangle x, be defined
as x plus one over x.

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:07.012
Let me write that down.

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.696
Inverted triangle x,

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.493
is equal to x plus one over x.

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:16.417
For all non-zero integers x,

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:19.237
all right, if inverted or upside down

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.152
triangle x is equal to t.

00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:24.634
So if this whole thing is equal to t,

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:26.470
where t is an integer,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.498
which of the following
is a possible value of t.

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.158
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:34.758
So, what you could try to do,

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:37.277
is you could take each of these choices,

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:39.355
and substitute it in for t,

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:41.549
and then try to solve for x,

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.788
and see if you can find
x's that are integers.

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:47.157
But instead of doing
each of them one by one,

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.210
let's just rearrange this equation

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.610
where we can solve for
x as a function of t.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.713
And then we could try
the different t values

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:59.230
out (mumbles), and say,
can we get a non-zero

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.262
integer value for x?

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.468
So if we take this, and if we multiply

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.241
both sides by x, we're going to get

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:09.946
x times x is x squared.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.664
One over x times x is one.

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:16.598
And then t times x is tx.

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.503
Now, it looks like we have a quadratic,

00:01:18.503 --> 00:01:20.697
we could try to get into a standard form

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:22.752
so we could try to factor it.

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:25.631
So let's subtract tx from both sides.

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:29.125
And so if we subtract tx,

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.749
from both sides, we are going

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:34.686
to be left with, on the left-hand side,

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:39.584
x squared minus tx plus one,

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:43.125
and that's going to be equal to zero.

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.145
Now this is interesting right over here.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:47.932
We have, kind of, a traditional quadratic.

00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:50.648
A traditional quadratic
equation right over here.

00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:52.410
We just have to think about, well,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.365
for what values of t can
we actually factor this

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.148
so that we can integer solutions for x.

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:00.101
So, actually, let's just write down

00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:01.634
all the options over here.

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:04.605
So if t is equal to one,

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.787
then this thing is going to be x squared

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:08.172
minus one x, so we could just say,

00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:11.081
x squared minus x plus one.

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.402
If t is equal to zero,

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:14.872
then this middle term disappears,

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:19.451
and you're just left
with x squared plus one.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:23.374
If t is equal to negative one,

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:26.172
then this thing becomes x squared,

00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:29.724
negative, negative one,
so it's plus x plus one.

00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:32.626
If t is equal to negative two,

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:37.626
then you get x squared
plus two x, plus one.

00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:40.344
And then if t is equal to...

00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:41.786
I'm running out of colors.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.638
If t is equal to negative three,

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:47.794
you have x squared plus
negative, negative three,

00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:50.558
so that's plus three x plus one.

00:02:50.558 --> 00:02:52.834
So which of these can you factor?

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.274
Well, it might jump out at you that,

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.980
hey, this is a perfect
square right over here,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.246
I could factor this one.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:02.246
This is x plus one times x plus one.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.778
One plus one is two,
and one times one is one

00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:07.066
right over here.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:09.145
So because I can factor this,

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:12.140
I know that this right over here

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.242
is going to be my answer.

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:19.025
If t is equal to negative two,

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.501
then all of this stuff boils down to that,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:24.530
and we could say that x squared

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.399
minus t, which is plus two,

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.056
plus two x plus one is equal to zero.

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:34.015
The left-hand side is
just x plus one squared

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:37.139
is equal to zero, which
means that x plus one

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.458
is equal to zero, which means that

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:43.639
x would be equal to negative one.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.456
So when t is equal to negative two,

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.895
that means that x is
equal to negative one,

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:54.377
and negative one is a non-zero integer.

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:55.457
You can look at these other ones,

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:56.711
and you say, well, yeah, this is very hard

00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.314
to factor, I need to take the product

00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:00.298
of two numbers, whose positive one,

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:02.073
and their sum is negative one.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:06.750
Well I can't think of two integers

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.145
that would do that.

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:10.466
Same thing here, x squared plus one,

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.568
how do I factor that?

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:13.948
There's no obvious way, at least

00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:15.551
in my brain, of factoring that.

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.187
Same thing over here, two numbers,

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:19.406
whose product is one and whose sum

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:21.031
is positive one, well, I needed

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.305
two integers, and I
can't think of any there.

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.269
And same thing over here,

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:25.743
two numbers whose product is one,

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:27.683
and whose sum is three,

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:28.599
can't think of it.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.277
But this one, right over here, you can.
