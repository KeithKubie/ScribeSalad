00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.235
It turns out that these equations are identical. Let's see why. I can add x to

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.151
both sides to get 2y is equal to x plus 14. Then I divide both sides of my

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:15.175
equation by 2. So, I have 1y is equal to 1 half x plus 7. The second equation is

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:20.233
more simple to solve for y. All we need to do is to divide each term by 6. So I

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:25.358
have one y. 3 6ths of x is the same as 1 half x. And then seven. I know the left

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:30.222
side equation is equal to the right side of the equation, so I can just rewrite

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:34.667
my equation with both sides flipped. And sure enough, I have identical

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.291
equations. They share all the same points.
