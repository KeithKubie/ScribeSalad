00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
The diamond in this ring will cut into any
substance on Earth.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.300
It's the hardest, natural material on the
planet.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.960
But it's just carbon, the same element that
makes up the graphite in this pencil lead,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.429
which is so soft, that it's intended purpose
is to rub off on stuff.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.800
The atoms are all of the same element and
they're all bonded together with covalent bonds,

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.580
so what's the difference?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.260
Well the atoms are arranged differently, they form different atomic networks and therefore, different network solids.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.739
In chemistry we place networks in various
categories

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
because each type of network has characteristics that make them useful for all sorts of handy applications.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.980
You can have a chain of identical molecules,
each molecule is connected on two sides.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.860
So glycogen which is just a chain of glucose
molecules is bigger than glucose

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.290
but it's not super durable as substances go.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.370
A sheet of particles like the proteins that make up silk is a more sophisticated kind of network

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.010
because the particles are connected on all
sides,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.280
but its connections are still two-dimensional
so it's only stronger in those directions.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.519
Now, you can stack sheets on top of each other in order to build a network into the third dimension,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.170
but then the sheets just slide around on each
other

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.079
and they're not much more useful or durable
than they were before.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.619
A truly three-dimensional network branches
out in multiple directions,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.360
forming covalent bonds in a structure that resist forces much better than a chain or a sheet of the same material.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.400
So in the most basic sense, the way atoms and molecules bond to form network is what make many materials what they are.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.909
It explains why diamond is so hard while graphite
is so soft

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.840
and how the main ingredient in sand can also be made into the silicon wafers that make our electronics.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.440
It's also the key to how we can turn this,
into this.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.479
Though before you send the kiss off email
to your student loan officer,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.340
I should warn you that you won't be able to
do that at home.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.060
[Theme Music]

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.240
Network solids are one of the three types
of atomic solid we've talked about,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.020
materials that are made of individual atoms
rather than molecules or ions.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.780
The cool and special thing about network solid is that the atoms exist in, you guessed it, a network structure,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.660
that is each atoms is linked to several others
in various directions.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.720
Like all networks, this makes the arrangement
both strong and stable.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240
It also provide some other properties that
may surprise you.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.280
If you've seen our episode on atomic orbitals you know the way the electron in a chemical bond orient themselves,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
that is the way the orbitals hybridize, has
a big effect on the properties of a substance.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.280
If water's orbitals hybridize differently for example, it might not be polar and life as we know it wouldn't be possible.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.340
It's the same with network solids. Orbitals
and their hybridizations make a huge difference.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.320
Thankfully though, orbitals can't be different. They are the way they are because of the laws of physics.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.920
So first, let's look at carbon. Pure carbon
can bond with itself in two different ways.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.700
In the first scenario, the outer electrons of each atom are arranged into SP2 hybridized orbitals

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.820
with two other atoms for a total of three
lobes in a flat trigonal arrangement.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.180
This creates a sheet with a hexagonal structure and with one unhybridized P orbital left on each atom.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.410
These orbitals form pi bonds that merge into
an extensive network on their own

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.840
and this gives the structure its real strength.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.230
You know this carbon network by its street
name, graphite.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.680
The pi bonds within each sheet is really strong which allows graphite to withstand a lot of pressure.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.380
But as with any sheet-like formation, only
in two dimensions.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.640
The sheets are only held to other sheets with
really weak van der Waals forces.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.640
They allow the sheets to slide on top of each other so they can easily be removed layer by layer.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.020
That's why graphite is so fantastic for writing
with.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.320
When you use a pencil, layer after layer of
graphite is being transferred to the paper.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.710
That slipping sheet structure also makes graphite
an excellent lubricant.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.000
It can break down into an extremely fine powder of slippery platelets that almost any substance can slide easily over.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.180
Which is why it's great for things like sticky
locks.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.620
And because the electrons that form the pi bonds in the graphite are able to move from one atom to another,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.080
graphite also conducts electricity.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.980
Most of the properties of graphite, you'll notice, don't apply to the other type of network that carbon can form, diamond.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.400
Even though the graphite in the pencil is made of the exact same thing as diamond, pure carbon atoms,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.040
they're different from each other in almost
every possible way.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.130
And all of these differences are simply because
of the way their atoms are bonded.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.830
In diamond, the bonding electrons in each
atom are arranged in SP3 orbitals.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.730
Four lobes that are as far away from each
other as possible.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.070
Again, information you should have in you
from the orbital episode.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.460
Each lobe in that tetrahedral structure overlaps
and bonds with one on an adjacent carbon atom

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.270
creating a totally uniform, three dimensional
network of carbon in every direction.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.210
So any stress on this network will be resisted
by multiple atoms and multiple bonds.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.420
This stability is what makes diamonds so famously,
incredibly hard.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.700
But the downside is that this rigid structure
also makes them quite brittle.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.090
In other words, they break before they bend.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.050
And like any crystal and solid they tend to break along the seam between atoms called a cleavage plane.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.560
And these are the places that the diamond
cutters attack first.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.880
And here's another way that the diamond's network structure makes it totally different from graphite.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.060
Diamonds are electrical insulators, not conductors.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.090
This is because the carbon atoms in diamonds
share sigma bonds, not pi bonds,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.790
which doesn't allow the electrons much freedom
of movement.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.220
And if an electron can't move around, it can't be used to transfer energy in the form of electricity or anything else.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.540
But even though diamond is terrible at conducting
electricity,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.860
both graphite and diamond are good conductors
of heat.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.700
That's because of the strength of their covalent
bonds.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.090
These type bonds require that when one atom
vibrates, all the atoms around it vibrate

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.480
in exactly the same way.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.900
So when thermal energy increases in one region, it spreads quickly throughout the diamond or graphite.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.980
Even though there is some space between the
sheets of graphite,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.460
the structure of the sheets is so rigid that the vibrations transfer through the whole mass.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.960
And as you may have guessed, diamond conducts
heat even better than graphite

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.400
because each atom spreads that energy in three
directions rather than two.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.760
Graphite has another interesting response
to heat.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.680
When it's heated to very high temperatures, around 3000 degrees Celsius, and placed under extreme pressure,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.540
about 15 million kPa, the atoms rearrange themselves from a two dimensional sheet network into a 3D network.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.000
Now that's roughly the amount of pressure
of 15 metric tons on one square centimeter.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.700
Basically five elephants sitting on the heel
of a high-heeled shoe.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.980
That tremendous heat provides energy for the
breaking and reforming of bonds,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.030
which allows the atoms to reorganize themselves
to relieve all of that pressure.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.940
And that my friends is how you can turn common
graphite into diamonds.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.900
So no, you cannot do that at home.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.520
But just like with you and me sometimes what
seems like an excessive amount of pressure

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.090
can end up forcing changes that stabilize
things in the long run.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.900
Now it seems kinda odd but the opposite reaction, diamonds turning into graphite, is even more difficult.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.320
So much so that it's functionally impossible for it to happen naturally. At least on this planet.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.300
Even though it is possible under those incredibly
hot elephants on heel circumstances to break

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.990
the covalent bonds in graphite,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.669
the activation energy required to break those
bonds in diamond is so high

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.380
that the rate of its breakdown is essentially
zero for all earthly purposes.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.690
The similarities and especially the differences
between diamonds and graphite

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.430
are an amazing display of the power of chemistry.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.520
Even though they're both made of the exact
same material,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.580
the mere difference in the nature and arrangement of their chemical bonds completely changes their physical

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.540
and chemical and electrical characteristics.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.580
Also, one is pretty and one is pencil lead.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.960
They explain why diamond can be used to cut
through glass and drill through rock,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.990
while graphite is soft enough to write and
lubricate with.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.070
And yes, diamonds are more valuable,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.949
but you could argue that graphite with its
easily erasable mass producible pencils

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.440
might have done more good for the world.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.090
The pencil is maybe mightier than the diamond.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.340
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry, by the way.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.900
If you paid attention, you learned that networks lend strength and widely distributed stability to network solids.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.160
You learned that both diamonds and graphite are network solids made up of pure carbon atoms

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.000
but that the arrangement of those atoms in 2 and 3 dimensions respectively give them completely different properties.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.110
