00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.734
We still have to do the same things
we had before, so you remember, in,

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.630
in tracking,when we were doing
tracking we had this notion of

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.260
a dynamics model for and
it was a linear model.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.200
So the idea is that at each time step,
we have some prediction that,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.610
allow, us say, well, if I have some
density about where I think I am,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.920
what's my new density?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.010
And in that particular case,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.970
it had to be linear in order
to make the math work out.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.302
That was, you know,
the underlying part of the, the Kalman.

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:31.380
All right but in general,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.530
we can have a more general
state transition matrix, right?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.150
So the idea is that what is the expected
change from time T to T plus one.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.760
Okay so if I'm at some point or

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.200
if I'm guessing that I'm at some point
I can say what's my expected change.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.980
So what's important about this and the
reason I'm going on and on about this is

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.180
besides just having a sort of dynamics
model that says how things are likely to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.040
evolve I can also intru, include
a notion of perturbation or control.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.400
All right.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.700
So, the perturbation means if I was
here, maybe I know that I added,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.290
I took two steps to the right.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.640
Now Megan's freaking out again.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.400
All right, I'm back.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.170
All right.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.387
So what I would do is
I would say that okay,

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:22.200
the the expected state
transition is that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.250
I take where I am, I take two steps to
the right, and then I add some noise.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.300
So it's a little bit like, remember when
we talked about that in a linear model

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.930
I could actually have a different
linear transition at every time t,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.820
but usually we keep them constant,
here, we're going to have the notion

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.120
of an input, and the input is
represented as u, u for input.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.470
Don't ask me.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.200
You, if you, if you want to know why,
ask some control theory professor,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.950
because they always use u as the input,
so it's their desire.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.090
Anyway, so we're going to see a u sub t.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.220
That's the control, or the input,
or the perturbation that got added

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.730
to the system at time T and
we assume that we know that, alright?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.770
So what we've done is we've changed
our filtering just a little bit so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.014
that besides just taking observations,
we're going to assume we have

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:15.260
observations plus assume, that we have,
we know what the inputs are, all right?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.990
Lots of words but
I hope that you follow that.
