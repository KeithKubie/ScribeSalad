00:00:00.646 --> 00:00:01.561
Man 1: We've been discussing

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.481
this amazing second paragraph of the

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.670
Declaration of Independence.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.146
We've gotten through what passes

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:07.479
for the first two sentences.

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:09.897
They use all sorts of
weird punctuation here.

00:00:09.897 --> 00:00:12.895
Now they're going on to
say, "That whenever any form

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.738
"of government becomes
destructive of these ends,

00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:19.802
"it's the right of the
people to alter or abolish it

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.671
"and to institute new
government, laying its foundation

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.477
"on such principles as
organizing its powers

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:29.809
"in such forms as to them
shall seem most likely

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.669
"to affect their safety and happiness."

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:35.870
Man 2: Just to make sure
I, because they're writing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.560
in a very -

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.931
Man 1: They get a bit
ornate in this (crosstalk)

00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:41.802
They edit that first sentence a whole lot,

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:44.804
so it's very clear, but this
sentence is a little bit ornate.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.346
Man 2: When they write,
"That whenever any form

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.733
"of government becomes
destructive of these ends,"

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.346
they're talking again of the
life, liberty, and the pursuit

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:52.011
of happiness.

00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:53.850
Man 1: Right. (crosstalk)

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.183
In other words, if you have
a king who's taken away

00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:59.367
people's life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:01.792
This is, they're talking
about the English government,

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.817
not just the Parliament,
but the king now has become

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:08.324
destructive of these unalienable rights

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:09.794
that we're supposed to protect.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:11.658
Man 2: Yeah and that we
then form a new government

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:14.733
to affect their safety and happiness.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.983
Man 1: Right, but most
importantly, it's the right

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:19.992
of the people to alter or abolish it.

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:21.399
In other words, they're saying something

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.057
that has not yet been
quite accepted by history,

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:27.986
which is if you're a
people and you don't like

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.856
your government, you can overthrow it.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.922
We hadn't had that many revolutions

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:36.322
in the past 200 years leading up to that

00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:39.272
and this is the beginning
of an age of revolution,

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:41.790
where people say, "Oh
yeah, we have the right

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.454
"to abolish our government."

00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:44.523
Woah, that's a holy cow.

00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:46.721
Man 2: It's the people
doing it, not another king,

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:47.787
not another ruler.

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.319
That's most of history, is other kings.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.423
Man 1: Exactly, most of
history, for the 100 years

00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:55.786
leading up to this
document, France and England

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:56.851
have been fighting each other.

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.518
The kings of England have
been trying to supplant

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:02.119
the kings of France and
there's been a 100 Years War,

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.318
it's been ...

00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:05.652
The American Revolution's
sort of a part of that,

00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:07.720
but something different happens here.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320
It's not one king trying
to overthrow another king,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.819
it's the right of the people
to abolish and institute

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.819
a new government to
protect their own safety

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.819
and happiness.

00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:24.353
The next sentence, "Prudence,
indeed, will dictate

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:26.865
"that governments long
established should not

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:31.202
"be changed for light
and transient causes."

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:33.770
That, basically, is saying
you shouldn't go around doing

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.069
this all the time.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.686
You have to have a really,
really good reason,

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:40.271
because it's not as if
just because you're kind of

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:43.270
annoyed at your government
you should overthrow it.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.603
This is why they have a
pretty long document ahead

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:46.352
of them.

00:02:46.352 --> 00:02:47.852
This is just the first two paragraphs.

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:48.866
Man 2: This is important.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:49.544
I guess, from my (unintelligible)

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:50.653
of what this whole document is for.

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:52.212
This is to communicate
with the rest of the world

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:55.461
and as you mentioned,
also France, that look,

00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.053
we're not crazy folks here.

00:02:57.053 --> 00:02:58.986
We recognize this is a
serious thing we're doing.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.294
We don't take this lightly.

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:02.184
Man 1: That's what this
sentence says exactly,

00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:03.919
which is you shouldn't
do it just for light

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.877
and transient causes.

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:08.652
We're going to have to
show you that we've got

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:12.961
some real good reasons to do it.

00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:15.453
That's what it goes on to say.

00:03:15.453 --> 00:03:18.124
Especially like, "while
evils are sufferable

00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:21.319
"than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.255
"to which they are accustomed."

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:26.918
In other words, these
are powerful words saying

00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:30.053
that these are the type
of things you really have

00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:32.210
to raise up arms against.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.519
Then, let's go to this sentence.

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.735
Oh sorry.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.069
Man 2: I find this one really interesting.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.841
It's kind of a less famous
part of it, but it says,

00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:40.521
"and accordingly all experience hath shown

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.853
"that mankind are more disposed to suffer,

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:45.921
"while evils are sufferable
than to right themselves

00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:48.008
"by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed."

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.932
It's really saying that, normally, men,

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.789
even when their rights start
to get imposed, they just -

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.520
Man 1: Go along with it.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.090
Man 2: It's kind of like
a frog in boiling water.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.053
They just live with it, but
when it gets too bad ...

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:03.388
Man 1: Yeah, that's when
you have to take up arms.

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.855
You're right, the whole point of that is

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:08.122
that experience has shown
we kind of just go along

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:11.886
with bad kings, just like
we go along with good kings.

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.086
This is special, this is
different, what they're saying

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.604
and that's why they
start the next sentence

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:17.455
with the word "But".

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:20.322
It's sort of the, "but this
is different," sentence.

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:21.389
Why is it different?

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.990
"But when a long train of
abuses and usurpation ..."

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.722
Usurpation means they're
taking away our powers.

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:32.722
"... Pursuing invariably the
same object evinces a desire

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:36.746
"to reduce them under absolute despotism."

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:39.854
In other words, what's
happened is the king

00:04:39.854 --> 00:04:43.257
and his parliament have
decided to reduce it

00:04:43.257 --> 00:04:46.590
so that they have all the powers.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.996
They're taxing without our consent,

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.328
they're doing all sorts of things.

00:04:50.328 --> 00:04:52.790
They're quartering troops in our homes.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.589
That's when it goes on to
say, "it is their right."

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.856
In other words, the right of our people.

00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:02.523
"... it is their duty to
throw off such government

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:07.247
"and to provide new guards
for their future security."

00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:08.189
Think about that.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.163
How often had that been happening before?

00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:13.855
Man 2: Yeah, especially
for the people to do it.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:14.855
Man 1: Right.

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:18.995
We very rarely have had
a people-led rebellion

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.190
to say you've usurped.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.666
There's usurpation.

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.255
You've usurped our rights.

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:26.997
There's been a long train
of abuses and you've reduced

00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:29.808
us to absolute despotism.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.079
Actually, Jefferson, when
he writes that phrase,

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:35.388
has an even grander
phrases (unintelligible)

00:05:35.388 --> 00:05:37.080
everything else and Franklin says,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.919
"I think we're going a bit overboard here.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.522
"Let's just 'say reduce them
under absolute despotism',"

00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:44.888
which means you've taken
away all our rights.

00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:46.323
You've become a despot.

00:05:46.323 --> 00:05:47.655
Man 2: Yeah.

00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:51.557
Man 1: Then it goes on
to say, "Such has been

00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:54.557
"the patient sufferance
of these colonies."

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:56.390
In other words, we've been
pretty patient up until now.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.989
You put on a tea tax,
you put on a paper tax,

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:03.989
you put on a stamp act,
taxation without representation.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.323
You haven't allowed us to
be part of the Parliament,

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:08.140
voting on our own taxes.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.975
We've been pretty patient of these things

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:15.256
"and such is now the necessity
which constrains them,"

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:17.474
meaning constrains us, the
people of the United States,

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:21.140
"to alter their former
systems of government,"

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.056
and now is when they set up
what is going to be the rest

00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:25.474
of the document.

00:06:25.474 --> 00:06:27.321
They attack the king.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.922
The history of the present
king of Great Britain.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:33.138
We have him up there,
George III, there he is.

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:39.722
Looking kind of nice, like (crosstalk)

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:42.790
He looks definitely like a
royal person, but the history

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.321
of this present king of
Great Britain is a history

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.722
of repeated injuries and usurpations.

00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:53.854
" ... all having in direct
object the establishment

00:06:53.854 --> 00:06:58.251
"of an absolute tyranny
over these states."

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.417
You know what?

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:01.454
I think they were overstating it a bit.

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:05.145
I'm not trying to be
kind to King George here,

00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:08.686
but what they did is they tax
the tea, they tax the stamp,

00:07:08.686 --> 00:07:10.936
they were using the tax
revenues to help support

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:12.120
the colonies.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.654
I think Parliament felt that
you could argue a little bit

00:07:15.654 --> 00:07:18.186
that we're taxing without
getting your consent,

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:22.436
but I think they would say,
"Hey, wait, absolute tyranny?

00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:24.998
"Repeated injuries and usurpation?"

00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:28.330
They're going too far and
there was a lot of people,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.411
at least half the people in the colonies,

00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.460
that kind of agreed with the English.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.162
They were still loyal.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:38.260
So, what they do, Jefferson,
Franklin, and Adams,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.193
and the people writing this, is they say,

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.060
"We're going to have to
show you why we're using

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.193
"this strong language."

00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:45.278
It's a wonderful sentence to me.

00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:49.944
"To prove this, let facts be
submitted to a candid world."

00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:52.130
That's what this declaration is.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.797
We're going to give you all
the facts and try to prove

00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:58.003
it's been absolute tyranny
that we've been suffering

00:07:58.003 --> 00:08:00.254
and they worked themselves
up into convincing

00:08:00.254 --> 00:08:03.088
themselves and probably
the rest of history.

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:06.004
Man 2: And to be fair to
them, probably in 1774,

00:08:06.004 --> 00:08:11.748
or even March of 1775, they
might have felt like that,

00:08:11.748 --> 00:08:14.749
but there was bloodshed now.

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:16.335
People have been killed
and now, of course,

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:18.399
people are going to be
much more passionate

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:22.189
about the situation.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:24.592
Man 1: I guess you could
sense it in your own sense

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:25.722
of history.

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:28.123
Once people start fighting,
they get themselves a bit

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:29.995
worked up.

00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:32.494
Man 2: Absolutely and it's British troops

00:08:32.494 --> 00:08:33.723
on American soil.

00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:38.311
It's American families,
American fathers who are dying.

00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:39.647
That's how I can imagine they would start

00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:40.897
to see these things.

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:41.394
Man 1: Right.

00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:44.726
It starts to get out of hand
without their intention.

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:46.728
The continental congress
didn't declare war

00:08:46.728 --> 00:08:48.394
back in 1775.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.660
You have a bunch of
militia people in Lexington

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.659
and Concord getting all
riled up by Paul Revere,

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.440
because the British
are coming to take some

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.868
of the munitions out of
the arsenals in Lexington

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:01.017
and Concord.

00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:03.130
He's riding and saying
the British are coming

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.351
and then the militiamen
come out and suddenly,

00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:10.129
up in Massachusetts, this
revolution that even most

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:11.997
of the people in the
continental congress weren't

00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:16.018
quite ready for, has
begun to happen and ...

00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:19.268
(crosstalk)

00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.397
Man 2: After this, they go on and list.

00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:24.434
Man 1: That's the rest of the document.

00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:28.197
The rest of the Declaration
is just line after line

00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:31.064
of the king has done this,
the king has done that,

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:33.527
and most importantly, as you see in this,

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:36.160
the history of the present
king of Great Britain,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.826
they're revolting now against the king,

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:42.156
not just the Parliament
that has voted these taxes,

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:44.409
but they're saying it's the king himself

00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:47.259
that we're rebelling against
and that's what made it

00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.823
a true revolution, rather
than just trying to get rid

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.490
of the Parliament, which is temporary.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.500
Man 2: Fascinating.
