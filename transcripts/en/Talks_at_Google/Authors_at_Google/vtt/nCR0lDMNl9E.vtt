00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.010
DON HARRISON: Hi, and
welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.110
My name is Don Harrison.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.852
I am pleased to welcome
two authors in front of us

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:15.310
who are here to discuss their
book, "The Fourth Revolution,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.190
The Global Race to
Reinvent the State."

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.150
On my far right is
John Micklethwait,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.860
who is currently the editor
in chief of "The Economist."

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.960
Which one of you, in their
19th year, 20th year,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.841
took a road trip across
the-- that was you?

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.132
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: That was me.

00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:37.180
DON HARRISON: That was you?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.721
So I just wanted to highlight
that that was an important road

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.160
trip, which had a formative
sauna at the end of it,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.720
with Milton Friedman.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.170
Did that lay the ground
work for this book?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.670
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
I should explain.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
When I was aged 18 in
Britain, you take a gap year

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.990
before you go on to university.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.180
And I came to California,
possibly quite a long time

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.420
before many of you here
were born, in 1980.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.297
And I went to go and stay
with-- I was traveling around

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:10.880
with a friend, and I went to go
and stay with a cousin of his.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.130
An elderly man called Antony.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.970
And we stayed in his apartment
block in San Francisco.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.180
And he persuaded
us to go and have

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.420
a sauna around the
corner with his neighbor,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.964
a man called Milton.

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:26.700
And I sat there,
and Milton asked me

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490
what I knew about
Margaret Thatcher.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.800
Neither me nor my friend
really knew much about it.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.590
And he kept on saying how
the world would change,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.060
that British Rail
would be privatized,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.380
that British Leyland,
this old car company,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.800
would be broken up.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.142
Margaret Thatcher would
introduce education vouchers.

00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:45.600
That's something
called Monetarism.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.670
And I was age 18,
19 at the time.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.940
And I thought this man
was basically on drugs.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.450
And I looked at
him, and I thought,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.550
this is completely weird.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.883
I've just come from Yorkshire,
part of Northern England,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.790
and we had lessons by candle
light because of the miners

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.100
being on strike.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.270
And later that week,
I went to go and watch

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.206
The Grateful Dead
play in San Francisco.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:08.789
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE:
That's a rock band.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.288
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
Nothing, nothing,

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:13.786
nothing that I saw
then seemed half

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:18.390
as hallucinogenic than what
I had heard in the sauna.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.655
And yet, that was
Milton Friedman,

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:23.120
to my somewhat junior self.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.560
And actually, in some ways,
it's a nice way into this book.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.120
Because this book is an
attempt to say to people,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.300
you may think that
government will never change.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.345
But it can change very,
very dramatically.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.630
And in fact, in terms
of the revolutions

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.880
we talk about in Western
government, what's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.190
interesting about the
Milton Friedman revolution,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.720
is we say the revolution of
Thatcher and Ronald Reagan

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.380
wasn't really a whole one.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.480
It was just a half revolution.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.870
And what we argue,
is that if you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.395
think that you
should be despondent,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:56.770
and you can see lots of people
who are going to troop off

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.350
to the mid-term
elections in November,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.950
and if you think
of all the people

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.980
who are going off to
vote in Europe this week,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.740
there's a sort of
despondent apathy there.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.320
And what we argue in this book,
is that is completely wrong.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.170
Is that all the
evidence of history

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.090
is that government will
change dramatically when it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.080
needs to do so.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.520
And the West has been through
three huge revolutions

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.250
like this.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.130
But also, very
much to your world,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.440
is that technology
changes things.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.220
If all of you, and I
find this incredible

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.845
that anyone at Google
could think this,

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:32.110
but we do get this
reaction sometimes,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.720
people tend to think that--
they seem to somehow assume

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.050
that all this change that has
happened to the private sector,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.172
somehow won't happen
to the public sector.

00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:43.180
And we argue that is
exactly the opposite.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.500
Every huge revolution
government has been through,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.445
technology has been
right to the core.

00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:50.102
So that was a long way
segue from your sauna,

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:51.700
but that is the
message of this book.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.950
That change is
coming to government

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.780
in a much, much bigger way
than people have thought,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.880
but with one twist.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.680
And that is that this time, you
are in competition with China.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.615
And with Asia.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:05.910
And with other places which
are working much harder

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.797
on government than the West is.

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:08.630
DON HARRISON: Great.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.974
Well, I do appreciate that
you dove right in there.

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:12.840
At Google, we always like to
sort of dive right in too,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.620
and sometimes throw
the PowerPoint away.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.100
So I'll punch through the rest
of the introduction quickly,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.360
and then we'll get on with it.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.510
But I'd note that you
studied history at Oxford.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.350
You had a productive
career as a banker.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.620
That is close to my heart.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.522
But then, unfortunately
became a journalist in 1987.

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:31.730
You were named Editor's
Editor of the British Society

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.330
of Magazine Editors in 2010.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.950
And I assume both of you
guys are Friends of Google?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.630
I've seen a picture in the book.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.480
And notes that seemed
friendly in the text.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.623
And on my immediate
right, Adrian Wooldridge,

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.850
who is the management
editor for "The Economist"

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.710
at writes the Schumpeter column.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.000
Pronunciation OK?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.290
Good.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.917
And he was based in DC, where
you were Washington Bureau

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.059
Chief.

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.350
So let me-- I mean, you jumped
in and sort of explained

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.930
the basis of the book.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.350
I want to say that my
impression of your book,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.920
or what really stuck to
me, was a certain-- was

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.040
the call to action
that you describe.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.179
You offer ideas, you
offer a clear roadmap.

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:15.720
But what I sort of
found interesting,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.109
is both the history, but
also the clear engagement

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.650
you outlined.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.221
You know, Mill, Webb,
Cromwell, Richelieu, Gladstone.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.430
You know, all engaged, all
with a sense of mission.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.590
We do have this apathy
towards democracy.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.150
But you try to make us not
just despair about that.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.290
And to provide examples
of how we move forward.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.365
Was this-- you know, you
have a roadmap of action,

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:41.550
and then you also
have a call to action?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.740
Are both part of the book?

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.530
Or is one more important
than the other?

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.946
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE:
Can I start off

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.200
by saying what the
revolutions were,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.810
just to give people
a sense of why

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.667
we're saying that
there were revolutions.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.500
Because we tend to
think, we can quite often

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.070
think that the State is
just something that's there.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.474
Something that we can ignore.

00:05:57.474 --> 00:05:59.140
And what we argue
very much in the book,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.090
is that the State, has
for the past 500 years,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.520
been a key to the
competitiveness

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.640
and the best of
success of the West,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.390
and that the State has
constantly evolved.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.000
And it's because it's
evolved that the West has

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.410
managed to stay ahead.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.390
If you go back to
the year 1500, you

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.450
would find that
everybody in the world,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.270
who wasn't completely
deranged, would

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.380
have thought that the future
of the world belonged to China.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.120
China was much more
dynamic, it was much bigger,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.220
it was a much more concentrated
civilization than Europe was.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.220
China-- Europe had
three cities which

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.360
had more than 300,000
people as inhabitants.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.705
The Heavenly City
in Peking alone,

00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:46.840
had inhabitants of 300,000
people, many of whom

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.650
were civil servants
who were selected

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.700
by objective examinations.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.910
The most sophisticated
examinations the world

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.110
had ever seen, from the
whole of the Empire,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.120
to administer this great Empire.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.990
So, Europe, by contrast,
looks like a sort

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.368
of blood-soaked battlefield.

00:07:05.368 --> 00:07:06.700
A backwater.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.830
Where you're constantly
fighting over religion,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.180
you're constantly being
bullied by nobles,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.710
who all have their
own private armies,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.732
and are wandering around
in a rather lawless way.

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:19.670
And the way that
Europe gets ahead,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.720
is first of all inventing, and
then reinventing the State.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.060
The first thing Europe does is
invent the State as a security

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.210
State to provide public order.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.340
That's the fundamental
thing that the State should

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.530
do, to have a public
order revolution, whereby

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.940
the nobles are
brought under control,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.650
religion is brought under
the control of the State,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.120
so you don't have any
dissent over religion.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.470
So, public order,
but the same time,

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.490
a certain measure of
competition between all these

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.444
rather coherent Nation States.

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:49.860
They're competing
with each other.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.670
In China, their system is so
big, the Empire is so big,

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.030
that it's very introverted.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.340
It's very inward-looking.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.440
When the Chinese
invented gunpowder,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.300
they used it to
create fireworks.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.950
Probably a nice thing to do.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.160
We in Europe use it
to create weapons,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.730
so to blow people
out of the water.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.445
When the Chinese were confronted
with the possibility of trade

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:14.800
with the rest of the world, the
emperor in the mid 17th century

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.550
says, actually,
to all the people

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.529
who are on the coast,
the southern coast, which

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:20.320
is the most prosperous
part of the country.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.300
You must move inland.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.090
You mustn't mix
with those people.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.020
It's an introverted
Middle Kingdom.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.590
Europeans, on the
other hand, trade

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.740
with the rest of the world,
conquer the rest of the world,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.059
create a dynamic, and rather
imperialist, obviously,

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.880
imperialistic civilization.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.830
So Europe pulls ahead,
because of this invention

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.000
of the competitive
Nation States.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.600
Then in the 18th
and 19th centuries,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.640
you have a sort of
liberal revolution,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.560
whereby you have a liberal
State, created as accountable,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.860
that's efficient, and
that's much smaller.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.286
So you have a contraction
in the size of the State.

00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:55.660
Because the State
goes from being

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.920
a rate-seeking organization,
which basically deals

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.920
in sinecures, office
sinecures, to employees,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.640
employs them for
doing nothing at all.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.510
To saying, actually, we'll
select civil servants on merit.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.780
We'll solve problems.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.650
We will create a prison
system, a police system,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.240
solve the basic problems of
an industrializing society.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.930
So that's the
liberal revolution.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.060
And then, in the
early 20th century,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.900
because people begin
to complain that this

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.169
is a rather hard hearted
vision of the state.

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:26.960
They begin to complain
that the State needs

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.600
to do more to encourage
economic dynamism.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.560
You get an expansion of
the role of the State.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.450
Starting small,
starting with the notion

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.070
that the state should
provide a guaranteed

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.050
minimum of civilized life.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.690
Education, welfare,
retirement payments.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.900
But then the ambition
for the State

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.630
gets bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.550
So, the Labor Party
in Britain, in 1945,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.570
talks about building
a new Jerusalem.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.790
Today's absolutely
the anniversary,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.240
the 50th anniversary of Lyndon
Johnson's great society.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.050
When he said, we must
create a great society,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.050
and use the State get rid of
racism, get rid of poverty,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.240
get rid of discrimination.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.610
So, a more and more
expansionist view

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.830
of what the State could do.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.320
But that vision, we think,
hits the buffers basically

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.284
in the 1970s, because of
over expansion of the State.

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.700
You get a reaction against
that under Reagan and Thatcher,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.350
who say we've got to
contract the State a bit.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.170
But that doesn't really work.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.320
They did important things.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.195
They got the state out
of running businesses,

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:26.700
like British Rail,
British Leyland,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.840
which they shouldn't have been
running in the first place.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.087
They got the industrial
relations much more

00:10:33.087 --> 00:10:34.170
sorted out than they were.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.980
But the state
continues to expand.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.110
And what we're now
arguing, is that we're

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.590
at the beginning of a
fourth revolution, driven

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.260
by a number of forces, which
we'll talk about later.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.780
But essentially, which
gives us a chance

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.320
to reinvent the State in
just as dramatic a way

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.392
as it was reinvented in the 16th
century, in the 19th century,

00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:55.600
and then in the 20th century.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.000
And we need to do that.

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:00.310
DON HARRISON: That's great.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.310
So the--

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.810
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE:
Sorry, he fell asleep.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.685
DON HARRISON: No, no.

00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:04.810
I was trying to think if
I could relate that back

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.202
to the original question.

00:11:06.202 --> 00:11:08.660
Do you think though,
that-- you know,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.325
there was a great
quote in the book that

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.450
talked about-- it didn't
matter what system we had,

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.530
as long as it's
well administered.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.360
Do believe that?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.160
Do you actually
think that there's

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.540
qualities that allows
our systems to operate?

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.225
Or are there other
better systems?

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.350
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: No, I
think at the heart of what

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.000
you are seeing now, is you have
seen a State, which has grown.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.730
It has gotten far too big.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.350
It tries to do too
many things, and you've

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.420
ended up with this
nightmare, where

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.910
both the Left and the
Right keep on adding to it.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.625
Because the Left adds
hospitals and schools,

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:46.180
the Right adds prisons.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.480
California is one of the
great examples of that.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.210
And both sides keep
on asking for more,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.626
and we've ended
up with regulation

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.840
in a complete sprawl.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.739
One of the founders of the
welfare state was Sidney Webb.

00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:57.780
Beatrice and Sidney Webb.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.510
The first sort of Fabians.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.265
He was the son-- his
mother was a hairdresser.

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:04.920
You now go to Florida,
and you discover

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.200
you need two years in order
to become a hairdresser.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.910
To get a license to be
able to cut and blow dry.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.015
Even Sidney Webb's
version of Leviathan

00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:15.660
possibly didn't
stretch that far,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.240
let alone the idea
you need two years

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.946
to become an interior designer.

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:20.320
And whatever vision
of the State,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.090
if you look at John Stuart
Mill, Locke, Thomas Hobbes,

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.890
they never said the
State was set up

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.490
to prevent clashing
color schemes.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.380
Perhaps a bit like these--
in your living room.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.280
So there is a core to this.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.500
There are two big things.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.480
One, can you run
the state better?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.380
There, we have
absolutely no doubt.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.834
That should appeal to people
of any political persuasion.

00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:44.500
It should appeal
particularly, actually,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.958
to many of the
people in this room,

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.725
because there is a huge
amount of technology in that.

00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:51.206
There is a whole variety
of things the State does,

00:12:51.206 --> 00:12:52.580
which are completely
out of date,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.910
which we can come back to.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.450
But then there is also
an ideological question.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.590
Because making the
State do all the things

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.250
that it does at the moment,
much better, is sort of obvious

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.660
and should be done much more
aggressively than it is.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.160
But you also have
to go back and ask

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.910
these fundamental questions.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.380
What is the State for?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.695
And at least part of
the aim of this book,

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:14.300
or part of the pick
up of it, seems

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.280
to be that people, America,
Britain, and the West, who

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.459
have not thought about
political theory,

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:22.250
they have not thought
about what Mill said,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.110
about what Hobbes said,
about what the Webbs said,

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.474
have come back to
ask those questions.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.890
In a strange way, your have
Governor here, Jerry Brown, he

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.555
does actually think
about those things.

00:13:31.555 --> 00:13:34.250
But time and again, when
people aren't thinking,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.200
and our personal
answer is what we

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.745
would describe as a liberal one.

00:13:37.745 --> 00:13:40.420
Is you have to take the
State's-- the burden

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.985
of the State off people, so in
order they can do much better.

00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:46.555
But we think by doing
that, you could definitely

00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:50.025
leave far more room to direct
programs towards the poor.

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:51.900
You could make the State
much more efficient.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.370
So there are those two bits.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.770
One is managerial.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.810
Make the state work much better.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.950
The second is ask yourself the
fundamental question, which

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.150
actually, politicians
don't at the moment,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.429
is what is the State
fundamentally for?

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.595
DON HARRISON: So, talk about
then, about what forces

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:10.780
you think are coming to bear
that's creating an earning

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.757
crisis?

00:14:12.757 --> 00:14:15.090
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: That are
creating the current crisis,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.870
or creating the
opportunity for change?

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.787
DON HARRISON: Crisis is
always an opportunity.

00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:19.786
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: Good.

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:21.950
I think what's the most
obvious thing that's

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.880
creating the current
crisis, is the fact

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.140
that we have an explosion
of entitlements,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.090
of public spending, that
is really unsustainable.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.525
That we-- you know, we have
the 2007 economic crisis.

00:14:34.525 --> 00:14:37.800
And since then, we've pumped--
public debt has gone up

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.684
by-- I think McKinsey calculates
it's gone up by $13 trillion.

00:14:40.684 --> 00:14:41.600
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: 14.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.620
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: $14 trillion,
that John is wrong, actually.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.155
But before that, these
trillions were multiplying.

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.280
And what we have though,
the whole Keynesian notion

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.150
of the function of the State was
that the State should step in

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.815
at a time when private
sector demand declines.

00:14:56.815 --> 00:15:00.655
A time when you get recession,
and potential depression.

00:15:00.655 --> 00:15:03.360
And it should step in to
stimulate the economy.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.940
Since 1960, America has
run surpluses five times.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.460
Since 1975, France has
run surpluses three times.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.960
No.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.897
France has never run
a surplus since 1975.

00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:19.605
And I think what you
have is a situation,

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:24.360
in what was once supposed to
be a crisis fighting mechanism,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.710
has become something
that you do all the time.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.810
Constantly stimulating the
economy, in a way that I think

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.430
is dangerous.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.120
It's like constantly
taking steroids.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.370
Constantly taking drugs
that stimulate you,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.010
rather than taking them
to deal with an illness.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.850
And this addiction to
debt is happening--

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.140
has happened at a time when the
age profile of the population

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.078
is getting worse.

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.453
You're getting
demographic change

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:50.000
that the population,
particularly in Europe,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.770
is aging.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.826
But also in America.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.760
You have the retirement of
this huge baby boom generation.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.930
So I think necessity
is driving a lot

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.710
of the reason for the
reinvention of the State.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.967
Secondly, I think there
is a huge opportunity

00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:04.015
to do things better.

00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:05.895
If you look at the
State managerially,

00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:08.272
it looks as though it's
in a different century

00:16:08.272 --> 00:16:11.320
from the century
of-- even I work in.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.245
Even I live in.

00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:14.395
Let alone, you people at Google.

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:18.780
If you look at the school
calendar, it's 180 days.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.970
America has one of the longest
summer holidays in the world.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.499
During which time, I
think most school children

00:16:24.499 --> 00:16:25.790
forget everything they learned.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.110
And the reason for
that is so the children

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.934
could go and harvest the fields.

00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:31.970
You know, it was an
agricultural calendar

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.770
created to free
children for harvesting.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.810
Also, you have a lot
of industrial sort

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.905
of logic working in the State.

00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:42.220
It's driven by the idea
that vertical integration,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.110
the controlling and owning
everything that you do,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.690
is the best way of
managing things.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.080
Which is the way Henry Ford
thought about production

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.182
in the early 20th century.

00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:51.640
It's not the way
the private sector

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.880
companies operate anymore.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.785
So, managerially, there's a
lot of room for improvement--

00:16:56.785 --> 00:16:58.160
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
I'll just come

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.660
in-- I'll just come
in and interrupt

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.680
there, very quickly, is that
one example we actually use

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.950
is this building.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.640
We say, look at the difference
between Sloan's headquarters

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.500
at General Motors, back in the
1950s, these huge buildings

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.220
in the middle of Detroit, which
had the chairman at the top.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.400
They had rows and rows
of people downstairs.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.810
Now come to Google.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.920
You see a complete change.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.640
A devastating change in the way
in which companies organize.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.990
The way that companies
have orientated.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.410
Now go look at government.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.107
Government has not
changed anything.

00:17:30.107 --> 00:17:32.190
Sorry, didn't mean-- there
is a voice here saying,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.689
clearly, we don't
understand Google.

00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:37.960
It may be just as hierarchical,
and indeed, autocratic,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.435
but it is at least down under
a veneer of communal action.

00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:44.560
And that is perhaps the
way government should work.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.765
But it is.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.070
It is fundamentally different.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.910
You don't have rows
and rows of people

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.150
where you advance by
seniority based on age.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.210
But that is still the way that
the State fundamentally works.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.880
So when Adrian is
saying it's out of date,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.880
it's not just an
agricultural bit, a lot of it

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.410
is back in the Henry
Ford era, and a lot of it

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.925
is back in the 1950s.

00:18:04.925 --> 00:18:07.360
And so merely,
we're not saying you

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.390
have to do anything
dramatically radical

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.090
just to bring it up
to the same levels.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.710
But there are some
radical things

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.084
you can do to do
with technology.

00:18:14.084 --> 00:18:16.210
And I've interrupted.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.210
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: Well,
obviously, the other big prompt

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.960
is technological innovation.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.050
And for me to talk to you people
about technological innovation,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.940
would be rather like
me going to the 49ers

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.770
and talking to them
about football.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.490
But I do think that we are at an
extraordinary time in history.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.260
That in the 19th century, the
manufacturing revolution hugely

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.504
increased productivity.

00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:38.920
And I think that you can have
exactly the same revolution,

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.970
you are having exactly
the same revolution,

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.030
in the service sector.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.870
Whereby you can
increase productivity.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.090
And the State is fundamentally
a service center occupation.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.660
And one of the great
arguments about the State

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.595
has always been, you can't
really improve productivity

00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:55.354
because it's so
dependant on human labor.

00:18:55.354 --> 00:18:57.520
And there's a great economist
called William Baumol,

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.934
who invented the notion
of something called

00:18:59.934 --> 00:19:02.350
"Baumol's disease," which is
essentially that productivity

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.440
in the public-- in the service
sector, cannot increase.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.820
And his argument was that you--
to have Beethoven's string

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.130
quartet played when
Beethoven was alive,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.730
you required four people.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.740
To have it played now,
you require four people.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.540
So you're absolutely stuck
with a productivity problem.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.840
And I think that in one
sense, that's obviously true.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.970
But in another more important
sense, it's not true.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.540
Now you can listen to
Beethoven's string quartet,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.086
you can listen to all
the music in the world,

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.820
virtually free, at an
incredible quality.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.690
And I think that logic, the
logic of the digitalization

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.730
of information,
means that you can

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.760
begin to introduce the sort
of productivity improvements

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.970
that you've seen in
manufacturing, in the service

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:44.470
sector.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.490
And that means
you're fundamentally

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.420
changing the nature
of the State,

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.330
fundamentally
removing a constraint

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.890
on the nature of the State
that you've seen before.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.690
So I think that that is a
combination of the pressures,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.060
the prodding from fiscal
and demographic things,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.810
with the opportunity to do
things radically differently,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.430
because of the nature of
information technology.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.160
And finally, a third thing
is global competition.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.310
I started off
talking about the way

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.810
that the State
has been dominated

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.146
by the West for
the last 500 years.

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:18.520
The West has been
the place where

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.250
all the big ideas and
innovations have come from.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.010
And that has kept
the West ahead.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.885
Now, you're seeing
something very new,

00:20:24.885 --> 00:20:26.930
which is, lots and lots
of really good ideas

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.700
are coming from
the rest of world.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.410
At a time when the
West is paralyzed,

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.210
I think, and rather
gridlocked and intellectually,

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.530
perhaps, ran out of steam.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.140
Other parts of the world are
coming up with new ideas.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.290
Brazil coming up the notion
of conditional cash transfers.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.165
Which changes--
introduces incentives

00:20:43.165 --> 00:20:45.100
into the welfare state.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.520
The Indians coming up with
new ways of running hospitals

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.970
and getting medicine and
health care out to rural areas.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.215
And above all, China coming
along and challenging

00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:57.140
the two fundamental
ideas of the West.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.540
The fundamental
ideas of the West

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.510
is that government should
be out of industry.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.620
Should be out of business.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.980
Well, they've invented this
notion of State capitalism,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.170
and injecting government back
into the heart of business.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.063
And the second idea is
that democracy works.

00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:10.920
Democracy is essential
for circulating

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.442
elites, and that sort of thing.

00:21:12.442 --> 00:21:13.150
And they say, no.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.390
Actually, you can have a
top down, Mandarin style

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.390
circulation of elites.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.310
So they're really going at
the very fundamental ideas

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.180
of the West, and saying, we've
got a new model, it's better.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.970
History is being forged by us.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.406
The West is left behind.

00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:27.781
DON HARRISON: One
of the examples

00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:29.989
you gave in the book that
actually resonated with me,

00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:31.340
was the Khan Academy example.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.798
It's a chance to-- you know,
we're seeing things like Uber,

00:21:33.798 --> 00:21:35.365
and ridesharing.

00:21:35.365 --> 00:21:36.825
You know, software
is allowing us

00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:39.650
to sort of re-imagine
services that we've

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.180
taken for granted
for a long time.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.750
The education one
is interesting.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.750
You think we're at an inflection
point where we can see.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.118
You know, productivity
gains, and things we've said,

00:21:49.118 --> 00:21:50.560
you know, 20 students a teacher.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.336
That can get much, much better.

00:21:52.336 --> 00:21:53.960
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
I think that's true.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.257
I think that you tend
to-- as you know better

00:21:57.257 --> 00:21:58.840
than most people,
with the technology,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.080
people tend to exaggerate
the short term gains.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.535
But then, yet the
long term gains,

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:05.514
they underestimate
the long term gains.

00:22:05.514 --> 00:22:07.180
And I think you can
see what's happening

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.220
in education beginning.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.720
The Khan Academy is interesting.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.680
Bill Gates, who I know is
a very popular man here,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.279
he makes his children do their
homework with the Khan Academy.

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:19.320
That is something-- he's
the world's richest man,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.550
but that is something
which is open to all of us.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.350
And what is happening
in education

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.590
is making it possible
for star lecturers

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.370
to reach ever more people.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.830
You're no longer just
wedded to the person

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.350
you have to listen to.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.255
The talk and talk variety.

00:22:35.255 --> 00:22:36.920
And yes, it's
going to take time.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.590
And yes, you've got
these huge barriers

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.270
to do with the teacher's unions.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.061
Because actually, what
we're talking about,

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:45.620
I said that the managerial
revolution is apolitical.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.235
But actually, you
think about it,

00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:49.560
it does pose really
substantial problems.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.880
And I would argue it poses
substantial problems, possibly

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.772
slightly more for the
parties on the left,

00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:59.246
and to use here the example
of the Democratic Party.

00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:01.120
They are going to have
to make up their mind.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.119
And you can see this with
Hillary at the moment,

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:04.440
really wrestling with this.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.250
Is, does the Democratic
Party exist to try and help

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.540
the lot of the poor, or
does it exist in order

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.400
to protect the public
sector workers who

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.060
are it's absolute
core beneficiary.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.540
Absolute core supporters.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.660
Because if you believe any of
these things about education,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.830
then that could be
amazingly good for the poor,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.980
but much less good for
the teacher's unions.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.370
Which as we know, are about
one out of 10 of the convention

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.470
members of the Democratic Party.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.040
It's not just for the Left.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.140
In this book we are
equally tough on the Right.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.845
We think the Right Republicans
have two really huge problems

00:23:41.845 --> 00:23:43.580
in trying to deal with this.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.250
We see ourselves very much as
a sort of centrist manifesto.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.510
A very radical manifesto,
but one aimed at the center.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.460
The Republican problems are two.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.390
The first is, they have got
to take the State seriously.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.800
The most perfect example of the
Asian alternative is Singapore.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.490
Virtually every single thing,
every single government service

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.690
that you compare America
and Singapore, Singapore

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.360
provides roughly two or
three times better service,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.550
at usually about half the cost.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.190
Little bit of that due to
authoritarianism, a huge amount

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.780
due to better management.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.690
Singapore pays people at the
top $2 million a year to run it.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.860
They do what any private
sector person would do.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.667
They think there's a huge
problem running schools,

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:30.000
running your administration,
running your civil service.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.416
If you do a good
job with that, we

00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:32.950
will pay you a
huge sum of money.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.350
At the moment, it's
inconceivable to imagine

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.480
any Republican senator
standing up and saying,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.646
I think the civil servant
in charge of the Pentagon

00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:40.770
should get paid $2 million.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.260
Even if that man could save you
billions, they wouldn't do it.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.250
So you have got to take
the State seriously.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.440
At the moment, the
modern Republican Party

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.016
doesn't really seem to want to.

00:24:50.016 --> 00:24:51.390
And the second
thing is, you have

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.960
to fess up, if you are the
conservative side of America,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.700
to the real problem
of crony capitalism.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.307
Because if you look at the way
in which you reduce the State,

00:25:00.307 --> 00:25:02.390
the same way as Adrian
talked about the Victorians

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.080
in Britain reducing the State.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.376
The Victorians in Britain
took a State 1815,

00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:10.960
had 80 million pounds worth of
money coming in from taxation,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.870
they reduced it to
60 million pounds

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.715
40 years later, at
a time when Britain

00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:15.840
was the world's superpower.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.120
At a time when their
population went up 50%.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.600
At a time when
they added schools.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.060
Off with all the other
things Adrian talked about.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.440
And they did that by ripping
out crony capitalism.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.470
Well, the crony capitalism
in America is a $1.6 trillion

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.615
worth of tax breaks.

00:25:30.615 --> 00:25:33.260
Virtually all of which
goes to either rich,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.140
or to crony companies.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.284
And that side of
it, the Republicans

00:25:39.284 --> 00:25:40.200
have got to deal with.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.080
There is nothing in Milton
Friedman, that nice man

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.510
I shared the sauna with,
I was about to say shower.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.780
But there is nothing
in him which says,

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.180
it's a brilliant idea to have
mortgage interest reduction.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.520
So that more money
goes through that,

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.890
to the top 5% in America, than
goes through social housing

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.635
to the bottom 50%.

00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:02.460
That is progressive
politics gone mad.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.750
It is a tragedy that the
Democrats don't target that.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.690
It's a tragedy the
Republicans don't

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.740
admit that that is big
government via another arena.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.990
Look at all the money going
to agricultural industries

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.860
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.590
Yes, managerialism can sound
sort of politically neutral,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.430
but once you actually
start applying it,

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.940
it has quite big
political problems.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.682
DON HARRISON: So I think, and
you touched on it quickly,

00:26:27.682 --> 00:26:32.995
that in a book that I view
as extremely pro democratic,

00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:35.810
you do spend a fair bit of
time talking about the virtues,

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.630
or some of the virtues
of the Asian systems.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.730
Talk about the aspects that
you like in the experiments

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.634
you're seeing
occurring in the East,

00:26:44.634 --> 00:26:46.210
and anything that
we could emulate.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.710
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE:
I think the worst

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.700
sort of race to be
stuck in, in business,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.205
is one in which you
don't know the virtues

00:26:53.205 --> 00:26:56.610
and the competitive
strengths of your opponent.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.640
And I think we are in a
sort of competitive race

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.150
with the Eastern world, with
the Chinese-centered world.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.560
And the most foolish
thing we can do, possibly,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.660
is to underestimate
their strengths.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.433
So, I'm now going to
present a view that

00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:14.360
is slightly optimistic,
or slightly praising

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.269
of their strengths,
in order that we

00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:17.310
don't underestimate them.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.135
But I think they've
done two things which

00:27:19.135 --> 00:27:21.590
are really remarkable,
and we should think about.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.070
One is that they've created a
sort of State capitalism, which

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.540
is very different from previous
forms of State capitalism.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.090
It's not a form of
State capitalism

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.530
whereby they own companies, and
have them run by bureaucrats,

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.990
by administrators.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.362
It's one in which they
own shares in companies.

00:27:37.362 --> 00:27:40.810
They own-- it's sort of
equity based State capitalism.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.640
And they have competitions
between various companies.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.125
They set up constant
competitions

00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:48.419
between telecoms companies,
between IT companies,

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:49.960
even if they're
normally State owned,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.890
there's a lot of
competition going on.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.307
And secondly, they've set up
a sort of top down autocracy,

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:58.640
which is very different from
other forms of autocracies.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.510
Most autocracies die,
because the person in power

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.640
won't let go of power.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.320
He's one guy, and
he's on the top.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.560
And he gradually gets older,
and madder, and crazier,

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.050
and eventually disease, or
a revolution, or he dies.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.850
What they do, is
that they basically

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.960
select this sort of
Mandarin style elites.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.210
And they have their
job for 10 years.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.860
And then they have a
peaceful transition of power

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.320
to the next generation.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.095
So up until just before
Moody, the Chinese leadership

00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:29.340
was significantly younger
than the Indian leadership.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.840
That's why, in fact, India's
a democracy, and China is not.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.510
So you have a
circulation elites,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.234
you have competition between
State owned companies.

00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:37.650
But at the same
time, the State is

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.590
acting as a sort
of guardian, trying

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.700
to think in the long term.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.075
Now I can list,
and I'm sure John

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:44.892
will list, endless
qualifications about that.

00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:47.100
The degree of corruption
there is, the degree of self

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:47.890
serving there is.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.090
The degree of bureaucratization
of companies that there is.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.872
But nevertheless,
there is a sort

00:28:52.872 --> 00:28:54.710
of dynamism about
that system which

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.740
is really challenging the West.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.420
And that has grown up,
that sort of dynamic,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.420
sort of State
capitalism has grown up,

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.146
at a time when our own
version of democracy,

00:29:04.146 --> 00:29:07.640
our own version of capitalism,
has got rather lazy.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.950
Rather self indulgent,
and rather unattractive.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:16.060
So if you look at the
period from 1945 to 2000,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.430
roughly, democracy spreads.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.040
The number of
democratic countries

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.330
relentlessly goes
up, and up, and up.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.204
And when we reached 2000,
democracy stopped expanding.

00:29:26.204 --> 00:29:27.870
Begins to go down a
little bit, but it's

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.650
basically static since then.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.730
There are many reasons
for that, but one

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.517
is that China offers
an alternative which

00:29:35.517 --> 00:29:37.050
is attractive.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:41.030
And another is that
people look at the West.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.077
They look at the European Union,
at its sort of huge, Brussels,

00:29:44.077 --> 00:29:46.160
rolling bureaucracy, which
doesn't work very well.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.920
Or they look at
America, its incapacity

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.584
to pass a budget, its
incapacity to run the roads,

00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:52.625
invest in infrastructure.

00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:55.060
Its incapacity to see schools.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.720
And they don't see the shining
city on the hill anymore.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.370
They see something
that doesn't work.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.050
So the attractiveness
of the alternative model

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.250
is going up, while the
attractiveness of our model

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.910
is going down.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.530
And why this matters, I
think, is that we actually

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.012
do want democracy and liberty to
win the great battle of ideas.

00:30:12.012 --> 00:30:13.720
And if they are to
win that great battle,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.980
they need to be much fitter,
and much more attractive

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.940
than they've become.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.384
DON HARRISON: The--
I'm struck by the idea

00:30:21.384 --> 00:30:23.550
that, I think it was six
years ago, seven years ago,

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.906
that China told all
its telecommunications

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:27.780
executives to essentially
switch governments.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.990
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE:
That was fantastic.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.760
DON HARRISON:
Switch country-- it

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.093
would be the same as Barack
Obama calling up and saying,

00:30:32.093 --> 00:30:35.240
Mark Zuckerberg, you're going to
Google, Larry, you go to Apple,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.000
uh, Tim, you're
going on Facebook.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.720
Are there things
like that, that you

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.430
would like to see based on this?

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.885
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: I mean,
the story about this, John

00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:43.740
will talk about this
a little bit more,

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.230
but the story about this
was quite extraordinary.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.980
Because one of the guys who was
running one of the big telecom

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.120
companies was in Hong
Kong, and he was just

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.310
about to do a big deal.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.110
And he got this call
in saying, you're not

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.401
running this company, you're
running the other company.

00:30:55.401 --> 00:30:58.704
So he had to go in and sort
of renegotiate his position.

00:30:58.704 --> 00:31:00.120
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
I love the idea

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.420
of switching people around.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.390
And yet, I mean,
the example, China,

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.640
there are things right and
wrong about the government,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.348
that-- the thing you
want to think about,

00:31:08.348 --> 00:31:10.050
is that they are competing.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.590
The thing we begin
this book with

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.740
is this place I've listed,
on the outskirts of Shanghai.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.450
China Executive
Leadership Academy.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.420
And it's a place where they
send all their people who

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.120
want to be ambassadors, who want
to run State owned companies.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.700
And, you approach it, and
it looks a bit military,

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.150
there's barbed wire
on the outside.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.955
And then you go in, and it
feels a bit like Harvard,

00:31:32.955 --> 00:31:37.125
but Harvard as
redesigned by Dr. No.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:37.915
Because--

00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:39.206
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: ie Stanford.

00:31:39.206 --> 00:31:40.770
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: ie Stanford.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:45.290
And you have a huge, red,
scarlet desk-shaped building

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.290
in the middle, and there's
an inkwell beside it.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.500
And also dormitory
buildings around it.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.900
And this is the place
they send people

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.890
to ask the question,
what works best?

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.767
Much less ideological
than other parts

00:31:56.767 --> 00:31:57.850
of the Chinese leadership.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.330
People get sent
there, and they are

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.740
trying to do the same as
they did with business.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.946
The Chinese think,
well 25, 30 years ago,

00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:06.320
we sent people to
Silicon Valley.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.270
We sent people to the Midwest.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.710
We sent people to Wall
Street and the city of London

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.830
to learn about capitalism,
and to gain information

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.060
to try and do things better.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.445
We're going to do exactly
the same with government.

00:32:17.445 --> 00:32:20.476
But there's one
really obvious twist,

00:32:20.476 --> 00:32:21.725
is they send people Singapore.

00:32:21.725 --> 00:32:22.975
They send people to Chile.

00:32:22.975 --> 00:32:24.540
They send people to Scandinavia.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.730
They send people,
yes, to some states.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.717
They were sort of
rude about California,

00:32:28.717 --> 00:32:31.175
but they've gotten slightly
more interested in it recently.

00:32:31.175 --> 00:32:33.758
They're interested about things
that are happening in Chicago.

00:32:33.758 --> 00:32:36.860
But they do not send
people to Washington.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.820
They do not see-- all they
see is dysfunction there.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.430
And that isn't just
an ideological bias,

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.530
it's also they're desperately
looking for things that work.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.025
Even at a micro level.

00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:49.240
And I think what
would be foolish,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.945
is to discount, even
allowing for all of this,

00:32:52.945 --> 00:32:55.320
because a lot of examples of
all the terrible things that

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.903
are going wrong in
Chinese government.

00:32:56.903 --> 00:32:59.620
But they are really
working at this thing.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.500
And we, to some extent, are in
the same position, just maybe

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.910
a slightly old version of it.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.800
So I'm sure you could
probably think about it again.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.480
It's like the
equivalent of kind of,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.920
AOL sitting there, battling
against another search engine,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.020
and not really thinking
about what Google was doing.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.590
The worst form of contest.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.535
The worst form of contest.

00:33:18.535 --> 00:33:20.900
Perhaps a slightly
better old world example

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.860
is Sears Roebuck sitting there
battling Montgomery Ward,

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.770
not realizing that
it was actually

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.100
in competition with Walmart,
and then with Amazon.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.410
The worst competition
to be in is

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.630
one where you do not know
you're in the competition.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.570
And that, I think,
if there's a big,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.070
sort of message in this book,
it is that people have got

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.640
to understand, both in terms
of the opportunity, if America,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.572
Britain, Europe, the West, takes
of this to defend democracy,

00:33:47.572 --> 00:33:48.962
but also, actually , the threat.

00:33:48.962 --> 00:33:51.420
Because there are other people
who are actually taking this

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.049
much more seriously than we are.

00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:56.590
DON HARRISON: I'll turn it over
to the audience for questions

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.090
in a second.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.800
But let me ask
one more question.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.760
Talk about the role that
corporations play in this.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.410
I mean, part of the growth
of the intermission economy

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.120
is that companies like Facebook,
like Google, Apple, Twitter,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.969
can reach billions of people
almost simultaneously.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:18.295
It's starting to play a role
in how legislatures act,

00:34:18.295 --> 00:34:21.159
and how laws are viewed.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.394
In your book, you sort
of allude to corporations

00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:27.120
in the category of
special interests.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.924
Do you-- you know, are we a
force of good, a force of harm?

00:34:29.924 --> 00:34:32.340
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: In obvious
ways, we're [INAUDIBLE] good

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:32.620
is.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.889
For everyone at Google to
send out emails to people,

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.826
telling them to buy
this book, and thereby

00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:39.454
engender the revolution
that we need.

00:34:39.454 --> 00:34:40.829
But, I'll leave
Adrian to answer.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:44.219
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: Well,
I think one-- ha, ha.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.830
I think one way, one thing
we argue in this book,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:50.250
is that corporations represent
a way of running things, which

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.650
government can learn from.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.239
Their leaders, they're
more efficient.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.700
They're more part of the 21st
century than government is.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.890
But essentially, I don't-- I'm
not a person who believes that

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.950
all we need to do is
bring in Jeff Immelt,

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.220
put him on a commission,
and everything will be fine.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.261
Because companies have
their own business to run,

00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:13.250
they can't also concentrate
on running the government.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.280
What I do think is
a fundamental thing,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.420
is the purchaser provider split.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.680
The notion that
the State actually

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.550
exists to make sure that
everybody has access

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.550
to education, or
access to health care,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.360
or access to various
public services.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.130
But in doing that,
it doesn't actually

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.012
have to employ the
people directly

00:35:34.012 --> 00:35:35.095
to provide those services.

00:35:35.095 --> 00:35:38.170
It can buy services from
a range of providers.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.970
It might be internal
to the public sector.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:43.660
Or might be external, and
encourage competition,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.650
and bring in people
from all over the world,

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.530
public or private.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.240
And I think a really
interesting example

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.060
of that is what happened in
Sweden in the early 1990s.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.580
Sweden, the sort of example
everybody would think of,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.980
of big government socialism.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.700
And in the early 1990s,
they had a complete rethink

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.060
of the way they run their state,
and they decided, basically,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.165
to encourage welfare
entrepreneurialism.

00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:07.810
They basically said,
look, we believe

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.040
in providing free education.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.210
We believe in providing
free health care.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.810
But we don't believe
in providing jobs just

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.140
for the sake of providing
jobs to the public sector.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.520
So they gave everybody
a school voucher.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.180
Milton Friedman's great idea.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.390
They allowed private
companies to run schools.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.790
They allowed chains of private
companies to run schools.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.630
They allowed private
companies to run hospitals.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.796
Didn't say, you have to be
run by private companies,

00:36:30.796 --> 00:36:32.360
they said, compete.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.860
We'll give a contract to the
person who runs them best.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.120
And that created
competition within schools.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120
It broke the power of
producer interests,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.210
like teachers' unions, and
it spread good management

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:42.710
practice.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.820
I went to a hospital
in Stockholm,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.820
which was run by
actually, a private equity

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.835
company, on behalf
of the government.

00:36:48.835 --> 00:36:51.950
And what you saw was that they
were introducing total quality

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.511
management, lean manufacturing,
all the sort of things

00:36:54.511 --> 00:36:56.510
that doctors wouldn't
instinctively think about.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.330
They were getting doctors who
were sort of Guild members,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.999
almost, to work much more
creatively with nurses,

00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:04.540
with other members of the staff,
because they were conceiving

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.390
their services as a whole.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.770
And they also, when they created
this new management system,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.980
they spread it around all
their other hospitals, all

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.600
around Europe.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.280
So, good practice
spread around Europe.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.170
So I think, it's not that we
want companies necessarily

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.810
to run things.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.910
But we want to open the public
sector to competition, whereby

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.100
public private sector people
can compete with each other,

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.090
and the private sector can be
more like the public sector.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.300
I mean, the other way around.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.550
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: Adrian's
hospital was free at the point.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.883
So, free at the point of access.

00:37:35.883 --> 00:37:37.550
So somebody who goes
there, it's free.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.930
But behind it,
there is a company,

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:44.548
the contract is between the
government and the company.

00:37:44.548 --> 00:37:46.188
DON HARRISON: Does
anyone want to ask

00:37:46.188 --> 00:37:47.901
a question in the audience?

00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:48.484
AUDIENCE: Um--

00:37:48.484 --> 00:37:50.192
SPEAKER 1: Could you
hold on to the mike?

00:37:52.912 --> 00:37:54.388
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:54.388 --> 00:37:56.848
OK.

00:37:56.848 --> 00:38:00.292
Google is one of the best
companies I've worked for.

00:38:00.292 --> 00:38:02.260
And one of the reasons
is that it actually

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.720
uses engineering principles
in its management.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.688
And that's really unusual.

00:38:06.688 --> 00:38:08.410
I've worked at
Apple, I've worked

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.624
at a number of other places.

00:38:10.624 --> 00:38:12.430
It's unusual for
management to say,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.106
you know, let's do experiments,
and see what works.

00:38:16.106 --> 00:38:21.342
Ben Goldacre has suggested
really interesting ideas

00:38:21.342 --> 00:38:24.880
for your British
health care system.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.950
Where they say, OK.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.204
Well, let's do clinical
trials, let's find out

00:38:28.204 --> 00:38:29.495
what's actually happening here.

00:38:29.495 --> 00:38:34.809
And he's been quashed regularly
with truly sound ideas.

00:38:34.809 --> 00:38:37.791
So, I'm curious
what you think first

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:40.276
of evidence-based
management, which

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:44.808
is what Google prides itself
on, and whether that's

00:38:44.808 --> 00:38:45.807
something to do with it.

00:38:45.807 --> 00:38:47.400
Because I haven't
read your book yet.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:47.720
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: OK.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.136
I'll give you two
answers on that.

00:38:49.136 --> 00:38:52.590
One, you are absolutely right.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.140
There is a tendency within-- if
you look at the civil service,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.797
and you put it alongside
the people in this room,

00:38:58.797 --> 00:39:00.880
apart from the civil service
being somewhat older,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.710
in pretty much every
country you would go to,

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.940
it's not a culture
at the moment which

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.160
rewards entrepreneurial
thinking.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.840
If you're in the civil service,
it's the same pretty much.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.120
It's amazing.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.370
There are one or two
exceptions like Singapore,

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.161
but pretty much, if
you do like we've done,

00:39:17.161 --> 00:39:19.328
and you travel around the
world, and you see people,

00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:20.702
different government
offices, you

00:39:20.702 --> 00:39:22.450
could tell within
about 10 seconds you're

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.440
in a government office,
not a private one.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.420
And behind it, there
is a general feeling--

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.540
you've got a job for
life, in most cases.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.960
And you've got a job for
life, unless you mess it up.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.960
And so, it's almost exactly
the opposite culture

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.130
that you have here.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.790
Here, you are here
to take risks,

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.414
to come up with new ideas.

00:39:40.414 --> 00:39:41.080
So you're right.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.790
And that's why the Goldacre
thing was squashed.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.970
In terms of
evidence-based, I think

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.346
that is a really interesting
example about why people think

00:39:51.346 --> 00:39:52.970
this is never going
to really take off.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.190
But you look around
the world, what's

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.150
happening is experiments
are taking place.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.760
Cities have to
start experimenting.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.180
Mayors have got
to make-- chances.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.140
And whenever people
say it's impossible,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.250
just think of crime.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.110
When I was younger,
you'd go to New York,

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.570
it was an absolute nightmare.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.790
Look at every single
number to do with crime.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.234
It's gone down.

00:40:14.234 --> 00:40:16.400
Largely because people have
worked out how to do it.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.845
And that was very much
started in the cities,

00:40:17.845 --> 00:40:20.580
with Giuliani and [INAUDIBLE]
and other people like that.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.320
Look at the way that
people are trying things

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.500
at the provincial level.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.930
Even Google, I
think, helps things

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.620
within the District of Columbia.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.780
There's various things.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.900
There's also experiments
going on at the bottom.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.040
And the other
crucial thing, which

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.270
is where the Goldacre thing
comes in, is information.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.006
Because we talked
about education.

00:40:39.006 --> 00:40:40.380
Yes, there's always
ways in which

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.820
technology is helping education.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.000
But the most
radical way, is it's

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.210
telling you how bad
your schools are.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:50.040
You're all in California,
you now know your schools are

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.727
massively worse than Finland's.

00:40:51.727 --> 00:40:53.810
You've known that for the
past four or five years.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:54.610
The PISA test.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.110
The most recent
PISA tests tell you.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.790
They're not just worse than
Finland's, they're worse than

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:58.970
Poland's.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:03.200
So you are paying more
money to get worse results.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.704
And the more that information
starts going around,

00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:07.620
you can see it in things
like Facebook groups.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.980
You can see it in things like
websites which are devoted.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.180
And that is very much a
kind of bottom up revolution

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.080
which is going to
push this, I think.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.070
And you can see again,
Adrian mentioned Sweden.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.120
Another thing Sweden does
is, every hospital has

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.170
to publish all its results
online, so you can see.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.730
So again, it's about
the internet just

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.920
gradually working, is a way
to police the public sector.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.720
So you don't-- yes, maybe
the changes we talk about,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.710
maybe the Bloomberg presidency
came in, then maybe you would

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.964
see a wide range of these
things going through.

00:41:38.964 --> 00:41:40.505
Maybe there is a
Thatcher, or someone

00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:42.590
like that, who will
push this through.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.120
But there is also just
the massive evidence

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.962
in front of people of how
things can change at the bottom.

00:41:47.962 --> 00:41:49.920
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: Well,
we talked a great deal

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.300
in this book about
the paralysis that

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.120
is characteristic in Washington,
and the fact that America

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.275
really is not the sort of
beacon that it once was.

00:41:58.275 --> 00:42:00.292
On the other hand,
America, because it

00:42:00.292 --> 00:42:02.750
is this federal system, because
you have so much initiative

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.780
on the part of the
states and cities,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.620
has also got lots and lots
of great things going on.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.175
It just doesn't quite
come together at the top.

00:42:11.175 --> 00:42:13.820
It's hard to scale up
these things, really.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.220
AUDIENCE: So you seem to suggest
that the technology is going

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.130
to help things out, because
competition would increase,

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.600
transparency would increase.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.160
And at the same time,
if you think of people

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.040
as sometimes being foolish and
inaccurate, and easy to believe

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.970
false beliefs, you
can you imagine

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.350
that charlatans, for
example, could take hold

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.610
and false beliefs could happen.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.020
And I wonder, what are
the limits for this?

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.720
So if we think about the
FDA, for example, in the US,

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.280
which is clearly a very
bureaucratic organization.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.740
And let's say we
just cancelled it,

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.200
and we let people just create
whatever medications they would

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200
want.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.610
I suspect we would get
much more fake medicine

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.290
that would cost
people lots of money,

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.150
and would kill people
much, much faster.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.760
So, I'm wondering, where
is this belief coming from?

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:16.270
And is there any evidence that
openness and transparency's

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.937
always going to lead
to better outcomes.

00:43:17.937 --> 00:43:19.811
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: That's
a terrible example.

00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:22.890
I think that it's obvious nobody
wants to get rid of the FDA.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.910
I mean, there's a big
difference between wanting

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:28.690
to get rid of-- the FDA is doing
something transparently useful,

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.260
and it helps.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.167
It helps markets, it
helps a whole variety

00:43:31.167 --> 00:43:32.000
of different things.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.125
There are some things-- I
know there are criticisms

00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:36.190
about some bits of
things the FDA does do,

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.200
and it is useful to some extent,
that there's more information

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.800
out there, so the FDA
can be held to account.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.270
What we're saying
is, keep the FDA,

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.945
get rid of the
rules that say you

00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:51.320
need to spend two years
training to be a hairdresser.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.050
Because I don't-- although I
would worry about what kind

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.152
of food you are getting, I'm
not too worried about who cuts

00:43:58.152 --> 00:44:00.540
your hair, although
it looks very good.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.350
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: I mean, let
me give you an example of why I

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.680
think you're-- always is the
problem with your-- I remember,

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.992
I lived in Washington,
in the early 2000s.

00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:11.801
From 2000 to 2010.

00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:13.175
And during that
period, there was

00:44:13.175 --> 00:44:15.456
a-- the public school
system doesn't work.

00:44:15.456 --> 00:44:16.830
And there's was
a lot of pressure

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.620
to introduce a voucher
system, and to introduce

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.730
charter schools.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.270
And you would have
parents, black, poor,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:29.059
impoverished parents, who would
be queueing up outside schools

00:44:29.059 --> 00:44:31.100
to try and get their
children into those schools.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.475
Because they knew those
schools were better.

00:44:32.475 --> 00:44:34.599
Now, these people weren't
making foolish decisions.

00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:36.890
They were making decisions
absolutely well informed.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.490
Because they knew the schools
that their children were

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.920
trapped in were
useless, and they

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.910
knew these schools provided
a better education.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.290
So in many, many areas
of the public sector,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.140
the people who really knew--
people, ordinary people,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.505
are very well equipped
to make decisions.

00:44:51.505 --> 00:44:53.357
You don't need to have
an expert tell you.

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.190
And in fact, the expert
is going to come out

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.400
with a much worse decision.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.899
I think it's one
of the worst things

00:44:57.899 --> 00:45:02.020
that Obama has ever done,
was to send his own children

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.240
to a private school,
Sidwell Friends,

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.735
whilst denying ordinary black
children within Washington

00:45:08.735 --> 00:45:10.360
to be able to make
a choice themselves.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.735
So my prejudice is that
choice is quite a good thing

00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:13.485
to give to people.

00:45:13.485 --> 00:45:17.490
Not to choose to legalize
drugs that kill people,

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.220
but to choose where they send
their children to school,

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.901
to choose what sort of public
services they get from utility

00:45:23.901 --> 00:45:25.234
companies, and things like that.

00:45:25.234 --> 00:45:27.375
I think it adds a
dynamism to the system,

00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:29.235
and empowers parents.

00:45:29.235 --> 00:45:31.539
AUDIENCE: So, I'd ask you
if you have any evidence.

00:45:31.539 --> 00:45:32.955
Is there any
evidence that there's

00:45:32.955 --> 00:45:36.691
a domain life in which giving
people free choice is better?

00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:38.732
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: Yes,
I just gave you evidence.

00:45:38.732 --> 00:45:39.134
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:45:39.134 --> 00:45:41.814
This was a story about your
own experience in Washington.

00:45:41.814 --> 00:45:42.989
Is it not?

00:45:42.989 --> 00:45:45.072
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: It's
considered evidence by me.

00:45:45.072 --> 00:45:47.040
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT:
There's a lot of-- guys,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.750
there's a lot of evidence
about if you give people

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.030
more choice in
things like schools,

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.820
you can go-- you've got
socialist examples, like we

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.770
gave you Sweden, as one example.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.330
You can go look at that.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.480
Look at the example
of education.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.640
There's a lot on it.

00:46:07.326 --> 00:46:07.867
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:08.367
Great.

00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:09.304
Sorry about that.

00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:11.275
Basically, my
question is about how

00:46:11.275 --> 00:46:14.117
to increase political will
to do some of these changes.

00:46:14.117 --> 00:46:16.450
Because obviously, you guys
have written a book in order

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.470
to start a movement,
or maybe continue one.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.928
Call it something more concrete.

00:46:21.928 --> 00:46:25.720
But my question is, it seems
like we've had the information

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.090
revolution for a long time.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.305
And that hasn't been enough.

00:46:30.305 --> 00:46:35.150
And it seems like you have
to deal with a system that

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.910
currently exists
that would be opposed

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.090
to a lot of these measures.

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:44.015
How do you actually get these
changes to manifest themselves?

00:46:44.015 --> 00:46:46.840
Because I've heard some
arguments about-- well,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.680
at least from your talk,
I haven't read your book,

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.419
something along the
lines of, oh, you

00:46:51.419 --> 00:46:52.918
know, democracy
might be threatened,

00:46:52.918 --> 00:46:54.900
you know, kind of like,
if aliens attacked,

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.370
humanity unites.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:02.940
But in this-- I don't-- that's
one way to potentially create

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.930
will to make some
of these changes.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:07.660
But I think that
there's huge obstacles.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.755
So, how do you think you
can actually make some--

00:47:10.755 --> 00:47:12.880
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: I think
some of them, as I said,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.240
is a variety of people
seeing things happen.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.123
If you live in San
Francisco, and you

00:47:17.123 --> 00:47:19.280
see that LA has a
much better system,

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.860
you're going to start
militating to get it.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.030
That's certainly what
happened in crime,

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.980
is that people saw what
happened in New York,

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.021
and they wanted more of
the same thing elsewhere.

00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:29.350
It made a big difference.

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.602
There's also-- and I'm
saying that there is now

00:47:31.602 --> 00:47:32.310
more information.

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.024
So that's the general argument.

00:47:34.024 --> 00:47:35.440
It could be-- as
you say, it could

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.920
be specific leaders
arise to pull it.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.530
But I think what
is worth noting,

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.470
is a lot of the problems
of the American State

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:43.835
aren't actually that dramatic.

00:47:43.835 --> 00:47:46.293
I mean, the one which everyone
talks about is entitlements.

00:47:46.293 --> 00:47:49.675
But you look at the
Simpson Bowles Commission,

00:47:49.675 --> 00:47:54.310
they set off-- a group
of wise men so to speak,

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.670
they set off to go look at it.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.974
They came back roughly
with the same answer

00:47:57.974 --> 00:47:59.390
as pretty much
everyone has, which

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.577
is, you have to push
out the retirement age.

00:48:02.577 --> 00:48:04.160
You have to put up
the retirement age.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.170
You have to push it up
towards 70 slightly quicker.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.860
You have to do the
same with Medicare.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.540
You have to do some
fairly basic things.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.830
You have to do this-- tax reform
is just sort of bleedingly

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:14.410
obvious.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.110
We've given you, you know,
America has quite high taxes,

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:19.490
particularly in corporations.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.489
But then it has all these
ridiculous exemptions,

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:23.976
which just require huge
amounts of form filling.

00:48:23.976 --> 00:48:25.350
And there is a
sort of deal where

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.150
you come through,
where you tax reform,

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.920
you do entitlement reform,
and actually, the basic budget

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.620
begins to look much better.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:39.050
If Barack Obama had taken on
Simpson Bowles and said yes,

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.130
I think that would have
been a huge jump forward.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.510
A massive jump forward.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.720
And actually, it's-- I
think when Obama comes to be

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.590
considered by historians,
and certainly when Obama is

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:52.030
considered by himself, I
think in 10, 15 years time,

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.910
when people are talking
about the Obama/Bush,

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:58.730
the Bush/Obama years of splurge,
where there was no attempt

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.840
to really bring this
problem under control,

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.495
I think people will actually--
Obama will actually seriously

00:49:04.495 --> 00:49:05.400
regret that.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.910
It was, I think a
catastrophic decision,

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.220
both in terms of American
government in the long term,

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.820
but also actually, probably in
terms of the Democrat Party.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.659
Because it was a fantastic
way to skewer the Republicans.

00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:19.950
Because suddenly they were
hoisted on their own petard.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:20.395
As a--

00:49:20.395 --> 00:49:22.853
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: I think it's
a great question you asked.

00:49:22.853 --> 00:49:27.120
But I do think that the speed
and the impact of the IT

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.594
revolution has really begun
to sort of change very

00:49:31.594 --> 00:49:32.135
dramatically.

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.884
Particularly the way
that you can possibly

00:49:33.884 --> 00:49:38.820
introduce-- you can use IT
to educate people, I think.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.020
That you can-- there's
a sort of a vividness

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.175
now of lecturers over the years.

00:49:43.175 --> 00:49:46.130
But I do think that it's not
something that is automatically

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.239
going to come because
of technological change,

00:49:48.239 --> 00:49:50.530
or just because people think
that you can manage things

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:51.029
better.

00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:54.900
We do argue that you also have
to add a new ingredient to it,

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.570
which is ideas.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.600
If you look back at all of
these great revolutions,

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.690
they've partly taken place
because some group of people

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.420
begin to argue that the State
should be doing something

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.146
very differently.

00:50:05.146 --> 00:50:08.442
I think the 19th century
revolution of John Stuart

00:50:08.442 --> 00:50:11.470
Mill and the philosophical
radicals in Britain

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.820
was driven by a group
of people saying,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.350
what should the state do?

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.960
It shouldn't be providing jobs
for aristocrats and sinecures,

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.390
but for people that should
be solving these problems.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.150
It should be organized along
meritocratic, accountable

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.700
lines.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.735
And the one ingredient
which we really

00:50:26.735 --> 00:50:28.740
think that you need to
throw into this, which

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.205
means that the problem can't
just be solved by Google,

00:50:31.205 --> 00:50:33.466
and can't just be
solved by McKinsey,

00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:35.110
is a big philosophical question.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.834
What should the state be doing,
and what shouldn't it be doing?

00:50:42.118 --> 00:50:45.860
AUDIENCE: The columnist that I
first read the term [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.265
and together with [INAUDIBLE],
it has stopped being fallacy.

00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:52.610
That information technology is
destroying white collar jobs

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.615
faster than it creates new ones.

00:50:54.615 --> 00:50:57.440
You might agree or disagree,
but it's very clear

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.280
that a lot of people
in San Francisco

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.724
agree there's a very strong
anti-technology sentiment

00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:04.265
out there right now
in San Francisco,

00:51:04.265 --> 00:51:06.210
and the country as a whole.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.380
And a lot of the fight of income
distribution ties into this.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.800
People feel that they
are losing ground,

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.490
and it seems to me that this
is a very difficult problem.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.940
If you address
this problem, this

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.810
might reduce the
velocity of the West

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:26.080
compared to autocratic
countries, who, I mean,

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.624
are quite happy to
have inequalities.

00:51:31.624 --> 00:51:33.302
What have you thought of this?

00:51:33.302 --> 00:51:35.260
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: A very
interesting question.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.625
Again, I think you
have this phenomenon.

00:51:37.625 --> 00:51:42.580
I agree that we all think--
we had a cover on it.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.670
We all think that the
speed of the technology

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.735
is going to rip
through services.

00:51:47.735 --> 00:51:51.080
I put this again to the lady
who's in the same situation

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.530
as I perhaps was with Milton
Friedman in the sauna.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.080
Not imagining how much
these things could happen.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.580
You all find it
very easy to imagine

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.038
it happening to
the private sector.

00:51:59.038 --> 00:52:00.680
It will happen to
the public sector

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.176
even more, because it
is patently overmanned.

00:52:03.176 --> 00:52:04.550
Productivity in
the public sector

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.310
has been so low, compared
to the private sector.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.100
I think you twist it both ways.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.630
If you take one of the
great insights of economics,

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.510
a profound statement by
a man called Herb Stein,

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:18.930
one of the great
economists, said,

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:23.910
if something cannot go
on forever, it will stop.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.500
You apply that to
inequality, all the people,

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.470
I wonder, around
the world, seeing

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.990
in Europe and America,
Asian even a bit,

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.995
inequality, for a world leader,
is now becoming, usually,

00:52:34.995 --> 00:52:36.430
your second biggest problem.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:38.390
It's either inequality
or fairness.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:41.880
And the problem is even
as economic struggles

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.060
to do with it, we all
know what economies

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.690
have to do to do about
inequality, it takes time.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.490
So from a political viewpoint,
you have this huge pull

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.230
to the left, I think,
in terms of people

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.730
thinking about redistribution.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.620
You have kind of Piketty
as one example of that.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.847
On the other hand, the
other side of this,

00:52:59.847 --> 00:53:01.430
is the space that
we're talking about,

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.354
which is the other thing
which cannot go on forever,

00:53:04.354 --> 00:53:05.770
is the ever
increasing government.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.270
The one thing that's
been consistent

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.520
in every single
person in this room,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.830
is that we've all lived
in an age where government

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.500
has gradually gotten bigger, and
bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.000
And I think that is something
that cannot go on forever.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.700
So if you can unleash
productivity through that,

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.280
you could also do
enormous amounts of good.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.000
So on the one hand,
you have, I suppose

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.797
that is a pull
slightly to the right,

00:53:27.797 --> 00:53:29.380
to start thinking
about different ways

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.500
of dissembling government.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.666
Now, the pull from the left,
in terms of inequality,

00:53:32.666 --> 00:53:34.180
is another direction.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.370
So, you're right.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.310
It's a huge thing.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.615
This plays into it,
but it also provides,

00:53:40.615 --> 00:53:41.957
I think, new twists within it.

00:53:41.957 --> 00:53:44.540
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: I think that
it's a very profound question.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.173
And I think it's one of the most
difficult issues of our time.

00:53:47.173 --> 00:53:50.861
And as somebody who writes a
column named after Schumpeter,

00:53:50.861 --> 00:53:52.584
who talked about
creative destruction,

00:53:52.584 --> 00:53:55.205
I think it may well be
the case that there'll

00:53:55.205 --> 00:53:57.454
be some people who want more
destruction than creation

00:53:57.454 --> 00:53:58.037
in the future.

00:53:58.037 --> 00:54:00.376
But on the other hand,
these very forces

00:54:00.376 --> 00:54:03.298
that are changing the
occupational structure also

00:54:03.298 --> 00:54:06.104
create new ways of
teaching people.

00:54:06.104 --> 00:54:08.028
New ways of training people.

00:54:08.028 --> 00:54:09.863
New efficiencies in
transmitting knowledge.

00:54:09.863 --> 00:54:12.196
So, many of these people who
were losing their jobs, who

00:54:12.196 --> 00:54:13.319
have seen their jobs displaced.

00:54:13.319 --> 00:54:15.270
On the other hand, the
positive side of that,

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:20.054
is that they can probably
be constructive in new jobs

00:54:20.054 --> 00:54:22.833
in much more efficient,
much more up to date ways.

00:54:22.833 --> 00:54:24.874
And I think that there
was an interesting example

00:54:24.874 --> 00:54:27.615
of a course that
was recently taken,

00:54:27.615 --> 00:54:36.740
and it was created to train auto
workers in Detroit to IT jobs.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.906
And this had been
basically run by the city.

00:54:38.906 --> 00:54:41.690
It had been run very badly, and
had an incredibly low success

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:42.266
rate.

00:54:42.266 --> 00:54:44.970
And it was taken
over by Infosys,

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.270
which has got an incredible
internal training system.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:51.318
They take people who are
bright, but not completely

00:54:51.318 --> 00:54:54.651
ready to [INAUDIBLE] jobs,
and push them up to a level

00:54:54.651 --> 00:54:57.745
where they can take this job,
and it had massive improvements

00:54:57.745 --> 00:55:00.500
in the sort of results you have.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.930
So the very forces or the
challenge you get also perhaps

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.704
contained the solutions
to our problems.

00:55:06.704 --> 00:55:08.620
DON HARRISON: Guys, we're
running out of time.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.790
I'm going to ask a general
question of you guys.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.550
We've had a bit of a
rough month in Europe.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:16.540
We have a hard to understand
decision by a European court,

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.780
on right to be forgotten,
we have the publishers

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.420
rising up, and trying
to use anti-trust

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.140
as a cudgel to beat us down.

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.140
You know, just a couple
other examples, as well.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.306
What do you-- first of all,
what do you think of us?

00:55:28.306 --> 00:55:31.599
And then secondly, how do
we-- how do we fix it right?

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:32.932
JOHN MICKLETHWAIT: Well, no, no.

00:55:32.932 --> 00:55:34.250
No, no.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.925
No, we have a
tentative back view

00:55:35.925 --> 00:55:38.280
of quite a lot of
anti-trust things.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.832
The one angle where I
personally am slightly--

00:55:41.832 --> 00:55:44.125
I'm nervous about, is
the issue of privacy.

00:55:44.125 --> 00:55:46.700
Or privacy, as some people say.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.622
I'm one of those
people who have begun

00:55:48.622 --> 00:55:52.330
to rethink exactly where I
want the sort of parameters

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.030
to be set.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.519
But on the whole,
I want somebody--

00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:56.227
I want somebody who
will have the default

00:55:56.227 --> 00:55:59.221
settings for privacy
set relatively high,

00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:01.464
so people start from that angle.

00:56:01.464 --> 00:56:03.213
And I do think there
is an element whereby

00:56:03.213 --> 00:56:06.207
I think at Google,
it's the fate you have.

00:56:06.207 --> 00:56:08.702
I think that many previous
technology companies before,

00:56:08.702 --> 00:56:11.197
where this will become
I think, that big.

00:56:11.197 --> 00:56:13.357
For better or worse, a
great part of your life.

00:56:13.357 --> 00:56:14.940
I think the dangerous
thing about what

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.200
is happening in
Europe, is that there

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.740
is a profound misunderstanding
of how entrepreneurship works.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.722
And that comes
through repeatedly.

00:56:25.722 --> 00:56:28.904
Another one dwells
with the people

00:56:28.904 --> 00:56:30.195
who are making these decisions.

00:56:30.195 --> 00:56:34.236
And it's not just a question
of Google and Facebook.

00:56:34.236 --> 00:56:35.540
It's more basic than that.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.450
You look at the
companies that make up

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.850
the more dynamic part
of America, many of you

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.748
barely existed, even
a few years ago.

00:56:44.748 --> 00:56:46.467
You have the
equivalent in Europe,

00:56:46.467 --> 00:56:48.431
it's a tiny proportion of that.

00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:50.886
And so, yes, there
are individual issues

00:56:50.886 --> 00:56:53.820
where privacy, as I
said, is one where

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.750
I'm beginning to get more
interested from actually

00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:00.680
exactly the liberal viewpoint
that we champion in this book.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.970
So if you think that
is a vital fact,

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.694
you can't just buy John
Stuart Mill or Adam

00:57:05.694 --> 00:57:07.140
Smith on economics,
and ignore it

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.170
when it comes to
individual liberty as well.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:13.682
But overall, I
think that there is

00:57:13.682 --> 00:57:15.610
a kind of slightly
worrying attitude,

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.779
especially from the Europeans,
about this inability

00:57:17.779 --> 00:57:19.950
to understand exactly
how a commercial--

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.630
ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE: 30 of
the top 100 companies,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.910
of the biggest 100
companies in California

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:26.512
were founded since 1970.

00:57:26.512 --> 00:57:28.470
The figure in Sweden,
which we'd rather lauded,

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:32.671
in terms of its public
sector management is 2.

00:57:32.671 --> 00:57:34.920
DON HARRISON: Well, thank
you very much for coming in.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.220
Appreciate it.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:35.820
Thank you.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.170
