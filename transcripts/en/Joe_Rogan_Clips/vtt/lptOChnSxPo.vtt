WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
But like a,
we get a lot of like,

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.280
how do I make it or when's the right time to move to la or New York?

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:09.640
Never or whatever.
But yeah,
but it's the eighties it's like,

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.780
I don't know man.
It's,
it's Kinda up to you.
And this guy who's like,

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.140
I've been doing it like 12 years or something and Andrew was just like

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.880
[inaudible] to finished.
She goes,
I would give up,
man.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.060
I would honestly give up because this business will eat you alive.
And I don't,

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.660
and that is something,
I don't have the heart.
I'm a sensitive guy.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.710
I don't have the heart to say that to anyone to just say back it up and can move

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:30.660
on.
You're editing for you.
You know?

11
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.820
But Andrew was saying that and it was kind of like,
yeah,
we were,

12
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:36.060
I appreciated his honesty.
You know?
Well,
like I,

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.000
I just think that it requires an obsession.
Yes.

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.760
If you're not like fully obsessed,

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.630
you're probably not going to put the thought process and the effort and do,

16
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.810
and you're not going to survive.
The bombings know the bombings.

17
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.460
Like they test your soul.

18
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.050
It's just nothing worse than feeling that amount of hate.
Where,
where,

19
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:02.460
where I or being in New York and to dead silence and hearing a guy in the back

20
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.060
button would be like,
oh,
you fucking kidding me.
Can we fucking go home now?

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.740
<v 1>I mean,
Jesus Christ like audibly,
audibly,
and the</v>

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.160
<v 0>silence.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
I just,</v>

23
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.460
and I hear that guy in my dreams and just bombing on stage once and this guy

24
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:20.660
goes,
you're fucking terrible.
And I was like,
he's right.

25
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310
It's nothing I could say.
I can't never respond.
Like,
not not going to say,
dude,

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.460
I'm with you.
I can't even pull myself out of this.
Yeah.
I got nothing.
Yeah.
Dave,

27
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.110
I were a Patton Oswald being on stage at the first festival ever did.

28
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.120
It was a Chicago comedy festival and I found,

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.680
I found the booklet from it recently,
like cleaning out my house and,
uh,

30
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.610
2001 and it was Doug,
Doug,
Stan hope.

31
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.170
Swartzman uh,
Tosh Kyle.

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.860
Who else fucking,
uh,
built wire,

33
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.400
a bunch of random like awesome people,
but uh,

34
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.940
patents on stage and Marin back when Marin still drank.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.350
I think that was the last time you drank actually that weekend.

36
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.170
Marin wasn't drinking back then,

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.620
man wasn't drinking way back in the 80s no d start drinking again?

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.540
Yes.
Oh,
that was like during the relapse period.

39
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.790
I think I remember it because he talks about leaving the hotel and a friend who

40
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.610
was at the hotel was like,
yeah man,
when you left your luggage was sweating.

41
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.050
Like said it to me.
She was so hung over.
But patent was like,
you know,

42
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:27.620
doing him and Marin were just dropping in and places and this chick was so mad,

43
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:31.730
she got bumped.
She's like,
you fucking suck.
And in patents like I agree with you.

44
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.960
I agree with you.

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.300
She was mad at him because she got bumped and so she was saying he sucked.
Yeah.

46
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.580
She's just screaming at him from the audience and like she said,

47
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.690
you get up hunting.
Yeah.
Well I mean I was kind of like,
this is a free form room.

48
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.850
I got bumped,
but I get to watch Patton.
So she's a comic heckling.
Yeah.

49
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.560
Oh,
I know.
She never made it did show.
No,
Huh.
Yeah,
I mean,
and,
and,

50
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.980
but it was that thing.
They were just like,
if you say I could be killing,

51
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.910
had been,
one guy would be,
this guy fucking blows.
And I'm like,

52
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.430
I believe that guy.
Damn it.
I don't want to,

53
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.780
that's the worst is when you're killing,

54
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.820
you see one person in the front row like this.
Yeah.

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.350
Like an old lady was scowling.
What?
Yeah.

56
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.680
I had an old lady like that at the store the other day.
Older Lady,

57
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.790
like she was like halfway into my act.
She still had this look on her face.
Like,

58
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.300
oh,
I don't know.
No,
I had her,

59
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.000
I hit her with this one bit and this one bed and she throws her head back and

60
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.680
then she's Howell and I'm like,
I got her.
Wow.
I got eyes she didn't want to give.

61
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.580
And that's a good,
that's a fun soda to cry when she was like all the sudden,

62
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.930
why God best feeling gave in.
Maybe it was the booze,
maybe the booze kicked in.
