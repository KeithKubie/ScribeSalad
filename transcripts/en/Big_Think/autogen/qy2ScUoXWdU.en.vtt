00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.040
I would never set myself up as somehow the
oracle of truth or value-free judgment.&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:18.420
You know, I’m really not that different
from the next guy. . . . I am a contrarian.&nbsp;

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050
I think I can admit to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.480
Looking at the MacDonald case, I was bothered
by it.&nbsp; I don’t know how else to describe

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:38.559
it.&nbsp; There’s a line in a Robert Mitchum
film noir where Mitchum says, “I could see

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:48.600
the frame, but I couldn’t see the picture.”&nbsp;
It’s one of the great film noir lines. . . . It’s

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
not so much that I could see the frame but
I couldn’t see the picture – this was

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:02.039
certainly true in&nbsp;The Thin Blue Line&nbsp;25
years ago.&nbsp; Here, there was something deeply

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.030
unconvincing about the case that had been
made, particularly the case that had been

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:21.140
made by Joe McGinniss in&nbsp;Fatal Vision...
too pat, too slick, too simple, too easy.&nbsp;

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:33.320
What’s so interesting about this story When
you have a theory – say you’re an investigator,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.630
which would be the best and easiest way of
talking about this – you have a theory about

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.689
what happened, a theory about who did it or
how they did it.&nbsp; The term confirmation bias

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.549
– I hesitate to use it, but . . . you have
a theory.&nbsp; The question is, does that theory

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.409
in some way determine the kind of evidence
that you look for and the kind of evidence

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.220
that you reject?&nbsp; If you truly believe there
were no intruders in the house and that Jeffrey

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.330
MacDonald was the person who killed his family,
you may not look for evidence that suggests

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.610
that there were intruders in the house.&nbsp;
You might not even notice it.&nbsp; It might become

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330
for all intents and purposes invisible to
you.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.900
I wrote a book prior to this book,&nbsp;Believing
Is Seeing, which is – I almost think the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:40.640
title should have been&nbsp;Disbelieving Is Seeing&nbsp;because
it shows you this interplay between how we

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.260
see things and the beliefs that we hold about
the world.&nbsp; Vision, which we often like to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:01.760
think of as neutral or value-free, is anything
but that.&nbsp; We see on the basis of what we

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.460
believe, not the other way around.&nbsp; And that
idea is very much part of a&nbsp;Wilderness of

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.840
Error&nbsp;as well.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:27.440
Cops come on a scene, look around, see the
position of furniture.&nbsp; 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.150
And often you quickly – I think this is
a human problem – you come to one narrative

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.910
or another, an explanation of what I’m looking
at.&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp; How do I explain this?&nbsp;

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.300
What happened here?&nbsp; Who’s responsible?&nbsp;
Who’s the real perpetrator?&nbsp; And so on

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:59.610
and so forth.&nbsp; In the case of MacDonald,
the police very quickly decided it was him,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.130
not just that it was him but that he had staged
the crime scene, he had arranged the crime

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.460
scene to make it look like there had been
intruders.&nbsp; But he had done it in such a

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.721
ham-handed pathetic way that it was easily
unmasked as a fraud. . . . You idiot!&nbsp; Look

00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:27.530
at this! . . . This is a pathetic attempt
to deceive us into thinking that there were

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.700
intruders when we know better.&nbsp; We know there
were none.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:43.071
So there you go.&nbsp; You have an idea, a theory,
and as a result of that theory how did it

00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:56.190
affect the next 40 years?&nbsp; Yes, it affected
the next 40 years in many very powerful and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.250
sad ways.
