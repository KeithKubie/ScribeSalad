00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.568
Everyone is so sexed up
on that show.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.137
I mean, it's the hottest people-
Sure.

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.805
Yeah, the tension
looks palpable.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.840
No, I'm sure people were sitting
at home jerking off

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.842
to that show, being like,
"Oh, she just said 'rough sex.'

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.211
That's disgusting! I'm watching
this with my children!"

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.479
But I love it.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.148
Yeah, they do dances where like,

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.016
the girl just flips up
into his face

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.852
and rides around with her box
right in his face.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.387
Literally, that is a move.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:25.725
Yeah, just, come and get it.
Soup's on.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.564
Doug Benson is with us.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.599
You can see him tonight
at the 12 Guests

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.835
of Christmas
at the Gramercy Theater.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.638
Also, December 2nd and 3rd
at Largo in Los Angeles.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.740
He also has a show,
Getting Doug

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.009
With High, where he smokes weed
with comedians, and that's-

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.211
On YouTube, yeah.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.479
On YouTube. It's super fun.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.946
Adam's done it.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.415
So fun. So baked.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.849
Oh, Tom did it too!
Yeah, I did it too.

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:52.885
Adam has got to his audition
right now.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.488
Can I tell you real quick
before, when I did your show,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.156
literally the next morning
when I was doing

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.591
Mad TV,
we shot a sketch

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.393
where we were playing
potheads at 7:00 AM.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.161
I was still so baked
from your show.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.630
Oh, that's great.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.398
It was kind of,
but then also terrible,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.166
because I was just like ...
at first I got there.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.635
I was like, "It'll be great,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.369
because I'm still
really fucked up."

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.772
We're playing a show where we're
potheads doing a cooking show.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.209
Yeah, it's easy to get too
fucked up to play fucked up.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.877
Yeah and then we would start,
Amir K

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.845
and I would start improvising,
and he would just look at me,

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.547
and I was like ...
"Oh, was that not funny?"

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:22.849
He was like,
"Dude, you're fucked up."

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.917
I was like,
"Can we take ten?"

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.352
Oh, my God. We need-

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.288
I love Amir K at breakfast time.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.058
Doug Benson is in the studio
with me and Tom Thakkar.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.492
Hello.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.595
Doug Benson, who I have been
a huge fan of

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.897
since Best Week Ever days.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.633
Doug Benson used to steal
the show on Best Week Ever.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.736
I'll never forget one line
that has stayed with me

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:47.907
since 2006, I remember,
probably 2005.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.875
It was some story
about Paris Hilton,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.844
and it was like,
she was leaving some place.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.747
You were like, "Hey Paris,
don't let the door have sex

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:59.986
with you on the way out."
Still gets me.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.422
I remember like, me and my
friends loved it so much.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:06.125
Then I got on
Last Comic Standing

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.659
my senior year of ...

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.562
and Doug was like,
one of my favorite comedians.

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:12.665
I used to make lists,
I was so obsessed with comedy.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.334
Doug was always on my list,

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.002
like my top favorite
comedians, still is.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.739
Funniest, just one of
the funniest people ever.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.674
Then I go
to Last Comic Standing,

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.310
my senior year I get passed
at the Chicago auditions,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.878
and I go to LA
for the semi-finals,

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:29.715
and Doug Benson is
in the lobby

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.717
of the Hilton Garden Inn
in Glendale,

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.686
where they were putting us
during the show.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.289
I go, "That's Doug Benson.
What is he doing here?"

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.659
I went up to go say,
"I'm a fan. I love you."

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.161
I go, "Why are you here?"

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.930
And he was like,
"I'm doing Last Comic Standing."

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.399
I'm like, "I'm competing
against you?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.234
What is going on here?"

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.668
It was like me and
Tanashe,

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.237
pretty much,
is like how I felt.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.072
Me meeting Alexis Ren
on the first day of Dancing

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:56.008
With the Stars.
I was like, "Why am I here?"

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.679
You do meet a lot of people
through doing these shows.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.447
I met Tig that time too.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.016
Yeah, who else was
on that season?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.183
It was-

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.885
Was Todd on that one?

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.920
No, no. Todd was
on the very first one,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.822
and then he was also
on that weird battle

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:12.558
of the first and second seasons
one that they did,

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.893
where they didn't announce
the winner on TV.

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:20.699
They just mentioned it during
an ad during an animated ...

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.069
It was the premiere
of a new animated show

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.070
that ended up bombing.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.339
They mentioned it during
a break in another show.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.507
That's nuts.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:29.776
Who the winner was.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.177
Who won that?
I think Alonzo Bodden.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.744
Alonzo Bodden, that's right.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.048
Yeah, there were a lot
of people there that season.

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:37.317
That was so fun.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.885
Remember how they
sequestered us

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.854
when, we were at the point
where nobody had ...

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.657
there was like 40 comedians
were all going to compete

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.759
to see who makes it
into the next stage.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.160
Top ten.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.096
Yeah, so we had to stay
in a hotel room for ...

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:54.900
we were sequestered in a hotel
for a couple of days.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.202
We had roommates.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.371
Yeah, yeah. My roommate
was Chris Porter, who-

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.939
Mine was Jackie Kashian.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.907
Who advanced, and then you still
have to stay there

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.877
one more night after they say
who advanced and who hasn't.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.479
I had to be roommates
with a guy

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.047
who was celebrating
all night long,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:10.616
because he had advanced
and I didn't make it.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.720
That's what happened,
is I came back the next year,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.455
and that's when I made it
into the next group.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.658
That's where I met Amy Schumer,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.226
and that's where
we became friends.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.827
Yes.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.362
Yeah, but the season
where you and I were there,

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.830
remember Sean Rouse
was there?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.964
Yes.

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.800
He passed away recently.
I know.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.237
Hilarious dude. They wouldn't
let us out at night,

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.972
and the bar closed at ten.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.674
We wanted drinks,
so he figured out ...

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.611
they had somebody posted
at the front door of the hotel.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.047
He ordered a pizza
from Domino's,

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:45.718
and when the guy got there
at the hotel room door, he said,

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:48.755
"Can I give you extra money
for your shirt and your hat?"

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.523
He bought the guys
shirt and hat,

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:55.594
and left the hotel like
he had just delivered pizzas.

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.663
Yeah.
That's how he got out.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.498
Wait. What did he do
with the other guy?

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:00.900
The other guy wore his clothes.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.334
He locked him in a closet?
Oh, I see.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.237
No, they just switched clothes.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.538
The idea was just get past
the Last Comic Standing

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:07.974
chaperone person.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.141
Yeah.

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.710
That was watching the door.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.846
He escaped out that way,
but then I met him at the bar,

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.615
because the hotel
had a back door.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.118
I didn't have to go to such
elaborate lengths to get out.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:22.622
Then we just went to a bar
nearby and drank for hours.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.657
Yeah.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.159
Yeah, it was a very strange
experience.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.728
Josh Wolf was also ...

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.965
he was, we had like adjoining
doors between our rooms.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:36.569 align:start position:0%
So, Chris Porter, I think it was
Ty Barnett, is that his name?

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.270
Yeah.
And Josh Wolf.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.206
We just opened up
the adjoining door,

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.808
and the four of us would all
just smoke weed every night.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:47.079
It's so funny how that show,
they try to control you,

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:50.583
but they don't, it's not
the same as other reality shows.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.317
You can get away
with a lot of shit.

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:54.153
Me and Amy used to take,
when we'd have to go

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.388
and get on the small bus
to go to events and stuff,

00:05:56.388 --> 00:06:00.393
we'd just fill a coffee cup
with booze at the hotel bar

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.828
and sit there drinking
out of it.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.295
It looked like
we were drinking coffee.

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:04.931
Oh, yeah.

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:07.466
But vodka drips through,
it cuts through the paper.

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:09.102
Oh.
Oh.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.436
It starts to drip,
so you've got to drink it fast.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:11.604
I didn't know that.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.272
Yeah, that's weird.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.907
Yeah. It's real weird,
because I put it in my body

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.710
all the time,
and then it eats through a cup.

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:21.113
I'm like,
"My liver can handle it.

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.915
My liver's stronger
than a cup."

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.083
Yeah.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.784
That was the vibe,
when I came back

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:27.520
for the finale of Dancing
With the Stars.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.823
Everyone's just drinking
and smoking in their trailers,

00:06:31.823 --> 00:06:34.493
and before that,
because we have nothing to lose.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.429
We're not trying to ...

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.930
the rules are
all still in place,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.999
but no one's
following them anymore.

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.900
We're just, some of us aren't
showing up for dress rehearsal,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.136
because we know we just have
to stand there and watch.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.305
It was so much more fun.
I've told this before,

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.174
but when I got eliminated
from Last Comic Standing,

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:52.912
I was still in college.
I had to go back and do tests

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.680
and go back to class
the next week.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.214
I was like,
"I don't want to go."

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:57.917
I was having a cigarette
with Brendan Walsh,

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.585
who also got eliminated
that night.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.420
We were outside the Glendale
Hilton, and I was like,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.456
"I don't want to go back
to school tomorrow."

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.025
He's like, "Just tell them
you're still on the show.

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.860
It's not going to air
until the summer,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.461
so just tell them
you're still ..."

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.197
So, I just did.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.732
I emailed them, and I said,
"I'm still on the show,

00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:15.234
and I'm in LA."

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.135
They were like,
"Follow your dream girl!"

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.805
Then I just didn't have
to go back to school ever,

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:22.875
because then it was over,
and they never knew.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.244
It was such a brilliant plan,
but ...

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.980
Some might be finding
out right now.

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.649
I'm sorry.
Thank you for believing in me.

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.451
Your class was worthless.

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.286
I didn't really learn anything
at the University of Kansas.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.787
They're going to take
your degree away.

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:38.356
Then we did, shortly after that,

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:40.459
you started opening for me
on the road and stuff.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.027
Yes, that was awesome.

00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:44.496
That really took everything
to the next level,

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.866
and that's the only way
you can get to the next level

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:52.338
is having a headliner
take you to feature for them,

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.340
and then getting
that amount of stage

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.609
sense.
That was so rad.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.477
I got in so many places
through you,

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.247
so many clubs
that I still work to this day.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:05.618
First time going there was with
Doug Benson, so I always ...

00:08:06.818 --> 00:08:08.320
I owe you a lot, Doug.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.222
You were the first guy
to bring me on the road.

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:11.924
That means something,

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.659
because then other people
start bringing you on the road,

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.393
because then you get better
because someone took the chance.

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:17.063
I remember the first time
I opened for Doug,

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:19.164
I didn't have 20 minutes.

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:21.566
I was terrified,
but then you get it together,

00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:22.768
because someone believes in you.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.202
You have to.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:26.538
It takes one person
to believe in you.

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:29.575
That's what Lady Gaga said
1600 times in an interview.

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.611
"If there's a room
of 100 people,

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.312
and 99 don't believe in you,

00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:36.882
Doug Benson was the one
who believed in me.

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:38.984
Doug Benson was
that person for me."

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:41.420
So, thank you Doug.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.055
Remember that show we did
at Morty's that one night?

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.423
Oh, God.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.858
Where the entire audience was,
as they say, urban?

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:48.995
It was a black crowd,
because they gave away tickets

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.730
on the local urban
radio station.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.531
No, I don't remember this.
I probably blacked it out.

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.733
Oh, my God. It did not go well.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.133
Oh, no.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:56.335
For anybody.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:59.438
No.
Well, that club's over now.

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:02.341
Yeah, but the host was
a black guy and he killed.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.709
Oh, right. Okay.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.243
Then you had a hard time
after him,

00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:06.845
and then I had a hard time
after both of you.

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.514
I had a lot of hard times
with you.

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.617
I was still new, and that's what
meant so much to me, that you-

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.118
You were working it out.

00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.187
Anthony Jeselnik used to bomb
in front of me.

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:17.456
He'd walk people that would just
get up and leave,

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.392
like we're not even going
to stay for Doug Benson.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.926
Right.

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:22.460
Because this guy's making us
so upset.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.364
I learned so much
from Doug Benson on the road.

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.599
First of all, and things
that I still do on the road,

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:33.873
which is like, you like
everything just to be in or-

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.674
... you expect
a lot from clubs,

00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:38.343
because it doesn't take much to
just deliver a good experience.

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:39.544
It's easy.

00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.046
Really, it's so easy.

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:43.649
When they fuck it up,
it's really annoying.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.385
I don't like it, and I don't
stand for it anymore.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.788
I've seen how you handle
those situations,

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.989
and you'll go in and be like,
"Guys ..."

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:54.526
I just call out things,
like if my veggie tray

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:56.061
isn't there, I get annoyed,

00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:57.362
because how hard is it
to get a fucking veggie tray?

00:09:57.362 --> 00:09:58.530
Right. It's like-

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.065
It's the only thing I ask for.

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.299
I'm not asking
for a pair of new Nike's,

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:02.535
which some people are.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:03.903
Yeah.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.571
You have to go to Shnuck's
or ...

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.707
that's a grocery store
in St. Louis, but you know.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.441
You have to get it
from Shnuck's in St. Louis.

00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:10.809
It's not that hard
to put in an order.

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.478
That's why it's hard.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:14.780
Did you ever see that movie,
Dinner for Shnuck's?

00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:20.085
Also, another thing I learned
from you that I love,

00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:22.020
and I don't know
if you still do this.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.558
You would get off stage,
like you would be,

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:28.360
"I'm doing a 45 minute show,
maybe 50 minute,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.729
and I don't need ..."

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.964
These guys that do hour
and a halves,

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:35.434
and like, what are you
hiding from off stage?

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.068
They never want
to get off stage.

00:10:37.068 --> 00:10:38.637
What are you running
from in your life?

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:40.405
Exactly. When Dave Chapelle-

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:42.308
Who's calls would you have to
return if you got off stage?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.043
Exactly. When Dane Cook
or all these ...

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:47.113
Carlos Mencia
used to do it.

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:51.150
He did 7 hours last night.
Why don't you want to go home?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.885
It's a badge of honor.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:55.320
But also, I want to go home.
Like, as an audience member,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.124
show me my favorite comedian,
an hour and a half, I'm out.

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:01.827
And the staff, the wait staff
has to just serve cokes

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.163
or nothing after last call.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.565
The comedian goes all night,
and they have to stay.

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:07.833
It sucks.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.434
Brutal.

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:11.203
In case somebody at their table
wants another coke.

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:12.972
They're sitting
around all night,

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:14.540
and they're not getting tips
that reflect

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.208
the amount of time
they're spending there.

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.811
People in audiences
have such social anxiety

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:21.713
that they can't even go
to the bathroom during a show,

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:23.615
because they're worried
that the comedian is going

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:26.218
to call them out or everyone
in the room will look at them.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.086
People are holding in their pee
the whole show already,

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:29.288
and then when you push that-

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.256
Yeah, it's a hostage situation.

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.892
-you're just putting people ...
it is a hostage situation.

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:35.394
A few people are enjoying it.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.062
It's a social grace
hostage situation,

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:39.064
where it's like people
who are polite,

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:40.499
you're holding them hostage.

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:41.733
Yes, yes.

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.435
That's a great idea.

00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:45.037
We should just take a break
at some point in the set.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.638
Does anyone need
to use the restroom?

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:48.240
Raise your hand if you need
to use the restroom.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.942
Okay, go ahead.
I'll look away.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.377
I'm not going to say
anything about it.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.280
I'll turn around.
I won't make fun of you.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.216
I actively, when someone
stands up and you can tell ...

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.951
I actively turn the other way,
so they know-

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.485
Me too.
I hate that.

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:02.421
I can't help myself.
I always mention it,

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.891
but I try not to shame them
for having to use the bathroom.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.259
I try to make it more on me,

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.195
like I always say
something like,

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:11.730
"Oh yeah, you're right.
This is a good time to get up."

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.065
Yeah, that's good.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.599
Your senses are correct.

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:17.869
If it feels like something
that is not political

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:19.671
and they stand up,
I'm like,

00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:22.474
"Oh, I'm sorry. I offended
the Korn fans," or whatever.

00:12:22.474 --> 00:12:24.310
Oh, yes. There's little tricks
like that.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.178
I think it's funny then,
but like in general,

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.447
I'm just like I know
that you probably have to shit.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:31.650
You don't want to deal with me
right now making fun of you.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.251
Yes.

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.620
Maybe not shit.
I don't know how often somebody

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.388
gets up during a show
to take a shit.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.257
I assume everyone
in the audience is shitting.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.325
I hate when a comedian calls
out a girl and is like,

00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:41.927
"She's just going to shit."

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:42.861
"What are you doing?
Taking a dump?"

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:44.062
Oh, it's like-

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:45.597
"A big gnarly dump?"

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:47.533
She's on a date.
That's the last thing.

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:49.901
"Let's listen everybody."

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.304
Oh, yeah. We've all heard this.

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:55.006
I've seen a comic follow
somebody to the bathroom

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:57.208
and just stand outside the door

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:58.911
while they use the bathroom
and then wait.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.279
That's harassment.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.114
I know.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.616
Getting Doug with High,

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.485
you've been doing that
show a while on YouTube.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.587
Yeah, we just celebrated
our fifth anniversary.

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:09.988
Wow.

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:11.356
And we celebrated
by smoking some weed.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:12.690
Hell yeah.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.828
Dude. People that do that show
get so fucked up.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:18.630
I had one of the worst days
of my life, was doing that show.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.432
I have so many friends ...
what is it?

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:22.334
Is it because you're dabbing?
What is happening?

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.637
We dab at the end, but even
before we added that segment,

00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:28.406
people were just ...
and me.

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:34.012
I definitely have, I try not to
have much to do after I do it.

00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:36.014
It kind of ruins
the rest of the day,

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:37.782
because it's just ...

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.852
it's not just standing around
casually smoking

00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:42.754
until you're high.
It's smoking until you're high,

00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:45.023
and then you just kind of have
to push through and keep going.

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.792
Yeah, because
you're constantly going.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.427
We're live for 45 minutes,

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.095
people just start calling you
a pussy in the comments.

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.529
That's it, yeah.

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:52.697
If you're not smoking
the whole time.

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:54.199
Oh, my God.

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:55.600
That was my fear,
is I didn't want to-

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.436
I really want to do it.
I get so ...

00:13:58.436 --> 00:14:00.005
because I'm back
on the weed train.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.573
Doug has asked me
to do it before,

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.509
and I'm like,
"I'm not smoking weed now,"

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.877
or I am but I don't want to be
public about it, or whatever.

00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:10.249
Now I'm back on the weed train,
but like, I guess ...

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:13.785
do you still take breaks?

00:14:13.785 --> 00:14:15.888
Do you still do Sober October,
that kind of thing?

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:19.257
I do, but I never take breaks
from weed. It's just alcohol.

00:14:19.257 --> 00:14:21.559
I don't know that I need a break
from weed.

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.996
I feel very similar
to you with weed,

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.398
that like it makes me
work harder.

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.468
Do you feel like it's a
stimulant for you in a way?

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.537
You know, I smoke all day
every day,

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:35.340
and I manage to get
some things done.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.676
You know, any time
you get really high,

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:41.713
you're either ...
you get ambitious,

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:43.882
but you might be
ambitious to do nothing.

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:46.785
You might be like,
"I'm really going to hunker down

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:49.622
and not get up right now."
You know?

00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.358
If I don't have plans
throughout the day,

00:14:53.358 --> 00:14:54.793
if I have a totally free day,

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.428
and the first thing
I do is get high,

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.097
then I'll spend
the next 3-4 hours

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:00.099
trying to figure out
what the fuck to do.

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.568
I end up not doing
anything productive.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.570
It's like walking around
in a Blockbuster video store,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.506
and then walking out
without picking a movie,

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.407
because you just
can't settle on anything.

00:15:09.407 --> 00:15:11.109
Yes, but if you have a plan and
you get high, you can execute.

00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:12.544
When I have stuff to do all day,

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.279
I can just get high in
between the things,

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.582
and just be high
and do the things I need to do.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.951 align:start position:0%
That's sort of what props me up.
I joke around about how like,

00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:21.920
I like to take pictures of fans
after the shows,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.088
because they're holding me up.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.489
Yes.

00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:26.224
I put my arms around them,
and like,

00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:27.959
thanks for holding me up
for a few minutes,

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:30.862
while your friend figures out
how to work a fucking camera.

00:15:30.862 --> 00:15:34.132
I mean, that's the other ...
have you noticed the thing of

00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:35.834
when people take pictures
after shows,

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:39.104
how rude some of the people
that ...

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.839
you want to like your fans,

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:43.274
and then they're so rude
to the guy taking pictures.

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.076
Who's not being paid to do it,
I mean,

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:47.412
except we're tipping them at
the end of the week or whatever.

00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:48.747
They don't know that.

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.448
This person's
just taking pictures,

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:52.451
and they go, "It's blurry.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.152
Do you not know
how to work an iPhone?"

00:15:54.152 --> 00:15:55.887
And I go, "I hate you now,

00:15:55.887 --> 00:15:58.190
and I don't want to take
a second picture."

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:01.726
So often, I think
a lot of people are assholes.

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:02.961
Oh, yeah.

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.696
It surprises me how many women,

00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:06.931
it's usually women
that are like,

00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:08.500
"I look disgusting in this.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.536
Have you ever taken
a picture before?"

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:13.805
And hands it back to them. I go,
"Don't talk to him that way.

00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:15.007
You're not paying him."

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.174
I push for selfies.

00:16:16.174 --> 00:16:17.676
Selfies are so good.

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.010
When somebody walks up,
"Can I get a picture?"

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.145
I go, "If it's a selfie, yes."

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.446
Yes.
Let's do it.

00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:22.881
Yes.

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.049
Yeah, because then
you can see it. There's no-

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.483
If they're all shaky,

00:16:25.483 --> 00:16:26.985
I just grab it
and do it myself, you know?

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.454
Dude, selfies.
I can't agree with you more.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:29.788
People always shit on selfies,
like,

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.589
"Oh, are you taking a selfie?"

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:33.892
I'm like, it's the most
efficient way to take a picture.

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.560
What's the alternative?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.929
Handing it to someone and
bothering someone to take it?

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.165
It's a better picture,
because it's this-

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.800
You're seeing it. Yes.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.967
It's the faces.
You're selling the faces.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:44.769
It's better.

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:46.404
Unless they're wearing like
a Dancing With the Stars outfit

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:47.439
or something,
you don't need the body.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.740
I don't need the body.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.676
People take pictures from so far
back,

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.445
and then cameras also still,
the camera phones like iPhones,

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.581
everything still looks further
away than it actually is.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.814
Yeah.

00:16:56.814 --> 00:16:58.149
You could be in the front row
at a concert

00:16:58.149 --> 00:16:59.785
and want to post a picture,

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.686
and it looks like
you're sitting so far away.

00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:03.188
Yeah, I was just at a basketball
game where that happened.

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.422
I was like,
"Look how close I am!"

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:06.124
It looks like I'm-

00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:07.359
Then you try to use the zoom,
and you get a blurrier picture.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.060
Yeah. It's so weird.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.529
Oh, have you ever tried to take
a picture of a full moon?

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.332
Is there anything more
disappointing than a full-

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.300
So you are back
on the weed train.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:18.370
Oh, yeah.

00:17:19.904 --> 00:17:21.473
That is not a sober thought.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.709
Either that, or you're
a werewolf with a hobby.

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:28.713
"Damn, I can't get a picture
of the full moon!

00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:31.316
I don't have opposable thumbs!

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:32.484
Oh, my God.

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.052
Somebody take this for me.

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:35.554
Every time it happens.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:38.657
I seriously ... yeah, selfies,

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.159
I am so on board
with selfies after shows.

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:42.760
It's so much quicker and easier,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.096
and passing the phone off
to another person.

00:17:45.096 --> 00:17:48.533
The person takes it, and it's a
phone they've never used before.

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:49.968
They've got to figure it out.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.370
Then they go to go,
"One, two, three ..."

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.872
Just do it.

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.740
I always tell the guy,
just take it right away.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.709
They also drill it.
Sometimes they'll drill it,

00:17:57.709 --> 00:18:00.212
so they've got 12 pictures
of you with your eyes closed

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.846
and three with your eyes open.

00:18:01.846 --> 00:18:03.548
Guess which one
they're going to use?

00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:05.717
For me, the one where
I look the most stoned.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:06.919
Of course.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.453
Yes. They never tag you.

00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:12.324
I take 1000 pictures a weekend
and two people tag me.

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:13.858
I go, "Why did you
even want this?"

00:18:13.858 --> 00:18:16.428
I always tell people to, also.
I do too. Tag me.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.162
Then they have to like,
look you up and stuff.

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:19.531
They never do it.

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.132
Oh, I was at the theater
yesterday,

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:23.235
and before the curtain came up,

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:27.572
this young couple, a man
and a woman came up to me.

00:18:27.572 --> 00:18:29.374
She was like,
"Can we get a selfie with you?"

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:31.309
Sorry to bother you, I know
we're at the theater, whatever.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:32.578
I'm like, "No problem."

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:34.580
So, I stand up
and we take a selfie.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.315
Then this lady comes up.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.951
"My daughter's mad at me,
because I want a picture too.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.419
I don't know who you are,

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:41.853
but I want a picture
because she got one,

00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:43.888
but now she's not
talking to me."

00:18:43.888 --> 00:18:47.059
Snap, then she takes
the picture.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.161
I watch her go back over
and sit near her daughter.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.062
Her daughter's just like
refusing to speak to her.

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:53.432
Like, "Why do you have
to embarrass me like that?"

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.833
It's so funny that she needed
a picture,

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.834
and she doesn't know
who you are.

00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:58.236
Yeah, "I don't know who you are,
but my daughter got a picture,

00:18:58.236 --> 00:19:00.138
so I need one too."

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.475
Doug, if people want to get high
with you or get you high ...

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.176
because I think
that's a thing.

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:06.778
If you're a Doug Benson fan,
your dream is like,

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.480
"I want to smoke weed
with Doug Benson.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.248
I want to get him high.
I want to roll him a-"

00:19:10.248 --> 00:19:13.518
Isn't that a great rocket,
that that's people dream

00:19:13.518 --> 00:19:15.820
to give me weed
and smoke with me?

00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:17.723
Its their bucket list shit.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.424
It's not an exaggeration.

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:22.460
It is a true dream
of potheads, to do that.

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:25.430
I've seen it happen,
and I can only imagine

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.400
it's gotten even more
so over the years.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.101
What is the best way
for them to do that?

00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:32.937
What is the most efficient way
for someone to get you high

00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:35.507
and have an experience with you?
To not be annoying,

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:36.975
and to walk away
with you being like,

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:38.677
"Oh, that guy was a good guy."

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.379
Just be standing next to me,
is what I like to say.

00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:43.015
If you want to get me
to smoke with you.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.083
Unless we're like,
in an airport or something,

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.085
then we can't do it.

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:49.554
If I'm anywhere where we can
get away with it,

00:19:49.554 --> 00:19:51.122
I'll smoke with anybody.

00:19:51.122 --> 00:19:53.358
What kind of conversation
do you want to avoid?

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:56.161
What kind of questions have you
been asked too many times?

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:58.063
How can we make this experience
the best for you?

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.864
I want to hang.
I don't want to interview.

00:19:59.864 --> 00:20:01.233
Yes.

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:02.867
When a fan comes up
and just starts asking ...

00:20:02.867 --> 00:20:04.602
if they ask about
something specific,

00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:06.838
like that I never hear about,
or that, "Oh yeah,

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:09.541
this is kind of a fun thing
to tell you the answer to."

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.610
That's fine,
but a lot of times it's just,

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:17.282
"Where you going next?"
They just, it's very generic.

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:20.452
I'm like, just go look
at my Twitter.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.921
I talk about that all the time.

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:27.525
Let's have a real conversation.
I'm just up for ...

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:29.126
that's the great thing
about smoking pot too,

00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:32.197
is that you can get
a bunch of fans at once.

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:33.865
We're all in a big circle,

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.801
and then I can say things
that make everybody laugh,

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.336
and they feel like they're
getting an extra performance.
