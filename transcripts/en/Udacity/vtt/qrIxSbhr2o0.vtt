00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.819
If we're talking about complex systems,

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.150
these systems may run on different processing units. And

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.090
we'd like to convey the configuration of the run-time processing units, and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.970
their component instances in a way, that sees how they can interact. And

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.890
this is, included inside a UML deployment diagram.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.790
A node in the diagram will correspond to a computational device, and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.340
the arcs indicate some kind of communication.
