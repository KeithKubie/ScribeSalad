00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I'll never
forget. So, outside,

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.508 align:start size:88% position:13%
he takes me aside before
we get into the rooms

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
and he goes, "here's
300 dollars. Have fun...

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.746
and I want you to get a hooker".

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.181
And I go... "yes, papa".

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.451
(electric dance music)

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.144
- Here's the show.
It's very simple.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.345
Just a bunch of funny people

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.047 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are all telling
true stories.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.783 align:start position:0%
Please give a warm round of
applause to Mr. Barry Rothbart!

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.786
(audience clapping)

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.689
- You know I don't talk
about my family a lot.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.893
A lot of people ask me
how I'm so good at sex

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.262
(audience laughing)

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.663
and it's true. A lot
of people are like,

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start size:88% position:13%
"we're big fans, we know
your hips don't lie",

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
but it's cause I learned about
it a lot from a young age.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.475
To give you a little background,

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.978
I was a fucking strange kid.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.780
I was a fat kid.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.016
I had a ponytail,

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.518 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wore huge
hand-me-down glasses,

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.788 align:start size:84% position:16%
and really right
members-only jackets.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:32.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
So at the age of nine,
I was a pedophile.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.228
I was a nine-year-old pedophile.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.130
I did pedophile things.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.398
I couldn't play with other kids.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.467
I would stand at the
edge of playgrounds.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.535
Watching other kids play.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.772
I was a fucking weird kid!

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.774
I didn't realize it,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.042
but for a lot of my childhood--

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.610
you know, you get
to that point where

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.347
you realize your parents
are just fucking weirdos?

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.183 align:start size:84% position:16%
They are just
people that we know.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.986
They shit--

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.154
You know,

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.123 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's the only example
I could think of.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.791
(audience laughing)

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.327
But I found out at some point--

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:08.461
This is pretty crazy.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.897
But my dad was a...

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.765
degenerate gambler,

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:16.936 align:start position:0%
he was a bookie for the Gambino
crime family in New York,

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.471
one of the biggest bookies.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.641
If you were in the Gambino
crime family in the 90's,

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.544
that was the fucking crime
family you wanted to be in.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.012
I don't want to brag,

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.983 align:start size:97% position:3%
but that was like the Michael
Jordan of crime families.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.918
So I didn't know
that for a while,

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.554
but my dad had this
whole criminal life.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:97% position:3%
I started to find out
because, for my whole life,

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.093
he lied to me and said he
was a "Music Producer".

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.028
Which is a strange lie,

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.731
cause that's something you
brag to your friends about.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.333
If he was an accountant,
he's just another dude.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.868 align:start size:88% position:13%
But I was like, "my
dad's a Music Producer".

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.336 align:start size:84% position:16%
He would make
these strange lies.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.705 align:start position:0%
He would be like, "hey, I could
get you Bon Jovi tickets",

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.007
and I'd tell my friends,

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.275
"hey, we could get
Bon Jovi tickets".

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.310
And he would be like,
"couldn't get 'em".

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.811
What!

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.747
Just don't say anything!

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.017 align:start size:88% position:13%
But he was a decent
dad, he was a good dad.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.719 align:start size:97% position:3%
We had a decent relationship,
and I wanted to be him.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.721
When I figured out what he
did and he was a criminal,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.990
I wanted that lifestyle.
"The Sopranos" was on T.V.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
This was a cool time
to be a criminal.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.728
For my 18th birthday,

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:19.465
he decides to take
me to Atlantic City.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.935
He gets myself and my
friend, Ben, a room,

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.436
and he gets the room next to us.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.339
Because when you gamble
away your family's money,

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
they give you free
rooms in Atlantic City.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.945
I'll never forget.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.013
Outside, he takes me aside
before we get into the rooms

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start size:88% position:13%
and he goes, "here's
300 dollars. Have fun...

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.985
and I want you to get a hooker".

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.353
This is for my 18th birthday.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.854
"I want you to get a hooker",

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.856
and I go... "yes, papa".

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.728
"Papa, yes papa".

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.064
This was in the late 1800's.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.400
I go, "papa, yes.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.535
I will do that for you.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:56.803
Hooker".

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.605
Then there was a list
of two other things,

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.908 align:start size:97% position:3%
as if hooker wasn't the
most interesting part of it.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.310 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was just like, "and there's
an arcade downstairs!".

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was like, "you
just said "hooker"!".

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.815 align:start size:94% position:6%
But he had gotten so
many hookers in his life,

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.383
he didn't even realize
it was a weird thing.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.385
And I go, "of course
I'll get a hooker".

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.787 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then I go into the room where
my friend Ben is waiting

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.623
and I go, "Ben, we're
going to get a hooker".

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:20.226
And he looks at me and goes,
"how does one get a hooker?".

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.795
I go, "I don't know!".

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:26.099
That's where this story
starts to get weird.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, we decide to get
all hooker-ready.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.172
We're putting cologne on.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.108
We're putting on suits.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.779 align:start size:97% position:3%
As if a hooker would be
like, "they dress too well!".

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.148 align:start size:84% position:16%
We were getting all
ready and it's six pm.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're going to go downstairs
and find a hooker.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.453 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't know if you've
ever been to Atlantic City,

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.290 align:start size:81% position:19%
but everyone looks
like a hooker.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.225
(audience laughing)

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.493
Everyone's a hooker!

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.228
Men, women, children.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:59.098
They're some slot machines that
looked like fucking hookers.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.767
We're just like, "I don't
know how to do this!".

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.135
So then we come
up with the idea:

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.037 align:start size:84% position:16%
let's get drunk
and smoke some pot.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.173
So we go upstairs and we got
drunk, we smoked some pot,

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.442
and then we're like, "let's
just open the yellow pages".

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
Right? It'll
probably be in there.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.245 align:start size:88% position:13%
We look under hooker...
Nothing!

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.914 align:start size:97% position:3%
We look under prostitute...
Nothing!

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.549
Then we get to "escort",

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.651
and there's a bunch
of photos of hookers.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we call one up
and the woman answers

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.258
and she goes, "hey,
what do you need?".

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.959 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're like, "Do
you have hookers?".

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.995
(audience laughing)

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:33.199
And she goes, "uh, no.
We have escorts, though".

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.703 align:start size:88% position:13%
We go, "is that the
same thing as hookers?".

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.204
She goes, "yeah!".

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.909
Yep, that's pretty much it!

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.410 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we're like, "oh yeah,
we would love one",

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.745
and she goes, "what height?".

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.513
We're like, "medium".

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.718
She's like, "what about boobs?".

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.087
We're like, "yeah,
we'd love boobs!".

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
What do you have,
girls with no boobs?

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.224
I don't want those girls!

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:01.828
Keep your weird no-boob
girls to yourselves!

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.899
We're feeling like the man,

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.434
"So you going to send her?",

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.870
and she says, "yeah, it's a
hundred an hour per person".

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.874
We're like, "cool, we share
a hooker. That's awesome".

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.076 align:start size:94% position:6%
She was like, "okay,
we're sending a girl over"

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.945 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I hung up the phone.
I'll never forget.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.146
At the point I was like,

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.182 align:start size:84% position:16%
"oh fuck! We're
getting a hooker!".

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.719 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't know. How many people
here have gotten hookers?

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.621
Cool! One honest dude.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.256
You guys are liars!

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.125
(audience clapping)

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.393
Are you clapping for him

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.429
or the concept of me
asking someone that?

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.464
So, it's a weird--

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.433
There's going to
be a human being

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.901
that's going to come to the door

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.870
and be like, "fuck me!".

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
I guess that's not
exactly how it happens,

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.040
but that's how I pictured it.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're like, "we
should get higher",

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.512 align:start position:0%
which is a strange decision
for when a hooker's on the way.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.747 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we get higher and
I'm getting to the point

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:58.918
where I'm afraid of things.
Like I'm afraid of furniture.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:02.088
I'm hiding behind a table.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.224 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like, "this is
going to be so weird!".

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.827
Then finally, I'm
perched on a couch

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.229
and there's a knock at the door.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.697
My friend's like,

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.800
"I'll take care of this",
and he opens the door.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'll never forget what was
standing outside of that door.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:20.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can only describe
this woman as--

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.642
Picture your mother's friends.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:24.877
That's it.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.449
She was just shapes!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.217
She was an older woman!

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:32.718
My friend closed the
door and comes here.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.621
He's like, "what do we do?
What do we do about this?".

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.357
I was like, "I don't know,
man! I'm freaking out!".

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:41.060
My mom's friend Carla
is standing out there.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.595
I don't know what to do!

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.997
So we're huddling and he
looked at me and goes,

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.767
"I'll take care of this",
and he goes to the door,

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:50.703
opens the door, looks this
hooker dead in the eyes,

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:54.173 align:start size:88% position:13%
and just goes, "this
isn't what we ordered!".

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.341
Like a pizza!

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.679
Like, "anchovies? Nope!

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.481
That's not what we wanted".

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.749
I was like, "What a badass!".

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.618
She just looked at him and went,

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:09.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
"okay, give me two minutes".
And she walked away.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.592 align:start size:88% position:13%
We were like, "what
now? Where does this go?

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.294
There's a level
two to this game?

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.330
I thought the game was over!".

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.433
There's another knock at
the door and we open it.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
This woman--
Compared to the first one,

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.539
like a real fox, but still
wasn't attractive at all.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.141 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know when someone's
hot at the DMV?

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.676
They're DMV hot.

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.045
It's, like, compared to
everyone around them.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:35.481
Like, "yeah, she's attractive!".

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.682
She just walked in--

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
She just stepped right
in and she's like,

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.852
"hey guys, what's going on?".

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:44.090
We're like, "oh hey!", and we
just had a bottle of Vermouth.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.493
We gave her a shot of Vermouth.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.728
We're like, "hey, what's up?

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.029
Yeah, we're just
a bunch of dudes".

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:53.032
We look like old
men from the 70's.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're wearing loafers
with no socks.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.706 align:start size:94% position:6%
She was like, "what do you
guys do for a living?",

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:04.777
and I go, "I'm a Camera
Man for The Daily Show!".

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:10.182
Then my friend goes,
"I'm a Zoologist!".

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.184
You could use Zoologist?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.621
I'm talking about a union job.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:19.492 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're talking about
saving penguins?

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:21.928
You know, what Zoologists do!

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
She's like, "oh cool", and
we're like, "what do you do?",

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.299
she's like, "I'm an architect".

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.700
We're like, "yeah, right".

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.535
(audience laughing)

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:30.803
So she's sipping her Vermouth

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.940
and then she shows us a
picture of her daughter.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.310
We're like, "Oh no!

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.845
This is too weird now.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.447
This is so strange!".

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.049 align:start size:81% position:19%
So we're like, "we
can't do this",

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.550
and we have another huddle.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.255 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're just standing there,
huddled, talking again.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.656 align:start size:94% position:6%
My friend's like, "I
can't have sex with her",

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.158
and I'm like, "I can't either.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.961
I wasn't just going to
do it if you weren't!".

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.296 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm like, "I think
I have an idea

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.966
how to get us out of this".

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.469
I leave the room, and I don't
know if you guys have fathers,

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:08.074 align:start size:97% position:3%
but there's a moment where
you really bond with your dad.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.810 align:start size:97% position:3%
I went over to my dad's
room. I knocked on his door.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.345
I'll never forget.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.145
He opened the door and he
goes, "What is it, son?",

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:14.480
and I go, "Papa.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.819
Papa, I have a problem.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.390
There's a prostitute in my room.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.058
She's DMV hot and...

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't want to
have sex with her".

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.696 align:start size:81% position:19%
He looked me in
the eyes, he goes,

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.199
"Don't worry, I'll
take care of this...

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.767
Send her to my room".

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:38.104
(audience laughing)

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.505
And I did!

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:41.974
And I spent the
rest of the night

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:45.344
listening to my dad have
sex with a prostitute.

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:49.548
I remember thinking, "I'm
going to be a weird adult".

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.983
Thank you guys very much!

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:54.320
(electric dance music)
