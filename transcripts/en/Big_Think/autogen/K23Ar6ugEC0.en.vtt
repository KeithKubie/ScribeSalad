voluntary early retirement program

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
voluntary early retirement program

followed by a reduction in force program
 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.040

and some painful decisions had to be

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
and some painful decisions had to be
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.630
and some painful decisions had to be
taken at that time it was quite

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
taken at that time it was quite
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.380
taken at that time it was quite
understandable to the rest of the

colleagues in the company that these

colleagues in the company that these
these reductions made sense because the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310
these reductions made sense because the
 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.150
these reductions made sense because the
company was bleeding cash and losing

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
company was bleeding cash and losing

sales later on we had another challenge
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.360
sales later on we had another challenge
in a company and we had to reduce costs

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
in a company and we had to reduce costs
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.270
in a company and we had to reduce costs
further and at that time to when the

action was announced the logic was
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.740
action was announced the logic was
pretty clear to the people that that was

reductions are made that they be made as

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
reductions are made that they be made as
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590
reductions are made that they be made as
early as possible and with as much

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
early as possible and with as much
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.040
early as possible and with as much

explanation as possible and then and
 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.230
explanation as possible and then and
then one has to go beyond it and when

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
then one has to go beyond it and when
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120
then one has to go beyond it and when
the reductions are actually made they

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
the reductions are actually made they
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.460
the reductions are actually made they
should be done as fairly as possible so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
should be done as fairly as possible so
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.640
should be done as fairly as possible so
that those colleagues who are exited

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
that those colleagues who are exited
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.730
that those colleagues who are exited
there's a good sense among the ones who

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
there's a good sense among the ones who
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.969
there's a good sense among the ones who
remain why certain decisions had to be

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
remain why certain decisions had to be
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.290
remain why certain decisions had to be
taken

I first came and certain exits occurred
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.050
I first came and certain exits occurred
a lot of the exits among senior

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060
a lot of the exits among senior

management had to do with the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
management had to do with the
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.410
management had to do with the
willingness of people to adopt a more

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420
willingness of people to adopt a more
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.020
willingness of people to adopt a more
flexible mindset because this company

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
flexible mindset because this company
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.790
flexible mindset because this company
was going to go down a transformation

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
was going to go down a transformation
 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.130
was going to go down a transformation
road and those that would have

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140
road and those that would have
 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.460
road and those that would have
difficulty accepting that concept

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470
difficulty accepting that concept
 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.930
difficulty accepting that concept
probably should go somewhere else so

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940
probably should go somewhere else so
 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.540
probably should go somewhere else so
that became a factor in the discussion

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550
that became a factor in the discussion
 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.930
that became a factor in the discussion
at that point when one does a reduction

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940
at that point when one does a reduction
 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.170
at that point when one does a reduction
in headcount under cyclical

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.010
circumstances or unexpected
circumstances then in many cases whole

circumstances then in many cases whole
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.120

departments get shut down or whole sales

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
departments get shut down or whole sales
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.130

divisions get restructured in which case

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140
divisions get restructured in which case

divisions get restructured in which case
you might have different groups of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
you might have different groups of
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.640
you might have different groups of
people leaving the company quite

people leaving the company quite

now the hiring decision is very

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710
now the hiring decision is very
 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.650
now the hiring decision is very
important and nobody has a perfect

important and nobody has a perfect

higher then of course the productivity

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
higher then of course the productivity
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.110
higher then of course the productivity
goes up dramatically when I look at

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
goes up dramatically when I look at
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.680
goes up dramatically when I look at
people I do look at a few basics first

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
people I do look at a few basics first

people I do look at a few basics first
the first thing I always look for is the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490
the first thing I always look for is the
 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.550
the first thing I always look for is the
attitude you can always train people on

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
attitude you can always train people on
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.140

skills you can give people special
 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300
skills you can give people special
courses but you can't give special

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
courses but you can't give special
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.340
courses but you can't give special
courses an attitude that's something

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350
courses an attitude that's something

that comes from from from within if

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
that comes from from from within if
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.890
that comes from from from within if
people have a positive outlook to life

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
people have a positive outlook to life
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.600
people have a positive outlook to life
if people are anxious to work in a team

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610
if people are anxious to work in a team
 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.630
if people are anxious to work in a team
environment if people are anxious I want

environment if people are anxious I want

to see the colleagues around them

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110
to see the colleagues around them
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.680
to see the colleagues around them
succeed those are people with the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
succeed those are people with the
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.960
succeed those are people with the
attitude that will do better than those

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
attitude that will do better than those
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060
attitude that will do better than those
that are too self-oriented and that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
that are too self-oriented and that
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.460
that are too self-oriented and that
starts to become pretty obvious after

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470
starts to become pretty obvious after
 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.650
starts to become pretty obvious after
you've asked a few questions whether a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
you've asked a few questions whether a
 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.410
you've asked a few questions whether a
person is more an outside individual or

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420
person is more an outside individual or
 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.690
person is more an outside individual or
a self individual the other thing you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700
a self individual the other thing you
 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.090
a self individual the other thing you
look for is the fire in the belly is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100
look for is the fire in the belly is
 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.220
look for is the fire in the belly is
there a passion is there a desire to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
there a passion is there a desire to
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.800
there a passion is there a desire to
learn is there a desire to grow is there

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
learn is there a desire to grow is there
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.650
learn is there a desire to grow is there
a curiosity that that's going to get

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
a curiosity that that's going to get
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.890
a curiosity that that's going to get
people to new places again it's an

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900
people to new places again it's an
 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.289
people to new places again it's an
instinctive assessment that you make

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299
instinctive assessment that you make
 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.800
instinctive assessment that you make
after you've seen a lot of people and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
after you've seen a lot of people and
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.210
after you've seen a lot of people and
finally you look for people who will

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
finally you look for people who will
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.180
finally you look for people who will
have the ability to learn absorb and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190
have the ability to learn absorb and
 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.300
have the ability to learn absorb and
drove sometimes people may not become

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
drove sometimes people may not become
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.390
drove sometimes people may not become
competent in their own areas and that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
competent in their own areas and that
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.120
competent in their own areas and that
probably will then not allow them to be

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130
probably will then not allow them to be
 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.160
probably will then not allow them to be
very good if you're trying to hire a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170
very good if you're trying to hire a
 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.259
very good if you're trying to hire a
good research scientist in

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269
good research scientist in
 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.569
good research scientist in
pharmaceuticals and they don't seem to

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579
pharmaceuticals and they don't seem to
 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.180
pharmaceuticals and they don't seem to
have the ability to be a strong research

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190
have the ability to be a strong research
 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.010
have the ability to be a strong research
scientist then they may have the right

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
scientist then they may have the right
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.630
scientist then they may have the right
attitude and the fire in the belly but

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640
attitude and the fire in the belly but
 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.800
attitude and the fire in the belly but
they're not going to be very successful
