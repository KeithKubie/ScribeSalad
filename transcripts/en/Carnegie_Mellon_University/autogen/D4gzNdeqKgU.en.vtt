people are understanding that robot

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040
people are understanding that robot
 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.340
people are understanding that robot
systems don't exist in a vacuum that our

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350
systems don't exist in a vacuum that our
 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.650
systems don't exist in a vacuum that our
robots regardless of what they do are

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
robots regardless of what they do are
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.630
robots regardless of what they do are
going to have to interact with humans at

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640
going to have to interact with humans at
 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.160
going to have to interact with humans at
the end of the day these advances that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170
the end of the day these advances that
 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.660
the end of the day these advances that
we're seeing in computer vision where

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670
we're seeing in computer vision where
 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.460
we're seeing in computer vision where
we're able to very very rapidly detect

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470
we're able to very very rapidly detect
 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.040
we're able to very very rapidly detect
people's facial expressions or people's

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050
people's facial expressions or people's
 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.050
people's facial expressions or people's
body posture through things like open

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
body posture through things like open
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.290
body posture through things like open
pose have enabled our systems to get the

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300
pose have enabled our systems to get the
 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.120
pose have enabled our systems to get the
data that they need in order to

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
data that they need in order to
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.670
data that they need in order to
interpret human social behavior and then

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680
interpret human social behavior and then
 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.860
interpret human social behavior and then
on the human robot interaction side all

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870
on the human robot interaction side all
 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.569
on the human robot interaction side all
of these you know many studies coming

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579
of these you know many studies coming
 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.830
of these you know many studies coming
out that are trying to understand how

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840
out that are trying to understand how
 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.450
out that are trying to understand how
people interact with robots in various

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460
people interact with robots in various
 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.939
people interact with robots in various
ways and how robots can interpret human

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949
ways and how robots can interpret human
 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.889
ways and how robots can interpret human
behavior and use their own social

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899
behavior and use their own social
 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.049
behavior and use their own social
behavior to improve the interactions

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059
behavior to improve the interactions
 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.049
behavior to improve the interactions
between human and robot and so on the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059
between human and robot and so on the
 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.569
between human and robot and so on the
production and understanding side the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579
production and understanding side the
 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.069
production and understanding side the
human robot interaction research is

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079
human robot interaction research is
 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.569
human robot interaction research is
going to play a big part my vision for

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579
going to play a big part my vision for
 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.189
going to play a big part my vision for
the future is that technology has a

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199
the future is that technology has a
 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.020
the future is that technology has a
positive impact we have to answer

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030
positive impact we have to answer
 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.150
positive impact we have to answer
questions about how our technology could

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160
questions about how our technology could
 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860
questions about how our technology could
be used for good and could be used for

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870
be used for good and could be used for
 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.110
be used for good and could be used for
bad and how we can aim our technological

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120
bad and how we can aim our technological
 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.140
bad and how we can aim our technological
advances toward positive impact in the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150
advances toward positive impact in the
 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.899
advances toward positive impact in the
world I think this really means that we

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
world I think this really means that we
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.700
world I think this really means that we
need to be multidisciplinary need to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
need to be multidisciplinary need to
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.859
need to be multidisciplinary need to
pull in lawyers and policy makers and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
pull in lawyers and policy makers and
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.499
pull in lawyers and policy makers and
people from social sciences and we also

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509
people from social sciences and we also
 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.630
people from social sciences and we also
need to pull in people from technology

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640
need to pull in people from technology
 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.730
need to pull in people from technology
who understand the capabilities of these

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740
who understand the capabilities of these
 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.109
who understand the capabilities of these
systems and understand what's even

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119
systems and understand what's even
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.600
systems and understand what's even
possible to talk about in in terms of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610
possible to talk about in in terms of
 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:37.600
possible to talk about in in terms of
the societal impact

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 
 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.670
