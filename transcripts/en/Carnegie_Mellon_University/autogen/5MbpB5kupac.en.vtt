the idea of using data for analysis and

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
the idea of using data for analysis and
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.220
the idea of using data for analysis and
statistical analysis is pervasive it's

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
statistical analysis is pervasive it's
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.039
statistical analysis is pervasive it's
it's everywhere now so there's quite a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
it's everywhere now so there's quite a
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.770
it's everywhere now so there's quite a
bit of excitement about the topic and we

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
bit of excitement about the topic and we
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.480
bit of excitement about the topic and we
will have students at a very young age

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
will have students at a very young age
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.850
will have students at a very young age
now contact our department and ask about

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
now contact our department and ask about
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.799
now contact our department and ask about
majoring in statistics this did not

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
majoring in statistics this did not
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.849
majoring in statistics this did not
happen 10-15 years ago with respect to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
happen 10-15 years ago with respect to
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500
happen 10-15 years ago with respect to
the Carnegie Mellon programs in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
the Carnegie Mellon programs in
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.929
the Carnegie Mellon programs in
particular the curriculum is designed to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
particular the curriculum is designed to
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.040
particular the curriculum is designed to
give students a taste and experience of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
give students a taste and experience of
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540
give students a taste and experience of
what it would be like to do statistics

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
what it would be like to do statistics
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.250
what it would be like to do statistics
and data science in the real world and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
and data science in the real world and
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.870
and data science in the real world and
as such we take problems that are real

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880
as such we take problems that are real
 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.100
as such we take problems that are real
interdisciplinary research problems

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

industry problems and government

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
industry problems and government
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.080
industry problems and government
problems from all over and we put them

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
problems from all over and we put them
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299
problems from all over and we put them
straight into the classroom so it's we

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
straight into the classroom so it's we
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.389
straight into the classroom so it's we
don't actually use a lot of textbooks

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399
don't actually use a lot of textbooks
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.090
don't actually use a lot of textbooks
after the introductory level we also

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100
after the introductory level we also
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.490
after the introductory level we also
incorporate research almost at all the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
incorporate research almost at all the
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830
incorporate research almost at all the
levels it's possible to be a freshman

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

diverse set of backgrounds with all of
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.569
diverse set of backgrounds with all of
