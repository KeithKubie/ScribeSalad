00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 Hairdressers usually cut by 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.700
 one side and then cut by the other and that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.660
 there will always always be a side 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 different from the other because it is very little 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.860
 the only way they have is exactly 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 just as a mathematical precision is 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.000
 cut both at once and as you can 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.559
 do that as you can cut two sides to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.559
 the time you would need 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.189
 yes 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.590
 with the use of tools practically 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 primitive fire spades 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.400
 little more than medieval, so it's not 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.920
 say that everything is with a little bit of 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.420
 imagination sometimes you have to put it because 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 your imagination and that are the results 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.280
 positives 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.280
 yes 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 ah
