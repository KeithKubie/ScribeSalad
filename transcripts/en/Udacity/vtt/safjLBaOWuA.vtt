00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This strange expression appeared in our equation for heat conduction along the wire.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, we look into its mathematical meaning.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The scary name for this topic is central difference formulas for derivatives.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is about determining the derivative, that means the slope of the tangent of functions

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that are based on empirical data, measurements,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and now your approach to determine the slope of this function at this point

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
would be to look a little further to the right, determine another point of that function there,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then connect this point to our original point and you can see that this doesn't really work well

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but we want to determine the derivative of our function namely the slope of the tangent.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The simple trick is to go a little to the left and a little to the right.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Determine the points of the function, left and right and then connect these.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To be clear, this works far better. Now we can write down some equations.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That's Δx stand for the total distance from left to right. Δ always is denoting the difference.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The estimate for the slope would be what we gain in height divided by how far we went to the right.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The denominator is simple, Δx is how far we went to the right. The numerator is a little more complex.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's the difference of this value of the function minus that value of the function.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's what we are gaining in height, so it's our function on the right-hand side, f(x₀ + Δx/2)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
from x₀, we are moving by half of this distance to the right

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
plus Δx/2 minus the value of the function on the left-hand side f(x₀ -Δx/2)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that go into the left by half of the distance minus.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now you can get an idea about why this is called central difference.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Obviously, it's a difference and the difference is centered at x₀.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we're moving as much to the right as we're moving to the left.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, we're going to apply the same formula to the second derivative.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The rate of change of the rate of change, and think acceleration.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We simply use this formula not for the original function, but for its derivative.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You replace f by f' wherever you find an f. So this f becomes an f'.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This f becomes an f' and this f becomes an f'. Prime, the second derivative.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But now we can use our original formula for these derivatives. This is going to get a little long.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
When estimating this first derivative, we get an expression with denominator Δx

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and in the numerator, we got the following.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We are moving to the right by Δx/2, so we're ending with f(x₀+Δx).

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We are moving one further Δx/2 to the right minus we are moving Δx/2 to the left

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which means this is f(x₀) and now for this derivative.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We are moving by Δx/2 to the right minus Δx/2 + Δx/2, canceled.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So this becomes f(x₀) minus now we have to move by Δx/2 to the left which becomes f(x₀ - Δx)/Δx.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's now collect what we have found in total, we are dividing by (Δx)²

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and in the numerator, we've got plus the value one step to the left plus the value one step to the right

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
minus twice the value at our original position.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So what originally appeared in our equation,

00:03:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
T7 + T9 -2(T8) is 1 mm² plus the second derivative of the distribution of the temperature.
