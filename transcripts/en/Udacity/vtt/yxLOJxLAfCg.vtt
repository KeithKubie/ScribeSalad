00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The fast module exponentiation technique used in lecture suffers from an important security flaw.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The time it takes to execute depends on the value of the power,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which may be secret.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This means an attacker who can measure precisely how long encryption takes

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
can learn something about this key.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Assuming a simple model of computation,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
where modulus and multiplication by 1 or 2 is free, which costs essentially nothing,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but all other multiplications cost 1 unit of time,

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which of the following module exponentiations would take the longest?
