00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:02.788
Hi my name is Morey Aldeeb.

00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:04.188
I was born in Egypt.

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:05.648
Worked on a farm til third grade

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:08.048
and then I came with my family to the USA.

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:10.868
And I continued working and also going

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:13.504
to school since we had to.

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:15.184
But working full time didn't

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:17.124
make school go well.

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:18.424
I was mostly sleeping,

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:20.124
and I wasn't doing well at all.

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.564
And that continued that same

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:23.344
exact way til eighth grade.

00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:25.104
And my family was also in the middle

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:26.464
going back and forth between

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:27.864
Egypt and here and nobody had

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:29.584
decided yet exactly what we were doing.

00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:31.484
But then when high school started,

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.424
two weeks in, my house burned.

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.064
And I was like, that's it for school.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:38.124
There's no way it's
gonna work out anymore.

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:40.112
But after a year and a
half of being homeless

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:42.392
and in a shelter, my
family was able to move

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:43.838
in some where stable.

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:45.498
And life was getting a little stable so

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.238
I was willing to give
high school another shot

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:49.158
and let's see ya know, if I could really,

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.958
if school would actually work out for me.

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.718
Thank God that I found Khan Academy

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.578
and they had everything that I needed.

00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:57.408
'Cause I needed Pre Pre
Algebra to actually start

00:00:57.408 --> 00:01:00.186
my way and actually be able
to learn at an equal level.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.946
So they had it all for me.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.566
Ya know, they had Pre Algebra and then

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.566
Pre, and then they had
Algebra, and then they

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.166
had the whole path just
set up right there for you.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.026
Where I didn't even have to organize it or

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:11.846
find someone to help me organize it or

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:13.046
figure out what I would do.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.786
And I went down through every video and

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.746
as I learned and I learned then things

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:19.246
were getting easier and
the pace was what I wanted.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.446
It motivated me a lot
that I felt like I could

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:22.536
actually learn.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.256
And I was learning and getting happier.

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:25.726
And things were working out ya know.

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:27.806
And I continued that
same way and that even

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.366
drove in a love for math for me and after

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.346
finishing every video that was there,

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.626
I finished high school
and that year and a half

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.546
I graduated in 11th grade.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:39.466
After finishing the 11th
grade and I went through

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.206
Queens College and I
knew I could learn math

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.486
so I continued learning
math and Khan Academy

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:48.946
was still there for me.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.304
They had Calculus and
they continued through

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:54.124
Statistics and Probability,
and every class that I needed

00:01:54.124 --> 00:01:57.584
to continue to get my,
to do well in math and

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.164
I was able to finish in
my Applied Math degree in

00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:01.784
two and a half years.

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:03.704
And now I'm doing my
second bachelor's here at

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:06.444
Columbia University
after transferring here.
