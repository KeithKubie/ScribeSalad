NARRATOR: So one of the new
emerging kind of information

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.040
technology revolutions
that we're seeing nowadays

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.290
is this idea of
augmented reality.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.060
This notion of taking the
world of everyday perception,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.080
and tweaking it
and augmenting it,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.400
and impregnating perception
with mindedness, with agency,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.320
with aesthetics.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.470
And so how do we do that?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.530
Well, it essentially means that
the information technologies,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.460
the instruments that
we're using today

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.360
to manipulate and
transform the world,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
are now allowing us to overlay
digital information on top

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.345
of the physical world.

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:49.960
They have apps
already, that looking

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.880
through the camera in the app,
you can place virtual elements

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.730
into real environments.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.660
So it's this notion that
you're mapping the real world

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.360
and overlaying agency
information, gamification,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.820
mind, into it.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.904
So what does that mean?

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:06.570
It means that more
and more of the world

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.825
starts to feel re-enchanted.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.491
More and more of the
world can be turned

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.840
into gamified experiences.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.130
There's more cognitive
activity occurring

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.500
in the interface
between self and world

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.837
until self and world become one.

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:24.670
Now I think that that's
where we're heading.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.700
And certainly the idea
of augmenting reality

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310
is part of what it
means to be human.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.900
From the moment that we
started to create architecture,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.150
to put objects in the world,
to make art, to carve tools,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.180
we've been augmenting reality.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.480
So for the digital revolution
to finally catch up to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.400
that is a perfectly
natural emergence.
