00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.166
I had about five minutes
before I was set to deliver a talk

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.593
to a bunch of business owners

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.341
about visibility and being on camera.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:23.252
After all, I was
the so-called expert there,

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:28.380
the former 20-year television news anchor
and life and business coach.

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:32.326
I happened to take a look down
at my cell phone just to catch the time,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.136
and I noticed that I had a missed call
from my ex-husband.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.385
I can still hear his voice.

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:42.279
"Darieth, what is going on?

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:47.818
I just got a call from some strange man
who told me to go to this website,

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:51.651
and now I'm looking at
all of these photos of you naked.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.756
Your private parts
are all over this website.

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:56.488
Who's seen this?"

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.146
I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe.

00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:06.187
I was so humiliated
and so embarrassed and so ashamed.

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.831
I felt like my world was coming to an end.

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:13.680
And yet, this began for me
months of pain and depression

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.104
and anger and confusion and silence.

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:21.446
My manipulative, jealous,
stalker ex-boyfriend

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.604
did exactly what he said he would do:

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:26.264
he put up a website with my name on it,

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:27.893
and he posted this.

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:30.317
And this.

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.371
And several explicit photos

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:35.763
that he had taken of me
while I was asleep,

00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:37.744
living with him in Jamaica.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:40.085
For months prior to that,
he had been sending me

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.529
threatening text messages like this.

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:46.465
He was trying to make me out to be
some sleazy, low-life slut.

00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:49.317
He had even threatened to kill me.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:54.284
He told me that he would shoot me
in my head and stab me in my heart,

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.548
simply because I wanted to end
the controlling relationship.

00:01:58.977 --> 00:02:01.509
I couldn't believe
this was happening to me.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.779
I didn't even know what to call it.

00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:07.452
You might know it as
cyberharassment or cyberbullying.

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:10.188
The media calls it "revenge porn."

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.894
I now call it "digital domestic violence."

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.504
It typically stems from
a relationship gone bad,

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:21.633
where a controlling, jilted ex-lover
can't handle rejection,

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:24.387
so when they can't physically
put their hands on you,

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.188
they use different weapons:
cell phones and laptops.

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:29.371
The ammunition?

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:35.034
Photos, videos, explicit information,
content -- all posted online,

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.677
without your consent.

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:40.323
I mean, let's face it --
we all live our lives online.

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.101
And the internet is a really small world.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.990
We show off our baby photos,

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.847
we start and grow our businesses,
we make new relationships,

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:52.587
we let the world in,
one Facebook like at a time.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:54.839
And you know what I found?

00:02:54.863 --> 00:02:56.330
An even smaller world.

00:02:56.728 --> 00:03:00.942
One in 25 women say
they have been impacted by revenge porn.

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:05.538
For women under the age of 30,
that number looks like one in 10.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.119
And that leaves a few of you
in this audience as potential victims.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.733
You want to know
what's even more alarming?

00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:16.755
Lack of legislation and laws
to adequately protect victims

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.339
and punish perpetrators.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.736
There's only one federal bill pending;

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.877
it's called the ENOUGH Act,
by Senator Kamala Harris.

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:27.417
It would criminalize revenge porn.

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.616
But that could take years to pass.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.670
So what are we left with in the meantime?

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:33.624
Flimsy civil misdemeanors.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:40.132
Currently, only 40 states and DC
have some laws in place for revenge porn.

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:44.037
And those penalties vary --
we're talking $500 fines.

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:45.264
Five hundred dollars?

00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:46.441
Are you kidding me?

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:47.821
Women are losing their jobs.

00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.152
They're suffering
from damaged relationships

00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:51.537
and damaged reputations.

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:54.101
They're falling into illness
and depression.

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.613
And the suicide rates are climbing.

00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:01.992
You're looking at a woman
who spent 11 months in court,

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:04.143
thirteen trips to the courthouse

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.633
and thousands of dollars in legal fees,

00:04:06.657 --> 00:04:08.291
just to get two things:

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:11.212
a protection from cyberstalking
and cyberabuse,

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:13.712
otherwise known as a PFA,

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:14.978
and language from a judge

00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:17.260
that would force a third-party
internet company

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:18.882
to remove the content.

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:23.000
It's expensive, complicated and confusing.

00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:28.470
And worse, legal loopholes
and jurisdictional issues drag this out

00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:29.778
for months,

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:33.641
while my private parts
were on display for months.

00:04:34.203 --> 00:04:38.235
How would you feel if your naked body
was exposed for the world to see,

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.565
and you waited helplessly
for the content to be removed?

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.633
Eventually, I stumbled upon
a private company

00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:48.785
to issue a DMCA notice
to shut the website down.

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:52.817
DMCA -- Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:56.269
It's a law that regulates
digital material and content.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:05:01.630
Broadly, the aim of the DMCA is to protect
both copyright owners and consumers.

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:02.816
So get this:

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.876
people who take and share nude photos
own the rights to those selfies,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.852
so they should be able to issue a DMCA
to have the content removed.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:14.213
But not so fast --

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:16.649
because the other fight we're dealing with

00:05:16.673 --> 00:05:21.006
is noncompliant and nonresponsive
third-party internet companies.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.732
And oh -- by the way,

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.879
even in consenting relationships,

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:28.252
just because you get
a nude photo or a naked pic,

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.528
does not give you the right to share it,

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:33.187
even [without] the intent to do harm.

00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:35.782
Back to my case,

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:37.759
which happens to be further complicated

00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:40.950
because he was stalking and harassing me
from another country,

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:44.940
making it nearly impossible
to get help here.

00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:48.434
But wait a minute --
isn't the internet international?

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:50.926
Shouldn't we have
some sort of policy in place

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.810
that broadly protects us,
regardless to borders or restrictions?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.664
I just couldnâ€™t give up;
I had to keep fighting.

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.736
So I willingly, on three occasions,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.299
allowed for the invasion
of both my cell phone and my laptop

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:11.283
by the Department of Homeland Security
and the Jamaican Embassy

00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:13.529
for thorough forensic investigation,

00:06:13.553 --> 00:06:16.299
because I had maintained
all of the evidence.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.958
I painstakingly shared my private parts
with the all-male investigative team.

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:28.052
And it was an embarrassing, humiliating
additional hoop to jump through.

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:31.117
But then something happened.

00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:34.916
Jamaican authorities
actually arrested him.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:40.400
He's now facing charges
under their malicious communications act,

00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:44.717
and if found guilty, could face
thousands of dollars in fines

00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:46.653
and up to 10 years in prison.

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:49.276
And I've also learned that my case
is making history --

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.855
it is the first international case
under this new crime.

00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:58.249
Wow, finally some justice.

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:00.352
But this got me to thinking.

00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:02.450
Nobody deserves this.

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:06.061
Nobody deserves this level of humiliation

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:09.768
and having to jump through
all of these hoops.

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:14.307
Our cyber civil rights are at stake.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:19.203
Here in the United States,
we need to have clear, tough enforcement;

00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:24.083
we need to demand the accountability
and responsiveness from online companies;

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:28.773
we need to promote social responsibilities
for posting, sharing and texting;

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:32.916
and we need to restore dignity to victims.

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:35.202
And what about victims

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.672
who neither have the time,
money or resources to wage war,

00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:43.677
who are left disempowered,
mislabeled and broken?

00:07:44.362 --> 00:07:45.512
Two things:

00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:49.339
release the shame and end the silence.

00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:53.015
Shame is at the core of all of this.

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:56.903
And for every silent prisoner of shame,

00:07:56.927 --> 00:08:00.006
it's the fear of judgment
that's holding you hostage.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.832
And the price to pay
is the stripping away of your self-worth.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:09.016
The day I ended my silence,
I freed myself from shame.

00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:12.776
And I freed myself
from the fear of judgment

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.680
from the one person who I thought
would judge me the most --

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:17.259
my son,

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:19.839
who actually told me,

00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:23.736
"Mom, you are the strongest
person that I know.

00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:25.784
You can get through this.

00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:31.164
And besides, mom -- he chose
the wrong woman to mess with."

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:32.904
(Laughter)

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:37.544
(Applause)

00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:41.262
It was on that day that I decided
to use my platform

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.785
and my story and my voice.

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:48.030
And to get started, I asked myself
this one simple question:

00:08:48.054 --> 00:08:50.154
Who do I need to become now?

00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:54.895
That question, in the face of everything
that I was challenged with,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:59.172
transformed my life and had me thinking
about all kinds of possibilities.

00:08:59.196 --> 00:09:02.458
I now own my story, I speak my truth,

00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:05.085
and I'm narrating
a new chapter in my life.

00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:08.327
It's called "50 Shades of Silence."

00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:11.291
It's a global social justice project,

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:13.649
and we're working to film
an upcoming documentary

00:09:13.673 --> 00:09:16.139
to give voice and dignity to victims.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:20.538
If you are a victim or you know
someone who is, know this:

00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:24.625
in order to be empowered,
you have to take care of yourself,

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.355
and you have to love yourself.

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:29.117
You have to turn your anger into action,

00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:30.704
your pain into power

00:09:30.728 --> 00:09:35.168
and your setback into a setup
for what's next for your life.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:40.047
This is a process, and it's a journey
of self-discovery

00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:42.373
that might include forgiveness.

00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:47.518
But it definitely requires bravery,
confidence and conviction.

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:49.620
I call it:

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:52.766
finding your everyday courage.

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:55.207
Thank you.

00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:59.507
(Applause)
