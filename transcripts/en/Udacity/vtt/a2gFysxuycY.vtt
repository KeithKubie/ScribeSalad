00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.202
Okay. So this is what I've done as you see,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.130
it looks a little nicer than it was before. And I didn't

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.530
really change that much. I just made a few changes, so

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.560
I just wanted to point them out to you, so that you

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.690
know what they are. And the main thing, one of the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.210
main things I did is really to introduce these derived attributes. So

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.860
these are attributes that are basically

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.520
computed. Based on some other attributes.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.010
Okay, they don't have a value themselves, but their value is computed.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.900
And I used two. The first one is age. So

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.930
basically we know the age of the patron based on

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.920
the birthday, of the patron. So you guys, I don't

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.150
know if you have that information currently in the system.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; No, we'll have to add that to the

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.280
form patrons fill out, when they get their card.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.255
&gt;&gt; Is that, that an issue? Can you do it?

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.130
&gt;&gt; No yes, we, we can easily do that.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then, perfect. So we'll do it that way. I think it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.310
a, in a little cleaner. And similarly, since you told me that the fine

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.480
was computed based on the amount of days that an

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.310
item was late. The patron was late returning the item, then I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.010
also added this as a derived attribute that is computed based on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.140
the due date and when the item is actually returned.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.780
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.389
&gt;&gt; Makes sense? Okay. And the rest

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:10.590
is kind of really minor things. So the, the only one I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.340
want to point out is I didn't, you know, discuss that with

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.260
you before, but I added this, which is called cardinality

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.700
for some of these relationships. And what they say is basically

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.360
is how many elements are involved in the relationship.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.580
&gt;&gt; So, you mean the stars?

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the stars and the one...

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.290
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.380
&gt;&gt; Here for example, this is telling you that for each item there

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.490
is only one title. And that for each title, there are multiple items.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.490
&gt;&gt; So, star means many.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.716
&gt;&gt; Stars mean many, yeah.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:39.045
&gt;&gt; Okay, go you.

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.321
&gt;&gt; Sorry that's kind of computer science lingo - we use the star

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.500
for that kind of stuff. And, similarly, for the patron, it's

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.510
telling me that, you know, each patron can have multiple, can

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.550
request multiple titles, and that the same title can be requested

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.650
by multiple patrons, which I think is the way the system works.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.080
&gt;&gt; Right. So except for these minor changes,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.850
we already had a pretty good model in our hands, so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.620
I think is a, we can finalize this and then just

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.350
move to the low level design and then implementation, and be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.970
done with the system.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.979
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
