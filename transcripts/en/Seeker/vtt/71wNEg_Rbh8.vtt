00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.359
Jealousy is a strong burning emotion filled
with lots of nuances.

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:17.460
The thing is, when it comes to jealousy there
is one place where straight men stand alone.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.610
Evolutionary psychology is kind of weird.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.890
It's a bunch of highly educated scientists
looking at modern humans and applying Darwin's

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.470
evolutionary principles to behaviors they
observe.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.300
While there IS research involved, it's kind
of like educated guessing.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.829
We can't go back in time and see exactly what
prompted the adaptation that resulted in jealousy,

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.980
but evolutionary psychologists can test how
it works now and guess[1]!

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
For the people who've never experienced jealousy
-- to which I personally say, "what?!"

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.749
-- jealousy has its roots in envy, suspicion,
mistrust, anxiety and protective possession.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.579
It's usually attributed to relationships,
and feels like a burning all encompassing

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.679
emotive mess.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.679
A hot friggin' mess[2][3].

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.909
Evolutionary psychologists say this feeling
has been part of humanity for a million years,

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.100
evolving when humans were still living solely
in Africa.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.110
Males were constantly guarding the social
group and providing food while the females

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.840
were maintaining social structure and raising
the offspring.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.440
According to their hypothesis, male jealousy
evolved to ensure they weren't providing resources

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.240
to mates who weren't prioritizing their genes
-- i.e. females who were thirsty for their

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240
sidepiece[4].

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.390
On the other hand female jealousy, though
originating from the same inner structures,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.680
manifested as anxiety over emotional betrayal
because her mate might split the hunting spoils

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.030
with HIS sidepiece!

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.100
That meant fewer resources for her and the
offspring.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.460
Jealousy burns hotly in both men and women,
but the cause is slightly different.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.920
It all sounds veryâ€¦ tweet-drama like, and
yet, studies over the years have confirmed

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.670
male and female jealousy do work in this way!

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.660
Now a new study in the Archives of Sexual
Behavior, the largest ever completed, claims

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.730
they've confirmed yet again how jealousy works.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.040
In this giant study of 64,000 Americans[5],[6],
they found that when it comes to sexual infidelity,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520
straight men are the most heated.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.989
Heterosexual men cannot abide when their partner
has physical relations with another.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.530
That being said, straight women, gay, lesbian,
and bisexual men AND women were ALL more concerned

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.060
by emotional infidelity[7] -- or the idea
that their partner might love someone else.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.190
The lead researcher wanted to learn what the
largest triggers of jealousy might be, and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.459
for whom those triggers are strongest; and
it turns out only heterosexual men are NOT

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.030
worried about their partner falling in love
with another person.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.280
Of course, it also depends on how you ask
participants the questions in a study like

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.280
this.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.859
An older study out of Northeastern[8] found
when presented with seven different types

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.650
of infidelity, rather than simply emotional
or physical, the differences between the sexes

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.650
(at least) shrank.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.650
What about you?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:01.409
What would send you into a jealous rage?
