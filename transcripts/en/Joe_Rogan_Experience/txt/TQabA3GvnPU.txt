Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Boom, and we're live. John Jock, Joe Hogan. I'll pull this up. Pull this up quite some time, but we made it. Yeah, we've made it. We made it happen. People still to this day, all my friends call me Joe Hogan because you a, I don't know man. Joe Hogan. That's a funny Brazilian thing. You know the Portuguese translation of ours to H's I think. I think when we speak English, you have to use your tongue in a way that in Portuguese we had just flat out. But you use Rio, you don't say heal, right. Do you say heal real? How that work? Somehow? The, it's in Portuguese there first to let us add the strongest one in the word, but, but Hixon and hoists and say on, right, it's, but it's not Rickson but it's Rio. Yes. How's that work? I don't know when it becomes, the name is different than when you say a city name.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Oh really? Yes. Oh, it's funny. Real. It's more something for them. And when you say personal, it becomes a little, I don't know, Hickson. So Holly people, it's an h but it can be an r like a earth sound with objects and things. Yes. Or just places I'm thinking more places in in. It's funny because in each region in Brazil is a different accent really. Well that makes sense. Kind of like America. Yes. Each place like by countries that, because it's the sounds very different, but it's a beautiful language. Portuguese has like especially Brazilian Portuguese. I was like a sing song, you know, like a flow to the bus or of a carnivores, but it's that the way you guys talk, it's cool. It sounds good. You know it's one almost like singing. Yeah. How many Americans have like put on a fake Brazilian accent once they started really getting into Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       Must be when I think, I think in a way when Gigi to stablish their flag outside Brazil, it make funny. It's fun in a way that people, our goal is to make that area become more resilient than any other place. It's not that we're trying to speak more English, but we'll make the English become more Portuguese and almost every student that I have, maybe probably because of my accent, they still listen and speak in very similar the way we do in every Jujitsu school. Yeah, well that's a u. We used to see that in taekwondo. Two guys would have like fake Korean accents and in each school the instructor has a different accent and different vocabulary, which even extended more, it becomes like another language in digital community. So Jujitsu is huge in Rio, but what other parts of Brazil that is very strange if you stop button and think about the history of martial arts, which is something that's always been very fascinating to me.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Jujitsu's the most fascinating because until 1993 it very few people understood how potent Brazilian Jujitsu was. When when I start understand Jujitsu and became on the teenager time, Jujitsu is basically in Brazil has that amazing Arrow off my uncle Helio and Carson, the whole first generation of their family, which Brazil was all over, [inaudible] was all over Brazil as a teenager. Remember the sheets was basically establish in a very, um, wealth area in Rio de Janeiro only. It's basically have all these schools is to call Gracie schools by the neighborhood. You have a Gracie, my tie. You have a Gracie coppa cabin. I have a than future Gracie Baha. But everything was almost Gracie school everywhere and it was wealthy people only in their welfare of real wow. Then slowly, because keep in mind these two have one, maybe two tournaments. Sports have you shoots a year. That's it. We always practice sheets who mainly at that time for self defense, we want to get ready for protect ourself would never had much chances to try in a tournament cause there's no tournament. Every training we do was based in defend yourself. What year did tournament start coming about?

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       By the beginning of the nineties. I think there's usually two tournaments. Start catching up more as a crazy video of your brother. He gun and uh, Hickson competing at a tournament once. I was the biggest tournament of the year. Three, 300, 300 competitors. Oh, that's crazy. That was, that was the biggest, that's the biggest one. 300 thousands and thousand hours. The big ones is like 5,000 people. Yeah. Now when this happened, what year was this with your brother? I think was in the 80s not sure which year with something. I don't think today looking back is something that um, I didn't like personally cause it was no need for that. We, everybody's to train together and let, I don't want to find out there was behind the scenes people involved with the organization. They want to something more of the tournament and they end up making something like that happen. Oh, so you mean because he gun and Hicks in a trained together having them compete against each other was not a good at all?

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       No. Hickson was teaching us cause our instructor, why do you think they wanted to have him compete against Seguin? It wasn't even, this happened on the day of the event was no planning of having that fight or anything. They just made that happen there and they realize that the promoter of the tournament, they sponsor a, was talking to someone involved the promotion. Hey Man, I'll give you more money if it makes something like that happen in an hour time. If my instructor tells me I want you to go and do that, I don't even question, I just go and do it. Right. That's the way we were in, in, in the whole family and uh, all instructs. And I've got to go and do this even though I don't like it. It's wrong. I should not do it. We'll do it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       So what would be wrong about it would be that you were all training partners and in fact Hickson was your instructor. So for one of you to go up against Hixon, it's just

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       w I will give you a, the Indian nineties, early nineties, we have a cymbal wrestling tournament in uh, San Diego. And when we moved to America was nosy sheets, events at all. And we are in search of something similar that we can do to keep the edge. And we went to some judo tournaments. We went to wrestling tournaments and not knowing the rules of anything. And we ended up in assemble wrestling tournament.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Sambo for people don't know is a Russian martial art that wear their judo jacket, but they were wrestling shoes and shorts.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       It's kind of a mix of both different rules. I still don't know exactly the rules, but here we are and myself and now we go there and I saw Hickson in that event and when it comes started, the final match was me and him on the final and I back that time where we have some conflicting side, the family things that are, I'll keep that in four, four walls, but a, we were not, the relationship wasn't as well as should be. Then when the referee call me, it's like, well, I'm not going to fight my instruct on my, my coach, my, my hero, my idol. No. Um, and I told the ref, no, not fighting Nev. Hexion was like, look at me. And I think in a good way he knew of not ever compete against him, but at the same time he, he realized that, um, I would never have done myself. You can see him, right? I will fight for him for the rest of my life. And, and period. And I think it was the point that, um, I was able to engage back our family things together after these days and showing him that it's all my respect and our fight for him never against him.

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       Well there was a time where people were trying to use the Gracie name and um, many people were opening up schools that weren't necessarily really that, that wasn't their birth name, Gracie, whereas you guys went a different direction and use the Machado name and the Machado name became enormous too. So there was like, from what I remember in the 90s when I first started training with you, there was a, I started out at Hickson's place and I only, uh, trained there one time and then I went from Hickson's place to Carlston's place just cause it was closer. I didn't know any better. I thought Gracie is Gracie. Oh Carlson, Gracie Hicks. Grades. I didn't know anything and I was white belts and I was like, oh another Gracie. Oh this is like 10 minutes closer to my house. I'll just go ahead. That's how it used to be in Brazil and there on the 80s all gracious schools, but then when that place went under, lost that plate, it was on Hawthorne.

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       That was when v Toward Belfort man, his UFC debut in 1997 and that place went under, I started training with you and when I started training with you it was like 97 ish. Right? Somewhere around there. 98 somewhere around there. One was, I think it was right before fear factor. No though. Seems few years before. Yeah, a few years before cause fear factor was 2001 newsradio style. Yes. I was still on news radio when I was training with you, but our member there was like a co year Machado. Now I'm like, what are you talking about? I was like, I didn't understand like oh there's like Machado's and then there's like two different, like

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       the the, the functions. The thing that happened in that time was this, my mother older sister, she's married to Carlos Gracie senior than me. He had seven lives color. His last wife was my mom's sister and that's, we grew up with the family. We don't have the same last name, but I feel like I am and all my brothers, the same thing. We represent the grist family the best way we can forever and now and every then have a big family. I have cousins that you relate better than others, but it's still a family than no. And back at that time, two of my brothers were teaching at the Gracie school in Carson. Was He going in Carlos? And um, I think by that time Chuck Norris was no longer training with Horian at the Gracie school. They're not sure what happened and he stopped training. Then one day, um, some of the, some technologies noise show up at our house, at our garage. We used to teach in our garage in Redondo beach and we opened the doors and the look is like, man, that guy looks like Chuck Norris.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       Then this was a him up or this is Chuck Norris. And we look like what? And he brought him to train. He did training a few years back at the Gracie school. And Blah, blah, blah, and it's a long store shot. Then he start training for us and when he start 24 hours, we become very good friends. It was amazing. Like something Brian Away. He invited us to his house and he's a great guy, man, amazing person. It's the hanging out and by the time I remember he used to make a movie, one movie a year. He worked for six months, make a movie and has six months off. When we met him, he was six months off. Literally he trains every day, but when he trained, he doesn't go home. We'll have lunch. He hangs out, go to a movie, then sell it, become good friends. Then one day he, after a few months after the train of was, he invited us to the valley where he used to live in, in soon and say, look, I have surprise for you guys.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Then he took us to a shopping center right off into the believer in, um, he shows a, have a gift for you guys and he shows a, uh, one of the unity's mats, right? He's like a school. Then he said, look, this is for you guys at your school. Wow. Then we'll look into him like [inaudible] run on the street and said, check, we don't think we can afford that is an underwater, that's my building. You guys don't have to pay anything. I just want to make sure I don't have to drive them one on one at four or five. You guys, that's a hell of a drive to Redondo drive. And he gave the school tours. Wow. Then it's like what can I tell him more about this guy that's on the knows and that's why we have this school in the valley because he used to live any sooner.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       The school was in a scene and then we start coming here. Then here we are. You Hogan Tarzana to our school. Yeah. That's amazing. Wow. What a great guy. But the point on that, our conversation was that, um, our school when we opened our school, still called college. Gracie's you too because of our uncle. Cause when we came in we have the Gracie school and I remember, uh, the family's big and everybody has your sign of story. Everybody's saying something about your uncle, your cousin and we wanna make sure that this side, the fem that we were representing away was Carlos side. Then um, a lot of people when the with d the grand opening check noise were with us doing this self defense and demonstration and the grand opened up the school and that was on Sunday. On Monday. We're not even ready for the amount of people that show up at our school.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       And we have um, a small place with the amount of people, but a lot of people start calling the other school asking where our schoolwork cause we're not even on the the book, the Yellow Book. Yeah, we are not even on that and people are calling the other schools, hey do you know where the other school is in there? Create a little situation back then and we got some uh, calls from other cousins and they say, Hey, you guys cannot use the name. Then for the first time leaving using the name of our family, we realized like what? Why not? Cause you don't have less name, you can use it. Then for us, we grew up fighting or the family doing everything for their family. We still do nothing change, but then their suggestion was, yeah, you can call my child like all the Gracie name. My family was this because of Horian?

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Yes. Was Beck who was a lawyer and so he was the one who kind of copyrighted it and wanted to make it. He was like trying to sue Carlson at one point. Right, but do you know the crazy thing was this, we have one of the students in and as we learned your shoe too, the most important thing for me as an instructor was everybody can learn how to fight, right? How can you translate what you learned in the Mat to implement in your personal life? That's how we learned your shoes. The impact as you two has on you to succeed outside the academy. I know you can fight, but can you fight on your life outside then is a different ball game. It's a lot bigger and a lot harder and we have a lot of students that came to us when we have our garage time that changed their life in Queens gently.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       One of these students happens to be sent off the biggest lawyer in California and we have no idea because we ended up getting sued by one side of the family. They don't have no money. We turn to this and say, guys, I'm sorry. We want to have to leave. So you thought you were going to close down the school? Oh yeah. Then we have this guy, which his father was very grateful to us show up. Say, look, I'm these hot shot lawyer. I can represent you guys. Like what am I going to pay now? You guys are ready. I owe you because my son was saved by you guys and who's your son? That his son was 21st for quite some time. Became very [inaudible] to change his life around. He was a drug addict. Now he's one of the best yoga instructors out there. Jujitsu addict. Yeah. We go and tell his life and that lawyer protectors made sure that we stay here. Fine. What's back then? There was on the past today, Paul, our families, we have our difference back then and it's less now. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:16:03       it's nothing. Well, there's enough for everybody now. I think everybody realizes in the beginning, Jujitsu was so new and so powerful and that Gracie name was so huge. Do you remember when Vituro tour? They used to call Him v [inaudible] Gracie? Yes. They would call him victor for some reason it was victor vi, k, t, O, r, and then it became v tour, like I was there when they were calling them Victor Gracie Manda. No, the amazing thing in the eyes of fighter and in my generation, Brazil, everybody wants to be part of their family. Of course, everybody wants to feel that you and that big circle because there's so much history and it's the name.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       August 12 at your birthday, right? 11th August 11th they're going to have a statue of a Carson Gracie beach in Copacabana and ribbon me. A lot of recognitions happen now, which is you two in special degrees. Usually it's because anyone that does usually today you're doing great Sushi somehow, maybe second generation, that generation student off this guy who his instructor was the student and off they may, I think everybody should be in and they're grateful for what their family's done.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Yes. The fee, it's the most important family in the history of martial arts by a long shot man. It's, it changed. The world, changed the world, changed the world, changed my world. I remember when UFC came out and I watched it and I had been a Stryker my whole life and um, I had done a little wrestling in high school, but no Jujitsu, no submissions, don't nothing. And I watch boys crazy just run through everybody. And I felt, I felt so vulnerable. I was like, oh no, I don't know anything. I don't know any of this. What the fuck. This is how I was watching him take guys down and just strangle him like shit. And these guys were killers. They were standup killers and hoists was just everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       [inaudible] when I was in Arizona, I remember the first one they show in the paper view. And, uh, I was in Denver right the first year. [inaudible] and I was teach a seminar and I think back those days they got payment thousand dollars for the weekend. And, and I was watching a group of guys and they were not even sure and I put them on that. David said, hey, who wants to make a bet that the skinny little guy like looked like a dark color is going to win everything? And everybody I know. No, that guy. Okay, put good money in them. Nobody put the money though. And He, we are because we knew what you should do too is we knew that Jujutsu youtube works and the things usually it's brought a lot of reality into the martial arts world. Oh yeah. We made a lot of enemies that today are our friends because we showed something that people refuse to learn until they have no other choice.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       They have no other choice and no man, we have UFC, the biggest fighting show in the world. What they come from came from Horian. There we go. Came from the streets in Brazil to the world and Horian Gracie, who we all owe a huge debt to. He wanted to prove the effectiveness of Gracie Jujitsu. So he established the ultimate fighting championship and that's where it came from. It came from that guy's imagination and his desire to spread the word of his family. That's why I choose you to do for people. Make you believe. Yeah. Imagine if he did not believe in what he has and what he learned. Yeah. Will be. None of us will be a talking today, probably still doing something else and maybe not as happy as we actually know. It's amazing. And the whole stories, it's hard for people to understand too that have never practiced it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       How Fun it is. You know, it's, it's an a so, and it makes your mind the better. Oh wait, I was telling some of the students use Jitsu is a health way for you to be bullied by someone. You in a school environment and you have the high belts playing with their weapons. Yes. They even, they out the white belts come in. It's literally been bullying in a health way because it's an hour safe environment. Well it's not bullying where you're not getting picked on, but you're getting manhandled. Then the thing is they get smashed daily. They come back for next class. Yes. Next class. Until soon they're going to start be able to do the same thing. Yes. And that little step they do, they realize like, well I'm being picked by someone now I stand by myself and I'm able to, and he turned the table around.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       It's a very healthy way to be picked up smash every day that if you stay there, stick there, you're going to use that. You're going to reverse that. You get choked pretty soon going to be choking someone in the round bar going on by somebody and as I walking up in the stairs and that's how we grew up. We go to the schools, we get beat up like by the older cousins and um, man, I don't think that's for me. But then we come back one more time. Yeah, we'll come back one more time. Then 40 years later, you still coming back from one more time. We'll teaches you not just resilience, but how important it is to just keep showing up and it's a, it's fun. Yeah. That whole thing. You get choked to go home with a, how'd that guy choked me? Yeah. I thought I knew how to defend that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       How did he make me turn in their way that he gets the choke? Then it intrigued. Then you keep in in back in the 80s we had no videos. We would have to try to memorize and see how this actually happened. Right. Is it was a lot more challenging because you have to try to remake it and not sure if that's what actually happened to you. But the amazing thing in, I remember a lot of times they're looking around the mats. I have all my brothers, all my cousins. It's no way someone in this room with them will not have the answer for the question that you have. Right. And you have so many different views that is impossible for you not to learn. And I'll get good in Jujitsu. Yeah. You have so many amazing fighters out there knowing more than you know, then every member, every time I ask something to the technique, I get five different answers.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Yeah. And I use the one that works for me. Well that's what's interesting, right? I said everyone has a different approach that Jujitsu is almost like a, the way people talk, it's like having conversations. People use different words and different styles and, and, and, and, and the amazing thing is, let's see, we train and I do well with you then the train with that guy. You do well if the guy in deteriorate, I should be doing well. If the guy know maybe his game does not fit with my game, I might have a lot of difficult against him, which I shouldn't. What is the matchup game is very interesting is nothing that is guarantee all that guy's gonna. No it's not right. And maybe my game is used yours but not to his, well that was the most amazing thing about Hickson, right? Cause Hickson was the one guy that everyone said was the best when I grew up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       And I have to say, um, the privilege watch for me. I have some guys from Carson school, there was amazing fighters used to watch them and I remember one of them. Our Casio Cardozo for me was phenomenal. We have definitely heuler for his size, his weight, most accomplished, Phil nominal, all the greatest numbers, man. What this guy did with for his size against opponents. People look like that. No Way. And yes, it is a way. Yeah, and definitely as you going heavier, I have my brother Hagen, which was an amazing fighter. Choo. And if evidently for me, my time was Hickson. It's like you have the era of Hixon. Yeah, I love them. They live both fighters, but you, you in the room decade and Nixon and now could be you, but he was right there. Right. You could've been number number 200 Hickson. You could've been number one.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Are there anybody else in the amazing thing you feel like a chameleon? He can, he can kind of make any game. You train him. He can pretend to be you fighting me or anybody. It's amazing that aspect, especially in the teaching process. What was so good about him. He used to go to our school, we have third of the best guys, all higher belts, and he tells you, okay, choose how I want to start. And you choose. Okay. He is not going to get out. He gets out and he gets you in the position. You ask him to start with everyone. I think the most, the best thing that he has on his game that I'm on my view and today understand that was his defense. Hmm. No way to get him. You let your mom take his back, do whatever you want. You can get him.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       He used to start, let guys take his back with a rear naked choke, fully locked in black belts. Go ahead, start from here, stuffing, defend, get out and get you there. Crazy. Then messes your mind up like, Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, how can he get out? And he gets me here. Can't get out. You know? And I think the amazing thing was his confidence and belief on that. It makes amazing. Well, he was unusual in that he was really into physical fitness as well. Like Yoga really in the yoga become incredibly flexible and strong and really in the breathing. He, he had an amazing control of his body as well as the knowledge of Jujitsu man. He brought a lot of elements to shoot that. I don't think people realize how important it was as people, so I knew that. No you did not. He brought in the breathing aspen, the, there's your nice guy that makes you come closer to the nature habitats.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Yeah. Gymnastica naturals what we're talking about. It's a style of who invented that was the man who invented Orlando, Connie and there was a Brazilian thing as well. Brazilian guy. He's still alive in his eighties and you look at him like how can he do or still do that and the whole idea is move your body like the animals to bring back to us, the animal instinct that we end up losing by the generations. You see some of that now with a Edo port towel. And a lot of these guys are training martial artists in these movement, like movement classes and movement styles. And a lot of that is very similar to gymnastic or natural. Amazing. But the biggest difference I think was the concept that he used, the approach that he used wasn't as just mechanical the way it is with something that's sometimes on the exercise you change the direction of your movements is not certain Catia, you have to do one, two, three, four.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       Now he goes one, two, [inaudible] four 10 go back to six. You flow. And Hexion brought that into Jujitsu. And I remember a train, he goes, Hey, get there. Keep, keep moving, keep moving. Don't stop moving. Keep, keep the flow of the technique, you're gonna get it. And he brought that movement into the sheets, which for me made a huge difference in the way I fight. How did you fight before that? Um, we learned the technique. We do the drills and uh, it's more like you pause and wait for somebody to pause in his position when he came in. Understand that he's, you learn how to start guiding people to where you want them to go. Mm. I'm 20 few. I want you to go to my left is no other way for it to go to my right. I learned how to mold my Biden away.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       The only direction you will have to go is on my left. I know that, but you don't. Right. Then we go on one step ahead. Then when you go to my left, you're gonna put your left hand on the grounds. That felt right hand. I know that too. Then I'm two steps ahead of you. I mean, when you're trying to defend something, you already two steps behind because the defense is I was shorter than the offense. Your stretch arm. For me to get your arm, I have to put my hands and swing my leg for it. Just bring going back. It's always short. It's quicker. That's why when you have one or two steps ahead, you don't have the time to defend. You're blocking off the defense. I'm already too far ahead for it to defense. And that's what I learned with those movements that he brought into Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       You start learning how to guide and mold yourself to make you go to that direction. Who was a challenge to him in the early days? Cause there was a lot of great guys, right? We have a lot of great guys and it's funny sometimes I soon go to the Internet and see some of the fights and you notice that a lot of guys, they, they can kinda hang out for until five minutes after five minutes. And great athletes, they just done because of that movement. He keep going constantly keep that rhythm. People were not able to keep up with him. Right? And he's not lifting weights and a body builder now he's, and we learn how important for human needs to be in contact with nature. Would you imagine yourself not going for hiking some days in the morning? Let me, we need that. We need that energy. You know, we need to walk without shoes. We need to be near the mountains, the water. That's something that make us healthy and stronger. And that's why you see, we used to go a lot up in the mountains and waterfalls and out of the city to try to get that in a healthy animal instinct that we had. Yeah. Where they listen to the birds, listen to in the middle La maybe some chaotic, there are people that are in the city, they'll go on the mountain, they're going to get eaten, eaten by a mountain

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       lion. It's not even here, the mountain lion. But if you're walking there, quite often you understand that you'll, you'll develop any, still have that, oh, I heard something there. We're losing more of that as you Jitsu. We're trying to bring people into that environment, which is something they make you better off regardless. Be more aware of yourself. Exactly. Yeah. More primal. And um, then also that's the struggle of Jujitsu is so much different than what most people experience on a daily basis where you're literally trying to stop someone from choking you. And it's a friend, like a good friend, like [inaudible], but they're trying to choke the shit out of you and you're trying to stop them and the amazing thing you're trying to stop and you don't get mad at him. Not at all. You don't say thank you man. You slap hands. And then I say, how'd you get me?

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       Like, oh you forgot this. Like Oh God, here we go. His daddy is the amazing thing. One student said something like, do you know why? If you see two people show friendly cause they hug each other at the time. And I don't know for sure. Right? Yeah. Well there's so much physical contact that that is true. There's something to that. But I think it's the, they, I contacted talking to Jordan. I'm in that exchange of information. It's also humbling, which I think people need. I think people have a distorted perception of what they can do in his life. And I think sometimes you need to understand this is where you are. And when, one of the beautiful things about the ranking system of Jujitsu is, you know when you give someone a purple belt, you say, hey, this is real. Y'All ready for this? I've seen you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       I watch you. I know you know 100% where they are, they're ready to get a purple belt, and then it's this feeling like, okay, the all this showing up day after day drilling, after drilling coming in when I don't want to, is this paying off and I've reached a new place. It sounds like when you promote someone's a flashback, they'll go back like, whoa. Yeah, they realize all this time that are bringing in a very good way. Suffering going through these it worth when he ran now feeling much better. When you gave me my purple belt, I remember thinking that was probably one of the happiest moments of my life because to me purple belt was like a blue belt was like you just kept showing up. You kept showing up. You kept showing up. Now you've got a blue belt, but a purple belt was like you could get a black belt.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       You just have to keep going. You in the top of the mountain as a purple belt, you're right there with the we all the top guys. There's no way down. There's just up. You're right there with all of them. That was during the fear factor game days. I was more happy about getting that purple belt than I was about getting factor donation some because a, I get a lot of messages from people like, Oh man, it's your hook and good than jogger and you need to go to man. Come to my school anytime. Joe Hogan shows up and he's, he's back now. Training is not about his

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       power man. He doesn't care. He wrestles everybody, anybody and I see him twist the people around there and the school in east one and this is, this is real. Here's one of the hardest students training partners that I have and I think one of the last time I wrestle him and my Malibu School, I think we trained maybe for half an hour or something like that. I was there for, I don't know, 20 minutes just trying to sweep Joe and Joe was right there. I finished the trainers and man, my legs are sore and I don't, I don't remember if I did slip him or not to just stop training after half an hour and I want people to understand that it's anybody that I want to trend. I would never in a refuse, I never give a bell to anybody unless they deserve the belt and want to say deserve is.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       I don't defer people from more famous, less families taught. Now it's everybody's usually to word is the same. You have to walk in the same role as everybody because that's the only way you actually going to learn Jujitsu. For Real. Yes, you're and I don't remember you say no 20 body training get hurt a lot of times. Don't care. Show up and my neck is here, my knees there and trainee and you out there that you listen. Here's one the strongest, excuse my language. Motherfuckers I have in my school training Jujitsu with and that's why I'm here. I'm pushing him to get back and when to show up. And now that I know where he is, I'm going to show up here. What's up Joe, is that as soon as I healed this, fuck it. It is amazing. And I want people to know that a is the real deal. Another thing that people don't know is when he was back in the fear factor time, he had one idea to, one of the challenge for the people would be training, fighting a cage with me and decades, don't you too? And then they realized that, Joe, you don't need me. You go there and do it. Well you're wrong. You're going to mango. Everybody there. You don't need anybody to do that. You went up not happening. And uh, they decided [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       that it was too dangerous to do a person versus a person. They thought that there was too many legal implications. Actually. Meanwhile, they have people ride a fucking bull. Any sentence? But so the, the, the challenge was they were going to have to start with you on the ground, like in your guard or with you mounting them. We had to figure out what it was and whoever survived the longest, you know, like the, the,

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       I told that guy, I said, man, you don't need me. You can use Joe. Joe's going to do this same thing and gonna twist whatever needs to do it has all the tools for that. That was funny you say that the point was you, you can do it. There was no need for me to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:23       How do you, how, how you still fairly injury free after all these years because what's interesting about you is, you know, you've been doing jujitsu forever, but you can still roll and train with people. A lot of other guys after a certain of time, they

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       really can't roll anymore. They develop all these back problems, back problems in particular, um, neck problems. I learned Emmy Meulens you too. Last chance to have to get hurt. And my point is I'm always under control. I'm always controlling my opponent and I know how to avoid certain situations before the situation actually happened. Cause a lot of times people go for the kill but not concerned about them getting killed. Sometimes they expose themselves to be in a bad position and they have to learn. Sometimes you'll do an onboarding somebody and somebody put all the weight on your neck and I see peeping system in getting there. No, you go back and give up. Keep the control. Then you do it again, but nodding systems, some bad positions and if then has to do, how well do you eat? How well do you sleep? Do you exercise?

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       Let me a lot of the things that involve exercise to be like with weights, lift weights and run the needle and swing. You have so many things that you can do and people say, oh no debit buys going at the holidays. Sure we can die tomorrow, but I want to make sure that time of my life I'm healthy and I don't see myself going to Jujitsu school teaching and not training, but even Hickson can't train anymore. Oh no, he's back training. He's rowing ass. He's really know when to start rolling again. I saw one of his students, they train last week, just one hour. Wow. I had the injury and again understand a lot of real bad back problems. Yeah. As the back and the hip. A lot of things in a lot of those things happen more not with [inaudible] with some of the MMA fights and got understand back those days.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       There's no no protection at all and throw the child out of the ring and I was sipping. Yeah, very, very challenging. No weight class. I mean he show up as a young age fighting. Some monsters are dead and said, man, I don't know how he did it, but he did it and you know, showing up and Zulu when he was 18 is a losing sane but still strong. It was more from that time. Didn't actually shoot soon. You should. Should never go a as you Justin [inaudible] nothing. [inaudible] then his back training man. I would love it. It is amazing man. I don't see myself with years old not be able to train the new. You've got a cortisone shot recently. I, yeah, I'm not sure what happened and my knee bugs me and I go there have a little meniscal tear. I'm still training. Have a certain position that are, it's not comfortable, uh, have the cortisone shot and so far so good. Not bothering anymore, not bothering me. You have a central position that, but the physical therapy that I'm doing is being very helpful. What kinds of stuff are you doing in lift the weights and I'm every day in a bike doing things that make your legs stronger or bike is amazing. It's so good for the knees. Knowing packed them in. Yeah. I think we have everything we need. Then if I, if I don't have, I can learn how to do by end up man sheets is a, is a lifestyle in general.

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       Yes. Yeah, it is. And the P, it's, it's almost like, um, it's not just a lie. It's like a philosophy too because there's a lot of people that they learn how to deal with life through the struggle of Jujitsu because the struggle of training is so much harder than most of the struggles that you face in your daily life. It makes you more accustomed to dealing with uncomfortable position.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       I will tell a funny story that why she's you to this for you? I, my, my older daughter had some health issues. I get chew o'clock in the morning, something like that and uh, called the doctor and said, look, you've got to go and get these inhalers. Something that the pharmacy man, I was wearing my pajamas driving crazy to the pharmacy and as I'm walking in and have a guy walking out and bumped him, he showed her mind and hey, son of a ds F-you and I said, man, shoot turning them one. When I find them go home, go chill. Why? Then they got no, I'm going wait for you. Then he's outside. I go get the medication. I put this stuff in and say, man, get the guy outside. He's no longer there. Several months later the same guy show up in my school and I did not recognize him, but he keeps staring at me and I approach, hey, how are you? I betrayed shoots before. He's like, do you remember me? Did you train here before? No, I bumped into you in the pharmacy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       It goes like tank you for now hurting me. And that goes like, man, what happened to you that all my father passed away a day before I was so depressed. So the point for me was with Jujitsu, I can walk away for something like that. Then I feel sorry for the guy. You know, I'm not concern. All my friends are him. No, I'm not afraid. It's just the fact that I'm saving him to get hurt today. He's one of my best friends. He's my lawyer, my idea friend. He's been trained as youtube for, since that time, almost as 20 years. But I remember that they walk in and the guy bumped into me. He want to fight. Wow. And it's like, man, I walk away. Nah, I just drunk from you, man. Go home. And less.

Speaker 2:          00:40:48       That's the difference too, between Jujitsu and kickboxing. Cause the kickboxing, you can only hurt somebody. You can't really like hold onto him and go, hey, hey, you ever see the [inaudible]? Do you ever see the video? Yeah. He was already ocean when you, right. Ever see the video of Matt Serra, Matt Serra, uh, was in, uh, an altercation with some drunk guy in a, in a bar or a restaurant or something like that. And Matt matches. Took the guy down, mounted them, and was just holding onto his wrist and he was like, calm down, calm down. And the employers are like trying to figure out what to do. He was like, he's fine, he's fine, calm down. But you know, Matt didn't hurt him. He just held onto them and basically just mounted them and grabbed a hold of his wrist and was controlling them. And then when we, she, she too is

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       a gentle word. Yeah. We mean that yes. Usually it's, we'll give you the choice to choose to hurt someone or not. Yeah. And I think why a trainee realize that that person has something already going on in their life. Right. And we choose not to. Yeah. I mean we grew up in our time and it's funny with teenagers in those years you to tournaments and then we go like how are we gonna test ourself and back into the 80s in Brazil we have some fun time. We go to a nightclub and fight breaks through and here we are practicing our Jujitsu but not hurting anybody. And not because we choose or somebody provoke. No, we get people coming towards us cause we always little guys, we'll never be the biggest guys in the police. Then we just make sure like man we take them down, hold joke somebody out, but no scratch.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       And on the end those people become students of our school. Right. Because all those little kids can do that to us. Right. And that's one way. That's funny. In the 80s that usually two became even bigger with some of the altercation on the street. We convinced the person that we just fought, we just choked to come and become our student cause you didn't hurt them. Then they're like mad they and they end up coming and learned that they feel humiliated, but at least they, they feel thankful that you didn't injure them. Uh, for sure. Yeah. And you know, in a five minute, I think you should to give it that sense of control that you have. You have that,

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       well, this is the way I always explained to people. I say if I'm in a street fight with someone and they're swinging, if it's strong person of a strong person, they're good athlete and they have strong arms and they're throwing punches at me. If I get hit, I'm in trouble. No matter who you are. If you get hit, you're in trouble. Most likely I won't get hit if I know how to, how to fight. And I keep my hands up and I move. Right. But if I get a hold of you, you're not doing anything to me. Like there's a difference between like someone who's untrained and someone's trained. Like if a Jujitsu black belt grabs a person and gets off, actually gets control of them. There is no lucky. You're not gonna luckily submit me, you know, it's not going to happen, but you can. Luckily you could hit someone. It can happen in a street fight. If someone has a little bit of speed and they have power and there's a strong person they can hit you. It's much more dangerous. That's the only,

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       and we also want to train, it was the only opportunity or upon enhances before we close the distance, right? That's the danger zone. And if you think for a second, a lot of things that we do on the ground in Jujitsu, you'd just bring those two people up in the close. The distance is the same thing. And a lot of people today, they don't do the same. They tried to fight standing when they hold different than when you're on the ground, the way you move your legs, they way play guard. It's the same thing when you're standing. Work on the people's body as a whole, cause a sweep to make somebody fall. And, uh, and we learned that when we get close to someone, we make this size not affected as much eyes could if you have a distance, do you,

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       I think that there was a transitionary period where a lot of Jujitsu guys were having a hard time cause they were, they didn't know how to take people down. And then the wrestlers were learning how to keep them at distance. They were learning take down defense

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       in, in uh, yes and, and that's the very challenging thing. But if I'm fighting wrestler, what are the chances that he's going to take me down? It's higher than me actually taking him down. Right? And most of the things that we do in the Jujitsu on the, what we see in the sports issues today, we're not gonna use in a real fight, most as you should to see in a tournament. We're not going to use that in a fight. That's the difference from that generation of the 80s to the generations from the 90s until today. It's two different kinds of a Jujitsu. One is a sport which is very beautiful. A lot of people did do amazing techniques, but the rules of the sport had the tenders to take to another direction and when you have [inaudible] as the 80s with practice using a lot of leverage with the arms patients and when we play Gardendale eighties is different than we played today too. They have a lot of gears wrapping around everything. They key became a weapon right in our time. They give us never a weapon. They give us like almost like a paper we use a lot. The neck a lot. The elbow.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       Well that's what helped you when you transitioned to No-gi, right? Well definitely it also because you were born with no fingers on your left hand. Man was no d from me until two days. No difference. Right. I play exactly the same in both, right. No difference at all. But you are all over hooks and under hooks and and grips around the body and whereas the guys who transitioned to MMA and they're all game relied on grabbing collars and sleeves, those guys had the harder time for sure. Yeah. A lot of guys. That's why a lot of guys that are trying to come in, they might be good in their top games, but when they go in their back, yes, they are kind of a little lost until I see this guys how to play the game. Yeah. That's why it's so important. Impressive. When you see a big guy who also has a great back, great office back like Fabrizio over knew him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       I think if you'll notice it, if I'm on the bar of someone and I'm flat, I'm a target, right? I have to change the angle. If I don't change the angle, I'm going to get ground and pound like we've being seen a lot. Yes, you're gonna see some more this a black boundary sheets and then they go like, oh, it just gets flat on his back. That means all my weight now is affecting you. I'm dropping you. You have to learn that your leg should be an angle. This way I'm not able to hit you there. Your legs on the way. And that's one thing that very few guys do it or close the distance or change the angle, but it can be looking at him trying to, we'll hold his neck. He's gonna hit you hard. Well Eddie figured out a brilliant thing with rubber guard when with a brilliant thing with mission control and how to control from the back of the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       He loves the distance closer to the distance. He changed a lot of people's games. What? What that some people don't want to recognize, but they have chu is the idea that he had and I remember him coming up and try some of the techniques and people, oh this is crazy. I said, no man, keep going. This is, you're going to get some, well I don't think, not every body can do that because you have to be a little bit flexible. But once you learn how to do it, you save your life. Yeah. How many guys that when they get a hold of their foot and keep that close is no gap or room for the person on top to hit you. And as you're trying to move too much arm suddenly stuck. Yup, and there we go. Yeah. Closes the distance. You can be playing when my arms are free because I'm going to ground them pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       Especially the heavy guys man. Right. Hit once or twice. That's it. Yeah. He figured out some very unique ways to use his legs and you notice that he closed the distance or he changed the angle. Close the distance, change the angle. Whoever's on top, you don't have space or you don't have the angle. You always in a weird position when they get a hold of your head and the leg the way he does. It's interesting to see the evolution of Jujitsu from 1993 UFC style to 2019 too. There's so many new techniques. There's so many new approaches, but there's some guys like [inaudible] Gracie for instance, who just use the basics honed to raise her sharp edge. You don't see a lot of crazy baron Bolo, chokes or wild things from those. A lot of the like real rock solid traditional techniques, guys, he does simple works all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       Yes, whichever simple works. Are there any things you used to that require more than three steps you need to train a lot, but even Hickson, right? Like Hickson style was the just, it wasn't anything that no one knew how to do, which just he knew how to do it better than anyone. There we go. He's, he's the way he moved. Yes, you can find him. Right and once you find him, he gets out and get you. He goes around your back. It's, it was a middle man triangles. Armbars, rear naked chokes, normal stuff. Normal things that everybody knows how to do. You'll get to his god, you know you're going to find a back. Yes. Simple as that. I'm his guy, I'm gonna fall, follow his back. He's going to sweep me all. I'm not going to sweep all he's going down by me. They may, it's not much way can feel safe and today you see a lot of these usually to have, they need some pickled transition. You go phone number one beginning of the position transition. Then you have the submission today. They jump from number one beginning to the submission is no transition. The transition now is become muscle amped over by never seen so many injuries today in this Jujitsu competition. Really so many injuries, shoulder neath, foot, elbow like my God, what do you think it's from? Because it's no, you're missing a lot of that. Sometimes they finesse to get there. They have to muscle. Well that's

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you about your longevity because you are the best guy that I know of in terms of like you, you are, I mean if you have a little knee injury, little meniscus, but that's it. I've known you forever. You've never had like a major surgery. It never had like a major problem and everybody I know gets hurt. Everybody,

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       man. I again is the way you train, the way you control the fight and I think people can understand is I rather get you once but I get you. Well then trying to get it 20 times. Sometimes people try to go after each other and the injury will happen. Right? Cause the clashing. Exactly. If you have somebody come very tense to me, I don't play tests back. I tried to relax more. You relax more, I'm going to be able to achieve against you. I remember when you competed against Dean lister and he was about 250,000 pounds. Tt was so fucking big. He was so big. And then, but you were able to, there was one of the very big frustration for me on that event because I remember was I'm training to be my weight class below one 70 and that year I will have a with Marcella Garcia, we'll have some good names, good gas to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       And I was training a lot for that. And I think, um, we can a half before the event, um, Aronia was supposed to fight the LR, but back in those days, I think he's called tracked with pride, did not allow him to fight cause their concern is an injury happened. Right. And he's gonna meet me, be missing the pride fight. Then they come a week and a half to offer me death fight and um, and ended up taking their fight. But I don't think I, I train is specific and focused to fight dean. And I think that fight was a process for me. Dina was a monster but it wasn't a good fight was not much happening on the fight. It was mostly he was concern it to move and I was, I felt the difference in the, I was so light and I, I did not train anybody heavy cause I was fine on the one seven.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       I was just trying to, if people that way class in lower to get this speech, be ready for those guys, then here we are week and a half. I don't think I was feeling ready for fight. Somebody this big, my strategy, I have no strategy back down. Okay, let's, let's try to move. But he was very smart, not moving much. I have evidenced to be worried about him, grab a hold, get a hold of my foot. And I think it was 20 minutes, not much happened on their fight. And um, and for me it was, was frustrated not be ready for five like that as I was training to fight in a lower class. I was so ready and I regret not doing that would be amazing. But for the other reason, that movie Aben no problem.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       Well, when you did do Abudabi the first time, I think it was a wake up call for a lot of people that you know because of, you know, being born with no fingers in your hand and your approach to Jujitsu being so over Hook and underhook powered, you know, you, you transitioned so smoothly into No-gi whereas a lot of guys from your era, they would go and transition into Nogi and they really, they were missing so many tools because they're so used to grabbing the game.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       No, what I remember when I got a call to go at nine and nine and um, they said they rules would be 10 minutes, five minutes, first five, nothing counts, right? Then after five, whatever the rules were, I don't even know today what the rules were anyways, what counts on the account, but then realize, man, the first five minutes not counts at, let's go.

Speaker 2:          00:54:40       Right? So if people don't know what we're saying here, I would, Dhabi is a very strange rule set. So for the 10 minute round, the first five minutes of it, there's no points. It doesn't matter what happens if someone takes him back. If you get mounted, you get into a triangle, but you escape. There is no points.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Yeah. And I just go bring that guy to the ground, pulled guard right away and let's go right. And I think was suppressed for a lot of people because right from the bat I keep going all the way. And um, again, with the transition that I, for me, I have no transitions. The same game no-gi right. And I felt at home, yes. That's what I do every day. And I felt a lot of guys not sure how to behave, but in my mind, the first five minutes, nothing counts. That's, it doesn't matter if he mounts me, take my back or do anything. Nothing is realistic. Their whole idea is to make people actually go after charter. Right. But when I get there, I see people waiting, standing five minutes walking around, waiting for the five minutes [inaudible] and then went on one point opposite. But usually, yeah. And I said, hell no. Let's go to the ground, see if he's better grappling than me. Good if it's not good as them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       But it was a wake up call for a lot of people cause they got to see you. Who Do, who did you fight in that first year? He fought sock awry, right? Aye. Yeah. Fought who was a big time MMA fighter at the time. But I can, I think they were well known and very well known and May, may world of it. They're also known as being really good grapplers so it was very eyeopening for people to see you run through,

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       if I'm not wrong with the first loss for Sockeye is first loss. What was fine? I think for me it was, it's my world and let's see if you're better grappler good if you're not. Yeah, we go. Good Fun. Yeah. Yeah. It was fun and I think was, it was very good for me too. All Day. ADCC I was able to be among the best three guys and that was, um, for me was a great accomplishment. Being able to, to stay up in the top of their game and fighting the lighter guys that have your guys and was in special Nokia, which was something that it takes for a lot of people, some kind of adjustment cause they, they born in the gay world base in their game on the g and they have actually some hard time too. And a lot of them even gave up.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       Like, I forget it now. In the early days of Jujitsu, there was a, a lot of No-gi guys on the Luta Levi side, right? There was a v for people don't understand there's a big rivalry in Rio between Jujitsu and Luca Libris. Um, a lot of, a lot of times you have people that come to our school and they don't fit in, they and they walk away. And if find the stood back those days, those guys were some of these people that didn't, did not fit into their Jujitsu schools and then that creating their own, no geese school. But again, understand that. And in the 80s our generation in Rio de Janeiro, summertime, man, it's a 110, 115, extremely humid and we did a lot of trainings with trinity g and after the guest session, like the top of the guilt and here we go, we train ogee since we are white belts, we've been doing that because the intent, we're learn how to get out of our head lock, how to be in the barn and somebody trying to slap you.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       What do you do? And that was our training, that generation. That's why almost everyone from the 80s is still up to date teaching and making a great school. All the jet dead generation still the longevity on them being do Jujitsu still out there. A lot of guys that I see now, especially if their social media, they all teaching, they all doing very well. A lot of them too big. Some of them still in good shape and teaching. But at that generation I think is uh, for me was a golden gold generation cause he's still out there and the people that come from that generation, their students, they developed such a good Jujitsu roots is they're still looted liver, anything anywhere. I think they still have there but there's not a rivalry anymore right now. I don't think today past that time. And I think that their rivalry was a need for our generation to stablish.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       She, it was a very effective art and I think some of the MMA events that happened was the fight to should, should they happen on the, then we're able to bring that into make into an arena. And this way only the two guys would be finding not innocent people get hurt on the street. And I think ways of what people don't realize, there's a lot of those fights could be happened right on the nightclub or some people even get killed now lets bring their fighting to their arena on youtube guys. Nobody else going to get hurt. And that's why a lot of those events happen. No money, no prize money, not just for pride. There's some videos of some of them that still exist. You know, just for pride, there's no money involved in any of those fight on the beach. Who was that on fight?

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       Ugo Duarte. That's right. He'd go, Duarte went on to fight and pride. He fought tank Abbott, right? Man fought some different people. And I remember, I remember that they were so funny because I'm have a point on the beach in Rio that is, it's where most of the shit where the pretty girls were. Then all the guys go in there session the beach, very famous people, and then everybody goes in that session and I would keep it here. The rugal challenge Hexion Luca challenge Hexion Hooga challenge here is right here. Every go smack them in the face then, and he goes like, no, he didn't say anything. And I'm right there. I'm walking right there and a light shorts there. My mission where Hixon look up, look at me and say, hey, watch my back. Where were you? I'm the one. Okay, I'm off the screen now.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       Right on, on my left. You're gonna see me standing there then. Oh, he came right. If, if I get up, I can show you what this fear is. What year? This man, sometime in the 80s and didn't know who's filming that. We have a um, high and Gracie, he was sitting at someone's shoulders with our camera. Crazy to try to see. Oh no man. I was getting so many bodies. I was getting, I was getting punched in the head and back just cause as watching Hickson's but everybody didn't jump in? No, no, no. What we did was we made a circle harms two arms and uh, and Hickson's the one with the green shorts, right? Greenstreet yes. And he had the long hair that they, which they got grabbed his hair. It doesn't look like it's hers that well. Oh No, he is a ponytail there.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       Really? Yeah, I have, I knew he had a ponytail from a advantage of, see now you see Hickson mounting him. Oh no, he, he, he got tired of punching the guy we felt. And so my mission, him punching him. Yeah. There we go. And the guy tap and stop. Please stop and didn't have it. He has a group of guys with him. We want to make sure that nobody jumped on his back. And, but the thing is, we have this in, don't get me wrong, I'm not telling people to go and do that. But in that time and that generation, a lot of those fights that happen in the street with the need for Jujitsu to be established the way should be and was better than two guys finding there. Then that fight end up in a bind and that Glenn mucking five people shooting each other in the, remember Hexion said that we, we get together now our first original Gracie by high school, then some members of other Jujutsu to schools and say, look guys, a Hicks is gonna go, they're gonna make a circle.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       Only him and the guy fight. Nobody else fight. You understand that? Cause if everybody fights then somebody's going to get really hurt cause you're not going to be able to control anything. We just made a big circle. We'll hold hands regardless of what happened. We will not interfere. It's Hickson and the guy and that's it. But want to make sure nobody jumps in then never may say, you got to watch my back. And I go like, oh, okay. Said don't do nothing. I watched my back and he, we arm, I was behind him and I'm getting punched, getting kicked from other people. But the crazy thing was they happen and Hexion on his mind said, look, I'm going to go there, slap him on the face and he's going to run. Then we're like, okay. So he goes there, slept that guy and the guy did not run.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       Then we go, Whoa, shit game on. Then we hold the chart and, and I think it was, uh, this happened on Saturday. Um, Tuesday night ugo went to Hixson school with, uh, a lot of people. They're all carrying weapons. Hexion wasn't there and they call his shows up in shorts and he quickly just slept booboo around. Somebody called the police later on and they even should the ceiling, um, ar 15, whatever, just boom. And they laughed. But then was Hickson just smash him quick cause it was on the cement, not on the sand. Um, but then again happened in a way for us as a pride to prove the point is you to ease the best staff martial arts. Uh, we keep going strong and Ula was alluded lever, a guy who was a looter liver respected, real strong, one of the best guys do today and they had a grappling style.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       It just wasn't as comprehensive back there. They were doing a lot of foot locks already here. The ones that are doing a lot of foot locks and they'll get a lot of Hugh hooks and they have some quality fighters among of them. Definitely Eugenio to Dale or Janita deal and they have, I ended up fighting one of the guys from there and now I want to double dom is there. But as the time goes by, I think people get older, can understand and I don't think today has any conflict or any bad feelings and they must've adopted a lot of the Jujitsu techniques to everything was you, you take the guilt right today, all training. Grappling. Okay. What is the definition of grappling you on the ground fighting then? It's usually it's what do you think about this new trend that you're seeing, like you saw it particularly coming out of John, Donna, her and dean lister with the leg locks like leg locks are so big in, in Jujitsu competition.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       Now when when we learn Jujitsu in stu today, we will not learn anything related to lags until we get our blue belt. The main reason that behind these were to be able to let you the help guard without concern anything just to learn how to move your hips in sweeps and hooks. Foot lock is something very effective, but if I show you right away, I might be stopping some of the evolution of your game or the other person that you train with that he can learn, which will make even better. His Foot luck, right? That's why we hold back until people get up one year, two into Jujitsu to learn leg locks, but today you have the no-gi everybody such in a hurry. Then a lot of No-gi schools, the first thing people wants to learn, hey, I want to learn hill hook. It's usually it's with, gee, I want to learn ombre.

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       They know g wants to go straight to the leg, they get people want to go straight to them. But I think particularly because of the success of these leg lockers against high level competition or know it's effective is amazing. I think it's a portion of the game [inaudible] and you will see the development of people that will have defending that which also will force guys to pass also beyond the legs only. But definitely their work is a very danger. Let people wrap their legs around your leg hook you there. I mean not everybody can get out of that and if you don't tap, you're going to get your knee ripped apart. For sure. And that's the real problem with leg locks is that so many guys wind up with pretty devastating knee injuries in the 80s the the, the decision not to have heel hooks in Jujitsu was for safety.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       We do, we did practice, but the competition does not allow, you gotta understand that in the 80s if you have a knee problem, your career is over, right? There's no surgery that really would fix it correctly. Right. Today is different. Yeah. You understand it's the devolution of the medical side make possible for you to put a brand new knee over there. Yeah. But still to this day, meniscus tears and cartilage tears, those are still huge. I mean without stem cells it's very, very difficult to fix those unless you get the wineskin. Like I had part of my meniscus removed on my left knee and then you see them in, you want to train fall Engevity and your gun understand two is a, I think some of those things should be kind of farmers cranium, a pro league into the Jujitsu world. Cause a lot of people they get hurt before even they learn what Jujitsu is.

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       That's why my only concern is the danger of all those heel hooks. [inaudible] leg locks. Cause if you get somebody who knows he might have or he might roll to the right side, even though a lot of guys do get hurt. Yeah. But if you hold somebody who doesn't have much experience in one of those traps, it's for sure injury. They brought the wrong way and rip it apart themselves. Even if you don't squeeze, it's because they don't know what to do. Right? Yeah, and my, that's my view off as an instructor today on my school center. You're not ready for legs yet, right? Oh, I go to the nugget. Don't go to the Nogi Tournament yet. You have to learn first in the stand for your own safety. And also I want them to develop guard. Cause when we get hired with pool guard, when you get tired, you lie down to sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       You don't sleep standing. You sleep. When you lie down, when Jujitsu is the same thing, you get tired, you're going to pull guard. And that's one of the ways I see some of my students in a tournament. They get tired. He's a top guy. Send his that pulling guard. Does that mean he's tired? He's already once in. That's why you have to have a good guard just to survive and rest to be able to continue. We surprised though that this no-gi leg block games are taken off the way it did. I think because of the success of have so many guys doing extremely well in some of the guys that come from the new ogee originally doing so well now some of the guys that come from the gear world doing No-gi, they've been finding some challenges to adjust to that leg. I think he, in a way, you have two ways that simplify because if you get somebody in a footlocker leg lock there, we go in at the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       You complicate cause you see a lot of scramble now and a lot of injuries as evidenced the same. People don't want attack. Then it's a position that you, some is going to get hurt. Yeah, but I'm, I'm [inaudible] that development and devolution of the, the grappling world and I think it's amazing. It's sooner or later somebody is going to find ways to protect better and better and better and better that will force people to move on. But you seen that I think now with a lot of the leg lock guys against each other. They kind of stalemate and he seen them winning by rear naked choke or Armbar. Again, they're not using the leg locks against each other. They realize like, man, he knows as much as I do now. I need more than that. Yeah, they're using them to sweep or they use them to set up other things.

Speaker 1:          01:10:49       They're trying to exploit other holes like maybe they concentrate too much on leg block so then they, they're open to armbars or chokes. I remember when when I learned in the beginning and we have foot lock as the last resource, let's see him fighting the guy and I man not able to submit him. I'm going to foot lock him. That's how we used to have in the 80s where your Hail Mary lock is, okay, this is my deadly weapon. If everything that I do is not working, I'm going to foot lock him. Today's the opposite. My first shot his foot, lock him all the way. It's not working. I'm going to choke him. Yeah. You see so few foot locks in MMA. It's interesting, right? You see like so few figure four foot locks because the danger also for you to get hit yeah. That sometimes when you do the foot lock your face, your arms are both around the land.

Speaker 1:          01:11:41       You can get a not defending exactly. What do you think about combat Jujitsu at his new invention? Men I think is a way for people to step up to reality and then this thin and some guys make a decision to know what I might be able to go and do MMA too. But that's the real world. Yeah. If you find somebody, that's exactly what's going to happen. Right. And making people more aware of, okay, my Jujitsu for Jujitsu sport only, this is not gonna work there. Well for this kind of, as you sheets, I have now to be aware of more of my real fight. Yeah. And I think it will help more devolution of that sport of Jujitsu to transition to MMA for people to show what combat Jujitsu is. Eddie Bravo invented a way where you do Jujitsu with slaps on the ground and uh, you, you would think it's just, Oh, it's a slap.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       But no, a palm strike really. I mean you really can hit someone very, very hard with your palms. I mean, I can do that with my hand on a table and it doesn't hurt my hand at all. But if I did that with my knuckles it would really hurt. So they're there. They can smack the shit out of each other. We, we still do that after we train Jujitsu is to call in Portuguese that top area second slap each other after the train. No shirts. Yes. And we used to train like that in Brazil. Oh really? Yes. To be ready again. We have no tournaments. I me after the train, let's see. And we stand in front of each other and open hands and, and we go slap each other, make sure I get slapped in the face. But on the end, the train, you have marks all over your body and it still shake your brother's hand.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       I love you, but y'all over mess. Are you still, you still lift weights? Yes, I do. How often do you do that? Two days a week. Two days a week. But I, but I like to run a lie like outdoors. Yeah. I run three, four days a week and usually when you run in trails, I did try my how now it's too hot. I don't know. Unless you go early in the mornings. I go early in the morning, very early in the morning. It was, it was hot this morning when I went. It's very hot right now, but I like it there. I think I want to challenge my body hours to bring the best off the resistance cause I, I think I don't like to go and run the same street over and over again. Somehow. Your body rate again just to that right. I'm always trying to find different, the trays. Yes. This ways I gonna fight you on changes up and down the whole time. Yeah. And, but it's something to [inaudible] dish, which is my excuse to do all of this. I want to go and do better or my students are getting harder. How can I switch that to make not their heart, right. I gotta do a little bit more than I was doing now. How do you mix up your weightlifting training with your Jujitsu training? Do you do it in the morning and then train at night or do you do it after you train?

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       Right now I'm doing before teaching to the train. My intension is when I show up to the academy, I'm already tired physically so that when you do train you can be relaxed. And just this way, my challenge is because I'm physically tired, I make the level of my students higher cause they have a lot of energy and they're good too. It makes more challenge for myself to train with them cause I don't have, okay I manage now I have to purely use the techniques. There's usually two. The techniques has, must be on time. I intend to do that, get their tired to make a good training for me and that's what I've been doing. I show up and they don't know and hey, let's go and train. Then. Uh, I can tell them, man, I should rest before train this guy today. I don't know if he's getting there good until ty, everything's at the same time next week.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       I'm not going to do that again. So when you do it, uh, twice a week, how do you mix it up? Like what, what kind of training you're doing? I work on one one day legs and lower poverty. And that's not the day. Upper body of hours. Yes. Yeah. So it's just to make it stronger, just to keep the joints healthy and evidently fuel the muscles I think is important for its like preventing injuries. Yeah, that's the main thing. Yeah. And I'd be using a lot the, I don't EC stuff. Remember the guy from the, I don't ag, he sent it to me. The equipment I'm using that it's amazing they using that. It is a recommended issue shoe. Two guys for Jujitsu regards, it's, some are going get it man. It's incredible. Or You said something to me once, I'll never forget it. Go. Never Trust.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       You're nice to do. Not Fall out as strong as to get to the, to the neck. You have to be very aware of stuff. Seeing little flashes after that gets dark. Oh yeah. Yeah. We go, oh, I'm DC. No, you're about to go out. My friends trust your neck. Never Trust your neck. Yeah. But at least you could train it safely. Now with the iron neck there was always a bunch of different ways where people trained that were questionable. Like there's a lot of people that don't believe in neck bridges. They said it's actually kind of dangerous and our neck is, if you see the spine is so sensitive you got gotta be careful and work. Your neck issues you treat on, you use our heads on the ground base. Our bottle never. I think that our neck is again is the maintenance of having your neck or well around because that spin, anything that you do man, you work every angle of your neck.

Speaker 1:          01:17:19       Yeah. And I do a very simple exercise. I have ds attaching to a bar and go forward and turn sideways there. She knew the movement. Do you do the Ray Charles very, very slowly have that bungee that keeps more or less nation? Yes. Yeah, that's right side where man I love that machine or that piece of training. It was a a great addition to all the exercise. Thanks to the guys cause it's really, really helpful. Yeah. I recommend it to everybody. It's just, and for fighters that get hit in the head, it's so important to have a strong neck to resist the impact. Your socks will be the muscles around this way. The muscles take the first hit. Just like you're talking about building strength around your joints by lifting weights and protect actually the same thing. Exactly. So are you doing like basic stuff like curls and dips and very busy going in difference different than the time that you're training for competition, which is inhabited a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       Explosions in this way. Just trying to maintain and everything else I do. And she's used to, some days I train pushing more Sundays or pushing less. Some days I just train in defense and they say training. Okay, I gotta finish everybody today or I got amount of bar today. You kind of found, make your training, um, a goal for your training this way. Always excited to do it right. You know, and not having the same thing every day. Now I select OK to them when sweep everybody. Then I pull guard and keep playing guys my go sweep and some guys I'm very hard to sweep another day I just went amount. I can only finish people from the mount and that mean you kind of make different goals and I think that keeps you and again, my students there, it's usually just fun. Come on. Sure. It's fun.

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       You never know what's going to happen, right? It sells. I challenge you goes like, oh man. Then you realize I should sleep two hours extra. I'm tired now for sure. If you really want to find out where your body's at, go train home man. Why I'm so sore. I don't know. And it's usually to test you in every level. Now what about nutrition? I grew up um, did you follow crazy diet? I grew up doing the grace of diet with my uncle Carlos. Could you explain that? Basically men, the dye to be the foods that you combined, right? Some foods. When you make that combination you're not going to get what? Expecting from the food and that's how we learn. I eat a lot of fruits, lots. I don't drink juices in where I make my own juice. That's the only way you can have a proof that is actual fresh, fresh and juice.

Speaker 1:          01:19:59       Right. And if you then very rarely I eat meat, fish and chicken and a Turkey more often than red meats. I remember, I don't remember last time. It's been awhile, but it's basically fruits. He's my, I love it. But Pie in the morning, cream cheese and honey and late at night, sometimes watermelon juice in Tapioca. I don't know if people know what Tapioca is. Sure, yeah. Tapioca pudding. Yeah. Not the pudding. You make. Looks like a Tortilla. You make that in a pan and it's really healthy. Yeah, I was show you how to do. Yeah, it's, it's like a powder. It's like a brute and they shredded the roots in 'em and you, you put in a, in a pan and as the paint gets hit it looks like a Tortilla and Dan's, then you put a cream cheese and it's thousands times health in any kind of breads.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       You've eaten a life. Hmm. I mean things that are good for your body, but basically fruits are my, my main thing. Well, you're always burning off so much energy. Let's do the things. Jujitsu burns off so much energy and if it ended the lifestyle you have, you, you burn more than you eat, you're gonna keep your weight. Four, I weight the same painful in the past 10 years, the same weight. Go up two pounds, go down two pounds, three pounds, go down five pounds. You take any supplements I take. Uh, I take Maca, tumeric pounder and mixing all those juice that I make as a more like preventive things. And if it denti learn, sometimes I'm going to train harder tomorrow, I'm going to eat some carbs today. The carbs will become a lot of energy tomorrow. My training and you basically little things that you learn.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       But for me, the main thing is to stay healthy. Right? There we go. I don't remember last time we sick. No, really? I don't remember this time. Wow. People have headaches. Why have a headache many ways or have a headache? You're not drinking enough water or you need too much sugar on that mean something that you're consuming right now gives you headache. And what about a post workout recovery? Do you use sauna or ice bath or anything, anything like that? Man, the sound is a must. Yeah, I mean I love it. I see you put a lot of [inaudible]. It's a must so eliminates so much and your body's always pure and clean. I love my apps on South Jacuzzi. Therefore I dunno an hour and just forget about life. Yeah, she was brand new after then you have a lot of things that you should do as to keep the longevity of us to be able to do what we want to do and that stay healthy.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       It's a main thing. You stay hiking, stay close to nature, brief trying to breathe good air. It's pretty hot in la, but yeah, you go up in the mountains, man. You feel like, Whoa, it's even in your mind. You already changed the whole thing of a then that's basically stay healthy. I, how can I teach what? Tell my students to do. Some people I'm not doing right. It's like you go to the gym, have two different coaches, one that looks healthy and the one that is, it's pretty big. Which one are you going to pick? The one that knows how to get the way he is. Yeah. When you see guys that start letting themselves go and getting big and fat and it's like, it's very disappointing. Yes, it is. I give a hard time to a lot of people that I know, friends that that goes a man.

Speaker 1:          01:23:30       It's not what you say is what you've been doing. Yeah. And now, Oh, don't do this. Then you're doing what kind of a tomorrow by an example. Yeah. People get tired. They get lazy. Uh, yes, but man, you, you chose the wrong job to be lazy and now you're martial artist. You can be lazy as a martial artist right now, do something to seen in the desk and don't do nothing then that's I understand. But uh, you're doing the martial arts and you get lazy. Now he can't. You become in a way, an example for a lot of people. And that's why I make people do what you do. Yeah, there's no, it's not an option. It's not an option to become [inaudible] at all. And as soon as I see someone who is doing that, who becomes lazy and becomes fat, I just don't, it's, it's unfortunate.

Speaker 1:          01:24:19       You know, it's unfortunate you're making a mistake. I try, I try to understand and sometimes I don't. I said, look man, again, you chose the wrong line of work. Yeah, they, me, you're telling me that you don't like what you do cause you feel like what you do, you're not going to be the way you are right now. And it's a Juju to working for you now, which should be working right now more than ever. Well that's one of the great things about you and my brothers. You've always been a great example and you've always been a person who leads by example by the way, the things you say, but more importantly by the things you do for sure. And I know that a lot of in a, I think we learned through the years that what you say and what you do will affect a lot of people out there and especially now in the social media, get so many great inputs for people that I have no idea who they are.

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       Like, oh, thank you for this. Thank you for that. Thank you for you to put a good quote out there. I think those little things, uh, have an impact in hours in a lot of people and a, I can't forget that and man, I love what I do. I never had that job. They have a works and now I train Jujitsu and the amazing things, they give me money to lose you shit. They pay me to do this. Like I can't be. Thank you. Then they know never had it. You, you have a great life. You make friends everyday. Yeah. And now you make friends every day and you kind of, I able now to help people just with something that you say. Um, sometimes I have a higher belt students or even lower belt students that show up for training. And I learned that with one store.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       My uncle told me he, Uncle Carl is he and he used to leave it there. And uh, and uh, back in those days he observed a lot of things in uh, he has, uh, it was a time that in braze you have a lot of cock fighters and he has his regular rooster. Then he said, man, I'm going to make him money if he's rooster. I said, okay, and I'm going to see how long the rooster actually fights. And when I noticed the time, how long he fights, every time he's fighting, I'm going to get the real, the cock fight it, stop moving him out and the rooster think he's winning. He's been doing that for awhile. Then he realized the rooster can only stay in the fight for two minutes. After two minutes he run. Then he goes to arena and challenge anybody there with his rooster.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       It was not made for fight to fight in one, therefore one minutes and they bet the money. And for one minute the rooster get beat up, but fought for one minutes did not run. Then one minute up he got his rooster. Give me them. Oh let it fights and now I said one minute, the point was, I have guys that come to my school and they're not having a good day and I can't tell that by looking to their face and I'm start training them and I let them give me a hard time and I go like, man, what's wrong with you today? You kicked my butt today and I can see the change that made than that person. And I use that to train a lot of my students. I'll give one example. Our friend Eddie, when he was, before he fired Tyler, when he called me in, he wasn't in the best of his game and I know his could be an amazing on the beginning, prohibits anybody to give him a hard time or anything.

Speaker 1:          01:27:57       As he started building up. Then towards the end the say man kick his butt. He was so good and confident. After few months, nobody could even get close to the nothing to him. Said, man, you ready? You ready for a fight? But on the beginning, this was my way to work out his psychological to build him up. He wasn't in the best shape. He was in training, said no, you can't train to fish tune as everybody does what you do. You're going to find somebody who doesn't do what you do. When a train of people that do what the other guy do. And here we are in three months, we've made him a monster and he did what he did in his fight. We're using the same idea of my uncle telling me his story to make you start believing and towards the end that other guys, man get him.

Speaker 1:          01:28:45       Nobody could get even close. Isn't that funny? How much of it is psychological? Cause when you're are tired but you start doing well, all of a sudden you have energy. It's all in your mind. And one of the things, uh, I tried to remember who said that in uh, we grew up in the fighting world. Lauer's seeing summarized will she do in the war and have a lot of good quotes. And one of them was, um, whenever we think you're tired, your opponent is debt. I was remember that until today. I remember a yellow belt. One of my cousins told me that, man, when you're tired, you're pointing these dead that keeps you going. Your opponent is dead, he's dead and he's, he's way more tired than you are. That's the time you have to push instead of trying to conserve. No. Now push for what? If you're tired and he's not. This is, this is the mindset. Then Jujitsu gives you the tools but makes you never give up. You can be tired and we all going to be tying the fight, that's for sure, but you not going to give up. How important do you think it is to do additional conditioning other than just taking classes?

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       If you want to go and participate in a, in an event that tournament training, dishes you to train today, you're going to do well. If you want to win the tournament, then you have to do more. You have to work out. You have to do your physical because that hour involves if your mindset, a lot of people they get nervous because they feel that already. Do you ever think that you'll have a Jujitsu school that also has weights and cardio equipment and things like that and maybe even classes to help supplement Jujitsu training? I think I'll be a dream school for sure because a lot of people do not realize how beneficial that would be for them in general. Right? Not only for Jujitsu because I keep telling people now is put them in their minds for them to get better and believe in themselves, but when they do, those things are challenged themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:30:53       If you challenge yourself every day, you're going to bring the best of you every day. You should do the same thing every day. You already know what's going to happen. I never challenge a shelf. You're going to bring something better and better. You're going to grow more inciting and stop believing so much more. That capability that you have, that would be a dream school. I don't know. Any school that has like a real comprehensive gym strength and conditioning gym attached to a Jujitsu school to school. I don't know any martial art MMA places do and they may places. Yeah, like all those big gyms. Yeah, but a lot of things like sometimes someone may ask me and my thought above was this, when you go to MMA gym and I think today the specific for MMA, I mean they train enough grappling for MMA. They train enough punching for MMA, which is amazing, but it's like you're going to a hospital, you go, they have a general doctor, but if you need a specialist and got to go to the school that is specific for that purpose striking or she she to even though now the biggest ones, Jim's out there, they have the best instructors of anything all together.

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       Right, like American top team, right? They have, yeah. Ricardo Laborio, they had the best grappling culture could have the wrestling, but not all the schools are like that. Right. That's a rare one. It's very challenging because of sometimes the ego among the instructors shore who the fight is going to listen to, right? You get a lot of Jujitsu fighters and start training with strike and coach and the striking coach has them convinced that they're a Stryker. And I think the biggest challenge for the MMA guys is when is the right time for me to transition from standing to the ground or the ground to standing. And that's the ones that find the right momentum to do that. They're the ones that are winning. And I know my uncle Hila said, man, sooner or later they're going to get your number. I mean that's, they made me world very hard for it to retire it without and when is the right time to retire?

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       Right? Yeah. It's hard to figure out for many, many fighters now, it's a lot of the things, maybe money issues or maybe I didn't want to give up being famous. A lot of things involve when I should retire. Like now. Well, we've been around for a long time and we've seen a lot of fighters fight long past where they should have retired. That's when they can get hurt really bad. Yeah. And see that's when the, the injury can be resting, be with him for a very long time. Yeah. It's, does it bother you when you see that? Like particularly like older fighters getting knocked out? Man, for me, I think the people surround them should be say, hey, yeah, enough is enough to know. And um, I hope all of them, and I think the way these two days, everyone is able to make good for their lives with say enough money that they can live well.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       Not all of them are fortunate. That's why they have to keep fighting as much as they can. But it's a very challenging, I think he's, I'll have to understand his a short career. You don't have 20 years fighting. You have to understand is my body can take this much, but after a certain point, many in you can get hurt really bad. Um, just so everybody knows on the wall, the studio right there does John Jack Machado's coral belt right there on that wall in the studio. It's prominently, man, you gave me that. I only made, I only made 10 of those. One of them was right there. And my brother and I, all four, I gotta be for a special person. Joe Hogan. Man, it's awesome. Well thank you for everything man. Thank you for teaching me Jujitsu. Thank you for being such a great leader and a role model and just thanks for being here brother.

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       I really appreciate you. So Pedro, thank you for having me here and now I can. People don't keep asking, hey, why don't you go to seed, you're holding your tongue SCG Haggadah time. And I think it a great pleasure for me to be here. Amazing to see the transformation. And I think in the mixed martial arts world, in the martial arts world, how important was to have someone like you that knows what you're talking about. Cause I remember the first few days of UFC, uh, please UFC understand Joe Hogan was much bigger than UFC and I think you've see reach out to a point like that to have someone like you pushing and you have so many people that loves you, that follows you. And the UFC was, is your device of UFC and now, and don't get me wrong, those guys out there, but uh, when you are talking and you have all those may fights there is very different than when you see the other guys talking about, because I know the involvement that you have in a martial arts and the knowledge that you have. And it's way too good to be here. Men in all this specimen years see the amazing journey to follow. You see you're getting bigger and bigger and uh, be able to sit there from the beginning is amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       Well thank you. And I promise I'll be training soon. Soon as his knee feels better, I'll be back. Um, and uh, in Tarzana, that's your main school. The Malibu one unfortunately was affected by the fires, but Jay is now teaching somewhere else in the valley. Right. What was he teaching? I think we, we have a lot affiliation squares around here and we have one in Chatswood. We have one in, that's where J J Basie goes. He goes there on Fridays. Yeah, it's the kings. I'll have the women's combat sports. Yes. Yeah. And your gym. The Machado Jujitsu Academy is in Tarzana. And, uh, you could find it online. Yeah, it would be. I was 27 years and now we're probably going to be moving around the area for something that we need more space. I'm fortunate and fortunate the same. Fortunately the know it up [inaudible] to this podcast. Uh, we see it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:49       Yeah. That's going to be even more fucking crazy. Anything that comes out at you. Hogan gets, I love you again, Porsche. Well, listen, you have the best fucking school I've ever been to in the world. And a, it's a beautiful environment and it's a brotherhood and sisterhood and that's one of the best things about it is how, how much it is like family over there. It's like everyone who trains with you has the US utmost respect for you and the way you are and the way you treat people. It rubs off on everybody. You really, genuinely do. Make people a better person. Thank you, sir. Now she'll be back soon on the mat. All right, my brother [inaudible] thank you. Bye everybody.
