00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
 .. 

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.050
 Let's try other verbal tasks. This first 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.660
 is a classic. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.020
 The Briton has $ 2 and 25 cents in pennies and dimes. 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.750
 If it has a total of 40 coins, how many 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.175
 has every value? 

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.770
 First define the variables. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.175
 The letter n will be the number of dimes. 

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.760
 ... 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.810
 And letter d the number of pennies. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.010
 We know he has a total of $ 2 and $ 25 cents. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.690
 in dimes and dimes. 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.760
 How much is a coin from each value? 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.330
 So if we take the number of dimes, everyone has 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.630
 value of $ 0.05. 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.030
 So the number of pennies by 0.05 is how much money 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.790
 they represent pennies, plus the amount of money 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.270
 that represent dimes. 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.290
 So we have d dimes. 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 Each has a value of $ 0.1. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.070
 Each has a value of $ 0.1. 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490
 So that's the total amount of money we have. 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 If we have 5 dimes, multiply by 0.05 five and get 0.25. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.370
 If we had 4 dimes, it would make 0.40 and add up 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.940
 it together. 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.550
 Our assignment says the total amount we have 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.400
 are $ 2 and 25 cents. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 This first claim can be transferred 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.180
 into this equation. 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620
 We have a certain number of dimes and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.930
 a certain number of dimes. 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.760
 Multiply by 0.05 the number of dots and 0.1 the number of dimes 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.930
 and we get 2.25. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.400
 Now the second statement - we have a total of 40 coins. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.790
 And we assume they're just dimes and dimes, 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.470
 no more coins. 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.380
 So a total of 40 coins, that is, the number 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.820
 the number of dimes plus a total of 40. 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.590
 So dimes plus dimes - equal to 40. 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.020
 This tells us this information. 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.440
 So we have two equations with two unknowns and 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.530
 two ways to calculate it. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.050
 We can construct a system of two equations and subtract one 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.400
 equation from the other. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.490
 Or we can make a substitution. 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.030
 Let's try it. 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.010
 This is a more common way. 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.650
 So - what we do: we solve the equation for d. 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.800
 We could solve it for any unknown, but 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.030
 we find out how much d is and what comes out 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 we replace d here in this equation. 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.070
 First, we subtract n from both sides of the equation - 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.710
 - Here we go. 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.760
 Minus n plus this, minus n. 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.350
 Of course, this has to be deducted from both sides and will stay with us, 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.900
 that d equals 40 - n. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.460
 Now we take the result 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.500
 and substitute it in the second equation. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.480
 d is equal to 40 minus 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.620
 number of dots. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 And we can put it back in d. 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.770
 The first equation will now be 0.05 times 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.890
 number of dots plus 0.1 times 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.790
 number of dimes. 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.040
 So we already know that the number of dimes is 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.200
 equal to 40 minus n. 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470
 We learned that from the second statement. 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.820
 So instead of d I substitute 40 minus n. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.670
 That's the number of dimes we have. It's 40 minus 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.750
 the number of dimes, and that equals two dollars and twenty-five cents. 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 And now we can try to solve it for n. 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.720
 So we get 0.05 times n plus 0.1 times 40 - that's 4. 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.130
 See how we multiply it. 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.970
 0.1 times 40, that is 4 minus 0.1 times n, 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:07.030
 this is how I multiplied the parenthesis, and that equals two dollars twenty five cents. 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.530
 And what do we do next? 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.199
 Now we either take 0.05 and subtract 0.1 from it 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.285
 depending on how we want it - when we subtract these two members 

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:28.870
 we get to minus - 0.05 minus 0.1 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 - by subtracting we get a negative number 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.820
 plus 4 - this four still remains 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.370
 and equals 2.25 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.220
 Now we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.250
 We get minus 0.05n equals (if we subtract 4 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.840
 left - the four must go away - subtract 4 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.020
 even here; 2.25 minus 4 - that is minus 1.75 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.490
 OK. 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.020
 Now we multiply both sides of the equation by minus one, 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.960
 to make it easier, so we have it 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.280
 plus and plus. 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.390
 And then we divide both sides by 0.05. 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.200
 We could just divide both sides minus 0.05 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.160
 but I like everything positive. 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:24.640
 So, when we divided everything by 0.05, we got n equal to 1.75 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.176
 refracted 0.05. 

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:30.235
 So let's divide it. 

00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:32.750
 I'll write it in a different color. 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.880
 So we divide by 1.75 / 0.05. Multiply first 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.680
 numerator and denominator stem. 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.710
 Let's move two decimal places 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.080
 so we will have 5 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.270
 and 175 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.450
 It's the same as 175 over 5. 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.330
 17 divided by five are 3. 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.160
 3 times five is fifteen 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.480
 2 on 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.370
 We write 5. 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.080
 25. 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.260
 25 divided by 5 is 5. 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.400
 5 times 5 is twenty-five. 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.740
 We have no rest. 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.830
 So it equals 35. 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.170
 thus n is equal to 35 and we can find out how much d is equal to d 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.440
 40 minus n. 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.960
 thus, d is equal to 40 minus 35, which is 5. 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.310
 So we have 5 dimes and 35 dimes. 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.970
 And to make sure it's right, 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.600
 35 pennies gives how many? 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.210
 35 times 5 cents 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.400
 is 175 cents, or seventy-five cents. 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.890
 $ 1 and 75 cents in pennies. 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.170
 35 times 5 or 0.05, 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.060
 as you want. 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.150
 So this must be 5. 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.740
 And this is going to be 50 cents in dimes. 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.200
 1.75 plus 0.5 - this is a total of two dollars twenty-five cents. 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.280
 Let's calculate one more verbal role. 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.480
 We have patterns of squares. 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.620
 Here we see them. 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.870
 Here we see them. 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.340
 How many squares are in the twelfth pattern? 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.150
 Let's look at it. 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.280
 This is the first, this second and the third figure. 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.830
 Here's a single square 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.720
 here are two times two, but this block is missing 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.140
 right here. 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.170
 So let's look at it. 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.020
 One way to look at it is 2 times 2, 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:51.250
 and here 3 times 3, but from here 2 times 2 are taken out. 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.120
 So the next one will be 4 times 4 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.140
 and the removed block will be 3 times 3. 

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.000
 I would say one way to describe the number of squares - 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.826
 - actually, the simplest way, we don't have to 

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:14.780
 don't even think. Let's see, here we have three and then we have 

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.340
 3 minus 1 here. 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.150
 Highlight it with a different color. 

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.570
 3 minus 1 here. 

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.220
 Here we have 2 and here 2 minus 1. 

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.740
 And here we have 1 and 1 minus 1. 

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.840
 So zero. 

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.799
 In general, the number of squares for any n will be 

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:43.169
 n plus n minus 1. 

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:48.910
 Which is 2n minus1. 

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.300
 And it works. 

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.290
 2n-1 

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.550
 2 times 3 minus 1 is 5 

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.890
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.350
 It works with these three shapes. 

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.520
 So for the twelfth pattern, where n equals 12, that will be 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.460
 2 times 12 minus 1, ie 24 minus 1 

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.710
 which equals 23 squares in the twelfth pattern. 

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.450
 Although I said we will only calculate one more task, but let's go one more, 

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.610
 when we started. 

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.470
 Grace rode a bike at 12 miles an hour. 

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.220
 An hour later, Dan took the same route at 15 miles an hour. 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.900
 How long will it take before 

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.430
 Grace will finish? 

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:39.940
 So let's mark the time Grace is going, like t. 

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.510
 Or better 

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:48.180
 t will be Dan's driving time. 

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.010
 How long will it take to ride Grace? 

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.430
 Dan left an hour later. 

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.420
 Dan left an hour later. 

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.380
 So, whatever the number, Grace must go 

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.390
 one hour longer. 

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:07.370
 So t plus 1 equals Grace driving time. 

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.025
 When this is 0, this will be 1. 

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.480
 She will already have a 1 hour drive. 

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.240
 And we have to remember that the distance is equal 

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.990
 Speed ​​times time. 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:28.450
 So Dan's distance will be 15 miles an hour 

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.580
 times time in hours. 

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.250
 That's the distance Dan went. 

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.630
 And then Gracina's distance - we can call her g, 

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:42.420
 or let's say D for Grace, it's also her distance traveled - 

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.500
 - It'll be 12 miles an hour. 

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.730
 So her time will be t plus one. 

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.280
 It goes one hour longer 

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.090
 than Dan. 

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.350
 12 times t plus 1. 

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.290
 And the point they meet is a point 

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.380
 in which both sides are equal. 

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.330
 Dan's distance traveled will be equal 

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.760
 the distance Grace had driven. 

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.260
 So these two items must be equal. 

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.750
 15 times t - that's how far Dan came - 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.910
 - must be equal 

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.080
 12 times t plus 1. 

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.020
 And that's how far Grace came. 

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.270
 And remember, its time must always be one hour more 

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.290
 than Dan's. 

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.720
 So let's count the time. 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:36.350
 We have 15t equals 12t plus 1. 

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.010
 12t plus 1. 

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.810
 And then we subtract 12 - excuse 12t plus 12 - 

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.190
 we don't want to make a mistake here. 

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.840
 When we subtract 12 on both sides of the equation, we get 

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.940
 3t equals 12. 

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.940
 Divide both sides by three - moving it a little lower - 

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.990
 And we find that t equals 4. 

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:05.290
 So after 4 hours, after 4 hours, 

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.400
 caught up with Dan Grace. 

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.240
 This is Dan and if his journey lasted for 4 hours, Grace had to 

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.370
 go 6 hours. 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.060
 6 hours is Grace's time. 

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.030
 And Dan after 4 hours - 4 times 15 

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.860
 drove 60 miles 

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.220
 And Grace - excuse me, she went 1 hour earlier so it 

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.300
 it's not six o'clock, just one hour longer than Dan. 

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.000
 So it's 5, it's been a total of 5 hours. 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.730
 Grace was pedaling for 5 hours at 12 miles an hour. 

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:46.100
 And she drove, again, 60 miles. 

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.480
 So they met exactly after sixty miles. 

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.000
 ..
