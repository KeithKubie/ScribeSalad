00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:02.303
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:04.578
Broadly we're talking
about irregular verbs,

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:06.640
but more specifically today
we're gonna talk about

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.867
the -en ending, which is
why I'm calling this lecture

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:14.395
taken for a ride, because
of this little -en thing.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:16.763
So we've spoken previously
about verbs that show

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.830
their past tense or their past perfect

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.056
or past participle forms by
changing their vowel sound,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.058
like the verb to sing, right?

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.125
Present tense sing, past tense sang,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.329
past perfect aspect, had sung.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.043
So some of the words we're
going to be talking about

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:36.061
today also have that vowel change,

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.988
but what's different about them is that

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:41.518
for the past-perfect
or past-participle form

00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:45.511
instead of -ed, it's -en.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.788
Let me explain.

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:48.297
The verb to tear, right?

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:50.457
In its present tense it's tear,

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:51.920
I tear this piece of paper.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.451
(paper tearing)

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.005
Past tense, I tore this piece of paper.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.830
And in the past perfect, it's I had torn.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.839
Ah, I probably shouldn't have done that,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.511
I had notes on that paper.

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:07.088
Some verbs that fall into
the category of the -en

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:11.082
past perfect have
regular-seeming past tenses.

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:13.079
So for example, the word show.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.190
I show him the book,
she showed me the book,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.627
we had shown them the book.

00:01:19.627 --> 00:01:22.993
So we're still getting this n sound.

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.199
Same thing goes with prove.

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:26.578
Present tense, prove.

00:01:26.578 --> 00:01:28.296
Past tense, proved.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:32.452
Past perfect, proven.

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:34.635
Same deal for the verb to bite.

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:37.909
I bite, it bit, I was bitten,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.216
or it had bitten.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.746
The present tense of to ride is ride,

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.137
to past is rode, and the past perfect,

00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:53.061
or past participle, is
had ridden, or was ridden.

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:54.171
As in, the horse was ridden all around

00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.821
the countryside.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:57.655
The verb to eat works this way.

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.488
Present tense eat, past tense ate,

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:03.855
past participle or past
perfect is had eaten

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.132
or was eaten.

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:06.780
So I had eaten earlier,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.520
or the cookie was eaten by Stew.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.564
The verb speak undergoes that vowel shift,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.212
so it goes speak in the present tense,

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:15.789
spoke in the past tense
and past participle

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.087
or past perfect is spoken.

00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:23.870
Even really words like to
be and to go obey this rule.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.580
The -en rule.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.669
It just doesn't necessarily look like it.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.175
So to be, the past of that is either was

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:32.395
or were.

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.178
But the past perfect form of that is been,

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:41.451
which is just be with an
-en ending on it, right?

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:43.563
Go is the same way.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.625
So even though go has a
really weird past form,

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.480
I go, she went,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.359
the past perfect or past participle form

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.261
is gone.

00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.475
And sure, the letters
aren't in the right order,

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:00.612
but the sound is there.

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:02.122
Gone.

00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:03.306
Irregular verbs are weird,

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:05.070
there's not denying it.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.948
But we can break them down,
and they can be understood.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:11.154
And you can learn anything.

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:12.774
David out.
