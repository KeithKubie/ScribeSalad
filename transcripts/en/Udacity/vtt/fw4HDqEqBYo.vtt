not respond to the drug
that worked before?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.340
Select the most likely reason.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.860
Is it because the patient is mutated?

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.970
The cancer started growing
faster than drug could kill it.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.470
The cancer had mutated.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.100
Or none of these.
