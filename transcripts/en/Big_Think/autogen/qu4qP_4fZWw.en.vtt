technological change what they could
 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.230
technological change what they could
keep up with is which professional

already do this in various disciplines
 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.120

it's just new for AI you say you have to

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130
it's just new for AI you say you have to
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.370
it's just new for AI you say you have to
achieve the moral standards of at least

about what's what's okay and that sort
 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.290
about what's what's okay and that sort
of allows you to kind of a loose

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300
of allows you to kind of a loose
 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.730
of allows you to kind of a loose
coupling because it's wrong for

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740
coupling because it's wrong for
 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.640
coupling because it's wrong for
professional organizations to you know

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650
professional organizations to you know
 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.100
professional organizations to you know
to enforce a lot to go after people to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110
to enforce a lot to go after people to
 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.360
to enforce a lot to go after people to
sue them whatever that's not what

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370
sue them whatever that's not what
 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.550
sue them whatever that's not what
professional organizations are for but

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560
professional organizations are for but
 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170
professional organizations are for but
it's also sensible the profession it is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180
it's also sensible the profession it is
 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.910
it's also sensible the profession it is
what professional organizations are for

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
what professional organizations are for
 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.530
what professional organizations are for
is to keep up with their own field and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540
is to keep up with their own field and
 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.560
is to keep up with their own field and
to set things like codes of conduct and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570
to set things like codes of conduct and
 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.840
to set things like codes of conduct and
so that's so that's why you want to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850
so that's so that's why you want to
 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.520
so that's so that's why you want to
bring those two things together the the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530
bring those two things together the the
 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.230
bring those two things together the the
executive government and the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240
executive government and the
 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.820
executive government and the
professional organizations and you can

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830
professional organizations and you can
 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.260
professional organizations and you can
kind of have the legislature joining

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
kind of have the legislature joining
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.760
kind of have the legislature joining
those two together this is what I'm

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770
those two together this is what I'm
 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.070
those two together this is what I'm
working hard to keep in the regulations

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080
working hard to keep in the regulations
 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.960
working hard to keep in the regulations
that it's always people and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970
that it's always people and
 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.440
that it's always people and
organizations that are accountable and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
organizations that are accountable and
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.600
organizations that are accountable and
so then they will be motivated to make

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610
so then they will be motivated to make
 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.759
so then they will be motivated to make
sure that they can demonstrate they

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769
sure that they can demonstrate they
 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.339
sure that they can demonstrate they
follow due process so both the people

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349
follow due process so both the people
 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.820
follow due process so both the people
who are operating the AI and the people

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
who are operating the AI and the people
 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.880
who are operating the AI and the people
who develop the AI because it's going to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890
who develop the AI because it's going to
 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.870
who develop the AI because it's going to

whether it's a car accident normally you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
whether it's a car accident normally you
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.300
whether it's a car accident normally you
know the driver is at fault sometimes

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
know the driver is at fault sometimes
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.770
know the driver is at fault sometimes
the person that hit is at fault because

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
the person that hit is at fault because
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.490
the person that hit is at fault because
they did something completely

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
they did something completely
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.570
they did something completely

right but sometimes the manufacturer you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320
right but sometimes the manufacturer you
 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.540
right but sometimes the manufacturer you
know did something wrong with the brakes

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
know did something wrong with the brakes
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180
know did something wrong with the brakes
and and that's a real problem

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190
and and that's a real problem
 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.570
and and that's a real problem
so we need to be able to show that the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
so we need to be able to show that the
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120
so we need to be able to show that the
manufacturer followed good practice and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
manufacturer followed good practice and
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.040
manufacturer followed good practice and
it really is the fault of the driver or

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
it really is the fault of the driver or
 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.960
it really is the fault of the driver or
sometimes that really there isn't a

there isn't a fact of the matter like it
was just a unforeseeable thing in the

was just a unforeseeable thing in the
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720
was just a unforeseeable thing in the
past but of course now it's happened so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
past but of course now it's happened so
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.790
past but of course now it's happened so
in the future we'll be more careful that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
in the future we'll be more careful that
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.680
in the future we'll be more careful that
just happened recently in Europe there

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230
happy only to get you know money from
 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.140

insurance or whatever the liability or
 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.380
insurance or whatever the liability or
whatever he wanted to know that whoever

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390
whatever he wanted to know that whoever
 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.840
whatever he wanted to know that whoever
who had caused this accident was being

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
who had caused this accident was being
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.730
who had caused this accident was being
held accountable so there was a big

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740
held accountable so there was a big
 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.890
held accountable so there was a big
lawsuit and and that company was

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
lawsuit and and that company was
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.690
lawsuit and and that company was
absolutely it was a car manufacturing

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700
absolutely it was a car manufacturing
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.860
absolutely it was a car manufacturing
company they're able to show they

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
company they're able to show they
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.350
company they're able to show they
followed due process they've been

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
followed due process they've been
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.690
followed due process they've been
incredibly careful this was just like a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
incredibly careful this was just like a
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.850
incredibly careful this was just like a
really unlikely thing to have happened

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860
really unlikely thing to have happened
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.230
really unlikely thing to have happened
to have that kind of stroke that she'd

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240
to have that kind of stroke that she'd
 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.790
to have that kind of stroke that she'd
be holding on to the steering wheel and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800
be holding on to the steering wheel and
 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.500
be holding on to the steering wheel and
all these other things and so it was

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510
all these other things and so it was
 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.090
all these other things and so it was
decided that there was nobody actually

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100
decided that there was nobody actually
 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.710
decided that there was nobody actually
at fault but it could have been

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720
at fault but it could have been
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.100
at fault but it could have been
different

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110
different
 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.200

if Facebook is really moving fast and
 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.030
if Facebook is really moving fast and
breaking things then they're going to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040
breaking things then they're going to
 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.250
breaking things then they're going to
have a lot of trouble proving that they

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260
have a lot of trouble proving that they
 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.110

analytic I got the data that it got and

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280
analytic I got the data that it got and
 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.060
analytic I got the data that it got and
so so they are very likely to be held to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070
so so they are very likely to be held to
 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.979
so so they are very likely to be held to

been a negative consequence of that
behavior and it's something that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
behavior and it's something that
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.980

computer scientists should want that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990
computer scientists should want that
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.409
computer scientists should want that
that tech completion wants they should

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419
that tech completion wants they should
 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.080
that tech completion wants they should
want to be able to show that they've

want to be able to show that they've
 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.370
want to be able to show that they've
done the right thing

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380
done the right thing
 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.370
done the right thing
so there's so everybody who's ever made

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380
so there's so everybody who's ever made
 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.050
so there's so everybody who's ever made
any code at all knows there's like two

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060
any code at all knows there's like two
 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.150
any code at all knows there's like two
different pressures one is you want to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
different pressures one is you want to
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.080
different pressures one is you want to
have clean beautiful code that you can

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090
have clean beautiful code that you can
 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.580
have clean beautiful code that you can
understand it's well documented and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
understand it's well documented and
 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.170
understand it's well documented and
everything and and you know that's good

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180
everything and and you know that's good
 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.610
everything and and you know that's good
because then if you ever need to change

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
because then if you ever need to change
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.160
because then if you ever need to change
it or extend it or you want to write

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170
it or extend it or you want to write
 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.960
it or extend it or you want to write
some more software right that's great

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970
some more software right that's great
 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.820
some more software right that's great
you can reuse it other people can reuse

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830
you can reuse it other people can reuse
 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.440
you can reuse it other people can reuse
it maybe you'll get famous for your

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450
it maybe you'll get famous for your
 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.870
it maybe you'll get famous for your
great code right the other thing is that

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880
great code right the other thing is that
 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.730
great code right the other thing is that
you want to put stuff out as soon as you

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740
you want to put stuff out as soon as you
 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.860
you want to put stuff out as soon as you
can because you can sell it faster you

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870
can because you can sell it faster you
 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.510
can because you can sell it faster you
you don't have time whatever you want to

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520
you don't have time whatever you want to
 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.760
you don't have time whatever you want to
go do something else and so that's why

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770
go do something else and so that's why
 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.260
go do something else and so that's why
you make or maybe you don't even

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270
you make or maybe you don't even
 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.880
you make or maybe you don't even
understand you that what's you're really

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890
understand you that what's you're really
 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.200
understand you that what's you're really
doing and you've just barely got it to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210
doing and you've just barely got it to
 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.780
doing and you've just barely got it to
work or whatever so those two pressures

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790
work or whatever so those two pressures
 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.190
work or whatever so those two pressures
are always working on each other right

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200
are always working on each other right
 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.700
are always working on each other right
and it's really really important for all

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710
and it's really really important for all
 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.800
and it's really really important for all
of our benefit for society's benefit

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810
of our benefit for society's benefit
 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.070
of our benefit for society's benefit
that we put weight on that side of that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080
that we put weight on that side of that
 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.630
that we put weight on that side of that
nice clean code so that we can tell

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640
nice clean code so that we can tell
 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.850
nice clean code so that we can tell
questions like I just I like the one I

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
questions like I just I like the one I
 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.380
questions like I just I like the one I
just mentioned the questions like who's

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390
just mentioned the questions like who's
 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.060
just mentioned the questions like who's
at fault if data goes the wrong place

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070
at fault if data goes the wrong place
 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.910
at fault if data goes the wrong place
right so right now that's not the way

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920
right so right now that's not the way
 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.680
right so right now that's not the way
it's been going it has been completely

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690
it's been going it has been completely
 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.330
it's been going it has been completely
you know sort of Wild West so nobody can

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340
you know sort of Wild West so nobody can
 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.710
you know sort of Wild West so nobody can
tell where the data is going right but

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720
tell where the data is going right but
 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.210
tell where the data is going right but
with a few lawsuits with a few big

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220
with a few lawsuits with a few big
 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.160
with a few lawsuits with a few big
failures I think everyone's going to be

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170
failures I think everyone's going to be
 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.380
failures I think everyone's going to be
motivated to say no I want I want to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390
motivated to say no I want I want to
 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.360
motivated to say no I want I want to
show that the AI did the right thing and

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
show that the AI did the right thing and
 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.600
show that the AI did the right thing and
it was the owners fault or that we we

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610
it was the owners fault or that we we
 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.760
it was the owners fault or that we we
followed due diligence and that was an

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770
followed due diligence and that was an
 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.680
followed due diligence and that was an
unforeseeable consequence you know

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690
unforeseeable consequence you know
 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.450
unforeseeable consequence you know
they're gonna want to prove that stuff

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460
they're gonna want to prove that stuff
 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.250
they're gonna want to prove that stuff
and like I said that's going to benefit

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260
and like I said that's going to benefit
 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.170
and like I said that's going to benefit
not just the companies and not just the

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180
not just the companies and not just the
 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.570
not just the companies and not just the
the owners or operators but all of us

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580
the owners or operators but all of us
 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.440
the owners or operators but all of us
because it's we want liability to be on

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450
because it's we want liability to be on
 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.120
because it's we want liability to be on
the people who are making the decisions

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130
the people who are making the decisions
 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.670
the people who are making the decisions
right and so that's the right way around

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680
right and so that's the right way around
 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.410
right and so that's the right way around
so that's that's what we want to

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420
so that's that's what we want to
 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.750
so that's that's what we want to
maintain human accountability even

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760
maintain human accountability even
 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.190
maintain human accountability even

sometimes taking decisions the thing

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420
sometimes taking decisions the thing
 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.090
sometimes taking decisions the thing
that drives me crazy astir organizations

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100
that drives me crazy astir organizations
 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.780
that drives me crazy astir organizations
do wrong about AI right now is when they

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790
do wrong about AI right now is when they
 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.930
do wrong about AI right now is when they
go in and try to fight regulation by

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
go in and try to fight regulation by
 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.880
go in and try to fight regulation by

you know like deep learning is the only

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710
you know like deep learning is the only
 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.910
you know like deep learning is the only
reason we've got AI and if you regulate

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920
reason we've got AI and if you regulate
 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.800
reason we've got AI and if you regulate
us then you can't use it because nobody

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810
us then you can't use it because nobody
 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.270

this is completely false all right first
of all when you audit a company

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060
of all when you audit a company
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.150
of all when you audit a company
you don't go and try to figure out how

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160
you don't go and try to figure out how
 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.530
you don't go and try to figure out how
the synapses are connected in their

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540
the synapses are connected in their
 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.760
the synapses are connected in their
accountant so you just look at the

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
accountant so you just look at the
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.490
accountant so you just look at the
accounts so in the worst case we can do

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500
accounts so in the worst case we can do
 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.040
accounts so in the worst case we can do
the same thing with AI that we could be

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050
the same thing with AI that we could be
 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.750
the same thing with AI that we could be
doing with with humans now again this

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760
doing with with humans now again this
 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.100
doing with with humans now again this
goes back to what I was saying earlier

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
goes back to what I was saying earlier
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.629
goes back to what I was saying earlier
about due diligence if you have

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639
about due diligence if you have
 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.370
about due diligence if you have
accountants and the accounts are on you

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380
accountants and the accounts are on you
 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.450
accountants and the accounts are on you
could try to put the account and

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460
could try to put the account and
 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.129
could try to put the account and
understand and say why are the counts

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139
understand and say why are the counts
 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.780
understand and say why are the counts
run and then you try to establish

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790
run and then you try to establish
 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.520
run and then you try to establish
whether they were doing the right thing

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530
whether they were doing the right thing
 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.550
whether they were doing the right thing
at the right time or whatever the you

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560
at the right time or whatever the you
 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.730
at the right time or whatever the you
can't do that with AI systems but if you

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740
can't do that with AI systems but if you
 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.620
can't do that with AI systems but if you
want to prove if you want to be able to

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.630
want to prove if you want to be able to
 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.469
want to prove if you want to be able to
prove that there are honest mistakes you

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479
prove that there are honest mistakes you
 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.120
prove that there are honest mistakes you
can look at like how is the system

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130
can look at like how is the system
 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.120
can look at like how is the system
trained you know how was it being run

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130
trained you know how was it being run
 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.360
trained you know how was it being run
there's ways that you can audit whether

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.370
there's ways that you can audit whether
 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.030
there's ways that you can audit whether
the system was built appropriately so I

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.040
the system was built appropriately so I
 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.530
the system was built appropriately so I
think we should be out looking for those

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:37.540
think we should be out looking for those
 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.240
think we should be out looking for those
because then also allows us to improve

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250
because then also allows us to improve
 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.850
because then also allows us to improve
our systems so the most important thing

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860
our systems so the most important thing
 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.950
our systems so the most important thing
is just not believing the whole magic

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960
is just not believing the whole magic
 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.680
is just not believing the whole magic
line and one of the companies I've heard

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690
line and one of the companies I've heard
 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.050
line and one of the companies I've heard
give the magic line in a regulatory

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
give the magic line in a regulatory
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.790
give the magic line in a regulatory
setting you know in front of government

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800
setting you know in front of government
 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.580
setting you know in front of government
representatives was Microsoft and that

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590
representatives was Microsoft and that
 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.830
representatives was Microsoft and that
was at early 2017 and now they've

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840
was at early 2017 and now they've
 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.630
was at early 2017 and now they've
completely reversed that they've sat

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640
completely reversed that they've sat
 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.159
completely reversed that they've sat
down they've thought about it and now

00:07:59.159 --> 00:07:59.169
down they've thought about it and now
 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.050
down they've thought about it and now
they've said accountability and

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
they've said accountability and
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.210
they've said accountability and
transparency is absolutely core to what

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.220
transparency is absolutely core to what
 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.760
transparency is absolutely core to what
we should be doing with AI and I think

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:05.770
we should be doing with AI and I think
 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.529
we should be doing with AI and I think
Microsoft are making really strong

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:07.539
Microsoft are making really strong
 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:08.880
Microsoft are making really strong
efforts to be the adults in the room

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.890
efforts to be the adults in the room
 

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.570
efforts to be the adults in the room
right now

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:09.580
right now
 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.610
right now
so which is interesting like I said just

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:11.620
so which is interesting like I said just
 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.500
so which is interesting like I said just
literally within one year that there was

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:13.510
literally within one year that there was
 

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.110
literally within one year that there was
that that change so I think everybody

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120
that that change so I think everybody
 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.170
that that change so I think everybody
should be thinking that AI is not this

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:19.180
should be thinking that AI is not this
 

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.020
should be thinking that AI is not this
big exception don't look for a way to

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.030
big exception don't look for a way to
 

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.470
big exception don't look for a way to
get out of responsibility

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:25.480
get out of responsibility
 

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.330
get out of responsibility
