00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:02.660
- [Instructor] We're asked
to find the value of x

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.112
in the isosceles triangle shown below.

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:07.543
So that is the base of this triangle.

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:12.454
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:14.530
Well the key realization to solve this

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.755
is to realize that this
altitude that they dropped,

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:20.318
this is going to form a right angle here

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:22.150
and a right angle here

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.216
and notice,

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:24.533
both of these triangles,

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.222
because this whole thing
is an isosceles triangle,

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:30.537
we're going to have two
angles that are the same.

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.620
This angle, is the same as that angle.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.058
Because it's an isosceles triangle,

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:37.448
this 90 degrees is the
same as that 90 degrees.

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:39.238
And so the third angle
needs to be the same.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:42.387
So that is going to be the same as that

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:43.613
right over there.

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:46.622
And since you have two
angles that are the same

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:49.060
and you have a side between them

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.893
that is the same

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:53.358
this altitude of 12 is on both triangles,

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:57.008
we know that both of these
triangles are congruent.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:58.903
So they're both going to have 13

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:00.360
they're going to have one side that's 13,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.387
one side that is 12

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:03.787
and so this

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.149
and this side are going to be the same.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.116
So this is going to be x over two

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.896
and this is going to be x over two.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.027
And so now we can use that information

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.915
and the fact and the Pythagorean Theorem

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:17.165
to solve for x.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.549
Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.847
on this right triangle

00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:24.764
on the right hand side.

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.072
We can say that

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:29.718
x over two squared

00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:32.495
that's the base right over here

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:34.195
this side right over here.

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:36.786
We can write that x over two

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:37.619
squared

00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:40.457
plus the other side

00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:41.707
plus 12 squared

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.427
is going to be equal to
our hypotenuse squared.

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:49.228
Is going to be equal to 13 squared.

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:51.659
This is just the Pythagorean Theorem now.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.317
And so we can simplify.

00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:55.274
This is going to be x.

00:01:55.274 --> 00:01:56.981
We'll give that the same color.

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.993
This is going to be x squared over four.

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.649
That's just x squared over two squared

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.482
plus 144

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.366
144 is equal to 13 squared is 169.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:14.656
Now I can subtract 144 from both sides.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:15.868
I'm gonna try to solve for x.

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.679
That's the whole goal here.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.336
So subtracting 144 from both sides

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.924
and what do we get?

00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:25.342
On the left hand side, we have x squared

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:28.342
over four is equal to 169 minus 144.

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:33.311
Let's see, 69 minus 44 is 25.

00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:36.647
So this is going to be equal to 25.

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:39.810
We can multiply both sides by four

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.948
to isolate the x squared.

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:45.543
And so we get x squared
is equal to 25 times four

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.096
is equal to 100.

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:49.110
Now, if you're just looking
this purely mathematically

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.209
and say, x could be
positive or negative 10.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.756
But since we're dealing with distances,

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.089
we know that we want the
positive value of it.

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.217
So x is equal to the principle root of 100

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.627
which is equal to positive 10.

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:02.460
So there you have it.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.316
We have solved for x.

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.650
This distance right here, the whole thing,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.206
the whole thing is
going to be equal to 10.

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:11.275
Half of that is going to be five.

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:14.271
So if we just looked at
this length over here.

00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:16.576
I'm doing that in the
same column, let me see.

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:19.307
So this length right over here,

00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:20.331
that's going to be five

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:22.309
and indeed, five squared plus 12 squared,

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.420
that's 25 plus 144

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.003
is 169, 13 squared.

00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:29.206
So the key of realization here is

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:30.432
isosceles triangle,

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:34.159
the altitudes splits it into
two congruent right triangles

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.384
and so it also splits this base into two.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.042
So this is x over two

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.114
and this is x over two.

00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:41.396
And we use that information

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.180
and the Pythagorean Theorem

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.430
to solve for x.
