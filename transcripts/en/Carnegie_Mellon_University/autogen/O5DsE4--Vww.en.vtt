CMU had a really great reputation was

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
CMU had a really great reputation was
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.650
CMU had a really great reputation was
probably both to do to robotics and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
probably both to do to robotics and
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.470
probably both to do to robotics and
computer science and engineering and in

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
computer science and engineering and in
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.450
computer science and engineering and in
addition Pittsburgh at that time was

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
addition Pittsburgh at that time was
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.960

most livable city and it is too so I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
most livable city and it is too so I
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.480
most livable city and it is too so I
think this were main attractions not

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
think this were main attractions not
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.489
think this were main attractions not
only for me but also for my family

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499
only for me but also for my family
 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.370

what were my dreams when I came to CMU

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
what were my dreams when I came to CMU
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370
what were my dreams when I came to CMU
this was as I mentioned 24 years ago so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
this was as I mentioned 24 years ago so
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920
this was as I mentioned 24 years ago so
many things didn't exist you know you we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
many things didn't exist you know you we
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.780
many things didn't exist you know you we
didn't have a fancy I phones or iPods or

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
didn't have a fancy I phones or iPods or
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.020
didn't have a fancy I phones or iPods or
you know digital cameras and many others

so I think that it 24 years is a quarter

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
so I think that it 24 years is a quarter
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440
so I think that it 24 years is a quarter
century it's a really time that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
century it's a really time that
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.800
century it's a really time that
sometimes dreams who are born during the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810
sometimes dreams who are born during the
 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.230
sometimes dreams who are born during the
time I was here and I think but this is

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240
time I was here and I think but this is
 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.140
time I was here and I think but this is
really what has to be done but you you

what we do we do ethical polymerization
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510
what we do we do ethical polymerization
and this is a process which makes

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
and this is a process which makes
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.180

process because the polymer chains

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190
process because the polymer chains
 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.090
process because the polymer chains
it grows within a one-second time and it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
it grows within a one-second time and it
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609
it grows within a one-second time and it
adds monomer units so like small parts

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
adds monomer units so like small parts
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.810

this change died but sometimes they can

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
this change died but sometimes they can
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.190
this change died but sometimes they can
also transfer so they have offspring in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
also transfer so they have offspring in
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040
also transfer so they have offspring in
some sense and the problem is that this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
some sense and the problem is that this
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.020
some sense and the problem is that this
life of propagating chain is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
life of propagating chain is
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.059
life of propagating chain is
one second so it behaves nearly like

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
one second so it behaves nearly like
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610
one second so it behaves nearly like
human being because it grows it was born

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
human being because it grows it was born
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.550
human being because it grows it was born
and then it dies but this happens at a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
and then it dies but this happens at a
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.980
and then it dies but this happens at a
time which is hundred million times

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990
time which is hundred million times
 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.559
time which is hundred million times
faster and then our lifetime so it's

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
faster and then our lifetime so it's
 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.690
faster and then our lifetime so it's
very difficult to be controlled so what

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
very difficult to be controlled so what
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.820
very difficult to be controlled so what
we do very often we try to extend this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
we do very often we try to extend this
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.880
we do very often we try to extend this
one second life to something like a day

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
one second life to something like a day
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340
one second life to something like a day
or maybe a couple hours and this is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
or maybe a couple hours and this is
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.290
or maybe a couple hours and this is
really a challenge in how to do it so we

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
really a challenge in how to do it so we
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.360
really a challenge in how to do it so we
take this one second life of propagated

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
take this one second life of propagated
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.729
take this one second life of propagated
shine and then chop it down thousand

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739
shine and then chop it down thousand
 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.070
shine and then chop it down thousand
pieces one millisecond each and insert

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
pieces one millisecond each and insert
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.470
pieces one millisecond each and insert
one minute time in between every one

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
one minute time in between every one
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.210
one minute time in between every one
millisecond so it's one second is

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
millisecond so it's one second is
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.890
millisecond so it's one second is
thousand milliseconds plus thousand

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
thousand milliseconds plus thousand
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.009
thousand milliseconds plus thousand
minutes so it's a day modest so of

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
minutes so it's a day modest so of
 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.360
minutes so it's a day modest so of
course if you do that you have to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
course if you do that you have to
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.350
course if you do that you have to
understand somehow what to do it with

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360
understand somehow what to do it with
 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.509
understand somehow what to do it with
your catalyst how much this catalyst how

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519
your catalyst how much this catalyst how
 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.070
your catalyst how much this catalyst how
little these catalysts and one of the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
little these catalysts and one of the
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620
little these catalysts and one of the
recent advances which we did was really

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
recent advances which we did was really
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.300
recent advances which we did was really
reducing the amount of catalyst by a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
reducing the amount of catalyst by a
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.370
reducing the amount of catalyst by a
factor of thousands so essentially parts

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
factor of thousands so essentially parts
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.830
factor of thousands so essentially parts
per million any other catalyst and using

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
per million any other catalyst and using
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.990
per million any other catalyst and using
some environmentally friendly reducing

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
some environmentally friendly reducing
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.850
some environmentally friendly reducing

acid things like that so this is one

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
acid things like that so this is one
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.160

self-organizing molecules so this is

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
self-organizing molecules so this is
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.020
self-organizing molecules so this is
really something which allows to these

eventually it can go even to some

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
eventually it can go even to some
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.240

interactive materials so materials which

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250
interactive materials so materials which
 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.599
interactive materials so materials which
will be potentially functioning but

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609
will be potentially functioning but
 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.940
will be potentially functioning but
function in a very responsive and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
function in a very responsive and
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.500
function in a very responsive and
interactive way it may be like drug

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
interactive way it may be like drug
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.509
interactive way it may be like drug
deliveries which would be target in

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519
deliveries which would be target in
 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.730
deliveries which would be target in
particular part but also delivering drug

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
particular part but also delivering drug
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.430
particular part but also delivering drug
only when it is needed on a demand in

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440
only when it is needed on a demand in
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.340
only when it is needed on a demand in
some sense when our organ is

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350
some sense when our organ is
 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.530
some sense when our organ is
would need that so I think that this is

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
would need that so I think that this is
 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.440
would need that so I think that this is
probably what what we try to do is is to

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450
probably what what we try to do is is to
 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.490
probably what what we try to do is is to
make them on one side less expensively

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500
make them on one side less expensively
 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.180
make them on one side less expensively
but also more precisely and aiming at

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190
but also more precisely and aiming at
 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.050
but also more precisely and aiming at
some new potential applications as well

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060
some new potential applications as well
 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.680
some new potential applications as well
so I I think that you cannot plan the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690
so I I think that you cannot plan the
 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.870
so I I think that you cannot plan the
research you cannot plan inventions I

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880
research you cannot plan inventions I
 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.060

some sense with it but at the same time

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420
some sense with it but at the same time
 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.940
some sense with it but at the same time
you have to have a passion and I think

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
you have to have a passion and I think
 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.750
you have to have a passion and I think
things which I try to teach my students

things which I try to teach my students
 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.820

my goal but I have to be really

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
my goal but I have to be really
 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.460
my goal but I have to be really
passionate about what they do and if I

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
passionate about what they do and if I
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.140
passionate about what they do and if I
do then they have a very good feedback

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150
do then they have a very good feedback
 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.890
do then they have a very good feedback
and it's really boost of activity and

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900
and it's really boost of activity and
 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.260
and it's really boost of activity and
increases both productivity and were

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270
