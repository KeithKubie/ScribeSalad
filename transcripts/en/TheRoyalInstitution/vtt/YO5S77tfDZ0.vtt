00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.940
I was on Denbies Hillside a
couple of years ago and I got

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.910
this rather lovely shot
of the Adonis Blue.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.390
It's quite rare in most
places, but on Denbies

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.200
Hillside, near Dorking, it's
prolific in the spring time.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.280
Not only is it a very beautiful
butterfly, but also

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.070
it has a particular scientific
interest for optics because

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.240
the blue color it has
isn't generated by

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.440
chemicals, by dyes.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.190
It's caused by the structure
of the wings.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.960
There's a microstructure in
the wings which diffracts

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
light and it just diffracts the
blue light, which is what

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.750
produces that very
intense blue.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.930
And that hinges on some ideas
I've been developing in my

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.220
scientific life, which is to
control light with a new class

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.750
of materials, called
metamaterials.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.840
And their function is due
to their structure.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.270
But the butterfly
got there first.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.890
I'm John Pendry and I'm a
professor of physics at

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.700
Imperial College London.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.280
I work on the theory of
how to control light.
