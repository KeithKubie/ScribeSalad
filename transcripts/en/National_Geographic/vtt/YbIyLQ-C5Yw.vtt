I work for the
women in my country

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.305
who are facing crazy mountains

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:09.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
without even having
to step on a mountain.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.844
And I thought of
a campaign to go

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
climb the highest mountain
of every continent

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.150
in the world, knowing that
the struggle in the mountain

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.952
was so parallel to the struggle

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.121
that women face in society.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.858
(audience clapping)

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:29.762 align:start size:84% position:16%
I like to get outside
and climb things.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.299 align:start size:84% position:16%
Mainly mountains,
but when I was little

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.301
the climbing scene
was very different.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.903 line:0%
I was about six or seven,

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.705 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
and I was living in
this part of Bangladesh,

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.307 line:0%
called Khulna which is very near

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.909 line:0%
The Sundarbans, the largest
mangrove forest in the world

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.778
that you may have heard of.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:51.084
And this is the first time
when I saw white people,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.286 align:start size:94% position:6%
when my fathers office
received these foreigners,

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:56.923
and I didn't know how to
speak English at that time.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.791
I was overly excited,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.760
the officer had a little girl

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.896 align:start size:94% position:6%
who had a very nice,
ring-like thing around her

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:04.864
that she was playing with,

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.966
later on I found out
it was a hula hoop,

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.167
many years later.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I wanted to be cool,
I wanted to fit in,

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.271 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was obviously
very excited,

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.540
and I started playing
with it, with her,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.875
in sign language, whatever.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.278
And this auntie, we
have a lot of aunties

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.714 align:start size:84% position:16%
in our society who
dictate things for us,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:26.051
snapped at me and said
(yelling in Bangla).

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.087
Which is so derogatory in Bangla

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.156
that it cannot even be
translated in English,

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.192
but what it sums up
is that "a good girl

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
"shouldn't be
shaking their hips."

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.328
(crowd laughter)

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.731
And I wanted to be a good girl,

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.567
and I kept down the hula
and I never played with it.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.205
I was also asked to
stop biking, cycling,

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.874 align:start size:81% position:19%
because I would
lose my virginity.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:52.478
And there are many other
taboos that I believed.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:56.983
Bangladesh, it's a
land of extremities.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.052
Light, and darkness.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's a nation of 170
million people approaching.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.559 align:start size:94% position:6%
We don't have many
mountains as you can see.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.261 align:start size:97% position:3%
We don't have any
mountains, we live in water.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.897
But when I was a
child some amazing,

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:15.668
crazy disastrous events
happened in my life.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:20.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
I lost my home even
before I was a teenager.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:23.442 align:start size:97% position:3%
My parents divorced and
there was a custody battle,

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.878
and I was homeless as a result.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:29.848
Very early on I had to, as
a child, become an adult,

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:33.052
take responsibility of
basically my existence.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.354
But it was these experiences

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.655
that I'm very grateful for.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.124
These mountains that I climbed,

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.959
because those are
the experiences

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.496
that made me pursue
a better education.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
I went on to pursue
another career

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.033 align:start size:81% position:19%
fighting for other
people's homes.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:52.872
Whether that was for women
who were severely abused,

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
or ostracized, or
for indigenous people

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.910
living under crazy regimes,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.713
or refugees without a nation.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:04.717 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it was my one
particular friendship

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.386
and connection that got
me into a lot of trouble.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.188
Not just in China or Tibet,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.056
but at home in Bangladesh.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.692
As an activist who was
working and was very

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:15.795
involved with human
rights work in Tibet,

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
me and my distant
relatives, colleagues,

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.368 align:start size:97% position:3%
my tribe, basically, in
Bangladesh, was being hounded,

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
by intelligence
forces in Bangladesh

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.938
all the time, for years.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.908 align:start size:88% position:13%
My family was basically
very ashamed of me,

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.977
but it was during this period
when I found the mountains

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.712
as a refuge to heal myself,

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:37.249
but also it was during this
time that I really understood

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.585
the definition of
what home means.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:42.822
And I ask myself "what
is it about Bangladesh

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.757
"that really inspires me?
That I feel proud of?"

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:48.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it was the women who
were in the forefront

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.931
of every movement, whether it
was our liberation movement,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.299 align:start size:94% position:6%
our independence movement,
or other movements,

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.369 align:start size:84% position:16%
women were what
defined Bangladesh.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.773 align:start size:97% position:3%
So as Bangladesh approached
40 years in 2011,

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.843 align:start size:94% position:6%
there were all kinds of
celebration being planned,

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.446
and I thought of
a campaign to go

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:10.049
climb the highest mountain of
every continent in the world,

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.950
because I thought
symbolically it was

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
taking Bangladesh to all
corners of the globe.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:18.390 align:start size:84% position:16%
And also personally,
just knowing that

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
the struggle in the
mountain was so parallel

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.829
to the struggle that
women face in society.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:26.165
So The Seven Summits
was first postulated

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.601 align:start size:94% position:6%
by a Canadian mountaineer,
Patrick Morrow,

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.273 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the early 80s, and
after he finished in 1996,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.442 align:start size:94% position:6%
almost hundreds of people
have accomplished it.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.376
But out of that,

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:41.113
only 32 to 35 were women,

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:42.715
mostly Westerners.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:45.517
When I first thought
of this I obviously

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:47.420
didn't have the monetary funds.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.456 align:start size:97% position:3%
I ended up convincing the
board of two different banks

00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:54.426
to give me bank loans
totally based on trust.

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.029
This magical thing
started happening,

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.731
all these guardian angels,

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:02.401
and just people who
wanted to help out

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:03.869
in their small ways,

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.404
started reaching out.

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.640
A rich woman who recently
got out of a relationship,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.910
and you get talaq money,
which is a divorce sum

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.879
that you get from your husband,

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.882
she gave that all to me and said

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.450
"Please go free my
soul on the summit."

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.685
I was like "wow!"

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.455
And I was so inspired,
and then I got an email

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:25.224
from my former colleague
in the Tibetan movement,

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.927
Nima Dorje, says "Oh, by
the way, Patrick Morrow

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:31.630
"lives just by me, do you
wanna hook up with him?"

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.300 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I write to him and
Patrick and Baiba, his wife,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.370
invites me to Canada
to train with them.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
He set this really
hardcore regime for me,

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.508
and then he connected
me to different people

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:46.045
in the seven continents,
which made things easier.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.880
But mind you,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.384
Bangladesh doesn't have
a diplomatic relationship

00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:54.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
with almost majority
of these places,

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.823
so going to a lot
of these places was

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:00.659
just huge logistical barriers.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.862
But I ended up finishing
five of the seven summits

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.830
in the next one
and a half years,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.266 align:start size:84% position:16%
including Chomolungma,
or Mount Everest.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:11.037 align:start position:0%
I was so inspired, it was
personally very healing for me.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:15.407 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was brutally lonely
journey, to say the least.

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:18.310 align:start size:88% position:13%
But in the last four
years, I've gone through

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.979
every extreme situation,

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.648 align:start size:97% position:3%
from eating my own (bleep),
and poisoning myself,

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.184
because my camp got
totally destroyed,

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.887
and my toilet got
mixed with my food,

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:32.458
to getting held captive in
Papua, and held for ransom,

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.260
to losing my best friends,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.695 align:start size:97% position:3%
I lost four of my best friends
in the last five years,

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.931 align:start size:88% position:13%
waking up to earthquakes
and having everything

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.566
that you knew being lost,

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.303 align:start size:97% position:3%
to getting frostbites and
ending up with medical bills

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:47.273
in a country like the states
without medical insurance,

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:50.742 align:start size:84% position:16%
and going through
intense physical pain,

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:55.047
but this whole journey
gave me a vantage point

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.849
to see the earth
from a perspective

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.388
that one out of 170
million in my country

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.755
has been able to see.

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:06.058
So I'm very grateful,
and I learned a lot.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:09.428
I got to reflect a lot
on the human experience,

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.597
nothing will ever
be the same for me,

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:14.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
I took, as you can see,
a bunch of selfies,

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:16.969 align:start size:94% position:6%
which is a pure indicator
how lonely you are.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.471
(crowd laughter)

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.773
This is the time when I
was stuck in the infamous

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.876
Hillary Step in a traffic jam,

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.512
and I thought traffic jams
only existed in Bangladesh.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.713
(crowd laughter)

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.215 align:start size:84% position:16%
But whenever I would
hit rock bottom,

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.184
I would remind myself
of the women at home,

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:34.786
and the struggles that
they would go through,

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:37.423
and that would hug me
with a newfound energy,

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:41.760
and I finally managed in
2015 to accomplish a feat,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.363
which by default made me
the first Bangladeshi,

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.865
that was not my goal.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:46.833
Remember that hula?

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.601
(crowd laughter)

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.604
I took this hula hoop
to The Seven Summits,

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.239
I have a waist now
and I can shake it,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.907
but it was not about that,

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.309 align:start size:88% position:13%
it was about reclaiming
back what was taken

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.378
away from me as a girl child,

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:02.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I want to make that
possible for every other girl

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:05.251 align:start size:94% position:6%
that exists in my
country, and in my region.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
The other transformation
that happened

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.553
is when I came down Everest,

00:08:08.553 --> 00:08:11.857 align:start size:88% position:13%
everyone who detested
me came back in my life.

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:14.760 align:start size:97% position:3%
Family members, politicians
who sent intelligence,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.895
and that's exactly
when I realized,

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:20.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
"wow, climbing
mountains solved so many

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.100
"problems in this society?"

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
Had I known that, I
would be pursuing this

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:28.274
probably a year many moons ago.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.376
And I got all kinds
of company offers,

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.545
banks wanted to pay off
the debt by themselves,

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.481 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got a lot of
marriage proposals.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.016
(crowd laughter)

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:41.620 align:start size:94% position:6%
Marriage proposals at
home come with a biodata,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.121
how you would apply in a job.

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.524 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I made my own biodata,
and because it comes

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.960 align:start size:97% position:3%
with a mugshot of the groom,
and how much they earn,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.796
and what their father
does, and mother does.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:55.067
So mine looks like this,
and every time this works.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.503
(crowd laughter)

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:00.639
To sum it up, there
are many other girls

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.475 align:start size:84% position:16%
who need to climb
their own mountains.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.610
And what I'm doing now
is using the momentum

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.813 align:start size:97% position:3%
of the campaign to gain
support towards my foundation,

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:10.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
Ösel, and it's an
alternate education center,

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:14.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
which combines the
latest scientific finding

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:17.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
about mind-training, and
combines it with mindfulness,

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.792 align:start size:97% position:3%
and training in nature
through various activities.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:23.362 align:start size:94% position:6%
Ösel is a conscious
movement to bring balance

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:26.098
to mother nature
by empowering women

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.734
to harness their
inner luminosity.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.869
Thank you so much.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.605
(crowd clapping)
