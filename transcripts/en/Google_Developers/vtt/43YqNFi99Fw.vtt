[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.770
We're an app for booking
last-minute hotel rooms.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.520
We work with hotels
that have empty rooms,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.430
and they provide
these discounts.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.790
We make it really easy to
book those rooms on our apps.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.220
One of the exciting
moments was when

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.880
it was about two weeks into
the launch of Hotel Tonight

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460
that somebody
booked, and we didn't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.860
know who they were, It was
our first real customer.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.280
And so we all around
the office and said,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.960
hey, do you know this guy?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.520
Do you know this guy?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.395
Do you know this guy?

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.645
And we all said no, and
then we said, oh my gosh,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:31.520
it's a real customer.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.910
That was a really
exciting moment.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.910
We also had a really
big moment when we first

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.080
got our big first press hit.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.510
So we were on the
cover of the USA Today,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.720
and this was back when paper
newspapers were handed out

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.390
to everybody who
stayed in hotels.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.030
So it was just a
wonderful press hit for us

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.770
that really got us out to this
great target market of people

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.370
that travel for
business all the time.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.800
And that doubled
our growth overnight

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.294
and set a new
standard, and we just

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:00.460
kept on building from there.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.630
I think one of the most
interesting aspects

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.000
of the mobile ecosystem is
that app stores have ratings.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.777
So customers are telling
other customers whether or not

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.360
an app is high
quality, whether or not

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.401
a product's high quality.

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.100
That doesn't exist on the web.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.500
So it's very hard for a company
with a lackluster product

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.540
to succeed.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.599
Otherwise they're going
to get bad reviews.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.640
No matter how much money
they put into marketing,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.420
it's not going to be able to
get the same level of customer

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690
acceptance that a
great product will be.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.790
So we focus a lot on
product experience.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.240
We focus a lot on customer
service and customer

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.492
experience and keeping
our customers happy,

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:40.950
and that resulted
in great ratings.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.160
It resulted in more trial,
more awareness, more happy

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.960
customers, and it
fueled from there.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.310
And that's a very
uniquely mobile element

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.860
that app stores are brought to
the world with these ratings

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.430
and reviews and
that feedback loop.
