Hello and welcome back to the next module of the operating systems course. And

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.800
this module is on system recovery. System

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.920
crashes can happen due to power failure,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.740
hardware, and software failures. As operating system

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.070
designers, it is essential to understand how

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.580
to build systems that can survive crashes.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.890
In this module, we will discuss technologies

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.260
that will help us deal with system failures and recover from them. In this

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.210
module, we will cover three systems. The first one, LRVM suggests providing a

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.260
persistent virtual memory layer in support

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.860
of system services. The second one RioVista,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.910
suggests how such a persistent layer can

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.990
be implemented in a performance conscious way,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.840
with some ingenuity. The third one,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.490
Quicksilver, suggests a more radical approach.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.130
Making recovery a first class citizen in the design of operating systems.
