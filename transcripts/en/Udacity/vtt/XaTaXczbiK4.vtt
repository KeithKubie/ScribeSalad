[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:14.592
Ugh, son of a SQL,
this milk is older than I am.

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:19.154
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:23.438
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Hello?

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:24.170
&gt;&gt; Hey, Kagure.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.778
So I'm making a cake for the V3
launch party, and we're out of milk.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.892
&gt;&gt; Milk?

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:32.180
Yeah, you can use mine.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a bit old.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.000
Any chance you're at the store?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.210
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.229
No, I'm not.
I have a debt to settle.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.085
[MUSIC]

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.022
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:52.024
[MUSIC]

00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:53.985
Man, where am I going to get some milk?

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.869
[SOUND].

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.038
Hey J.P.
&gt;&gt; Hey Lila, how are preparations for

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:01.090
the V3 launch party going?

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.580
Do you need anything from
the store while I'm here?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.590
&gt;&gt; Actually really great you called,
I could use milk.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.130
&gt;&gt; Sure thing.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.210
&gt;&gt; That makes me think.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420
Now that we're actually
storing user data,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.090
we could do a lot of interesting
things with that information.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.090
Like, I don't know,
show who's bought what.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.100
&gt;&gt; Or
you could also show them who's shopping.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.130
&gt;&gt; That all makes sense,
a lot of sense actually.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.150
All right,
version 0.3 launch party canceled.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.800
Back to coding.
