00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.100
CHRIS CARTLAND: Welcome to
Google+ Developers Live.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.800
My name is Chris Cartland, and
I'm a developer programs

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.580
engineer working on the
Google+ platform.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.180
I am joined today with Gerwin
and Allen, two of our Google

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.460
Developer experts, who have been
nice enough to join us to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.130
talk about the cool projects
that they've been working on.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.020
So this is really great.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.400
We get to see not just me
talking about the features

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.240
that we have.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120
But we actually get to see the
people who are actually using

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.000
them to do cool things.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.480
And they're really good at what
they do, and they'll be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.610
able to talk through the reasons
behind why they make

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.850
certain things.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.430
And so you can get a really good
view of their experience.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.530
We hope you enjoy today's
showcase.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.780
So can each of you introduce
yourself?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.960
Maybe start with Allen.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.230
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Hi.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.300
I'm Allen Firstenberg.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.080
I'm a developer out
of New York.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.490
I do a lot of work with the
Google+ Sign-in and the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.510
Hangout API on the Google side,
and I'm starting to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.510
branch out into stuff involving
Google Drive and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.550
Google Glass.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.780
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.280
Thank you.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.090
Thanks for joining us.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.100
And Gerwin, can you introduce
yourself?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.480
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.770
Hi.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.150
I'm Gerwin, developer
from Austria.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.670
I'm doing a lot of stuff with
Google Hangouts API, the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.960
Google+ API but also with all
sorts of different Google APIs

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.550
that I can get my hands on
or can't get my hands on.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.860
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
awesome.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.980
Well, thank you also
for joining us.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.240
So today we're going to have
each of them talk about some

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.250
of the projects they're
working on.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.270
And then we're going have a
little bit of a discussion

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.190
about Google+ and
Google+ Sign-In.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.010
And then, of course, we'll
talk a little bit about

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.160
upcoming Google I/O.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.420
So to start off, Gerwin, can you
tell us a little bit about

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.900
your Hangout app called
Draw Here?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.155
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:39.380
So I have built a Hangout app
that allows you to draw stuff

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.315
on your video stream.

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:42.060
And I think the best way
to show it is to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.460
actually show it.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.020
So what it can do, I have here
a cursor, and I can actually

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.305
use this to draw directly
on my media stream.

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:52.810
Now if I could draw nicely, this
would actually look nice.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.030
But it can do other stuff.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.310
Just change the color, and
I can do rectangles.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.210
And one thing, I think, is nice
about it, you can use it

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.430
for fun stuff, like just drawing
flowers or something.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.400
But you can also use it
like a whiteboard.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.190
You can use it to create some
sort of whiteboard in your

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.260
app, and then you can
actually use it to--

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.523
Let's just switch to
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:21.959
Let's make this one smaller.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.760
And then you can just
do it to show off

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.990
calculations or something.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.190
So you can use it for all sorts
of different stuff.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.910
And I think it's pretty cool.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.610
So you can use it for
educational stuff.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.730
You can use to show stuff.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.250
And one other feature you can
use it for, you can actually

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.510
use it to show photos
to your--

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.550
Viewers, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just share a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.975
screenshot of the app itself,
so you can see it.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:51.370
So what I do is just drag the
screenshot into the app.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.050
And you'll see the screenshot
now directly into this.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.940
And they can actually
draw on the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.370
screenshot which I imported.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.610
And as you can see, what is
happening is on the one side

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.365
you have a drawing
canvas where you

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:05.160
actually do the drawing.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.690
And what happens is whenever
you update something on the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.690
drawing side, it updates an
overlay which is displayed

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.650
above your video stream.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.940
So that's what's happening.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.940
And you have some tools here,
like there's square, circles.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.590
You have an eraser.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.850
And you can draw images, and
then you can just remove the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.505
image and you're
back to normal.

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:26.800
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.690
That's great.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.440
So what you're doing here is
using the overlay to get

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.730
whatever you want onto the
screen, which is really cool.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.980
What do you think this
means for developers?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.940
Because some people will want
to use this right away and

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.740
just be like, yeah, this
is fun to draw.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.000
But where do you think--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.380
and either of you
can chime in--

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.310
this might go, as far as what
this technology can do?

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.730
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.580
So what I've discovered is that
actually the overlays can

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.860
be updated rather quickly.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.990
I managed to get ten frame
updates per second.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.530
So what this means is that you
can actually use it to just

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.850
illustrate a lot of stuff
without other people having to

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.150
install an app, because it's
displayed directly on your

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.820
video feeds.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.630
The only limitation is the
video transfer quality,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.070
because it can get a little bit
choppy if you're on a slow

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.270
connection, because the video
image [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.690
So the technology behind this
is actually pretty easy,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.740
because it just creates the
overlay from whatever source

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.040
you want to create it from.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.780
So in this case, because I'm
having the canvas, I'm just

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.000
taking the data URI from the
canvas and creating an object.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.780
But you can use it, for example,
if you and a family

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.530
friend you have some family
pictures, you have some

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.080
vacation pictures which you
want to show and you don't

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.610
want your grandparents to
have to install another

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.070
application.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.030
You can just put the photos
in there and show

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.930
them to them easily.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.940
So there are a lot of use cases
where you can use the

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.270
overlay in Settings.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.020
For example, if you're in the
Hangout On Air, you can't use

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.250
other applications,
because they won't

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.040
display on the screen.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.820
So you can use this method to
just display content of

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.220
whatever kind to the audience.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.410
So you could actually have
animated lower [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.950
like you see in some news,
where you have the stock

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.900
prices going from down below.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.810
So you can use it for those
kinds of settings, where you

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.980
have live pictures coming
in in your overlays.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.540
So you could use it
News settings.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.520
As I said, the update
is pretty immediate.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.040
So that works quite nicely.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.740
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
really cool.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.270
And I see two things that are
really cool about that.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.710
One is that it's really easy for
any application to put any

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.010
data into that view.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.100
So you happened to make it a
drawing app, but you could do

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.770
other things with that.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.800
And the second thing was that
you don't need everybody else

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.700
in the Hangout to actually use
the app or join the app in

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.430
order to see it.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.280
So for example, right now I'm
not using the Hangouts app

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.735
that you wrote, but I'm still
able to see the things that

00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:52.715
you draw on the screen.

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:54.310
And so those two things
are really cool.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.100
And it makes it a pretty
fun application.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.070
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Yeah.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.640
I think there's a lot of
power to overlays.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.720
It's probably one of the most
powerful features that we have

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.990
right now that's been explored
as part of the Hangout API.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.100
And we see a lot of different
uses of it, from the simple

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.980
lower thirds that we see in
things like Hangout Toolbox,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.780
to the very dynamic
aspect that we're

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.380
seeing in Draw Here.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.310
I think that's really the
place that's rich for

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.590
exploration in the
API right now.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.660
CHRIS CARTLAND: And Gerwin, you
said that this looks like

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.420
it might be a lot of work behind
the scenes to make the

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.490
Hangouts part of this work.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.890
And can use say a little bit how
difficult that was or how

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.875
easy that was?

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:33.240
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.190
So actually the Hangout part is
the easy part, because you

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.190
really just have an image URL,
or you have a data URI.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.330
And you just create an image
resource from it, and then you

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.790
just display the overlay.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.120
So actually, the most difficult
part about it is

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.160
because I work with more than
one layer is that, at the

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.180
moment, the API doesn't allow
you to define the order in

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.620
which they are displayed.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.840
So if I want to put one layer
above the other, I have to

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.490
make sure I create them
in the right order.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.660
And if you want to change the
order, you have to remove all

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.710
of them and create all of them
in the right order again.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.650
So that's maybe the trickiest
part about it.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.740
But in the end, it's just take
the image URL and put it on.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.750
And that's three lines
of code, really.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.090
CHRIS CARTLAND: OK.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.350
Cool.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.650
So those three lines, you can
put your image data however

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.970
you create that and do that.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.290
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.710
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
very awesome.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.990
Cool.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.115
Yeah.

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.120
Well, thanks for showing
that to us.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.370
That's a pretty cool
application.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.920
And also, another thing that
Allen wanted to show is a

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.040
different app.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.640
We'll switch gears a
little bit here.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.710
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]
for Draw Here.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.410
And this one's called
Where Am I?

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.840
So Allen, can you tell us a
little bit about this app?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.350
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Sure.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.050
Where Am I?--

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.180
I'll see if I can bring it up.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.630
I'm not sure how well you can
see it-- is a simple app that

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.360
was built based on request.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.310
A couple of people came to me
and said, hey, is there a good

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.450
way that we can share the URL
for the Hangout or the Hangout

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.050
On Air that we're running with
other people, either through

00:09:55.050 --> 00:10:00.760
email or through chat
or through some

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.980
other social networks?

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.160
And I said, well, we have access
to that information.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.930
So I wrote an app that would
display it, and as part of

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.750
that, I made it so that it
would shorten it into a

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.350
Goo.gl short URL.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.470
And then they said, hey, it
would also be great if there

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.110
was a way that we could get
access to the YouTube URL and

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.440
that other people in the Hangout
with me can also see

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.490
that same YouTube URL
before we start.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.010
So I added that.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.790
And then they said, hey,
wouldn't it be great if that

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.140
everybody who joined

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.520
Hangout Toolbox?

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.060
So I added an option
to do that.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.100
And all of these are
making use of--

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.590
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.450
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: --the
same part of the API.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.700
Hang on just a moment.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.140
Making use of the different
parts of the Google APIs that

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.750
are out there.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.330
So the URL shortener
is one API.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.280
It makes use of the Hangout API,
it combines it with some

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.160
other features, and puts it
all together in a concise,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.470
simple way to do things and make
it available to everyone

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.750
in the Hangout.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.760
So for example, the YouTube URL
under the current API is

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.020
only available to the person
who starts the Hangout.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.390
And I was able to make use of
the shared state that's part

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.610
of every Hangout and put the URL
into the shared state, so

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.630
anybody who's running
the Where Am I?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.235
App has access to it.

00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:30.620
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.470
That's really cool.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.600
And what I think is really
great about this is it's

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.630
really great that you were able
to just keep saying, hey,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.820
wouldn't it be great if?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.200
And every time you asked that
question to yourself, you just

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.940
kept going and adding one more
thing, one more thing.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.320
And you ended up with a lot of
different features in a pretty

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.590
simple app that is still
useful for the

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.030
people who use it.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.900
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.660
CHRIS CARTLAND: And
now we need a turn

off phone call extension.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.660
I wonder, wouldn't
it be great if?

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.970
No.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.560
That's great.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.270
Yeah.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.960
That's a really cool
app, Where Am I?

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.850
So those are two cool apps that
actually run in Hangouts.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.420
Let's switch back to Gerwin to
talk about something a little

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.361
more technical and what
he's done with Dart.

00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:22.750
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.290
So I've been looking into Dart
recently because I met up with

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.940
some of the Dart team recently
and some of the Dart developer

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.000
experts, really.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.180
And they really got me
thinking, OK, let's

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.020
just try out Dart.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.200
And of course, usually when I
try out new things I try to

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.440
combine them with things
I already know.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.810
I know Hangouts really well, so
I thought, OK, how would I

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.690
go about writing a Hangout
application in Dart?

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.390
And what I ended up doing in
the end is wrote a complete

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.670
wrap-around the Hangouts API,
because the Hangouts API needs

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.930
JavaScript calls.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.340
But in Dart, you can wrap
JavaScript calls into a scope

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.630
so you can access it.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.210
So what I did is write the
complete start wrapper for it.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.910
And the nice thing about it is,
with Dart being a typed

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.910
language, you have all
the nice features of

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.670
autocompletion, so you don't
have to remember exactly how

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.460
all the different calls
are called.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.720
So it was an on state change,
the onStateChange, because you

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.950
just have to autocompletion.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.610
And I'm just going to quickly
screenshare how this looks

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.960
like in the Dart Editor.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.688
CHRIS CARTLAND: OK.

00:13:26.688 --> 00:13:27.120
Yeah.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.330
That's great.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.690
So you can take advantage of
autocompletion when you're

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.550
writing Hangouts apps,
which is something

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.240
you couldn't do before.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.890
GERWIN STURM: So basically
I have here

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.220
included my Hangouts library.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.120
And what I do here, I create a
new Hangouts API class entity.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.250
And then I have here the normal
setup where I have the

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.710
onApiReady.add, where I have the
onApiReady events to do a

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.570
listen when the API is ready.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.510
And once the API is ready,
I can do [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.180
stuff in here.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.040
So if I have my main
API object--

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.650
And I have here the
autocompletion.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.560
This might be a little bit
small on the screenshot.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.970
But I have all the different
namespaces in here.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.960
So I can take the namespace,
and in here I have the

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.990
onStateChange event,
for example.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.630
Which listens for changes
in the shared state.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:22.096
And Change--

00:14:22.096 --> 00:14:22.860
StateChangeEvent.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.836
Sorry.

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:28.132
And once I am in here--

00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:29.070
Not this one.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:29.520
OnState--

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:29.970
Oops.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.420
Sorry.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.000
That's a dot add here.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.070
That's live coding.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:36.450
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.930
GERWIN STURM: And then I
have the event in here.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.290
And if I have the event here, I
have actually the properties

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.050
that are inside of this
event, which are

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.120
sometimes hard to remember.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.340
So I see the StateChanged event
has the Edit keys, and

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.340
it has the metadata, and it
has removed keys, and it

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.210
actually has the full state.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.000
So I can actually just access
those parameters.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.426
And I have [INAUDIBLE] and can
cycle through the values.

00:15:02.426 --> 00:15:06.600
So I think it's actually pretty
fun to write Hangout

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.140
applications in--

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.490
Wait.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.360
I'm just going to end
the screenshot.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.530
I actually find it's even
more fun than writing in

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.100
JavaScript.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.990
Because in JavaScript,
you don't have the

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.810
autocompletion feature.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.830
You just have to switch to the
documentation all the time.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.940
You have to look up stuff.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.450
And in this case, you actually
have the documentation

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.522
included in the library.

00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:29.636
So I think that's a pretty
neat feature

00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:30.530
CHRIS CARTLAND: Hmm hmm.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.130
And to see what you did to
make this happen is you

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.040
actually wrote the library that
you're using to make an

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.410
app right now.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.530
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.440
I wrote the library myself
so I can access it.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.310
So what I did-- just switching
the screenshot quickly again.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:48.390
So for example, if we just go
here in the onStateChange, I

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.640
defined the event [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.000
itself.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.480
And then inside the code, I have
all those js.scope parts,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.840
which actually then initialize
the JavaScript call to the

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.230
actual API.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.400
So I have the proxy calls
through the actual APIs.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.170
So I actually wrapped it quite a
bit so I don't have to write

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.970
too much JavaScript
code in the end.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.670
So I wrote the full library, and
then I actually included

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.250
the documentation for
all the parameters.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.690
So you could actually make a
Dart doc out of it with all

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.905
the Hangouts API explained
for you--

00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:21.160
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.770
That's great.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.850
GERWIN STURM: --automatically.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.850
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
pretty amazing.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.130
And then I'm sure you're going
to be continuing to use this

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.366
library in order to make other
cool applications.

00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:31.010
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.460
So the only problem at the
moment is that somehow the

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:40.400
Dart to JS compiler doesn't like
some parts in there, so

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.680
you can't compile with the
JavaScript and run it in

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.510
normal browser.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.475
You have to run it in Dart
VM at the moment.

00:16:45.475 --> 00:16:46.630
CHRIS CARTLAND: OK.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.570
So there's a couple things that
need to be fixed before

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.340
it's ready to go out.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.890
GERWIN STURM: I'm not quite
sure, probably because I

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.570
dynamically load JavaScript
on the Dart site.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.870
So there's something where the
Dart to JS compiler might be a

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.080
little bit confused.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.600
I have not entered this
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.180
But I have no problem running
it in Dart VM.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.740
It's just a very small
percentage of people will

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.069
actually be able to
run it that way.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.359
CHRIS CARTLAND: And I'm
confident you'll be able to

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.680
figure out what the next steps
are with this project.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.050
But yeah, that's really great.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.109
And thanks for showing us.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:20.180
Great.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.339
Allen, you have another project
that you're also

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.680
working on, which
is with node.js.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.990
So I'll let you introduce
that one yourself.

00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:29.791
[PHONE RINGS]

00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:34.040
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: As my phone
starts ringing again.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.690
Yeah.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.430
I'm working on a project with
node.js that's basically a

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.110
demonstration project
for using node.js

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.520
with the Google+ Sign-In.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.040
And it's kind of meant as an
illustration for how to do the

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.650
hybrid authorization flow that
you guys have defined as part

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.955
of the Google+ Sign-In.

00:17:56.955 --> 00:17:59.415
And let me share my
screen again.

00:17:59.415 --> 00:18:01.280
CHRIS CARTLAND: So you're
talking about using the

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.710
one-time code flow, where you
send a code from a web client

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.770
to your server in order to get
your server authorized for

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.820
making API requests.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.540
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
That's correct.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.770
So basically, what this lets
you do is to handle some of

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.230
the authentication with the
Google+ Sign-In button on the

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.640
client side, and it
will then send a

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.030
one-time code to the server.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.080
And then your server can,
from this code, get an

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.210
authentication token and a
refresh token, which it can

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:35.990
then use pretty much as long as
the user has authorized the

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.450
app to run it.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.520
The code is available
in GitHub.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.110
Everyone is welcome to take a
look at it, comment on it,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.920
criticize it.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.960
The couple of notable things
here is that it uses node.js.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.750
So it's JavaScript on the
server, and it uses a package

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:04.950
from Google that handles
accessing the Google+ library.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.450
And in fact, it's meant to
handle accessing any of

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.670
Google's client-side libraries
through the node.js

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.820
JavaScript.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.840
So this is a case where work
that's already been done to

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.770
create the Google+ libraries, to
create Drive libraries, to

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.865
create pretty much the
authentication libraries, all

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:27.810
of this stuff has already
been done.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.780
And now it's just being
leveraged on the node.js side,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.870
based on an additional library
that's coming from Google.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.750
CHRIS CARTLAND: And this
is a really new

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.930
library that Google has--

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.050
It' not fully launched.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.230
I think it's in alpha
stage right now.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.060
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: It is
still in alpha stage.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.490
CHRIS CARTLAND: Right.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.010
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: It is version
0.2.5, when I last

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.640
checked it out.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.970
And when I first started playing
with it, I found some

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.040
bugs and reported the
bugs, and they

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.050
got fixed very promptly.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.660
So Google is looking forward
to people trying it out,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.070
kicking the tires, finding where
the problems are, and

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.420
working to improve them.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.621
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.060
Well, it's great to see where
this is going too.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:11.320
And that is a coverage test of
all of the authentication and

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.610
authorization APIs, using
node.js on your server.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.500
So that's great.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:17.980
Yeah.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.710
Was there anything else that you
wanted to add about that?

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.060
I think that seems
really cool.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.120
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: It's
wonderful for me.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.150
I released it as public code
because I think other people

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.080
can profit from it.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.280
I know this is certainly the
code that's become the

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.940
cornerstone for just about
everything else that I'm

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.970
writing against Google's APIs
these days in node.js.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.300
So it's now the cornerstone
of all my other work.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.820
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:46.500
So speaking of Google+ Sign-In,
what's been your

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.700
impression over the
past weeks since

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.530
Google+ Sign-In has launched?

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.020
What have you guys been
doing to play with it?

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.855
And what do you guys
like about it?

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.330
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Want
to start, Gerwin?

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:58.730
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.190
Sure.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.250
So I think it's really
a neat concept to

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.280
finally have a unified--

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.130
I wouldn't even call
it Google+ Sign-In.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.000
It's like a Google sign in
button, because you can use it

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.340
all those other APIs you want
to use from Google as well.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.440
And so you could use Google
Sign-In before, but you never

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.900
had this unique button, which
is the same for all the

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.130
websites, really.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.330
It's the same flow for all
applications that use the

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.200
Sign-In button.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.510
So I think it's really good
that people know what to

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.770
expect when they click the
button, and I think that's

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.420
really important.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.050
Because you could have some sign
in button on your page,

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.110
but people could never know what
happens when they click

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.545
the button.

00:21:40.545 --> 00:21:43.090
But now with the Google+
Sign-In, they know, OK, so

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.270
that's going to happen, when
they have used it before.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.730
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I agree.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.630
And I think in addition to that,
one of the great things

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.090
is it's actually simplified
it a lot for client-side

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.360
developers, even simplified
it, to some extent, for

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.820
server-side developers too.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.440
The button takes care of a good
chunk of the legwork that

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.170
we needed to do.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:07.250
So if you're doing client-side
stuff, you could almost ignore

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.360
authentication and authorization
issues, leaving

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.020
it to the Sign-In button to
handle it all for you.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.990
And on the server side, there's
just a little bit of

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.170
additional work that you need
to do to get it right.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.290
You no longer need to worry as
much about am I requesting an

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.270
online or an offline token.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.880
What an I doing?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.200
Do I need to set up my
redirects correctly?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.940
The button's really handling
almost all of

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.190
that for you now.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.540
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.150
That's awesome.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.560
I'm glad to hear
that feedback.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.340
GERWIN STURM: One thing I really
like, from the user

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.685
perspective, is that you
now have this new page,

00:22:42.685 --> 00:22:46.550
plus.google.com/apps, which
shows you all the apps which

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.940
you have to used with the
Google+ Sign-In button.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.950
And it allows you to change
settings, allows it to change

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.360
the visible people to
the application.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.340
And it allows you to change who
can see your activities.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.660
And I'm actually not quite
sure how many people have

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.985
actively used this page, so I'm
just going to screen share

00:23:02.985 --> 00:23:06.220
it for people to see
how it looks like.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.682
CHRIS CARTLAND: And so this is
at plus.google.com/apps.

00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:10.170
GERWIN STURM: Yes.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.040
Slash apps.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.910
And it actually lists
all applications

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.800
which you've been using.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.140
And as you can see, I've been
doing some testing.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.510
I have quite a few
apps in here.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.220
And down here it tells you what
activities an application

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.430
[INAUDIBLE] and it shows you who
can see your activities.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.400
And you actually can directly
from here delete all the

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.100
activities, disconnect
the application.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.820
And I think that's a very good
start where you can actually

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.400
see what's going on, and you
actually have linked to

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.650
applications in here.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:49.630
I think it's much better than
the previous system for the

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.110
way you have to revoke
the app access from

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.350
your Profile settings.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.680
I think that's the way to go,
because it's much more

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.740
user-friendly than
the other system.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.750
CHRIS CARTLAND: And it provides
more functionality.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.600
So it makes it easier to control
the authorization that

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.875
you've granted to other
applications.

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:04.730
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.450
CHRIS CARTLAND: And it
also looks nicer.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.190
GERWIN STURM: It's still missing
some functionality,

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.730
because you don't have
the other scopes.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.490
You just have the Google+
Log-In scopes.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.780
And you could have a Google
Drive scope in there or

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.000
Latitude scope or Mirror
API scope.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.280
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.940
So it hasn't surfaced all the
information in that UI--

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.160
GERWIN STURM: No.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.555
CHRIS CARTLAND: --actually
yet.

00:24:23.555 --> 00:24:25.115
It just has the Google+
information there.

00:24:25.115 --> 00:24:27.950
But you could actually request
more access in your

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.200
application, which isn't
serviced in this part of the

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.175
display yet.

00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:33.590
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Yeah.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.870
I think the neat part about app
activities-- aside from

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.785
the fact that it's a great way
for applications and websites

00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:42.560
and so forth to get information
into Google+--

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.590
is also to see what Google as
a whole is using with them.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.990
We know that app activities are
increasingly going to be

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.430
factored into search results
and Search Plus Your

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.120
World-type results.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:00.280
So having users using your
application and you generating

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.510
app activities for specific
types of events is going to be

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.660
a great feature, and it's going
to be something that

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.660
users will increasingly be able
to take advantage of.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:10.930
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.550
And I like how you touched on
how this is trying to make all

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.400
of Google better.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.160
Because Google+ really is
designed to be that social

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.950
core to everything that
we do at Google.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.530
So we're really excited with
things like app activity,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.910
where we can start surfacing
that information in places

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.830
that it's useful and meaningful
for users.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.080
And so there's a lot of cool
stuff that we think we can do

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.750
with this, and we're
looking forward to

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.000
what we can do next.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.920
Yeah.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.750
Allen, if you want to talk
about interactive posts?

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.490
I think I've been seeing
a lot of activity

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.430
with that around recently.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.100
What do you guys think
about that feature?

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.840
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: About a
week or two ago, people

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.185
suddenly understood what it was
and how it can be used.

00:25:56.185 --> 00:25:59.100
And we're seeing a lot more of
them cropping up since then.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.920
I think there are some
great applications

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.700
for interactive posts.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.000
I know that a couple people I've
talked to about it have

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.960
really started thinking of it in
terms of not just a way to

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.430
share things but a way to
actually have people more

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.700
directly interact with websites,
so that the post

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.630
itself could be talking about
a website and the

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.910
call-to-action part can
literally be a call to action,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.140
actually doing something,
actually starting a program,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.060
reading a particular
page, starting a

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.810
game, joining a Hangout.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.170
All of these things are things
we're starting to see with the

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.220
call-to-action, and I love it.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.550
I think it's a great new way
to interact with things.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.000
I think people initially were
very concerned that it looked

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.280
like it was just going to
be all about buying.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.920
And once more information came
out and once people really

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.490
started to understand that it's
doing things, as opposed

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.150
to just reading things or seeing
things, they got a lot

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.170
more excited about the
potential of it.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.400
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.910
Very cool.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:05.050
Yeah.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.890
We've seen a lot of interest and
a lot of thought into how

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.910
interactive posts can
make individual

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.700
applications useful.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.960
Because there isn't a
one-size-fits-all solution for

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.210
different applications, because
it's a really powerful

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.720
thing that's deeper than
anything they can really fit

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.820
everyone perfectly.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.330
And that's why we have a long
list of call-to-action buttons

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.120
that developers can choose.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.070
Because your application is
unique, and your use case is

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.190
powerful in its own way, and we
need to make sure that you

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.570
have that opportunity to make
something really cool with the

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.180
interactive posts to help drive
engagement and make your

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.403
posts more useful to users.

00:27:44.403 --> 00:27:47.450
So there's a lot of cool
stuff in there.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.130
So are you guys going to be
using Google+ Sign-In, you

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.900
think, in your applications,
as you keep making more?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.500
It's a new thing, but what do
you guys think of it so far?

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.452
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
Go ahead, Gerwin.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:02.870
You go.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.100
GERWIN STURM: So I'm definitely
going to use it

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.294
more in the future.

00:28:08.294 --> 00:28:11.150
Actually, for all the new
projects I started with the

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.710
Cloud Endpoints and everything,
I used the

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.340
authentication method pretty
much everywhere now where I

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.140
need authentication.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.110
When it's possible, I'm still
trying to figure out how to

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.170
make it work in Chrome
extensions.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.430
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: And
I'm the same way.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.870
At this point, I'm looking at
doing Drive development.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.100
I'm looking at doing
Glass development.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.590
And for all of those
applications, they

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.670
both rely on OAuth.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.940
And if it relies on OAuth,
I intend to be

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.670
using Google+ Sign-In.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.280
That's why I created the
node.js sample package,

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.715
because that's the basis of me
building off everything else

00:28:44.715 --> 00:28:45.910
that I'm doing these days.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.820
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.800
That's really exciting.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.070
You mentioned Glass, and I heard
a little rumor about one

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.980
of Gerwin's projects.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.370
And I don't know exactly
what that is.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.970
But maybe Gerwin can give us
just a brief summary of what

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.250
he's trying to work
on right now.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.400
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.800
So I did quite a few stuff with
the Mirror API without

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.930
actually having access to it,
because I am not US, and I

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.210
don't have Glass.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.500
So I wrote my own emulator.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.300
Because the Mirror API is a
discovery-based API, you can

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.490
just encrypt cloud endpoints
on App Engine.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.880
You can create your own
discovery-based APIs.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.500
So it just copied all the
calls, basically.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.940
And what I did now, for an
example of how to use the

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.070
Mirror API, I used a Hangout
application, which I've

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.660
written in Dart using
my Dart wrapper.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.460
And this actually takes
information from the Google+

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.020
API to tell you more about the
people inside of the Hangout

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.650
and displays them for
you for Glass.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.660
If you're sitting in a Hangout,
like we are now, I

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.305
could just turn on Glass
and see, oh, Chris, he

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:47.170
is working at Google.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.311
Didn't know that.

00:29:49.311 --> 00:29:50.700
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
really neat.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.290
So there's a lot of
pieces in there.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.040
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.410
So I'm just combining different
pieces and throwing

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.950
them all together and seeing
what comes out of it.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.660
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
really amazing.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.760
So to make sure I got all the
pieces in there, you have had

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.330
your Dart wrapper that we
already talked about today to

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.330
make a Hangouts app.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:10.190
And with the Hangouts app, you
were using the Mirror API and

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.130
the Google+ API to bring
relevant content to the people

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.200
wearing Glass.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.390
GERWIN STURM: Exactly.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.050
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.630
Sounds exciting.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.040
I'm looking forward
to the future.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.420
That's awesome.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.440
Speaking of what's coming up,
next week is Google I/O. And I

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.180
believe both of you will
be coming out--

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.535
is that right?-- to visit
us in California.

00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:32.275
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:30:32.275 --> 00:30:33.610
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
That's right.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:33.750
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.710
We look forward to
having you here.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.695
You think there's going to
be a lot of cool things?

00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:42.150
What's most exciting?

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.565
Why would you make the trip all
the way out to California?

00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:47.245
I know, Allen, you're
in New York.

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:50.320
And Gerwin, you have
even further to go.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.170
How far is it for you
to travel, Gerwin?

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.790
GERWIN STURM: Well, I have to
fly to London for two hours.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.720
And then I have a 10 or
11-hour flight to San

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.460
Francisco and lots of waiting
time in between.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.160
So it's going to be a while.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.650
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:05.030
Great.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:08.510
So yeah, what's really driving
you to make that long trip out

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.750
to California next week?

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.430
GERWIN STURM: So what I find
really exciting about I/O is

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.850
meeting all the people.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.330
It's just like you have about
5,000 very enthusiastic

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.110
developers all in one
place, so there's a

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.700
lot energy in there.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.090
And you can just go up to
people, talk to people, get

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.930
ideas, exchange ideas.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.550
The talks might be interesting,
but you can

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:36.000
always listen to the talks
on YouTube later.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.410
But it's just the time in
between the talks where you

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.990
have a chance to talk to the
Google teams, or you have a

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.460
chance to talk to other
developers working with the

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.900
APIs to see how they
are using it.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.030
It's just all about the people
you meet there, which you

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:55.280
can't in normal life, which
doesn't happen so often.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.290
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: When I went
to I/O last year, it was the

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.970
first time I'd been to I/O. I
didn't know what to expect.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.450
I went to every session I could
and talked to everyone

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.790
that I could.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.440
And I found the sessions that
were most useful to me were

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.360
the ones that were most
surprising to me.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.240
So I went to sessions on Drive,
for example, knowing

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.960
absolutely nothing about Google
Drive before then.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.070
And in the year since
then, I've done

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.700
quite a bit with Drive.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.710
I've learned a lot
more about it.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.950
I had some questions about
Maps last year.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.650
I stopped by the help desk and
got some really good answers

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:35.100
about how to continue and where
to get more information.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.720
So I think that the best part of
Google I/O, as Gerwin said,

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.770
it's networking with other
people, being able to go up to

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.840
them and talk to them and get
inspired by some of what

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.440
they're doing.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:47.605
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:32:47.605 --> 00:32:48.640
It should be a really
exciting time.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.950
I'm looking forward to
next week as well.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:59.000
For the people who are not able
to make it to I/O, there

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.030
are some I/O Extended events.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:07.210
Last I checked, there were over
370, I think, Google I/O

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.630
Extended events around
the world.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:12.580
And are there some in
areas where you

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.510
are, Allen and Gerwin?

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.360
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I know
that there are three in

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.180
the New York area.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.810
One of them is run by the Google
Developer group in

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.890
Manhattan, and a couple of other
companies are holding

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.160
their own I/O viewing events.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.870
And from what I understand,
they're always exciting and

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.141
always interesting to follow.

00:33:32.141 --> 00:33:32.520
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.180
And we have one in
Vienna as well.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.090
So we have our GDG Vienna
group, which is

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.510
organizing an event.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.820
And we're expecting around 100
people, I think, which are

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.520
coming there.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.280
And actually, my first
impression of I/O was an I/O

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.310
Extended event.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.980
And actually, I/O Extended, it's
really like a small I/O,

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.430
because there as well you get
to meet other people who are

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.640
excited about the topic.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.040
So if you're in an area where
you have an I/O extended near

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.450
you, make sure to go there,
because you get a lot of the

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.790
feeling you have at the I/O
at the I/O Extended event.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.130
And most I/O Extended events
will actually have people from

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.409
I/O calling in for
the local group.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.780
So I will probably call into
our local GDG Vienna group

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.633
through Hangout to tell
them how it's like.

00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:18.100
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.239
That's great.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.489
And for the people who aren't
able to make it to one of

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:25.894
these events and aren't able to
be at I/O, of course all of

00:34:25.894 --> 00:34:29.600
the talks will be recorded,
and you can watch those

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.510
sessions later.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.449
Also, there will be a lot of
people posting on Google+ and

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:41.360
other places online about what
they find and what they learn

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.460
at Google I/O. So if you want to
keep up in real time, we're

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.219
going to be using the
hashtag io13.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.290
So there's going to be a lot of
cool stuff that comes out

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.880
as people learn about whatever
the topics are.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.870
We have a lot of different
tracks that you can follow.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.810
For example, Google+ has a track
that I think has about

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.295
14 sessions.

00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:07.195
So there's a lot of different
things and topics that you can

00:35:07.195 --> 00:35:08.130
learn about.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.510
I'll be giving a talk on
Cross-Platform Auth with

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.900
Google+ Sign-In.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.440
So if you're interested in how
to use Auth with different

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.670
platforms, like Android, iOS,
and web, as well as dealing

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:23.020
with a server, you should
come out and watch that.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.900
Was there anything else about
I/O that you guys are looking

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.950
forward to next week?

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.610
Anything else for the
people watching?

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.540
What should they be
looking forward to

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.190
and keep an eye out?

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.090
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: The
keynote's going to be

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.780
exciting, because it's
always exciting.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.070
But I really think, again, in
the spirit of networking with

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.160
people, follow people who are
going to I/O. A lot of them

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.140
are really excited about being
there and will talk and post

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.160
endlessly about what they're
finding and discovering.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.480
I know last year I posted dozens
and dozens of times

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.940
during sessions about what I was
seeing, and it was great,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.990
the conversations that
sprung up because

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.240
of what I was posting.

00:36:05.855 --> 00:36:06.350
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.560
And you can probably follow the
io13 hashtag, and there's

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.995
also the Google I/O community
where people will be posting

00:36:13.995 --> 00:36:17.350
and talking a lot, I think.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:17.940
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.750
The Google I/O community has
already got some good

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.710
conversations going.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.790
And I'm sure it's just going to
get better as we get closer

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.710
to the actual event.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.650
Well, that's going to
be really great.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:32.030
Thank you so much for joining
us today, Allen and Gerwin.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:36.330
These people that you see in
front of me are great, because

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.150
not only are they making cool
stuff with our services at

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.100
Google, they're also
helping us out.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.890
So when you ask questions in
the Google+ Plus developers

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.320
community, they're often
the ones that

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.870
are solving the problems.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.120
And if you ask questions on
Stack Overflow, they're out

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.830
there helping answer them.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.270
So I really want to thank them,
not only for joining me

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.590
today but for helping out and
supporting all the developers

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.840
around the world with Google+.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.960
Great.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.930
So thank you so much,
Allen and Gerwin.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:15.280
And we'll hope to have you
on again another time.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.470
And thanks, everyone,
for watching.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.070
And we'll see you next week.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.060
Or sorry, we won't see you next
week, because we'll be

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.200
getting ready for I/O. But
we'll see you soon.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.450
Thanks so much.

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:37.443
