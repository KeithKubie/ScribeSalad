00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.480
We're asked to find the area
of the shaded region, so

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.380
the area of this
red-shaded region.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.920
So this is interesting.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.680
This is almost a
10 by 10 square,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.800
except we have these quarter
circles that are cut out.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.780
So the area of this would be the
area of what a 10 by 10 square

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.500
would be minus the area
of these quarter circles.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.910
And each of these
quarter circles

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330
is a quarter of a
circle with a radius 3.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.110
I think we can assume
that all of these,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.550
if you took the
distance from here

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.520
to the outside of this
quarter circle, have radius 3.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.980
So if you put four
quarter circles together,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.590
you're going to have a
complete white circle.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.060
So one way to
think about this is

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.730
that the area of
this whole red region

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.320
is going to be the area of
the entire square, which

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.620
is 10 by 10.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.470
So it's going to be
10 times 10, which

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.900
is 100 whatever
square units we have.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.660
And then we're going
to subtract out

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.630
the area of the four
quarter circles.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.770
And that area is going to be
equivalent to the area of one

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.660
circle with a radius of 3.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.110
So what's the area of
a circle with radius 3?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.840
Well, the formula
for area of a circle

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.220
is pi r squared,
or r squared pi.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.400
So the radius is 3.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.380
So it's going to be 3 times 3,
which is 9, times pi-- 9 pi.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.660
So we have 100 minus 9 pi is
the area of the shaded region.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.740
And we got it right.
