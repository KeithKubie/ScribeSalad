to the team members and milling about
 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.479
to the team members and milling about
you see a video of them doing so they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
you see a video of them doing so they
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090
you see a video of them doing so they
basically fill the video screen and the

far as the experimenter is concerned is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
far as the experimenter is concerned is
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.210
far as the experimenter is concerned is
for you to count the number of times

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
for you to count the number of times
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.429
for you to count the number of times
that the black black team yes black team

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439
that the black black team yes black team
 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.749
that the black black team yes black team
passes the basketball back and forth so

passes the basketball back and forth so
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039
passes the basketball back and forth so
that's what you do so now you have an

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
that's what you do so now you have an
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.940
that's what you do so now you have an
ambition and a name and a value and the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
ambition and a name and a value and the
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350

ambition and the aim and the value
they're all the same thing and that is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
they're all the same thing and that is
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590
they're all the same thing and that is
to perform well at the task now the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
to perform well at the task now the
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179
to perform well at the task now the
thing that's so cool about this and this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
thing that's so cool about this and this
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.020
thing that's so cool about this and this
is really so cool it's just unbelievably

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030
is really so cool it's just unbelievably
 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.969
is really so cool it's just unbelievably
it's just unbelievable that this is the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
it's just unbelievable that this is the
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.670
it's just unbelievable that this is the
case it's like a complete validation of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
case it's like a complete validation of
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230
case it's like a complete validation of
a certain element of the Buddhist

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
a certain element of the Buddhist
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920
a certain element of the Buddhist
worldview so they passed the ball for a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
worldview so they passed the ball for a
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420
worldview so they passed the ball for a
couple of minutes and then the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
couple of minutes and then the
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.819
couple of minutes and then the
experimenter says to you how many and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
experimenter says to you how many and
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800
experimenter says to you how many and
you say 15 and because you're happy and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
you say 15 and because you're happy and
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.999
you say 15 and because you're happy and
you're happy with yourself because

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
you're happy with yourself because
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889
you're happy with yourself because
you've been paying attention and and the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
you've been paying attention and and the
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600
you've been paying attention and and the
experimenter says yeah that's right or

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
experimenter says yeah that's right or
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670
experimenter says yeah that's right or
maybe not maybe you missed one and then

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
maybe not maybe you missed one and then
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410
maybe not maybe you missed one and then
the experimenter says did you see the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
the experimenter says did you see the
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.270
the experimenter says did you see the
gorilla and half of you say what what

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280
gorilla and half of you say what what
 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.150
gorilla and half of you say what what
what gorilla like really and he and the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
what gorilla like really and he and the
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.710
what gorilla like really and he and the
experimenter says yes and then he

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
experimenter says yes and then he
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960
experimenter says yes and then he
rewinds it and plays the video and like

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
rewinds it and plays the video and like
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940
rewinds it and plays the video and like
a minute and a half into the three

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
a minute and a half into the three
 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.300
a minute and a half into the three
video sure enough in walks this guy in a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
video sure enough in walks this guy in a
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.750
video sure enough in walks this guy in a
gorilla suit six foot three here so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760
gorilla suit six foot three here so
 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.880
gorilla suit six foot three here so
stands in the middle of the game right

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
stands in the middle of the game right
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.520
stands in the middle of the game right
in the middle of the game the same size

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
in the middle of the game the same size
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.780
in the middle of the game the same size
as the players perfectly obviously

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
as the players perfectly obviously
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.610

evident beats his chest for like a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
evident beats his chest for like a
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770
evident beats his chest for like a
second and a half and then sort of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
second and a half and then sort of
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.180
second and a half and then sort of
saunters off and half the people who

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
saunters off and half the people who
 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.509
saunters off and half the people who
watch the video don't see the gorilla

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519
watch the video don't see the gorilla
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.160
watch the video don't see the gorilla
which is absolutely shocking and what

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
which is absolutely shocking and what
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.259
which is absolutely shocking and what
that means is that your ambitions blind

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269
that means is that your ambitions blind
 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.199
that means is that your ambitions blind
you to the nature of reality

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209
you to the nature of reality
 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.259
you to the nature of reality
now they illuminate some reality but

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
now they illuminate some reality but
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.240
now they illuminate some reality but
they blind you to most of it and that's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
they blind you to most of it and that's
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.610
they blind you to most of it and that's
fine because you're not there's not a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
fine because you're not there's not a
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.259
fine because you're not there's not a
lotta you in some ways you're a very

lotta you in some ways you're a very
pinpoint thing like a laser beam and so

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849
pinpoint thing like a laser beam and so
 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.100
pinpoint thing like a laser beam and so
you just can't be attending to

you just can't be attending to
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.350
you just can't be attending to
everything all the time but one of the

everything all the time but one of the

things that you might ask yourself once
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440
things that you might ask yourself once
you know that is that if you're

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
you know that is that if you're
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.240
you know that is that if you're
suffering dreadfully then one

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
suffering dreadfully then one
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.539
suffering dreadfully then one

fact that you're so fixed on the point
that you're fixed on might be integrally

that you're fixed on might be integrally
 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.069
that you're fixed on might be integrally

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
does quite nicely to see if he'll turn
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.000
does quite nicely to see if he'll turn
against God and it seems like a rather

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010
against God and it seems like a rather
 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.620
against God and it seems like a rather
playground sort of thing for God to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
playground sort of thing for God to
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.229
playground sort of thing for God to
engage in but the point is is that even

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239
engage in but the point is is that even
 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.839
engage in but the point is is that even
in a document like the Old Testament

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849
in a document like the Old Testament
 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.150
in a document like the Old Testament
there's ample

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160
there's ample
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.140
there's ample
suggestion that sometimes people just

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
suggestion that sometimes people just
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.319
suggestion that sometimes people just
get wiped out and hurt even if they're

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329
get wiped out and hurt even if they're
 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.770
get wiped out and hurt even if they're
living good moral lives aiming properly

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
living good moral lives aiming properly
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.059
living good moral lives aiming properly
and all that there's an arbitrariness in

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069
and all that there's an arbitrariness in
 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.599
and all that there's an arbitrariness in
life you that's not it erratic low but

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609
life you that's not it erratic low but
 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.750
life you that's not it erratic low but
it's possible that it's what you're

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
it's possible that it's what you're
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.469
it's possible that it's what you're
clinging to that's hurting you and it's

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479
clinging to that's hurting you and it's
 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.089
clinging to that's hurting you and it's
even possible that's the thing that

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099
even possible that's the thing that
 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.349
even possible that's the thing that
you're clinging to the hardest that's

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
you're clinging to the hardest that's
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.640
you're clinging to the hardest that's
hurting you the most that could easily

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
hurting you the most that could easily
 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.680
hurting you the most that could easily
be someone you love like lots of times I

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690
be someone you love like lots of times I
 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.330
be someone you love like lots of times I
see people in therapy and they're

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
see people in therapy and they're
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.560
see people in therapy and they're
miserable for

miserable for
 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.810
miserable for
in another sometimes it's because they

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820
in another sometimes it's because they
 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.520
in another sometimes it's because they
have a very close relationship with a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530
have a very close relationship with a
 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.040
have a very close relationship with a
family member and that just isn't

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
family member and that just isn't
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.550
family member and that just isn't
working you know the family member for

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560
working you know the family member for
 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.250
working you know the family member for
the sake of simplicity will say is not

the sake of simplicity will say is not
really oriented towards helping them

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
really oriented towards helping them

really oriented towards helping them
have a good life the family member is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
have a good life the family member is
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.660

instead oriented towards making them as

instead oriented towards making them as
 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.100
instead oriented towards making them as
bloody miserable as you can possibly

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
bloody miserable as you can possibly
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.110
bloody miserable as you can possibly
make anyone and and what would you say

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120
make anyone and and what would you say
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.870
make anyone and and what would you say
exploiting the the bond between family

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880
exploiting the the bond between family
 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.410
exploiting the the bond between family
members in order to enable that and then

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420
members in order to enable that and then
 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.930
members in order to enable that and then
sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940
sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary
 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.070
sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary
is either merely distancing yourself

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080
is either merely distancing yourself
 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.950
is either merely distancing yourself
from that person sometimes substantively

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
from that person sometimes substantively
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.860
from that person sometimes substantively
and sometimes seriously distancing

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870
and sometimes seriously distancing
 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.920
and sometimes seriously distancing
yourself from like we don't talk anymore

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930
yourself from like we don't talk anymore
 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.220
yourself from like we don't talk anymore
ever and so that's pretty damn rough and

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230
ever and so that's pretty damn rough and
 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.510
ever and so that's pretty damn rough and
it hurts and all of that but but it's a

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520
it hurts and all of that but but it's a
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.190
it hurts and all of that but but it's a
good example of the fact that sometimes

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200
good example of the fact that sometimes
 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.870
good example of the fact that sometimes
in order to extract yourself from the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880
in order to extract yourself from the
 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.000
in order to extract yourself from the
miserable bit of chaos that you happen

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010
miserable bit of chaos that you happen
 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.310
miserable bit of chaos that you happen
to be in meshed in you have to let go of

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
to be in meshed in you have to let go of
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.150
to be in meshed in you have to let go of
what you love best if the world you are

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160
what you love best if the world you are
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.740
what you love best if the world you are
seeing is not the world you want

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
seeing is not the world you want
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.660
seeing is not the world you want
therefore it's time to examine your

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670
therefore it's time to examine your
 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.690
therefore it's time to examine your
values that's really worth it's really

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700
values that's really worth it's really
 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.800
values that's really worth it's really
worth thinking about you know because

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
worth thinking about you know because
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.780
worth thinking about you know because
the alternative to is to curse fate

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790
the alternative to is to curse fate
 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.330
the alternative to is to curse fate
right because if it isn't you there's

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340
right because if it isn't you there's
 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.920
right because if it isn't you there's
nothing you can do to change there isn't

nothing you can do to change there isn't
something you're doing that's wrong then

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700
something you're doing that's wrong then
 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.150
something you're doing that's wrong then
it's faith itself it's the world itself

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160
it's faith itself it's the world itself
 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.620
it's faith itself it's the world itself
it's other people let's say because

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630
it's other people let's say because
 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.910
it's other people let's say because
they're a huge part of the world or it's

believe in or don't believe in because
 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.360
believe in or don't believe in because
it's fundamentally all the same in this

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370
it's fundamentally all the same in this
 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.030
it's fundamentally all the same in this
sort of situation that I'm describing so

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040
sort of situation that I'm describing so
 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.500
sort of situation that I'm describing so
and one of the things that's really

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510
and one of the things that's really
 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.880
and one of the things that's really
interesting and I mentioned this before

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890
interesting and I mentioned this before
 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.140
interesting and I mentioned this before
about the Israelites in the Old

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150
about the Israelites in the Old
 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.840
about the Israelites in the Old
Testament is that they they got this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850
Testament is that they they got this
 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.660
Testament is that they they got this
right it's really something because what

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670
right it's really something because what
 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.250
right it's really something because what
happens to the Israelites over and over

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
happens to the Israelites over and over
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.500
happens to the Israelites over and over
in the Old Testament is that they get

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510
in the Old Testament is that they get
 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.690
in the Old Testament is that they get
all puffed up about how wonderful they

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700
all puffed up about how wonderful they
 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.640
all puffed up about how wonderful they
are and then they make moral errors

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650
are and then they make moral errors
 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.620
are and then they make moral errors
because they're arrogant and then God

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630
because they're arrogant and then God
 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.210
because they're arrogant and then God
comes along and just cuts them into

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220
comes along and just cuts them into
 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.160
comes along and just cuts them into
pieces for like generation after

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170
pieces for like generation after
 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.710
pieces for like generation after
generation and then they wobble back to

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720
generation and then they wobble back to
 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.230
generation and then they wobble back to
their feet and but they always maintain

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240
their feet and but they always maintain
 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.180
their feet and but they always maintain
the same attitude which is

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190
the same attitude which is
 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.920
the same attitude which is
we did something wrong we did something

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930
we did something wrong we did something
 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.110
we did something wrong we did something
wrong it's like it's like it's like an

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
wrong it's like it's like it's like an
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.050
wrong it's like it's like it's like an
axiom rather than an observation is that

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060
axiom rather than an observation is that
 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.570
axiom rather than an observation is that
if we're not if things are not laying

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
if we're not if things are not laying
 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.180
if we're not if things are not laying
themselves out for us as they should be

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190
themselves out for us as they should be
 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.330
themselves out for us as they should be
then we cannot curse god we have to look

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340
then we cannot curse god we have to look
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.420
then we cannot curse god we have to look
to ourselves well and you think well why

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430
to ourselves well and you think well why
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.660
to ourselves well and you think well why
not curse god yes maybe it's his fault

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670
not curse god yes maybe it's his fault
 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.030
not curse god yes maybe it's his fault
and that's a really good question and

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040
and that's a really good question and
 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.070
and that's a really good question and
one of the things that I've tried to

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080
one of the things that I've tried to
 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.590
one of the things that I've tried to
figure out over the last 30 years is

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600
figure out over the last 30 years is
 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.200
figure out over the last 30 years is
well why not just curse God because

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210
well why not just curse God because
 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.060
well why not just curse God because
there is this arbitrary element to

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070
there is this arbitrary element to
 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.460
there is this arbitrary element to
existence and we are vulnerable and

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470
existence and we are vulnerable and
 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.020
existence and we are vulnerable and
there is a plenty of suffering and

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030
there is a plenty of suffering and
 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.030
there is a plenty of suffering and
things are unfair like there's problems

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040
things are unfair like there's problems
 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.320
things are unfair like there's problems
right there's injustice and unfairness

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330
