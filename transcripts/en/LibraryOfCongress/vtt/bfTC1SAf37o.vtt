00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.160
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Good evening.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.810
Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.020
Hi. Thank you for coming.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.320
Thank you so much.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.620
I'm Thea Austen.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.920
I'm the public events
coordinator

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.240
for the American
Folk Life Center.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.330
And on behalf of all of
our staff, we really want

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.910
to thank you for coming tonight
for a very special evening.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.800
This is part of the Homegrown
series which was created

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.120
to showcase the best
of traditional music,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.820
dance and narrative arts
from around the country,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.230
and sometimes from
beyond the country.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
We usually work with state
folklorists and with partners

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.000
like the Millennium Stage at the
Kennedy Center and hold these

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.330
in college auditoriums.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.100
But this time we're changing up.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.740
We came into a more
intimate space

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.970
for a very special performance.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.440
You can find more information

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.870
about the Folk Life Center
outside on the tables

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.230
where you'll also see DVDs
and CDs and things like that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.530
by our two performers.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410
So I want to make
sure you take a look

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.920
at that later after the show.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.730
Just a little bit of
housekeeping in that we have

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.110
to make sure that everybody's
out of the building by 9:30

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.900
because the magical electric
magnetic door locks spring

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.000
into action and the cops don't
even have control of them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.410
So we need to make sure
everybody gets out by then.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.330
Also we love mobile phones.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.630
We really do.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.190
The Veterans History
Project which is part

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.190
of the Folk Life
Center even has an app

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.270
to help you do oral
histories with your family

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.410
and then submit them
for our collections.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.330
But we don't want your
phones ringing right now.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.180
So if you haven't
turned them off,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.730
please turn off your phones.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.460
So why are you all here?

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.160
Well, in the 1970s,
cousins Connie Regan Blake

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.490
and Barbara Freeman
were both working

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.580
at the Chattanooga
Public Library,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.450
Barbara as a children's
librarian and Connie

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.240
as a full-time storyteller

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.460
for a special outreach
program called More.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.470
And I think she was called
Miss Daisy and had a blue dress

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.850
with daisies all over it.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.700
In 1973, they attended the first
National Storytelling Festival

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.590
in Jonesborough, Tennessee.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.860
That's where they met Ray and
Rosa Hicks of Beach Mountain,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.190
North Carolina who became
lasting friends and mentors.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.570
They realized they had a
special gift for telling stories

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.400
and they left their jobs, left
their careers at the library

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.050
to perform nationally and
internationally as folk tellers.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.160
Connie and Barbara pioneered
tandem telling which is a type

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.520
of duet storytelling
performance.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.110
And they were on the founding
board of directors for NAPPS,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.000
the National Association for the
Preservation and Perpetuation

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.590
of Storytelling which is
now called the National

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.890
Storytelling Network.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.760
In 1985, the folk tellers moved
to Asheville, North Carolina

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.880
and began working on a play
entitled Mountain Sweet Talk.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.050
This two-act, fully staged play
starred Connie and Barbara,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.600
incorporating original
materials and stories

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.900
from the folk tellers.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.170
The show ran for seven seasons,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.370
1986-1992 with over
300 performances.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.150
And I think it's the
longest-running play,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.260
right, in Asheville.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.750
The folk tellers also
toured across the country,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.090
performing at folk festivals
including the Smithsonian

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.830
Festival here in Washington.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.860
Connie and Barbara eventually
moved on to solo careers

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.710
and both are
internationally-recognized

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.440
storytellers.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.540
Connie Regen-Blake's collection
of recordings, photographs,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.510
correspondence and memorabilia

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.510
with documents both
her storytelling career

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.220
and the larger storytelling
scene from the 1970's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.010
to the present day is
part of the archive

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.330
of the American Folk
Life Center.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.640
So in this special evening
program, the two cousins

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.530
and performing partners
step back in time

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.970
to perform together once again.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.510
Please welcome Connie
Regen-Blake and Barbara Freeman.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:34.050
[ Applause ]

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.290
For an encore we will --

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.810
&gt;&gt; We are very excited to be
here and doing this and we're

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.110
so glad each one of
you all came tonight.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.100
It would be a very different
experience if you had not.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.900
We still would have been
telling, but we're glad

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.820
to have you here,
delighted for it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.810
And we're going to start
with one of our favorites,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.710
and it's called No News
or What Killed the Dog.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.400
On Edison Records --

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.820
&gt;&gt; It was gifted to
us by Marshall Dodge.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.920
&gt;&gt; A certain southern
lady was returning home

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.090
after recuperating in the
mountains for three months.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.390
My friend --

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.690
&gt;&gt; Georgianna.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.660
&gt;&gt; Met me at the
railroad station platform.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.500
Georgianna, has there been
any news while I've been away?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.980
&gt;&gt; No. No news.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.490
&gt;&gt; No news?

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.910
Surely something must have
happened in my absence.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.100
I've been gone for most nearly
three months and I am anxious

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.510
for any little bit
of news you may have.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.970
&gt;&gt; Well, since you mentioned
it, of course it don't amount

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.440
to much, but since you've
been away, your dog died.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.380
&gt;&gt; My dog died?

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he went over and ate
some of the burnt horse flesh

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.500
and that's what killed the dog.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.380
&gt;&gt; Burnt horse flesh?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.230
&gt;&gt; See, after the fire
cooled off, the dog went over

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.140
and ate some of the
burnt horse flesh

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.080
and that's what killed the dog.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.150
&gt;&gt; After the fire cooled off?

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.450
&gt;&gt; See, the barn burned down,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.980
burned up all the
cows and horses.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.890
The fire cooled off, the
dog went over and ate some

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.700
of the burnt horse flesh and
that's what killed your dog.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.030
&gt;&gt; My barn burned down?

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.170
How did my barn burn down?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, it was a spark
from the house.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.350
See, it flew over, landed
on the roof of the barn,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.000
burned down the barn, burned
up all the cows and horses.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.580
The fire cooled off, the
dog went over and ate some

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.440
of the burnt horse flesh.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.110
That's what killed the dog.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.100
&gt;&gt; A spark from the house?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.470
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, now that's
completely burned down.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.740
&gt;&gt; Well how did my
house burn down?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.130
&gt;&gt; It was those candles.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.030
They just kind of caught on
the curtains, shot up the side

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.630
of the wall, burned
down the house.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.370
A spark fell on the
roof of the barn --

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.670
&gt;&gt; Candles?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.510
Georgianna, I don't have
any candles in the house.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.620
I don't even allow
candles in the house.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.910
How did candles get
in the house?

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.510
&gt;&gt; Oh, they was around
the coffin.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.340
[ Laughter ]

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.640
&gt;&gt; The coffin?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.940
Who died?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, now, you needn't
worry about that.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.310
Since you've been away,
your mother-in-law died.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.040
&gt;&gt; Oh. My mother-in-law,
what a pity.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.060
[ Laughter ]

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.550
How did she die?

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.240
&gt;&gt; Well some folks say it
was from the shock of hearing

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.010
that your husband ran off
with the choir leader.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.310
[ Laughter ]

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.760
But other than that,
there ain't been no news.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.730
&gt;&gt; May all your news
be good news.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:54.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.610
&gt;&gt; This thing is
starting up my nose.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.720
Should I pull it back down?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.530
&gt;&gt; I think so, or get
Everett if we need to.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.830
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.130
&gt;&gt; Is that okay?

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.430
&gt;&gt; Let me try here.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.730
&gt;&gt; Is it hiding my dimple?

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.030
It's the only good
feature I have.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, are we still
okay on sound, everybody?

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.450
Still good.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.700
And I know some of you folks
in here go back a long way

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.350
with the folk tellers, right
back to the very beginnings

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.760
of the folk tellers in 1975.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.060
So it's really fun

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.680
to be breathing this
air into these stories.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.300
And this next one is
a traditional story.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.650
We always loved to think about
Ray Hicks, his wife Rosa,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.690
bring them on stage with us.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.820
And kind of in that
way they influenced

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.250
so much of what we do.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.290
And we have such
gratitude to them.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.180
But this is one of the
grandfather tales that we took

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.380
and made a little folk
tellerese within it.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.310
And it is like this.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.930
&gt;&gt; Once upon a time --

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.510
&gt;&gt; Back when turkeys
chewed tobacco --

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.760
&gt;&gt; And clog dancers
had wooden feet --

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.740
&gt;&gt; There were two women.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.100
&gt;&gt; Regina May.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.950
&gt;&gt; And Willa Mena.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.070
&gt;&gt; Now these two women
were the best of friends.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.670
&gt;&gt; But they lived in a community

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.870
where folks were
always at one another.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.580
&gt;&gt; Whenever anyone got together,
they'd start into arguing back

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.520
and forth and back and forth.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.530
Arguing about who could
stitch the prettiest quilt.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.790
&gt;&gt; Or who could spit the
furthest or who could check

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.550
out the most library
books in an hour.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.490
&gt;&gt; You know, that sort of thing.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.040
&gt;&gt; Well, one day
the two women got

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.530
to talking about their husbands.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.050
&gt;&gt; And how foolish
they could act.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.770
&gt;&gt; And they got to talking
about what was the craziest,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.820
most foolish thing
they'd ever done.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.270
Now they were both experts
on this particular subject.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.610
They had plenty to draw upon.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.840
And they started
making out a list.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.040
And they started
comparing notes.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.730
Then their tempers
started to flare.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.190
&gt;&gt; Their voices got
louder and louder

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.490
and they got into an argument.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.820
&gt;&gt; And they commenced to stare
one another down and going back

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.120
and forth and forth and back.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.420
&gt;&gt; And forth and back.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.720
&gt;&gt; Until finally it came

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.730
about that the only
way to settle this --

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.570
&gt;&gt; Was to make a bet.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.970
&gt;&gt; A bet as to which one's
husband would prove himself

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.980
to be the biggest fool.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.580
And they gave each other
a week to do it in.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.740
&gt;&gt; Now Willa Mena knew she
would have no trouble with a bet

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.970
like that because
she was married

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.640
to the world's very
best hypochondriac.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.810
He was always sick,
getting sicker.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.940
If somebody came in and
said they had a headache,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.720
within a few seconds you would
hear Willa Mena's husband say,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.540
"I think I've got a headache,
and a [coughing] cold too."

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.700
So out of sheer love for him,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.080
whenever Willa Mena had any
free time at all, she would go

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.930
and pull books off their shelf
and she would flip through them

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.540
to see if any book bothered to
mention a disease or a symptom.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.370
And if she found
something in print,

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.890
I'm sorry to say she's just rip
out the page, because she knew

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.280
if her old man got ahold
of a book that talked

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.800
about a disease, he
would come down with it.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.280
And she would have
to deal with it.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.550
So she thought she
would just use

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.400
that little tidbit for the bet.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.180
So when he came walking
through the front door,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.370
Willa Mena started
in with a question.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.010
"Honey, do you feel all right?"

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:48.010
He said he thought he felt fine,
but he was open for suggestions.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.310
[ Laughter ]

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.790
She said, "Just come
over here, honey.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.560
Slowly, slowly, slowly,
sit yourself down.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.140
You're looking like puny.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.120
I'm going to fix you
up as best I can."

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.490
She ran out to her little herb
garden and she ripped herself

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.580
up some angelica and
some spignent to thicken

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.920
and thin his blood
in due course.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.250
And then she threw
in some ginseng just

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.570
to confuse the other two.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.760
She kind of force-fed
him throughout the day

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.580
and he had a big old
smile all over his face

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.160
because he was feeling
pretty good,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.560
getting all that
attention from Willa Mena.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.600
Well, the next morning, bright
and early, before he was awake,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.120
she took him by the
shoulders and she shook him.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.710
"Honey Bunch, stick
out your tongue.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.010
I hope you're not going to put

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.230
that tongue back
into your mouth.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.960
From the looks of it, you've
done come down with something.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.840
But I'm going to keep you
alive the best I can."

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.190
And by that evening, that
smile had flattened out

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:05.520
and turned completely upside
down into one serious frown.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.640
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, back
at Regina May's,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.090
she had a different tactic
for winning that bet.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.270
When her husband come walking
through the cabin door,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.890
she's sitting behind her loom,
throwing that shuttle back

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.520
and forth, clicking and clacking
and clicking and clacking.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.060
And it without a single
piece of threat on it.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.060
Her husband, he came over and
he looked and watched and looked

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.780
and finally he said,
"Regina May,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.230
what is it that you're doing?"

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.640
She said, "Why, I'm weaving."

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.030
And before he could say another
word or ask another question,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.700
she came back with
an, "Oh, this is some

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.970
of the finest thread I
have ever worked with.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.780
Folks told me it comes
from virgin sheep.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:53.010
And any husband lying to his
wife can't even see it at all."

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.310
[ Laughter ]

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.720
He peered down just a little bit
closer, took off his spectacles,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.160
cleaned them and said, "You
know, I believe that may be some

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.040
of the finest thread
I've ever laid eyes on."

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.770
And she just smiled real big and
for the next two or three days,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.560
whenever her husband come
walking through the cabin door,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.700
there she sat, behind that loom,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.840
throwing that empty shuttle
back and forth in midair.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.400
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, back
at Willa Mena's,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.290
she had done a wonderful job
of convincing her old man

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.240
that he was a near goner.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.550
She scooted up a little chair
alongside of his bed and looked

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:35.800
at him real pitiful-like and
she said, "Honey, I'm sure going

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.220
to miss you when you're gone."

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.730
[Sobbing] She cried on.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:47.100
"And I just hate to tell
you this, but I've done gone

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.860
and had your coffin made.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.960
And while you've got just
enough strength left in you,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.110
you sure could help
me out a powerful lot

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:05.030
if you would just help
me get you on into it."

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.630
She drug that coffin box

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.500
over near the bed,
parallel to the bed.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:17.140
And she said, "It just pains
me to ask you to move yourself

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.760
from your snug little deathbed
over into your coffin."

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:29.150
"Yeah, Willa Mena,
that's plumb awful.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.600
But I'm thinking there's
something worse than that.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.380
When a friend dies, you lose
a friend, but when you die,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.660
I think you lose
all your friends."

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.310
[Sobbing] And she used that
opportunity to get him on a roll

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.200
and she got him right
down into that coffin box.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.480
She thought it was a good sign
too, because he landed face-up.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.260
She reached over and
petted him on the forehead

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.850
and by the time he closed those
beady little hypochondriac eyes,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.980
I'll be if he didn't
look downright grave.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.590
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, back
at Regina May's,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.030
she figured she'd spent
enough time behind that loom.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.980
So the next time her
husband came walking

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.890
through the cabin
door, she said, "Honey,

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.440
would you help me
move this here bolt

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.290
of cloth over to that table."

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.540
She said, "Watch out, don't
let it drag the floor."

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.890
And he just raised
his arms up higher.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.140
She got over the table and was
acting like she was spreading

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.430
out a piece of material,
got her a pair of scissors

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.740
and she went to cutting.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:38.670
Now he watched and looked and
watched and finally he said,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.310
"Regina May, what is
it that you're making?"

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.980
She said, "Well, I'm
making you the finest suit

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.090
of clothes you'll ever put on."

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.830
And she kept cutting.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.730
Then she got her a needle and
some of that special thread

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.160
and she went over and sat down
and went to stitching, sewing in

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.920
and out, in and out, stitching
up nothing but thin air.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.720
Her husband watched for a
little while and then he went

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.780
on to bed, and she
sat up half the night.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.450
Next morning, first
thing she said, "Honey,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.950
it's ready for you to try on."

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.490
He came into the parlor
and she held up like this

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.940
and he figured, "That
must be the pants."

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.320
He took one leg and
then the other.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.620
She said, "Raise your arms up."

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.010
And he just knew
that was the shirt.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.600
She went right over the top.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.060
She help up one more
time and he thought,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.740
"That must be the jacket."

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.290
So he kind of backed right
into it and she said,

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.150
"Now would you look at that?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.710
Turn around there."

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.230
He turned around twice and
she said, "Now, you know,

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.390
I think it's a perfect fit."

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:44.010
And he was standing there in
nothing but a pair of boots.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.310
[ Laughter ]

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.180
&gt;&gt; That same crystal clear
morning, Willa Mena leaned

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.590
over the coffin box
and said, "Oh, me.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.670
He's done died during
the night."

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.010
And her old man figured
she must be right.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.310
[ Laughter ]

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.700
So Willa Mena got real busy

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.820
and she spread word
throughout the entire community.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.200
She wanted everybody to
gather down at the cemetery

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.780
for what could turn out to be
a pretty good revival of sorts.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.870
And she got a neighbor
friends to help her load

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.330
up that old heavy
wooden coffin box full

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.510
of her husband onto the wagon.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.440
And she hitched up
the team of horses

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.920
and she started on
off down the road.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.470
And she got to the burying
grounds and folks were clustered

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.080
and gathered all about.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:41.120
And who should be coming down
the sawmill road but Regina May

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.290
and her old man, and him
in his new suit of clothes.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.090
He's walking along telling
folks howdy, shaking hands

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.010
with every other
one, telling them all

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.480
about this fine new suit of
clothes his wife made him

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.860
and all about that special
quality of those virgin sheep.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.650
Folks didn't quite
know what to do.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.440
I mean, this was their neighbor.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.280
They'd known him all his life,

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.010
but they'd honestly never
seen him in this light before.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.310
[ Laughter ]

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.480
Mostly they were just staring.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.840
Then a few of the children
started giggling just a

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.140
little bit.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.200
&gt;&gt; And then old Preacher
Dry Fry just started howling

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.210
and laughing and slapping his
legs and made so much noise

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.180
and so much ruckus that
the dead man got curious.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.930
He sat up in his coffin to
see what was going on and all.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.230
&gt;&gt; And when he did that,

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.210
folks just took off
running in all directions.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.130
&gt;&gt; And then the corpse must have
got a glimpse of his neighbor,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.330
and maybe some of
what was happening.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.580
Because he started laughing
and rocking that coffin box,

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.920
almost fell out of it.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.630
&gt;&gt; Then it dawned on folks,

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.250
there was some foolishness
going on.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.160
&gt;&gt; So they all came back to
find out what all had happened.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.780
And they all discovered
that Regina May

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.960
and Willa Mena had done
gone and made a bet as to

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.150
which one was married
to the biggest fool.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.010
&gt;&gt; Both of which were
now currently on display.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.310
[ Laughter ]

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.720
&gt;&gt; Now you may have
made up in your mind,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.920
decided which one won the bet.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.720
But we need to tell
you that Regina May

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.510
and Willa Mena never settled it.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.440
&gt;&gt; Why you can come into
the community day or night.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.500
You will still hear
Regina May and Willa Mena

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.490
and their husbands and all
the folks are still betting

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.790
about it.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.090
&gt;&gt; They're arguing
about it, going back

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.390
and forth and forth and back.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.110
&gt;&gt; Why they sound
downright foolish.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.510
&gt;&gt; You bet.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:48.250
[ Applause ]

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.650
&gt;&gt; I want you to know this
is only like the second time

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.400
in a long time that we
have had this opportunity

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.890
and taken the opportunity
to tell together.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.810
So it makes it extra
special for tonight.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.650
We're going to end this
little tandem part --

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.950
each of us are going to go

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.520
and we'll be each
doing a short solo set.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.210
And then I think a few Q and A's

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.390
if you all have any
questions or interview.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.500
And then we're going to end on a
tandem as well at the very end.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.090
But to end this set, we're going
to do another favorite, right?

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.760
&gt;&gt; Are we going to do Jazzy?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.060
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.360
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.100
&gt;&gt; And this is one we learned
from Shoshana Coriscov.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.900
She was five years old
when she taught it to us.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.180
We spiffed it up a
little bit here and there,

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.630
filled in a few blanks
and it goes like this.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.000
&gt;&gt; Fulfilleries I
think we call it.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.300
&gt;&gt; I think that's it.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.630
And it goes like this.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.090
&gt;&gt; Once upon a time in a nursery
rhyme, there were three bears.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.550
I said three bears.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.790
They all went a-walking through
the green woods a-talking.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.350
Along come a little girl
with long shiny golden hair.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.650
Her name was --

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.950
&gt;&gt; Goldilocks.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.250
&gt;&gt; Her name was --

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.550
&gt;&gt; Goldilocks.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.850
&gt;&gt; Upon the door she knocked.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.060
Baboom, baboom, baboom,
boom, boom.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.360
&gt;&gt; But no one was there.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.660
&gt;&gt; No.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.960
&gt;&gt; No one was there.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.190
She walked right in, had herself
a ball, a-eating and a-rocking

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.940
and a-sleeping and all.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.530
&gt;&gt; She didn't care
no one was there.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.230
&gt;&gt; She didn't care.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.270
&gt;&gt; Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa home
came the three bears,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.160
tired from the woods.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:28.340
Ready to sit down to some
homecooked goods, yeah.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.680
&gt;&gt; "Someone's been
eating my porridge,"

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.810
said the Papa bear,
said the Mama bear.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:41.350
&gt;&gt; "Hey Mama, she-bear,"
said that little wee bear.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.080
"Someone has broken my chair."

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.010
&gt;&gt; Well they went upstairs
to see what they could find,

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.700
saw Goldilocks in bed
asleep all the time.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.230
She woke up, broke up the party
and boogied on out of there.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.850
&gt;&gt; "Ba-doom bye,"
said the Papa bear.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.430
"Ba-doom bye," said
the Mama bear.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.120
&gt;&gt; "Hey Mama, she-bear,"
said that little wee bear.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.880
"What kind of bear
was that there, huh?"

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.780
&gt;&gt; And that is the story
of the three bears,

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.410
I said the three bears.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.710
&gt;&gt; I said the three.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.010
&gt;&gt; I said the three.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.010

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.080
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you so much.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.340

my video person I was going

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.640
to be walking over here.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.790
But I'm going to very quickly
-- the way I work on stories is

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.760
to record them, so I'm going
to record this little set here.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.020
And so you know,
I get my stories

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.050
from lots of different places.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.710
And sometimes from
the newspaper.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.730
This one is a Family Circus
cartoon, just a little bit

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.310
that I would like
to share with you.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.140
It's one of my favorites.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.160
The Mama was sitting
and reading a folk tale,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.440
fairy tale, to her little boy.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.570
He was sitting right on her
lap, and they got to the ending

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:14.230
and the Mama said, "And they
lived happily ever after."

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:19.510
And that little boy said, "Boy,
I did not see that coming."

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.060
[ Laughter ]

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.620
And I have to say, with
this life unfolding

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.020
of doing storytelling, I
did not see this coming.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.360
But I am so grateful that
everything that happened,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.720
that Barbara introduced
me to storytelling.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.660
She was the first one to
open that door and say,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.310
I think you can do this.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.340
And then our wonderful career
together and now with both

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.910
of us doing solo work, it
has been quite a journey.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:57.650
And in these years, storytelling
has taken me to all 50 states,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.500
34 countries and six
continents so far.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.380
And I think it works out well
that I happen to love to travel.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.210
And I also am fascinated
by maps.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.310
I always have been.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.910
You know, this idea
of holding something.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.950
Now some of you here maybe
have never held a paper map.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:24.770
But it used to be that you would
fold out or have small ones

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.220
and I still like to
do that sometimes.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.090
Because those maps, they really
represent sometimes hundreds

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.730
or thousands of miles,
different terrain, you know,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.760
landscapes, lakes and mountains.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.580
A dot can represent a
city of 20 million people.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.770
Vast oceans.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:51.670
There's this magic that
comes with these maps.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.270
And I happen, whenever
I'm traveling

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.770
out of the United States,

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.120
I always travel with
a laminated map.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.240
I actually brought
it with me tonight.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.230
And once, a few years
back, I was in kind

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.760
of an isolated place in China.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.940
I was at the Wei Chin
temple in the gardens.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.690
And that's right at
the base of Mt. Washan.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.510
And I was going to be
climbing up that mountain.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.740
I was kind of gathering myself.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.160
I'd been practicing on our
steep driveway for months.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.400
And I was very excited about it.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.430
But I was walking
through the gardens

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.810
and no other westerners around.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.330
And I smiled at one
of the villagers

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.640
and right away they came up to
me and indicated they wanted

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.990
to have someone take their
picture of themselves and me.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.080
They wanted a picture with me.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.650
And I was a little bit
flattered, but it was only later

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.140
that I found out there are
not many gray-haired people

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.010
in China.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.310
[ Laughter ]

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.990
And so it was a little of that,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.960
there was a little
ulterior motive

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.900
that they were wanting
this picture with me.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.390
But I don't speak any Mandarin.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.150
I don't speak any
of the dialects.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.920
But I did what I always
do when I'm traveling.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.620
I pulled out this laminated map.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.600
It's a small one,
folds in threes.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.430
And on one side is the world.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.740
So I turned it to the
world side and pointed

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.840
to where we were
in eastern China.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.400
And then I pointed to the
United states, you know, for me.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.060
And then I turned
that map over --

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.780
and almost everyone
everywhere I've traveled,

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.430
no matter how remote
the place might be,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.190
people seem to know
the English words

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.990
"New York and San Francisco."

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.290
And so I pointed those

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.210
out on this larger map
of the United States.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.600
And then I pointed
to North Carolina,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.030
Asheville where I was living.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.450
Back to me.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.920
And like that, we were talking.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.440
We were having this conversation

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.460
without knowing each
other's languages.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.430
I also travel with photographs.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.000
And I had some pictures
of my husband Phil

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.180
and of the Appalachian
mountains where we live,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.300
a picture of my cat Alaska.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.840
And by this time, a few more
people had joined our circle

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.980
and it was getting kind
of bigger and bigger.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.170
And people took the
photos and they started,

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.360
and then someone else walked
up and someone was showing

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.750
that person her husband,
and this is her cat.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.190
And showing I was able to
hear some of those words

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.520
with a mandarin accent.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.920
And it was really quite
magical and extraordinary to me,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.400
to know that this map is this
gateway to communicating.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.300
This way of without
knowing other languages,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.760
it really opens the
door to that.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.360
So I have always had this
fascination with maps.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:08.340
So as you might imagine, for a
map geek, I was quite delighted

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.560
when Google Maps came along.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.490
And I used it quite
a bit, and a number

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.070
of years ago I was invited
to come down to Australia

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.860
to do some storytelling
in a workshop.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.700
And the people that had hired
me had sent me the address

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.680
of the workshop.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.630
And I had a friend who was
living right outside --

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.500
the workshop was
going to be in Sydney.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.700
And I had a friend
who was living outside

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.370
of Sydney at the time.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.460
And I thought, "Oh,
I wonder where she is

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.300
in relationship to
this workshop.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.000
Maybe she could attend
or something."

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.230
And so I went straight
to Google and I typed

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:55.880
in 1154 New Trion Road, South
Wales, Sydney, Australia.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.710
And you know, Google
located that.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.030
And the next thing, if you use
Google, the next thing that pops

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.480
up is your home address.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.800
And I thought, "Huh, I wonder
how Google would take me

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.880
from Asheville to Australia."

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.490
So I pressed Get Directions.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.290
And without thinking,
I pressed print.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:25.040
[ Laughter ]

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:32.210
17 pages later, I had
intricate directions for my home

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.510
on Vance Gap to New Trion Road.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:41.200
So Google suggested, as I
was imagining my way west,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.130
Google suggested 40 and
then heading up to Chicago;

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.190
from Chicago over to Nebraska,

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.360
and then taking I-84
into Boise, Idaho.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.010
I thought that was an
interesting choice.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.310
[ Laughter ]

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.640
Then I was to continue west.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.460
And when I got to
the Oregon coast,

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.510
Google said, get in your kayak.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:08.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:17.190
2,786 miles later, which took
14 days and 5 hours according

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:22.770
to Google, I came to
the shore of Hawaii.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.680
Now Google already knew that
there was a road closure

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.830
and so I was going to
have to take a detour.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.210
But I made my way.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.090
I was starting across.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.210
You know, and I saw
signs for Honolulu,

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.340
and I must admit I was
tempted to make a side trip.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.010
But I thought, "No, I have
got to keep my focus."

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.030
Plus I was lugging that kayak.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.610
So I got all the way to
the other end of Hawaii

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:54.280
and Google distinctly said for
me to get back in that kayak,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:00.550
and I was to go 3,879
miles to Japan.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.870
Now it was on this
part of the trip

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.400
that I passed the
international date line.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.470
Not only the time changes,
but the date changes.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:15.330
It was the first time in my life
that I had a geographical reason

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.620
to be a day behind myself.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.110
I landed in Japan and I
was to go just a half-mile

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.540
and pick -- oh my goodness.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.900
Oh, all of a sudden the
directions where in Kanji.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.500
All of the signs were

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.840
in the Japanese language
with characters.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.030
But somehow I made
my way down Japan,

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.530
the whole country,
paying a few tolls.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.000
I had to take a ferry.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.350
But then Google insisted
I get back in the kayak

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:51.020
and 17 days later, I hit
landfall at Australia.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.040
And it was a relatively
easy trip down to Sydney.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.070
[ Laughter ]

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.940
Now at that point, I had
been working out a lot.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.760
And I do a modified Crossfit
and I was deadlifting.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.080
At the time I was
deadlifting 82 pounds

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.320
and I was doing dead
arm hangs and squats.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.410
But I must admit, Google
had a better opinion

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:25.080
of my physical capabilities than
I did, thinking that I could be

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:33.060
in open waters in the
Pacific 11,233 miles.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.600
But I'll tell you, I have
continued working out.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.050
Let me get something
here and I'll show you.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.820
And I continued working out

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.400
and I am actually now
deadlifting double what I was

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.700
deadlifting then.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.940
I'm the strongest I've
ever been in my life.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.800
So who knows?

00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:00.050
Maybe I will give it a try, and
if I do, I have the directions.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.080
[ Laughter ]

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.880
Thank you.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:12.020
[ Applause ]

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.560
Oh my. This happened a few
years ago, and I went back --

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.750
you know, I was in my office
late that night and I got

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.680
so tickled, I almost
lost my breath when all

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.430
of this started printing out.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:27.340
And I went back about two
or three months after that

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.950
and I thought, "You
know, I'm just going

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.340
to print out another copy."

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.780
By then they were already
saying, "Cannot calculate."

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.550
So this might -- Library of
Congress is getting this copy

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.800
and this might be one of the
only copies of directions

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.390
from 51 Vance Gap, Asheville
to New South Wales, Sydney.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.510
So I'm going to -- let me
just check my time here.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.810
Yeah, good.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:04.360
So I'd like to tell you, take
you back on that journey,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.830
change the mood with
this next story

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.980
and tell you another favorite.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.640
Especially from the early days.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.740
It's one that really
became my signature story.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:20.290
And I feel it's one that
helped take Barbara and I

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.470
onto main stages of
folk music festivals all

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.040
over the United States.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.800
Because I think for a lot of
people it was like, "Oh yes,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.800
storytelling's not
only for children.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.220
It's for everyone."

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.220
And some of them
are more for adults.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.860
And this is one of those.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.010
It's a story that takes
place back in the times

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:45.130
when people really depended on
horses, when they were a part

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.250
of their daily lives,
as was death.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.260
Something they had to deal with
and we have to deal with today.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.340
It's called The Two
White Horses.

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.990
Amanda Jane fixed me
with her big, round eyes.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.920
"Mama will be home
tomorrow, won't she, Jenny?"

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.770
She held tight to her ragdoll.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:10.090
I almost said, "Mama will
never be back, Mandy,"

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.440
but I choked back the words.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.790
How could you tell that
to such a little young'in?

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.830
When the neighbor women came to
get Mama ready for the burying,

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.340
they took Mandy and little
Joey over to the men's house.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.020
Nales Woodsby brought
the box to lay Mama in.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.100
They put on her best
taffeted dress,

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.260
the one with the stand-up
collar she only wore

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.180
to church on Sundays.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:40.600
And on Mama's breast there
was pinned Aunt Jenny's pin,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.900
beautiful.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.600
She looks so beautiful
in that coffin.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.770
Well, folks came and
it was Bert and Doc

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.670
who loaded up the coffin.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.260
He loaded it up into the
back of the wagon and Bert

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.410
and Doc pulled that wagon
slow-like all the way

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.680
up to Graveyard Hill.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.640
Mama always loved that view.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.630
You could look out over
most of Greenup County

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.720
with the river winding below.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.020
Meadowlarks were singing

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.020
and I could smell
honeysuckle on the warm air.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:20.060
But I had a cold,
drizzly feeling inside.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.730
The sunshine seemed all wrong.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.350
Preacher Gorge made
a long sermon,

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.530
saying what a fine
woman Mama was

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.340
and telling things
from the Bible.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.010
But I wished he wouldn't
talk so long.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:37.180
I was afraid Papa was going
to break down and cry.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.550
He looked so sad and stern.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.720
Charline Moss and Leslie Crunk
sang, "You've Got to Walk

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.720
that Lonesome Valley."

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.410
You've got to walk it all alone.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.280
I could just see Mama, dressed
in white, walking down a long,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.490
lonesome road all by herself.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:58.000
At the end, Papa asked them

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.890
to sing her favorite
hymn, Precious Memories.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.000
I almost smothered when
they set down that coffin.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.180
I could see Mama through a
little window in the lid.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.390
It looked like she
was just asleep.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.730
They commend to shove
them in the dirt.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.910
I ran down the hill and
waited with Burton Dock.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.880
Everybody left the graveyard
and we all walked home.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.640
The house seemed
so empty and quiet,

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.190
the old clock ticking
on the mantle.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.030
I missed Mama.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.850
She was always busy
around the house,

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.600
and the kitchen smelled good

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.700
from things she'd have
cooking on the stove.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.060
She'd call me to go carry a
bucket of water from the well

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.270
or go hunt the guinea's nest.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.890
But she was gone now.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:48.200
It seems like it took me a
long time to get supper ready.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.940
Cornmeal mash had lumps in it
and it tasted kind of scorched.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.110
But Papa said it was real
good and he was proud of me.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.580
When bedtime came, little
Joey hollered for Mama.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.910
He was terribly fussy
because he hadn't had his nap

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.730
on account of the burying.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.360
I could hardly get him
into his trundle bed.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.940
Didn't have no trouble
with Mandy though.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.080
She sleeps with me.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.290
Then Papa blew out
the lamp and climbed

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.240
into the big four-poster
bed in the corner, alone.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.920
A huge moon came up behind
the barn, making dark shadows.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.290
Chickens that perched in the
butternut tree were already

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.470
on their roosting limb.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.950
Papa's gun was on its
rack over the door, ready,

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:33.920
in case anything
bad should happen.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.220
I couldn't get to sleep.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.270
I kept thinking about Mama
up there in that graveyard

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.710
with all those dead people.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.000
Little Carter boy who jived
the thrash was near her.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.010
Grass hadn't grown back
over his grave yet.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.450
Over by the stone wall
was old Miss Crower.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.610
She got so heavy, she
couldn't get out of her chair.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.110
She died of heart dropsy.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.170
Outside, the crickets
were chirping.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.780
I wondered if they were chirping
up at the graveyard too.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.040
Old Yellow Throat gave a few
clucks and chats from over

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.590
in the blackberry briars.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.730
Sometimes he sings at night,

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.870
especially if there's
a big moon shining.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:16.900
I felt all shivery.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.330
Then I heard something else.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.340
Slow footsteps came dragging
across the front porch.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.830
There was a knock
at the front door.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.860
Papa's bed creaked as he sat
up and reached for his clothes.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.970
"Who's there?"

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.120
"Open the door, Clint.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.560
It's me, Alphea,"
Mama's voice answered.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.710
It sounded weak and far away.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.420
"I've come home from the grave."

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.850
"No, no, go away,"
Papa almost shouted.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.020
"You're a ghost that's
come to trouble me.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.030
Oh, I'm wretched enough, Alphea.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.690
My heart is wrung with sorrow."

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.050
"Open the door, Clint.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:00.780
Let me in."

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.080
"No, Alphea.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.380
It's the moon that's
got you awake.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.710
The moon's so big
and strange tonight

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.620
and the shadows are so dark.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.330
Go back to your grave
and sleep in peace.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:16.380
No." "Let me in."

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.830
"No, Alphea, it's the moonlight
that's made you restless.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:26.730
Last night it shone through
the window on your pale face,

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.330
and you a corpse
awaiting for the burying.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.260
They say if it shines on
your face when you're asleep,

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.420
it will drive you mad.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.300
Maybe even the dead."

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.630
"Oh, but I wasn't dead Clint.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.440
I must have been in
a deep, dark sleep.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.170
Believe me, truly I'm alive.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:52.910
Oh, let me in before
it's too late."

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.000
The voice drifted away.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.720
The little ones were so scared,
they hid under the covers.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.080
I was scared too.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.310
Papa turned to us and
he said, "Children,

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.670
if our two horses
have their heads

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.120
out of the stall windows
a-looking the way they do

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.020
when someone comes, I'll know
for sure it's your Mama."

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.380
He went over and he
drew up the shades.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.680
"They're there.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.630
Burt and Doc have
their heads out.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.120
Did you hear Doc knicker?"

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.180
Papa hastened to the door
and he threw it open.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.750
He caught Mama's arms just
as she was about to fall.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.620
He carried her over the
bed and laid her across it.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.150
"Jenny, run and make
Mama some hot comfy tea.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.310
She's so cold.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:39.870
Alphea, I saw Nales Woodsby
nail down that coffin lid

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.640
and dirt shuffled in on it.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.110
How'd you escape?"

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.680
Mama took a deep breath.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:55.400
"Well, a grave robber dug up my
coffin and pried off the lid.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.110
He stole grandmother's broach,

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.560
but he couldn't get
my rings off.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.680
He was trying to cut
away my fingers."

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.980
"What do you mean, Mama?

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.690
Then what?"

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.330
Well, the pain got me awake.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:13.040
When I sat up and screamed,
that old man hollered too."

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.070
[ Laughter ]

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.320
"He dropped his knife
and went hopping away

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.840
across those graves.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.780
It was that strange Ralph Sinion
who lives back in the swamps."

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.230
I tugged at Mama's sleeve.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.290
"Mama, how'd you get
all the way home?"

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.240
She stroked my hair.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.910
"Well, I pulled myself up out
of that coffin and walked home.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.000
The moon was so bright
it lit up the fields.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.920
I came by the crossroads,
took the old mill road

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.100
to the foot of our lane.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.740
Oh, it was so far, so far."

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.780
"That dirty runion
stealing from the dead.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.850
I'll stomp him!"

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:58.160
"Why, Clint, if it hadn't been
for that old scow, I'd still be

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.250
in my coffin, buried alive."

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:07.530
The next day, Papa took
a wide board and he sawed

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.610
out two horses' heads.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.200
He painted them white like
Bert and Doc and he nailed them

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.560
to the side of the stall window

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.120
so we'd never forget
how it was those horses

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.840
that knew it was mama that
night in the moonlight

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.140
when she knocked at our door.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:29.440
And that's a true story that
happened in Irwin, Tennessee.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.510
Thank you.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.090

[ Applause ]

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.400
It still is one of my favorites.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.230
And the woman that wrote the
words down to that story,

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:54.140
Eliza Sieman, I met her
when she was in her 70s.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.440
God, I'm in my 70s.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.740
Oh, my gracious.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:02.500
I met her a long
time ago in 1974.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:09.610
And she lived on this side of
Coffee Ridge and Tumbling Creek,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.840
a tiny little community
outside of Irwin,

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.700
Tennessee, east Tennessee.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.930
And she lived -- I went up
there and visited many times.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.910
She lived at the end of
the dirt road and the end

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.800
of the gravel road, at
the end of the road.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.040
And back during World
War II, she used to go

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.660
across the mountains,
Coffee Ridge,

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.430
and sit with a woman
named Becky Farner.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:34.250
And this had happened to
someone in Becky's family.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.600
And Eliza then wrote
the words down

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.570
and gifted me with the story.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:39.870
And I told that story

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.640
at the second National
Storytelling Festival

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.140
when I was featured.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.690
And now that was 44 years ago.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.490
So that was the first
time that I told it.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.880
I'm going to end, and I
will say that you know,

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.040
people used to really be
afraid of being buried alive.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.250
And my dad was raised in
New Orleans, born in 1911.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.540
And he said when anyone died,

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.190
that there was always this hope
they could somehow come back,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.190
and also a fear that they might.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:18.830
And people used to be buried
with a bell in their coffin.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.420
I mean, actually the
string was in the coffin

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.910
and the string then was attached

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.400
to a bell outside
in the grave yard.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.930
And it was so they
could pull that bell

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.200
if they had been buried alive.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.680
And that's where we get the
phrase, saved by the bell.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.420
So I'm going to end this
on one short little story,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.740
and then Barbara's
going to come up

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.040
and then we'll move right along
for the rest of the evening.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.800
This is one -- I
like to think of it

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.550
as bringing my Mama on stage.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.440
I just told you about my daddy,

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.920
but Mary Agnes Freeman is
the one that told me this.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:58.390
The telephone rang, and a voice
said, "Is your mama home?"

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:02.180
A little boy answered it, "No."

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.940
"Hmm. Is your daddy there?"

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.430
"No, he's busy."

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.900
"Oh. Is anybody else there?"

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.920
"Just the policeman."

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.730
"Oh, the policeman, may
I speak to him pleas?"

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.640
"He's busy."

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.730
"Well, what in the world
are they all doing?"

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:27.350
"They are all looking for me."

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.990
A story for you to
take away and tell.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.940
Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, come on up
and I will come down.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.450
They're going to
turn me off here.

more muscles

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.280
than me bring a chair up here?

don't have my chainsaw.

Let me see where I'm
going to put that puppy.

I just love that
Two White Horses.

That was just so special.

By the way, in relationship to
the bell above the graveyard,

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.470
most of those people
are Avon representatives

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.010
to this very day.

[ Laughter ]

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.510
Does the name Quasi
Modo ring a bell?

Bell ringing of Notre Dame.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.830
I'm sorry.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:42.700
Well, once but not
so very long ago,

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.290
there lived an old
man named Joseph.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.010
Everybody called him Old Joe.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.490
He was quite a character.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:54.550
He had a great sense of
humor, and he loved rhymes

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.660
and riddles and songs and jokes.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.180
He had a good life.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.130
He was a farmer,
and he raised cows

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:05.050
and chickens and such as that.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:08.090
And his garden was
the most beautiful

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:12.170
in the entire community,
because between the rows

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.220
of vegetables he had
beautiful flowers growing.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:21.030
Even the cornstalk as it made
its way up to the sunshine,

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.960
he had planted a little
sunflower seed right next

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:29.050
to each one of them so his
whole garden was just full

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.960
of sunshine.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.660
And he had something that
he was very grateful for,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:42.500
a very best friend that
just lived a farm away.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.420
Yes, sir, you could
go down Old Joe's hill

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.360
and his neighbor would
come down his hill.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.350
There was a little
dip in the land

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:54.250
and these two friends
would meet there every day.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:57.420
And you know, these
two elderly gentlemen,

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.670
they had a lot in common.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:04.010
They were both widowers, so they
had that grief and that sorrow

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.750
to share about their
beloved wives.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.040
But they also had all
that joy to talk about.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.610
The potluck suppers, the church
picnics, the country dances

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.710
and just all four of
them getting together.

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.800
And Old Joe and his best friend,
when they met at that little dip

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.170
of the land each morning,
they would talk about religion

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:33.170
and politics and the
events of the day,

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:37.340
and their dreams
and their hopes.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.460
And if one of them got
sick, the other was sure

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.980
to bring them a little something
to eat and maybe a funny story

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.000
to lift up their spirits.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.190
Well, one day Joe
got powerful sick.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.990
And he didn't show
up, and the neighbor,

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.550
he looked down his hillside
and up the other and he saw

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:03.510
that Joe's house was all shut
up tight, shutters and all.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.580
And it looked really dreary.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.020
And he saw that the horse and
the buggy were still there.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.070
He knew something was wrong,
so he went into his kitchen way

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.670
and he made him some chicken
soup and he brought it

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:20.680
down the hill and up the other
side and knocked on the door.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:27.280
And there was a very weak
voice said, "Come in."

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.210
And when the neighbor
opened the door

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.590
and he saw Old Joe
lying there like that,

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.540
he knew he was powerful sick.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.420
So he tried to make a little
funny and he said, "Well, Joe,

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:43.710
you look like death eating a
cracker without the cracker."

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:47.900
And Joe said, "You know,
I've got the chills

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:53.900
and then I've got the fever, and
my bones ache all over my body.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.890
I've never felt this bad before,

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.320
and I see you brought
me some food.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.030
I appreciate you.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.330
But just put it over there.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.130
I don't think I can
eat anything."

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.460
And his neighbor just pulled
up a chair and he said, "Well,

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.010
you know, Joe, I'm going
to tell you something.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.440
I really missed you down in our
little meeting place because I'm

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.240
out this morning early
milking my favorite cow early

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.120
and had my hand son
the udders there.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.920
Putting that milk
right into the bucket,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.810
and all of the sudden [buzzing]
there come this little old fly

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:31.290
and he was flying so funny-like.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:36.090
He was doing spirals and dips
and dives and I noticed why.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:41.290
One little wing was kind of torn
and tattered just a little bit.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.010
And he [buzzing] went
right up to Earline's ear

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.740
and she was flicking that
ear and just moving around

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.040
and flashing her tail.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.340
And I thought, "I'm going to end

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.770
up with churned butter
here if I'm not careful."

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.860
It really agitated my cow.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.220
And all of the sudden, he
flew out and she settled down

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.720
and I kept on a-milking.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.240
And then [buzzing]
went right into her ear

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.810
and I had to finish up.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.900
I never did see the little thing
leave, but I finished my milking

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:15.150
and I'm heading back tom y house
and I'm thinking, you know,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:19.570
I'm going to make --
are you feeling okay

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:21.970
for this, little buddy?

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:24.020
Okay, I'll go on then.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.470
So I'm walking back to the house
and I'm thinking, you know,

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:31.330
I'm going to have the best cup
of coffee known to mankind.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:35.420
I'm going to skim off
some of that cream

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.840
and -- yeah, I can't wait.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.650
And I look down into the bucket

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:47.700
and there I saw doing
the backstroke on top

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.480
of that cream was that same
little fly what had been

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.780
in Earline's ear.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.620
And I knew it was the same one
because its little wing was torn

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.480
and tattered a little bit.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.090
And when I saw that, it
made me think of my mama.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.290
She'd take that arthritic
finger and she'd say,

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:06.650
"You're not listening to me."

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:10.700
And then she'd say
something else."

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.970
And Joe said, "Well, you
know, I'm always able

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:17.150
to finish your stories
and riddles and such,

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.790
but with the fever, I
can't come up with it.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.090
I just can't do it.

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.410
My brain is -- I can't do it.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.400
It's too hot."

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.170
"Well, Joe, I'm going to
tell you the first line

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:33.060
of what my mama said and I know
you'll be able to finish it off.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:37.640
When I saw that fly in that
milk, I said, "In one ear --

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.510
"" And Joe said,
"And out the udder."

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.040
[ Laughter ]

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.140
And you know, just that
little bit of a smile,

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.580
Joe found himself just
sitting up in the bed

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.310
and he said, "Hand me that soup.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.830
I'm going to take it out."

00:54:54.830 --> 00:55:04.170
And this is the way it always
was with these two best friends.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:08.780
But one day something
happened to change all that.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.440
They were down in that
little dip of the land

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.450
and they got into an argument.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:20.500
And their voices
had some hate in it,

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.540
and their hearts were
filled with bitterness.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.160
And they were shouting
at each other.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.050
You see, a cow had given
birth to a little calf

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:34.050
and both neighbors were
claiming it as their own.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.270
"Well, it's got the
markings of my favorite cow.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.020
It doesn't take any more
than an idiot to see that."

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.960
"Well, your favorite cow
looks like all my cows,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.510
and who's land do you think
it was born on anyway?"

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:48.500
And that's the way it went until
these two turned their backs,

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.490
one to the other, and they went

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.860
up their hillsides
without looking back.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:00.450
And turned into their homes,
shut themselves inside,

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:03.830
warning never to speak again.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:12.110
Well, the weeks went by and
Joe, he was feeling alone

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:16.500
and wanting company, but he
wasn't about to make amends.

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.870
And apparently neither
was his neighbor.

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:24.790
Now one day, there come a
knock at the door, and Joe went

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.900
to the door and he cracked
it open a little bit.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:32.810
And he saw a young man standing
there and he had a toolbox full

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:37.590
of tools on his shoulder and Joe
said, "What be your business?"

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:42.740
And the young man said,
"Sir, I need a job of work.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:46.950
I was wondering sir if you have
any projects I could help you

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.740
with around the farm.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.310
Oh, mister, I really
need the work."

00:56:53.310 --> 00:57:00.320
Well, Joe in his way said,
"Well, I may look old,

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.890
but let me tell you
something, young fella.

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.480
If something's broke around my
farm and needs fixing, I just --

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.510
" and all of the sudden he felt
in his heart, filled up with

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:16.110
that hunger, a hunger he had
for company and conversation,

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.070
just to talk to somebody.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:21.540
And so he cut himself
short and he said, "Well,

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.570
I'll tell you what, young fella.

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:27.080
I don't reckon I have any
projects as you say to do,

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.120
but I tell you what I do have.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.480
I've got me some
coffee to perking.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.870
I've got some homemade
bread, fresh-churned butter.

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.460
Why don't you just come
in here and sit a spell

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.390
and we can have a
little chat or so.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:45.230
And then you can be about
looking for your job of work."

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:48.510
And the young man
said he'd like that.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.250
So he came in and they
sat down at the table.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.700
And Joe, he started
telling him all kinds

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.830
of jokes and funny stories.

00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:58.090
And the young man
was smiling real big

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.220
and Joe was just laughing
outright, and then all

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:07.300
of the sudden Joe glanced out
the window down his hillside

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:13.150
and his heart was
filled with resentment.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:18.280
And he turned to the young
man and said, "You know,

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.530
I think I've got
a project for you.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:28.210
Now look out that window way
there and you see out there

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:33.360
down at the bottom of my
hill we got a little ditch

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.690
that is supposed to be
now I guess called a creek

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:37.990
or something.

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:41.130
You see my neighbor
wants to divide us,

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:44.580
so he had a spring
pond up there.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.910
And he takes his tractor
and he turned it out

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:51.690
and flooded this little
old dip in the land there,

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:55.330
and now we got ourselves a
bubbling brook, a little creek,

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:56.630
whatever you want to call it.

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.430
Now I'd like to do
him one better.

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:01.970
I would like for you to go

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:09.710
down by the water
and build me a fence.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:14.130
And I mean a real tall fence
so I don't ever have to see him

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:18.890
or his cows or his
creek ever again.

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:21.350
Do you think you could do that?"

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:27.690
And the young man said,
"Joe, I've got the tools.

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.340
And if you've got the lumber,

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.970
I think I can do a job
you'll be well pleased with."

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:37.050
So Joe took him to the barn
and there was stacks and stacks

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:42.360
of wood and panels, lumber and
plenty enough to do the job.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.620
And then Joe told him and
said, "I can't grow everything

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.510
and I need to go into town
and lay in some supplies.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.860
But I'm telling you
what, young fella,

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:57.270
I'll be back before sunset,

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:02.190
because I want to
see that fence.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:05.710
And make it mighty
tall, mighty tall."

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:07.700
And Joe, he got the
horse and the buggy

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.450
and he started on
off down the road.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.330
Down that dusty road
toward town.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:18.800
And that young man, he took
all those lumber planks

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.450
down creekside and his
work, it went really well.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.550
He hammered, sawed and
fashioned with nails.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:29.140
And he worked the whole day.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.370
And just before sunset, Joe
pulled in and he got right

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.530
out of his buggy and he
just came around to the back

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:41.680
of his cabin so he
could see that fence.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.610
But there was no fence at all.

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:48.310
But rather that young
man, he had built a bridge

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:52.360
and that bridge was going from
Joe's land across that creek

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.980
over to his neighbors.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:58.410
And down the hillside was
coming Joe's neighbor.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.900
And Joe headed down
his hillside.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.360
And the neighbor was the
first to step onto the bridge

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.050
and he extended his hand.

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.120
"Oh, Joe, you're quite a man.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.670
I'd have never thought of this.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:13.210
I just want to be
your friend again."

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:18.830
"Yeah, I've missed you and
can I just say that all

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.850
that bitterness and those words
we had, we can just let them go

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.680
in one ear-- " And the neighbor
said, "And out the udder."

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.650
And then they were
walking across the bridge

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:33.270
and Joe told him, "We all
know the calf was yours.

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:37.260
But let me tell you something,
this idea about the bridge,

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.460
I wish it was mine, I really do.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.760
But it wasn't.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.060
It's this young fellow here."

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:46.420
And about that time, that young
man had taken that tool box,

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.240
put it back on his shoulders
and he was walking away.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.970
Joe hollered after
him, "Hey, young fella,

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:57.090
I do like your projects and you
can tell I've got a lot of work

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.640
to do here at the farm.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.920
I'd hire you up,
pay you a good wage.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.790
You know, I'm a pretty good cook

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:06.050
and you can stay
in the bunkhouse."

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:09.430
"Joe, I would like that.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:17.010
I would like that so very much,
but I've got to be moving on.

01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:21.500
I've got more bridges to build."

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.840
Thank you.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:35.190
[ Applause ]

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:40.750
So now I'm going to
tell you something

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:45.180
that five words are going
to help you remember.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:51.570
And the five words are
"everybody knows old Dry Fry."

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:56.130
Now you can just turn to
the person closest to you

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:57.430
and say those five words.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.150
It really helps us all
get our memory back.

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.220
That and coconut oil
will do the trick.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.070
So everybody knows old Dry Fry.

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.370
Try it out.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.680
Everybody knows old Dry Fry.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.980
Yeah, boy.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.840
Old Dry Fry was a
substitute preacher

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.620
and he loved to do that.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.310
But what he loved
more than anything

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:20.680
in all the world
was fried chicken.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.760
Now Dry Fry had a 9:00-5:00 job.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.990
He was a veterinarian.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:31.480
And right next to his little
veterinary, he had a taxidermy.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.330
Now you know if you're
out fishing

01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:35.770
and you catch a big
old huge bass,

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.590
you're not going to eat it.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:41.060
You're going to take it to
a taxidermist and get him

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.060
to gut it out and put it on
a wooden board and tack it

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.190
up over the wall and you
can say that's the one

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.170
that never got away.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:50.630
Well, Dry Fry was really known

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:53.930
for his veterinary
and his taxidermy.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:59.010
But what he was most known for
was the sign he put out front.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:03.010
It read, "Either way,
you get your dog back."

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.310
[ Laughter ]

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.800
And you know, people would
be coming down the road

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.750
or they'd be riding
in their buggies

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.080
or sweethearts would
be holding hands.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.730
And they would see that sign and
they would turn one to another

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:18.560
and say five words,
"Everybody knows old Dry Fry."

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.860
Yeah, boy.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.670
One day old Dry Fry was
at a church and picnic.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:27.060
And nobody went to the
regular pastor to say, "Pastor,

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.120
please ask the Lord
to put the blessing

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.420
on the food so we can eat."

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.880
No, they went to Preacher Fry
because they knew he talked

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.180
so rapid and so fast, by the
time he got into the blessing

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.490
and pulled out, the
food would still be hot.

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.390
So Dry Fry allowed
he'd be glad to do it.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:48.160
And he started in with the
blessing and one thing would pop

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.790
into his head and then
another and then another still,

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.810
and he'd say things
like, "Bless the farmer

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:56.000
that grew the bird we're going
to eat, bless the little seed

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.940
that went into the ground,
the little bud that came up

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.540
and the little bud that
grew into the big cornstalk.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.550
And bless -- " he
went on and on.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:08.120
And he got to talking so fast
that his false teeth got loose

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.430
and they flung out of
his mouth and dropped

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:14.320
down deep into a mudhole.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.110
And everybody wanted to help
out Preacher Fry and fish

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:23.080
out them teeth for him and
all, but nobody was willing

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.760
to put their hand down into that
mud and get worms or nothing,

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.820
or worse yet get bit
by them chompers.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:33.520
And that's when little Amandy
Durrigan, sharp as a tack,

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.070
11 years old, bright
little girl, she went right

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:41.930
over to a picnic basket, got
herself out a big old piece

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:46.620
of friend chicken, tied a string
onto it, brought that chicken

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.840
over above that mudhole
and dangled it for bait.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.540
And sure enough, them old
teeth come flying up out

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:57.290
of that mudhole, latched rung
onto that piece of chicken.

01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:01.830
It took three grown adults to
rip and tear that chicken meat

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.340
out from betweenst
them working chompers.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:08.090
And then somebody came up
with some homemade lemonade,

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:11.000
rinsed them off, mud
and worms and all

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.340
and drip-dried them
a little bit.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.690
And then there was a little boy

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:18.500
with a beautiful
little sweet heart.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:27.010
And he came up with this
half-eaten jar of peanut butter.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:33.420
And he dug in there real deep
and he put some peanut butter

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.930
up on top of them chompers
for sticking power,

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:42.870
gave those teeth back to Dry
Fry and he was as good as new.

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:47.740
But he finished the
blessing with one word.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:54.520
"Amen." And everybody turned one
to another and said five words,

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.780
"Everybody knows old Dry Fry."

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:05.380
Now I have picked a person out
of the audience to help tell

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.130
with me the last
scene of Dry Fry.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:13.510
So Tom, come on up here.

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.570
[ Applause ]

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.050
You can come up that way.

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.660
And do you have your microphone?

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.960
&gt;&gt; I do.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.260
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.700
I love to do this
when I tell Dry Fry.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.820
I always pick somebody
out of the audience.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.760
So count your blessings and
let this be one of them.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.740
What I always say to my
volunteer is I pick a volunteer

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.220
that has no sense of pride
about them whatsoever.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.810
Oh, you wore a hat.

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.450
That is so good.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.330
Okay. So to help us
get started into this,

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:54.850
I'm going to need five words.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.830
&gt;&gt; Everybody knows old Dry Fry.

01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:59.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, boy.

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:03.150
One day old Dry Fry
was at the county fair,

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.790
looking around for
his best friend.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.770
Brother Henry, give me five.

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:11.390
Brother Henry, I hear tell,
here at the fair they're willing

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:14.740
to sell some of their
prized horses.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.280
&gt;&gt; Well, let's get us a couple.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.580
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.110
Look, reach out with
your hand here.

01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:23.840
Wow. Here's two fine-looking
horses.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.640
We're going to put them
in the same pasture.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.490
Stepping back and looking
at these two fine critters,

01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:35.580
you know, I think they
look exactly alike.

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.110
I don't know how we're ever
going to tell them apart.

01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:39.980
&gt;&gt; Identical.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.390
&gt;&gt; Identical has a
whole new meaning.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.540
They're practically twins.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.630
I don't how we're
going to tell my horse

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:48.220
from -- oh, I've got it.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.080
Let's measure them.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.540
Well, I never.

01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:58.160
&gt;&gt; I never too.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.780
&gt;&gt; Let's measure
them the other way.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:05.680
Well, I never.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.880
&gt;&gt; I never too.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.670
&gt;&gt; They are exactly alike.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:13.320
I don't know how we're ever
going to tell them apart.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.620
Oh, I've got it.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.920
You stand there.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.700
I'm going to go back here
behind this horse closest

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.040
to me, Brother Henry.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.730
Raise up that tail, take off
some of them scraggly hairs

01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:28.080
and that other horse over
there with the long tail,

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.800
well that will just be yours.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.070
See you tomorrow.

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:34.710
&gt;&gt; See you tomorrow too.

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:39.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, I never.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.590
&gt;&gt; I never too.

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:48.160
They both got sawed-off tails.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.070
Must have got caught
in the brambly bushes.

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:51.370
They're the same again.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:54.530
Now I don't know how we're
going to tell them apart.

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:57.010
Oh, I've got it.

01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:59.070
Just on this horse
closest to me,

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:03.340
I'm going to take a little
clip off of this one's ear

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.140
and that other one over
there with the full ears,

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.390
well that's going to be yours.

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:09.750
See you tomorrow.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:12.450
&gt;&gt; See you tomorrow too.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.020
&gt;&gt; Well, I never.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.770
&gt;&gt; Well, I never too.

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:24.680
&gt;&gt; They both got clips
out of their ears.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.530
Must have got caught in
the barby wire fence.

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:27.830
They're the same again.

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.200
I don't know how we're ever
going to tell them apart.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.770
What are we going to do?

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.600
I'm plumb out of ideas.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.800
&gt;&gt; I got an idea.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.750
&gt;&gt; Let's have it.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:49.090
&gt;&gt; You take the black one
and I'll take the white one.

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:51.160
[ Laughter ]

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.460
&gt;&gt; There you go.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:57.080
Wahoo. I told you no pride.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.140
[ Applause ]

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.160
Oh Tom, that was so beautiful.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.510
You were so good.

for 48 years and Tom is fresh

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.020
out of the audience,
but he is fabulous.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.320
Thank you, Tom.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.620
That was so wonderful.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.900
And Tom's beautiful wife
is Janet, and Connie

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.960
and I would stay with their
family year after year

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.340
after year when we first
started traveling on the road.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.150
So it was a second home for us

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:31.380
and we were always
welcome there.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:34.510
So is that it for me?

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.090
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:40.240
Yeah, we're going to have an
interview now, and then Connie

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.950
and I will end on
another folk teller story.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:45.380
Y'all are so cool.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.510
Thank you so much.

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:50.420
[ Applause ]

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.720
Thank you, sweetie.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.020
Okay.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:02.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.710
I think you should sit on
that end, and Connie and I --

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.610
That way we don't have to
swivel our heads around.

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:13.410
All right.

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:14.710
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Y'all
doing okay?

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:17.530
So we'll just do a little
short thing here and --

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:20.130
Hey.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.430
&gt;&gt; Steve.

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:22.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Hi.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.030
&gt;&gt; Yay.

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:25.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: My
name is Steve Winnick.

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:26.630
I'm the editor in the
American Folk Life Center

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:29.470
and I'll just be doing a brief
interview here to bring out some

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.590
of the background
to the folk tellers

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:33.090
and some of these stories.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.220
And in particular,
I think one thing

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.630
that people are usually
interested in is the story

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:42.060
of how you guys got started
as professional storytellers.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.220
So you know, you were
telling me before

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.490
about how the storytelling scene
has kind of shifted from a lot

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:50.680
of traditional stories to a lot
of personal experience stories.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.830
So now I'm asking for
the tandem telling

01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.470
of your personal experience.

01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:58.490
&gt;&gt; Well, Barbara
was a children's

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:01.480
and young adult librarian
in Chattanooga.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.100
And I went to visit her
and I had just gotten back

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.950
from spending a year
hitchhiking around in Europe.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.570
And I was really hoping
to go back to Europe.

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.430
But I went to visit Barbara,
my dear first cousin.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:16.420
And she told me about this job.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:21.130
&gt;&gt; The librarian here has
written a big, wonderful grant

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:25.140
for disadvantaged children,
economically poor kids

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.200
and we need a storyteller to be

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.590
in a cute little van all
covered with daisies.

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:34.080
And you get to give
out books to children.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.700
And even if they're in bed with
five other kids at their house

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.350
and something happens bad to
the book, you know, we want them

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:47.620
to know that honey,
you get another book.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.190
This time put it on top
of your refrigerator.

01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:53.890
And we just want them to have
a complete love of books.

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.730
And Connie was Miss
Daisy in the blue dress

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.030
with daisies all over it.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.330
She matched the van.

01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:01.210
And she was fantastic.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:05.300
&gt;&gt; And that was really the best
of children's literature too.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.610
It wasn't just you know,

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:09.960
the inexpensive books
on the corner shelf.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.910
It was really the award-winners,
Caldecott Award and all that.

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:16.500
The program is actually
still going on.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.800
&gt;&gt; It is.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.100
&gt;&gt; It started in 1971.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.440
That's when I started
as a storyteller,

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.840
and it's still going on.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.930
And then Barbara and I
quit those library jobs.

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:28.720
We really loved them, but
we had started doing --

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well,

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.480
we appreciate libraries
and library jobs.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.080
&gt;&gt; We do.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: How to
parlay your library job

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.680
into a glamorous
life of storytelling.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.980
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.220
And during that time I had heard

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.980
about the first National
Storytelling Festival.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.840
And I wrote Jimmy Neil Smith
who was putting it on and said,

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.910
"I'm a storyteller
in Chattanooga.

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:52.310
My cousin and I both tell."

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:53.690
And he said, "Come on up."

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:57.190
And we ended up telling
at that very first one.

01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:59.340
And within a couple
of years after that,

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.650
we decided to quit
those jobs we loved

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:06.730
and got a little pickup truck
with a topper on it and put all

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:09.220
of our belongings and lived
and traveled out of that.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.170
&gt;&gt; It was a Dotson pickup truck.

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.620
And when I bought it, it was red

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.470
and I thought it
was a fire engine.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.010
So I had the first yellow
Dotson pickup truck,

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:21.730
the really small kind.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:27.420
And so we named it DPUT,
Dotson Pickup Truck.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.970
200,000 miles on that old puppy
and it was really wonderful.

01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:34.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so then we
started traveling and lots

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:36.490
of people invited
us onto the stages

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.980
of the Folk Music
Festivals back in those days

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.410
and things just kept unfolding.

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:42.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:44.900
So that's a great
way to get started.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.400
And there's a person or a family
that was particularly important

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.790
in getting you inspired and
started, and there's pictures

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:54.650
of them outside on
the table out there.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.020
We're talking about
the Hicks family,

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.030
particularly Ray and Rosa Hicks.

01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:59.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:00.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So tell us
about how you came together

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:03.290
with them and how
they inspired you.

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:06.990
&gt;&gt; We met them at the very first
national storytelling festival,

01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:10.280
1973 there in Jonesborough,
Tennessee.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.280
They'd come down out of the
mountains, this giant of a man,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.010
really a giant in so many ways.

01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:19.130
But literally 6-feet-7-inches
tall.

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.520
They invited him
up onto this stage.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.870
There was actually a recording
of this that I still have.

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:30.370
And he told one of
the Jack tales.

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.570
And afterwards, Barbara
and I both went up to him

01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:36.690
and met his wife Rosa who
stood just barely five feet --

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:40.330
there's a picture of her out
there on the table as well.

01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:45.140
And we walked all around
town that day and we all fell

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.440
in love with each other.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:52.020
And then that began this dear
friendship that lasted for me

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:57.690
with them until Ray passed
away on April 21st in 2003.

01:16:57.690 --> 01:17:00.900
And Rosa passed away
in 2012 I think it was.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.890
&gt;&gt; I'd like to say
something here too.

01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:07.240
Because I just admire
Connie so much.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.800
And the Hicks family
still had the outhouse.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.060
They still had to go out to the
spring to get all their water

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:18.070
to wash their dishes and to
boil their food and whatever.

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:22.240
And Connie was very instrumental
in taking carpenters

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.570
and raising money,
fundraising and stuff like that,

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:30.830
f-u-n and f-u-n-d raising
for Ray Hicks and Rosa.

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:34.140
Got them in an addition
built onto their house.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.210
And the other part sometimes
was filled with snakes

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:40.980
that would come up through the
cracks and the wood was so --

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:46.020
anyway, renovated but still
looked like the old home place.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.640
And gave them flush
toilets and water pipelined

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.410
in so they could still go to
the outhouse if they wanted

01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:57.180
to for nostalgic reasons.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.890
But they didn't have to in
the cold, bitter winter.

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:06.710
And so I just think that --
Connie has even gone to Africa

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.900
and me women that
are so impoverished,

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:17.370
but they did have a means of
taking magazines from America,

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:21.810
you know, and tearing the
pages and putting a little bit

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:24.750
of glue-type on it to where
it looked like a real jewel.

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.820
Do you have on one right now?

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.800
See how real that looks?

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.040
It's paper magazines.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.600
And so Bead For Life, Connie was
very instrumental in coming back

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.600
to America and telling
the story of these women

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.650
and selling their stuff for them

01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:45.370
and sending the money
back to them.

01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:47.910
So I just admire you
to pieces for that.

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.210
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.510
That's very dear to my heart.

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:51.850
&gt;&gt; And you probably didn't tell
them that in the interview.

01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.150
&gt;&gt; I didn't.

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.450
Yeah.

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:55.750
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.870
Well, another thing
that did come

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.340
up in the interview
was a particular story

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.250
that Connie, you had about Ray.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.620
And it involves your
license plate.

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.920
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's cute.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:12.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I was asked by the
Candinsky trio, a piano trio,

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:18.670
cello, violin and piano, to
do storytelling with them.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:23.480
And we created based
on Ray Hicks' version

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.110
of Wicked John the Devil,

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:28.000
and also Barbara Freeman's
version of that story.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.920
We created a story called
the Cantankerous Blacksmith.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.480
And our intention was all
four of us were telling it

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.720
on stage as a quartet.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.590
Sometimes only the
violin, sometimes only me,

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:42.890
sometimes all four of us.

01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:45.220
And we toured this all over.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:51.340
And there were nine presenting
universities that said, "Yes,

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.360
we will do this new work,"
which is quite a challenge

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.550
for chamber music often.

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:58.330
And they were up and
down the Appalachians.

01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:02.480
One of those was at
Boone at the University,

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.780
Appalachian State, yeah.

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.390
Appalachian State.

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:10.170
And this was before Ray
and Rosa had a telephone

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.040
or that indoor plumbing.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.730
And so I had written them
and told them about this

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:17.050
that was going to happen.

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:18.840
And I had no idea if they
were going to be able to come.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.060
I had arranged several people
that could maybe pick them up,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.740
but they'd have to write
them or just go and see

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.810
if they wanted to come.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:30.780
And it was a highlight of my
life walking out on stage,

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:36.490
the trio and I in tuxes -- I had
a glittery, slivery white outfit

01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:40.160
with black tux -- and
seeing Ray and some

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.130
of his family sitting
in the second row.

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:44.670
And Ray listened to
that storytelling.

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:48.060
Such an odd way probably
to his ear,

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.510
but laughing and
slapping his leg.

01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:54.560
And afterwards we walked outside
and we were saying our goodbyes.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.800
And Ray said for me, he asked me

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.140
to not let anyone
ever forget him.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.800
So I tell a lot of the stories,

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.850
I carry his pictures
wherever I go.

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:13.000
And he turned to me and he said,
"Connie, tell on, tell on."

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.030
And that's now my license tag.

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:19.040
[ Laughter ]

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.340
Thanks for asking.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So
I wanted to make sure

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.040
that we didn't forget Ray
as well, bringing that up.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
Another story that came

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.000
up in our interview
earlier today was one

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.740
of Barbara's stories about
telling a particular story

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.130
in a particular place and
the importance of that.

01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.220
Could you tell the audience
a little about that?

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.370
&gt;&gt; Do you want me to
actually do a couple

01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:42.480
of scenes but Cliffnote it?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah,
that would be great.

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:48.730
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I was asked
where was my favorite place

01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:51.460
to tell a favorite story.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:57.490
And I actually went
to Jerusalem.

01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:00.620
I had to sell all of my
Limber Jacks, you know,

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:03.120
those little dancing dolls
that you see on a paddle

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.470
and you hit the paddle and you
lower the doll and the dance?

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.380
I had 82 of them but
I was keeping two

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:14.530
and I called Gale Haley,
a famous illustrator too.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.540
She won the Caldecott medal.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.640
And I said, "Gale,
you've seen me

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.790
at book conferences and stuff.

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.340
I want to go to Jerusalem
and Bethlehem

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.620
and Nazareth, the holy land.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.750
It's $999."

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:33.880
And she said, "Well," --
she said, "I will come there

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.460
because I really like those.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.460
They look like real people."

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.370
Like you have one
that's Mini Pearl

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:42.950
with the little tag on her hat.

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:46.840
And I had roosters and
frogs and just everything.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.110
So she came and she said,
"Barbara, I'll give you $1,000."

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:51.530
And I said, "That is terrific.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:53.160
Isn't that just like the Lord

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.460
to give you one lousy buck once
you've got there, you know?"

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.790
I was very blessed to go.

01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:00.620
I really enjoyed it.

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.510
But when I was there --

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.070
[ Laughter ]

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:09.070
When I was there, I
thought here I am you know,

01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:13.250
walking the Villa de la Rosa
for the crucifixion of Jesus,

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:17.540
and here I am on
Bethlehem on my birthday.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:23.510
And so when it came time for
me to tell a story there,

01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:27.740
I thought about telling
my favorite story

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.170
which is the Tale
of Three Trees.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:33.680
And three trees are
dreaming about what they want

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.980
to be when they grow up.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.150
And one wants to -- he sees
the stars in the heavens

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:40.990
and he wants to hold
magnificent diamonds

01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:42.590
like the stars and jewels.

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:46.080
And he wants to be made into
a beautiful treasure chest.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.490
Another tree sees the creek
going by, making its way

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.160
to the mighty waters
of the ocean.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.440
And he wants to be
a sailing ship,

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.360
a wooden sailing ship that's
so powerful and so strong

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.490
that he would be the one
to carry kings to and fro.

01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:07.790
And the third tree just wanted
to stay on the mountaintop

01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:12.850
and grow so tall and taller
still that when people wanted

01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:16.660
to look at me, they'd
have to raise their eyes.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:20.430
And when they did, I
would point to heaven

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:23.930
and perhaps they
would think of God.

01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:27.880
I will be the tallest
tree in the world.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.660
Well the years go by and the
rain came down, and the sun,

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:34.140
and they grew tall
and taller still.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:42.150
And one day, three woodcutters
came to the top of the mountain

01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:44.430
and the first one went over
to the first tree and said,

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:47.290
it's perfect for
what my needs are.

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:52.600
And with the last swoop of his
ax, the tree fell, thinking,

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.490
"I will be inlaid with gold
and silver and hold treasure."

01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:01.650
The second woodcutter
went to the second tree

01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:05.260
and said, "Looks strong.

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.580
I'll take it."

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:10.820
With the last two swoop-swoop of
his ax, the tree fell thinking,

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:17.910
"I will sail the mighty waters
of the ocean, a sailing ship."

01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:22.060
The third tree, she stood so
tall and straight and still

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:25.180
and she pointed to heaven.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.580
But that woodcutter, he did
not even look up at her.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.340
"Any old tree will
do for me," he said.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:37.000
He came over and with his
ax, the third blow took

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.230
down the third three,
swoop, swoop, swoop.

01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:43.300
And she fell.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.370
The years went by.

01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:51.120
The three trees had almost
forgotten their dreams.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.630
Because the first tree, when
it was cut, it was taken

01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:57.980
to a carpenter's shop.

01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:59.520
"I will be inlaid with gold."

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.270
But that carpenter, he was not
thinking of treasure chests.

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:05.110
He needed something
more practical.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:09.560
So with his work-worn hands,
he built a simple feed box

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.160
and it was inlaid with
something, if you will, sawdust.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.120
And it was taken to a farm and
placed there so that hay was put

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.940
into it and animals could
come up and eat out of it.

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.460
The second tree was
taken to the shipyards,

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:31.480
but they were not building
the strong vessels.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.160
So the second tree was made
into a small fishing boat,

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.770
too small to sail a river,

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:39.310
much less the mighty
waters of the ocean.

01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:44.950
So he sailed to and fro,

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:51.720
to and fro with a cargo
of dead, smelly fish.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.860
And the third tree was just
taken to a lumber yard,

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.830
made into some beams
and left there.

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:05.520
So they had almost forgotten
their dreams, but one cold,

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.870
bitter winter night,
golden starlight shone

01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:10.950
down on the first tree

01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:15.710
as a young mother placed her
newborn babe onto the hay.

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:19.860
Her husband said, "I wish
I could have made a cradle

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.600
for him."

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.690
But that mother when she
saw that smooth, sturdy wood

01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:27.610
and that golden starlight
on her baby,

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:30.920
she touched her husband's
arm and she said,

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.780
"This manger is beautiful."

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:40.040
And suddenly the first tree
knew he was holding the greatest

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.820
treasure on earth.

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:46.610
And the second tree is
sailing in the quiet lake

01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:51.610
when a traveling man and his
companions come and one by one

01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:55.630
by one, they get onto the small
fishing boat and it starts

01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:56.930
out on the quiet lake.

01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:59.820
And then something happened.

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:02.270
There was a terrible storm.

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:05.780
The thunder, the
lightning, the hurling wind.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.610
And the waters of
the quiet lake became

01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:11.350
like the angry waves
of the ocean.

01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:14.440
And the passengers
were so frightened

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.220
and the second tree
said, "I'm too small,

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.870
to weak to carry these
passengers safely to shore.

01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.000
They will all perish."

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.270
And just then that traveling man
who was so tired and had gone

01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:30.730
to sleep, he woke up and
he stretched out his hand

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:34.500
and he said, "Peace, be still."

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.400
And as soon as he spoke,
there was no more storm,

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.980
and the waters were quiet again.

01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:50.030
And the second tree knew
that he was carrying the king

01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:53.720
of heaven and earth.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.460
Do you want me to tell
about the third tree?

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
You might as well.

01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:59.120
[ Laughter ]

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.410
&gt;&gt; That's the cliffhanger.

01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:05.010
Well, the third tree
was so confused.

01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:06.580
"What has happened?

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.960
All I ever wanted
to do was to stay

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.970
on the mountaintop
and point to God.

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.790
What's happened?"

01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:17.260
It was on a Friday.

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:21.880
She was roughly shaken
and removed

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.180
from the forgotten woodpile.

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:30.400
She was carried through a
mob of angry, jeering people

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.000
and they were picking up
the waste from the streets

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.300
and hurling it at her.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:38.230
And then she shuddered
in her heart

01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:42.480
when a soldier nailed a
man's hands and feet to her.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.280
And she felt cruel
and ugly and harsh.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:54.740
And then she heard the man
say, "Father, forgive them,

01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:57.580
for they know not what they do."

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:03.140
And the third tree felt sorrow.

01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:08.930
But on Sunday morning, when
the sun rose in the heavens

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:13.180
and the earth trembled with
joy beneath the third tree,

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:19.450
suddenly she realized God's
love had changed everything.

01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:23.830
It had made the first
tree beautiful.

01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:27.620
It had made the second
tree strong.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:34.000
And whenever anyone thought on
the third tree, they would think

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.460
of God, and that was better

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.050
than being the tallest
tree in the world.

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:46.510
So that's what I
told in Jerusalem.

01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:50.070
[ Applause ]

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:51.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So it looks

01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:52.670
like I turned the
interview into another story.

01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:53.970
[Laughs]

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:55.270
&gt;&gt; Sorry about that.

01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:56.570
&gt;&gt; That happens as storytellers.

01:30:56.570 --> 01:31:00.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: I think I had
better let you tell your tandem

01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:01.790
story, your last tandem story.

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:03.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, that sounds good.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.400
&gt;&gt; I've been waiting
for that story

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.700
like Old Joe and the Carpenter.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:10.510
It was anonymous, and both of
them are over 100 years old.

01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:14.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Steve.

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.310
[ Applause ]

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.810
As we are closing
for this evening,

01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.950
we also want to thank
Todd Harvey.

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:25.030
He and Valda have been
my main contacts here

01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:27.490
for getting my collection going.

01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:30.010
It's now up online which
I'm thrilled about.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:33.210
And Todd was called out of
town on a family emergency,

01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.240
so he wasn't able
to be here tonight,

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.900
but we are thinking about him.

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:40.020
And we'll dedicate
this last story to him.

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.420
And we mentioned about us
being first cousins and such.

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:48.470
And we used to always gather
down in Polatka, Florida.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:52.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are two of 13
cousins and we would get

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.460
on a train or we would drive
up with our families in cars

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.740
from Birmingham and Nashville,
Tennessee and all over.

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:05.810
And we'd all gather at my cousin
Cindy's place and our Uncle Phil

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:09.250
in order to spend all
summer long after school

01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:13.850
with our beloved grandfather
Samuel Enos Freeman.

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:17.090
&gt;&gt; And Pop Freeman
taught us a lot,

01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:20.450
but he taught each one
of us about fishing.

01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:23.560
And we kind of each
developed our own style.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:26.900
And once I was sitting down
a long the bank of the river.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.140
Big live oaks down
there in Polatka,

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.970
Florida with heavy moss hanging.

01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:33.270
It's hidden just a little bit.

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:35.580
And I was sitting on the bank
there doing a little fishing

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:38.180
and my cousin Barbara
Ann walked up.

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.020
&gt;&gt; Hey Connie Sue
What you doing, honey?

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.780
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm fishing.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.080
&gt;&gt; Fishing?

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.640
I don't see a pole.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.300
&gt;&gt; Nope. Don't need one.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.050
&gt;&gt; I don't see a line
or a hook or anything.

01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:52.360
&gt;&gt; Nope, don't need one.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.700
&gt;&gt; You ain't got that,
how are you fishing?

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.230
&gt;&gt; I got me this here
plug of chewing tobacco.

01:32:57.230 --> 01:32:59.730
And what I do is I
just break some off

01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:02.540
and I sprinkle it
out over that water.

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.740
Those fish come right
up to the surface,

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.680
grab some of that
chewing tobacco

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.820
and dive back down
into the water.

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.590
&gt;&gt; I still don't see
how that's fishing.

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:16.820
&gt;&gt; Well, those fish, they
got to come up to spit.

01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.360
When they do, I got
me a big stick.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.660
And I just hit them
over the head.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:23.610
&gt;&gt; Have you caught
very many that way?

01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:28.420
&gt;&gt; Well, just the other day I
caught me a 10-pound minnow.

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:31.090
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, well I'll tell you

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:33.510
about my fishing
adventure then, Connie Sue.

01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:37.300
You know, I was out
in evening time,

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.060
going to be doing some
shrimping in Pop's rowboat.

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.220
And I had his lantern
there, right there.

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:47.140
And I'm out there and I took
one of those weights and put it

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.240
in my mouth to cast out the
net to catch me some shrimp.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.970
And when I did it, it knocked
Pop's lantern right off

01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:58.530
and down into that water.

01:33:58.530 --> 01:34:00.830
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I'm sure Pop wasn't
too pleased about that.

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:03.410
&gt;&gt; Not a talk, but let
me finish the story.

01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:04.770
Let me tell you what happened.

01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:08.630
I was out there just
yesterday with a pole

01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:10.780
and a line and a hook.

01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:15.420
And I hooked up that
self-same lantern.

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.370
&gt;&gt; I heard of that kind
of thing happening before

01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:19.230
with boots and all.

01:34:19.230 --> 01:34:24.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Connie Sue,
this lantern was still lit.

01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:30.150
&gt;&gt; Barbara Ann, I'll take nine
and three-quarter pounds off

01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:35.730
that minnow if you'll at
least blow out that lantern.

01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:37.030

01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:39.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:40.930
I think that's good.

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:42.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:43.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:44.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:46.130
&gt;&gt; Yay.
