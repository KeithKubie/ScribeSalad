00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.320
Guys, Welcome back! I'm Nate with The King of Random

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.720
and today we are going to try casting molten metal in clay.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.848
In the past, we have tried casting molten aluminum in a few different things

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.540
We've used muffin tins. We've used plaster, and we've tried using sand.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.500
We've had mixed results with the sand. Sometimes it would work alright and sometimes the weight

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.760
and pressure of the metal would cause the sand to break up.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.340
So we wanted to try using something a little more dense and cohesive.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.340
Clay holds itself together really well, and we wanted to try three different varieties of it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
We're going to try casting metal in wet clay, dry clay and some of the clay that we fired in a previous video.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.420
Before I start pouring molten metal into these,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.599
I'm gonna make some predictions about what I think is gonna happen

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.469
and you should write down your predictions too. Tell me in the comments. How you think this is gonna go?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
I think our fired clay has the best chance of working well.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.180
It's already been fairly heat tempered and at this point

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.760
I don't think too much is gonna happen to it if it gets exposed to hot metal.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.580
However It is by far the least convenient. If you have to fire the clay every time before you pour metal into it,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.180
that's quite a big time commitment just to cast something in aluminum.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.460
The dried clay has a decent chance of working as well

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.559
but since it hasn't been fired when the metal starts heating the clay up

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.960
there's a chance it could crack apart. The wet clay is the one I'm gonna have to be the most careful with.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.580
I think when I pour the hot metal in it's gonna start forming steam

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.260
inside the clay which could cause the molten metal to bubble or possibly even splash out

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.890
so I'm gonna have to be very careful with it.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.970
For the aluminum today. Instead of using soda cans like we have in the past,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.789
I went to the hardware store and I got some housing conduit.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.399
This is several thick strands of aluminum braided together

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.340
and once you remove the outer plastic tubes you have some fairly

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.229
high-grade aluminum that you can quickly melt down.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.870
All right, there's one big chunk of aluminum.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.859
All right, I've taking two of the aluminum cables out of their plastic tubing.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.260
I think this is going to be plenty of metal for our experiments today.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.200
At this point if you have some large shears you can cut the aluminum cable up into chunks

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.920
or you can just grab single strands and start untwisting it from the rest of the bunch.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.749
We of course have to make our pieces of aluminum small enough that they can fit into our crucible.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.780
All right, we have our aluminum, we have our three types of clay

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.560
Let's go fire up the foundry and start melting some metal.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.390
Alright, we've got our backyard foundry and our crucible for the aluminum.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.390
Let's light it up.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.819
Holy heat Batman. It's toasted my finger right through the glove.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.219
Our foundry is going in. At this point the crucible is bright orange, so let's start adding aluminum.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.649
There you go, you can see it's starting to melt already.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.549
Whoops. Lost a little bit to the outside there.

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.249
Look at that stuff. Just melts into a puddle. Looking nice and liquid.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.870
Our aluminum is nice and hot and first we're gonna try pouring it into the fired clay.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.260
I hear a lot of crackling noises going on from that clay. Now that I've poured in the aluminum.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.190
Now there were already a few little cracks in the clay. Looking at it.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.050
I think I see a few more.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.130
They may have started to expand. The heat from the metal is going to make the clay expand.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.559
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen to it as it does

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.380
There is a little bit of water gathering around the bottom

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.109
I don't know if that's water that was somehow in the fired clay

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.389
or if it's water that was in cement pad beneath it or both. That's really cool shiny look.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.760
I love the reflection of the sky and clouds in that.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.180
There are lots of tiny little points appearing on the surface of the aluminum

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.799
and they almost look like they could be bubbles rising up. I wonder if that's an effect of using the clay

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.290
or if that's just something that happens from the aluminum.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.499
You can see that the dome on top is no longer quite as smooth

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.320
and I think that's because the cooling metal is starting to contract.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.980
Oh, there we go. It still feels a little bit soft

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.220
but it is no longer liquid. You can see as I poke it,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.340
it doesn't sink in or anything like that and it's losing some of its shine as it starts to oxidize a little as well.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.880
Holy cow! It's melting so fast!

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.180
All right, second batch is done. Let's pour this into the dry clay.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
Whoa. Look at those bubbles.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.210
Holy cow, I've never seen aluminum do that. That is super weird

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.089
and I don't want to get very close to it because I'm kind of afraid it's gonna explode. Look ahead, It looks alive.

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.849
Oh man, and now it's oozing off this side

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.740
That's just poured down off of the side. I guess...

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.980
Oh it exploded!

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.220
Okay, so that was maybe a little bit too exciting after boiling for a couple seconds.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.389
In the end fired clay. The clay exploded and

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.389
kind of shot molten aluminum into the air.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.979
I had already backed off a little bit because I was afraid of that

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.119
I think Marc, our camera guy took a little bit of a the brunt of it

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.160
He got a tiny bit of it on his glasses even so.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.960
We're definitely gonna figure out what we can do to improve the safety of this before

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.300
we try pouring it into the wet clay which I'm pretty apprehensive about.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.660
I'm pretty much positive it's gonna explode.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.660
So, we're gonna take some safety precautions on that one. That looked really cool though.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.009
All right, our final batch is ready to go and this one's gonna be poured into the wet clay.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.329
But because I'm pretty much positive it's going to explode. I've taken a couple extra safety measures

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.560
Not only do I have the gloves but about its sleeves, a hood and I'm gonna be putting the welding mask down

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.740
I'm also just going to pour it and back away immediately

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.740
and my cameraman is also not going to be standing so close to it this time.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.900
Oh yeah. Lots of good bubbling action like last time.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.459
I don't think the clay is going to explode, but I would be surprised if the aluminum doesn't do anything.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.690
Hey, maybe it's settling down

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.189
Look at that. You can see that the clay is actually drying out where it's touching the aluminum

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.180
A lot of cracking. The top of this thing is starting to look like a volcano.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.430
Check it out the clay is still steaming though.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.340
The aluminum is obviously still very hot and I'm not going to touch it for a while, but it's got a cool effect

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.469
I think this might be a bubble in the aluminum. So I'm gonna see if I can poke it. Pop it maybe.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.109
It's collapsing in so I think I'm right it's just, oh there we go.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.209
I'll look at that. The inside like crater of the clay

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.609
It's picked up some of the clay any wound. Yeah, you can see that is a bubble. There's all hollow in there.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.060
You can look down into it. See if this one will come out.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.360
Oh no! Well, our fired clay has become even more fragile, and I think it already was.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.440
Oh, yep, yep. That is just all falling apart. It did cast fairly well.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.640
It looks like there's a little indentation that might have been a bit of an air bubble

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.399
because there's no little mound in the clay.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.538
So I'm not sure where exactly that came from but there it is.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.900
Although the casting did it did come out fairly well,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.639
I don't know if it has enough detail that you would want to use fired clay for cast aluminum parts

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:07.660
and I am quite sure that you don't want to use dry clay

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.968
for casting aluminum parts. That's just doesn't work at all

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:12.939
Obviously, That's a neat looking thing.

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:16.119
But it doesn't look like cast aluminum.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.120
That's still very warm.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.919
If I hold this piece still in my hands for too long, it will start to get uncomfortably hot.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.560
But as long as I keep it moving, it's really not a problem at this point

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.960
See that the aluminum so hot that it actually dried the clay out all the way through in the middle.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:38.040
The purpose of today's video is to see if we could cast molten aluminum in clay

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.408
And we tried three different varieties.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.680
We tried normal wet clay, we tried some clay that had dried out what hadn't been fired

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.740
and then we also tried a piece of clay that had been fired.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.360
What we found was that clay is probably not the best material to cast in.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.170
Our fired clay did hold its shape for the most part

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.820
But it did crack apart when we tried taking the aluminum ingot out, it mostly fell to pieces

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.459
When we tried pouring our aluminum into the dry clay. It seemed to be working for a second

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.380
But then it started boiling, it poured over the edge, and then the whole thing exploded

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.240
which was actually really cool looking but pretty dangerous

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.540
as our cameraman did get splashed on just a tiny bit.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.050
We then tried pouring it into wet clay which I thought was gonna just explode immediately.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.010
I thought there would be violent amounts of steam and molten aluminum would go flying into the air

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.629
But I was wrong. It did bubble and boil which also looked really good but it didn't really go anywhere.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.820
It was pretty safe in the end.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.689
The heat from the molten aluminum did start drying out the wet clay which I thought looked really

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.659
cool. It almost like a volcano especially while it was still steaming

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.930
That was a really neat effect.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.599
But, I don't think it's a great tool for casting molten metal in because the final pieces of aluminum

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.360
had a lot of air bubbles in it and wasn't really the shape of the container it was poured into.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.240
Overall, I think that sand works better for casting molten metal than clay does

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.489
although there might be another material that we can still use that

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.740
will give even better and cleaner results.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.700
There you have a casting molten metal in clay. It's a fun experiment

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.800
although It's a little bit dangerous

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.709
and we didn't get very clean results so I can't say I really recommend it.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.449
Overall I'm very glad that we did this.

00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:08.420
I learned something new that I've never even seen anyone try before.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.639
I know the result is not what I thought would happen and

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.520
not something I was hoping for. It was still a good experiment to try

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.480
Thank you for joining us for this video, and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.749
See my face.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.940
-That was a little scary. Dude you all right?

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.300
- Yeah! - You got a little bit on your glasses lens

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.800
- I know!

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:30.078
- Holy cow and on your camera lens. Very front.

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:33.439
That's crazy...

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.380
Hey my friends! Thanks for watching and supporting our videos and thanks for welcoming Nate on to the channel

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.979
It's his first experience working on camera, and he'll soak up any validation

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.910
you're willing to give. So do your best to make him feel at home, and we'll see in the next video.
