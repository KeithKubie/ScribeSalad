00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.484
All: Quake the pool.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:19.619
Quake the pool.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.454 line:92%
Quake the pool.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.089

Quake the pool.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.292
Quake the pool.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.760 line:92%
Quake the pool.

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.662
Quake the pool.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.197 line:92%
Quake the pool.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.665
Quake the pool.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.273
Quake the pool.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.275
That's called
"Quaking the Pool."

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.277
It's the latest
summer challenge.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.345
White people have been
quaking the pool since

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.215
they were the only ones
allowed in them.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.451
Quake the pool.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.287 line:92%
Quake the pool.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.589
Quake the pool.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:59.292
Yeah, you get it.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.127
But it's not just pools
that can be quaked.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.361
You can quake anything.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:03.763
all: Quake the bowl.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.565
Quake the bowl.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.100 line:92%
Quake the bowl.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.601

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:12.772 line:92%
Quake the bowl.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.141
all: Quake the bowl.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.709
Quake the tank.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.177 line:92%
Quake the tank.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.613
Quake the tank.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:21.781
Quake the cube.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.716 line:92%
Quake the cube.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.418
Quake the cube.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.488
[all shouting]

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.724
Aim for the Jaccuzzi, pussy!

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.660
Cannonball!

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.663
He went with a can opener!

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.801
Probably tore his gooch!

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.637
This video confirms two
stereotypes

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.441
White's can't jump, but
thankfully they can swim

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.678
I'd suggest wearing some aqua
socks next time

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.716
Some traction. I tried to jump
over my infinity pool

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.386
I am so (bleep) rich!

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.558
Mo Money Mo Problems!
