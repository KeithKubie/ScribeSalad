00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.950
So let's look at a better solution. Because this

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.689
should not be a problem that every single developer of

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.810
server side applications need to think about. Fortunately the Google

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.600
cloud platform has a product that takes care of most

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.050
of these things. It's called App Engine, and that's

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.280
what we will be using in this course. Let's take

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.090
a closer look. App Engine is a development and deployment

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.700
platform that takes care of many things for your application.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.540
For example, it performs all the scaling for you

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.896
automatically. So when your application runs on App Engine, and

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:35.797
there is more traffic it needs to manage. Then

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:38.511
App Engine will increase the number of instances to use

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:41.100
to take care of the load. This is called

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.590
scaling up. And at other times, when your application is

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.340
not so busy. App Engine will reduce the number

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.930
of instances to save resources and cost. This is called

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.800
scaling down. And this scaling is done automatically. You

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600
don't need to write a single line of application code

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.910
to get this benefit. And it doesn't stop with automatic

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.550
scaling. The App Engine platform has functionality to deal with

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.300
all of the things we've previously looked at. So there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.800
is no need for you to do any design or

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.540
coding to deal with that. And this is no coincidence.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.600
Google has been the leader in designing scalable systems and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.460
all that experience was built into App Engine

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.550
when it was designed. As is everything runs on

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.760
Google infrastructure. There are Google engineers watching over

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.890
these systems day and night, to make sure everything

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.220
is running smoothly. So that you, can focus

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.870
on your application. In Cloud language, App Engine is

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.790
classified as a PaaS solution. And this makes

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.840
sense, because App Engine is a platform that takes

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.260
care of a lot of the complexity of building scalable applications
