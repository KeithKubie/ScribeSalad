Christ said resist not evil I was like
 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.480
Christ said resist not evil I was like
you don't even resist it and so I

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490
you don't even resist it and so I
 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.040
you don't even resist it and so I
thought that there was a metaphysics to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
thought that there was a metaphysics to
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.010
thought that there was a metaphysics to
that potential yeah well then I would

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
that potential yeah well then I would
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.979
that potential yeah well then I would
say that you you you've asked me a

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
say that you you you've asked me a
 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.250
say that you you you've asked me a
question that I can't answer I mean I

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260
question that I can't answer I mean I
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.049
question that I can't answer I mean I
guess that would be in the same line as

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059
guess that would be in the same line as
 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.500
guess that would be in the same line as
turn the other cheek now that's that's

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510
turn the other cheek now that's that's
 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930
turn the other cheek now that's that's
in a way it's actually yeah yeah there's

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940
in a way it's actually yeah yeah there's
 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.430
in a way it's actually yeah yeah there's
some nuance there I thought there is

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440
some nuance there I thought there is
 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.319

a whole different issue I would like to

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020
a whole different issue I would like to
 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.840

Devils in the details but it's
 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.219
Devils in the details but it's
definitely a sufficiently jarring

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
definitely a sufficiently jarring

investigation especially because I've

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270
investigation especially because I've
 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.449
investigation especially because I've
heard you talk in the past about how how

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459
heard you talk in the past about how how
 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.220
heard you talk in the past about how how

placard that's probably a very expressed

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
placard that's probably a very expressed
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.850
placard that's probably a very expressed
version of of how resisting what you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
version of of how resisting what you
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.640
version of of how resisting what you
deemed to be evil just the act of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
deemed to be evil just the act of
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.089
deemed to be evil just the act of
resisting it alone is so useless uh-huh

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099
resisting it alone is so useless uh-huh
 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.699
resisting it alone is so useless uh-huh
it's a waste of energy right like actual

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
it's a waste of energy right like actual
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.460
it's a waste of energy right like actual
and that's a very interesting take on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
and that's a very interesting take on
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.640
and that's a very interesting take on
that so that's why I've been thinking

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
that so that's why I've been thinking
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.430
that so that's why I've been thinking
about continuing my whatever you might

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
about continuing my whatever you might
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.410
about continuing my whatever you might

university you know I thought for a long

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
university you know I thought for a long
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.449
university you know I thought for a long
time in terms of war metaphors with

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
time in terms of war metaphors with
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.509
time in terms of war metaphors with

to think more clearly or begin to think
more clearly about whatever it is I

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
more clearly about whatever it is I
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.870
more clearly about whatever it is I
might be doing I realized that my

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880
might be doing I realized that my
 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.050
might be doing I realized that my

let's say maybe concern but if it's a

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
let's say maybe concern but if it's a
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.050
let's say maybe concern but if it's a
war then it's the wrong approach your

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060
war then it's the wrong approach your
 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.120
war then it's the wrong approach your
