[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.830
TIM PANTON: So yeah,
I'm Tim Panton.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.660
And this is Alex.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.020
I do stuff.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.570
You know, WebRTC stuff mostly,
but I started out on the web.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.070
And I'm really liking
the idea of getting back

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.850
into web development and
escaping from telephony.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.830
So that's the kind of
sub theme for this talk.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.902
And Alex will tell
you who he is.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.110
ALEX THOMAS: I'm Alex Thomas.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.880
I first got swept
into the WebRTC world

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.320
by creating my own startup.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.970
I wanted to create audio
chat for gamers and teams

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.020
in the web browser.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.990
And like earlier speakers said,
it was virtually impossible.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.360
The price cap was way too huge.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.950
And I stumbled upon a company
called XirSys and started

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.451
using them.

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.950
And it was a very
natural fit for me

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.180
to actually get a job there.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.040
And we provide STUN and TURN
servers, globally scalable.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.680
You can bring any API into us.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.110
And it's great if you think
the STUN and TURN server

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.790
area is just a land of dragons.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.320
TIM PANTON: So I
want to talk really

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.580
about how to build a WebRTC app.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.260
And that comes into two chunks.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.810
The first one I want
to absolutely emphasize

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.880
is what not to do.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.660
I can't say this enough, right?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.990
Do not-- do not-- replicate
the PSTN functionality.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.370
There's really no point.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.810
And specifically,
because it devalues both.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.265
So the value in WebRTC
is around its context.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:43.590
It's around the finely
tuned UX that you're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.020
providing to your web users
that you know a lot about.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.020
You know where they are.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.978
You know their friends.

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:49.280
You know all of this stuff.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.555
And you tailor a UX to meet
their goals of the thing

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:54.410
that they're trying to achieve.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.580
And the PSTN is
exactly the other way.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.980
It's a generic mechanism
that is nonspecific,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.580
but it's ubiquitous.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.145
And the great
thing about PSTN is

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.414
you can still charge
by the minute.

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:10.830
Now, what happens
when you combine

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.320
the two is you lose
all of those things.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.870
WebRTC stops being specific.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.290
It stops being a tailored UI.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.180
PSTN, you can't
charge by the minute

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.680
anymore, because
people don't expect

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680
to be charged on the web.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.040
And hey, also, you lose
the ubiquitousness.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.610
So in general, it's like
the worst of both worlds.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.080
And I can say this, because
I ran a startup doing it.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.200
And it wasn't a huge success.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.540
And actually there
was phonefromhere.com.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.120
So having said all that,
just kind of for laughs,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.220
we're going to do it anyway.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.570
So what we have here
is the first demo.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.190
Now let me just make
sure we have audio.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.670
Yes, OK.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.290
So what we have here is
a framework I worked on

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.090
and I still kind of
have warm feelings

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.934
for that allows you
to basically build--

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.225
and I could do with a slightly
bigger font on that one.

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:17.100
I'll come back to it.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100
It allows you to build
apps that call out

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.750
into the PSTN and some
other things using WebRTC.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.250
And just to give you a
sense of how easy it is,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.230
I'm running those four
bits of JavaScript.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.430
And now, we can
make a phone call.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.350
Hopefully.

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:48.174
[DIALING]

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:50.910
PHONE OPERATOR: Hold please
while we connect your call.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.910
Thank you for calling
1-800-PedMeds,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.150
America's largest pet pharmacy.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.530
If you've placed an order with
us before, please press 1.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.324
All other callers,
please press 2.

00:04:06.324 --> 00:04:08.490
TIM PANTON: Then you can
press 2 and all that stuff.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.610
But the interesting thing
is if we hang in there

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.680
for a little longer, she will
tell you to go to the website.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.950
ALEX THOMAS: I would like
to speak to a person.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.390
TIM PANTON: So my point there
is that her thing is actually

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.460
to drive you back
to the web, right?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.159
So even if you do make a PSTN
call with your WebRTC thing,

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.450
the first thing you're going
to hit is somebody saying,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.030
hey, go back to the web.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.000
So that is a
serious issue, and I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.250
think you can't
underestimate it.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.920
And now I need to
get my screen back.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.420
There we go.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.546
So having annoyed all the
PSTN people who are watching,

00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:53.670
let's build something to
actually delight somebody.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.580
Let's build something
that actually

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.020
does do something kind
of fun and useful.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.500
And so what we
thought we'd do was

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.720
to build something that
would at least delight a pet.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.320
And pets are kind of--
you know, a lot of them

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.460
are really social animals.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.110
And I must tell
you, so this parrot

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.720
that we may call later
if the gods are with us.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.935
First time I met this
parrot, it gave me

00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:22.750
a really seriously hard time.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.230
I came into the
room with my friend,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.250
and this parrot started dive
bombing me and squawking at me,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.020
right?

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.750
And so my friend
says, shake hands.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.500
And I'm thinking, well, I know
this guy from like five years.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.830
We've been on a desert
island together.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.760
We know each other pretty well.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.867
We're past the
shaking hands thing.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.200
So I look at him really puzzled.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.750
And he says, no,
really, shake hands.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.635
So we shake hands, and
the parrot watches.

00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:50.380
And immediately, the
parrot's seen the social cue.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.820
The parrot knows
that I'm now welcome,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.270
and therefore, it calms down.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.020
It still keeps a bit
of a beady eye on me,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.170
but really, it
stops hassling me.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.820
So they are social animals, and
they understand visual clues.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.330
So hey, video for
them sounds fine.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.680
And actually, they do also
do-- they like phone calls.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.510
Parrots will talk to
you over the phone.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.690
So we thought we'd build YoPet.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.540
So having said that, we thought
we'd probably better show you

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.820
how you build an app.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.930
ALEX THOMAS: Sorry?

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.721
AUDIENCE: Watch it.

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:27.170
Someone's going
to want to invest.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.277
TIM PANTON: Yeah, a seed round.

00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:31.265
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.190
TIM PANTON: So just to
give you a sense of how

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.920
easy this stuff is,
really, kind of ish,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.030
this is all the app
is going to do, right?

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.830
All we have there is a
couple of video elements.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.800
And well, that's almost it.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.700
The only thing we do then
is to add some scripting.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.520
JQuery because I'm lazy.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.790
Hoodie, Hoodie's a
really cute framework.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.400
Hoodie's a really nice
framework for throwing up apps

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.390
really quickly.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.140
It does all of the kind
of sign in, sign out,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.060
consistency across
multiple devices for you,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.760
synchronization across multiple
devices, all that stuff.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.230
And I'm going to ruthlessly
abuse that synchronization

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.690
as a way of doing
signaling in WebRTC.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.830
And adapter.js just gets
rid of some stuff that

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.720
is slightly different
between Firefox and Chrome.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.100
So that's a thing that
the Google guys support.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.990
And then there's assets.js.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.410
But first I'll just show you
the pet side of the thing.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.100
It's essentially the same
thing, except that, in general,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.150
pets don't like
seeing themselves.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.620
Like most of them
are really pretty

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.500
territorial about other
animals of their same species.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.900
So there is only
one video element,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.760
and that's me as the owner.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.310
We don't show the
pet themselves.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.490
So here we go, Pretty
much the same code.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.110
And then we get into the
kind of complicated stuff.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.310
This is how you move
stuff around in WebRTC.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.130
We're initializing
Hoodie down here.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.300
We're adding some
signing in as test,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.390
and that allows lazy
stuff and status stuff.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.560
And it's pretty much
a standard web app.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.230
There's nothing exciting there.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.120
A Little bit of cleaning up here
that we remove anything that's

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.650
loafing around the
database when we start up.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.770
We set an image just so that we
know that the thing's loaded.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.770
You know that we've
got to that point.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.200
And now here's the
real magic here.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.920
We're run a WebRTC
PeerConnection.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.330
So we fire one of those up.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.810
And then once we've fired one
up, we then run getUserMedia.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.700
And getUserMedia
accesses the camera.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.990
Having been given
permission to the camera,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.650
we then get given a stream.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.490
We connect the stream to the
video element we saw earlier.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.750
We then notify the
PeerConnection of the stream.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.780
Now, I have to take
some responsibility

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.000
for the complexity
of this because there

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.560
was an argument about whether
PeerConnection and getUserMedia

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.260
should know about
stuff under the hood

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.330
or whether the JavaScript
developer should

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.760
be responsible for
passing things from A to B

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.370
and that there should
be-- that should

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.540
be the only kind of
connection point.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.160
And my view was that it was
the JavaScript developer's

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.794
responsibility, and
we-- well, that's

00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:44.210
how it turned out
in the standard.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.793
Whether that was
right or not, I think

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.520
there's still people
who may disagree.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.320
But hey, it's fine.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.080
It works.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.010
So having that, we
create an offer.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.020
And then once the offer is
created, this is the magic.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.820
We push it into
the Hoodie store.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.860
Now, Hoodie does this wonderful
thing, which on the pet side,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.680
you can say that I'm
listening to offers.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.730
And when Hoodie sees a
new offer in the store,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.900
you get this callback called.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.730
And we can then do
something with it.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.660
We create a remote description.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.700
We stuff it into
the PeerConnection,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.930
and we clean up the
Hoodie database.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.071
So this whole thing
kind of goes that way.

00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:29.570
And then we do the same thing
the other way with the answer.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.930
And then we do the whole
thing with the candidates.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.620
So we move around.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.410
I think in this case
we probably move around

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.660
20 messages between Hoodie
to get this call set up.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.690
And in the end, with any luck,
you get to talk to your pet.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.570
So let's see if we can try that.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:56.810
Now, I need to get
back to my browser.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:02.050
So I have Hoodie running, yes.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.320
Now Alex is going to be
the pet for the moment.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.930
There's-- no, actually, no.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.260
Let's not go there.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.600
And I'm going to be the
owner, with any luck.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.310
So here's the owner.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.236
The user experience
here is really simple.

00:11:24.236 --> 00:11:25.860
That's a graphical
representation of me

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.930
on a bad day.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.480
And this is a graphical
representation of the pet.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.900
And then with any luck,
I get to call the pet.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.550
Does it come up?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.050
There we go.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.740
And we get to meet the pet.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.810
So it's no big deal.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.790
But hey, we've done
that in 150 lines

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.060
of JavaScript
maximum, complete app.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.140
So we looked at that.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.960
Oh!

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.930
But actually, pets do get
lonely at home, right?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.710
If you leave your pet all day,
it's good to call your pet.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.540
It's good to make
sure-- and we figured

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.150
what you could do is you could
take an old Android phone,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.870
like maybe you were given
at Google I/O two years ago,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.980
strap it to your pet's cage, and
then leave it in answer mode.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.730
And you could just call the
pet any time you feel like it.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.980
And I should point out that
the user experience is not

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.630
reversible.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.240
The pet cannot call you at work.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.270
So we've built YoPet.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.454
But actually, it turns out that
it's a bit of pain in the neck,

00:12:45.454 --> 00:12:45.960
all that.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.084
It doesn't scale very well.

00:12:47.084 --> 00:12:51.560
We're using Hoodie
really in an ugly way.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.760
And as somebody else
said, the timing

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.420
gets messed up if you're not
just right next to each other

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.460
on the same LAN.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.520
So actually, it turns
out to be easier

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.270
to use a framework
in a lot of cases.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.190
And there are a lot
of them out there.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.710
And they simplify the coding.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.650
They help you keep up with
changing browser versions.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.110
And some of them
provide nice features.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.750
So we rewrote it.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.470
Can you just ping Harvin and
make sure we've got a live pet?

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.470
ALEX THOMAS: He's ready.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.230
TIM PANTON: OK, cool.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.190
So having said that--
and we're going

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.530
to get rid of that pet call.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.780
And I knew what the agenda is.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.980
So if we look at the code
for using a framework,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.720
so we basically rewrote
this thing slightly shorter.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.300
So we used HTM instead of HTML,
because it's more compact.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.590
And so we now have actually
pretty much the same app.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.540
But I folded the JavaScript
in, because by this point

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.290
there was barely any
point in having two files.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.040
And the difference being
that I've loaded this.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.490
Now, this is a framework that's
in closed beta at the moment.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.100
But my friends were
kind enough to allow

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.814
me to use it for this demo.

00:14:04.814 --> 00:14:05.730
And I kind of like it.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.710
It's got some interesting
little minor features, which

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.260
I don't know if they're unique
or not, but I quite like them.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.500
So user stuff for the framework,
you sign in with an app ID,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.070
create yourself a client.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.170
And you get notified
when you get connected.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.350
But the most interesting
aspect of this

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:29.080
is that within an
application, their API

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.910
allows you to
assert an identity.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.120
So I can say, in this
case, I'm the pet.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:44.040
And in the owner matching file,
we say that we're the owner.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.934
And that allows us to
just assert an identity.

00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:48.600
And it could be Fred
or Bill or whatever

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.630
you want to-- your
pet's name or whatever.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.400
But basically you can
assert that identity

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.560
without having to do any kind
of other infrastructure, which

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.719
is I'm finding actually
pretty convenient.

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:01.260
And there's pretty
much nothing else.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.300
It's pretty simple code.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.990
All we're doing is
calling the thing.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.700
So in fact, let's try that.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.030
Assuming I can get my-- this
is the thing I always-- There

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.630
we go.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.165
So now we need to
find a browser.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
So I was taking this
really seriously, actually.

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:34.830
I bought myself
the domain as well.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.710
So I'm the owner here.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.000
And there's got to be a business
model here, so we need adverts.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.430
Hey, we're in Google.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.850
So we have now a
cruddy user interface.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.070
And is Harvin-- he's ready.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.577
OK, so he's running it?

00:15:58.577 --> 00:15:59.660
ALEX THOMAS: I believe so.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.368
TIM PANTON: Cool.

00:16:00.368 --> 00:16:03.930
Well, with any luck-- now,
I must ask you to be quiet.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.735
I don't want to
scare this parrot.

00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:07.860
I've only just got to the
point where it trusts me,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.130
and I don't want to scare it.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.780
So if we do connect
to the parrot--

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.850
Hi Gallagher.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.960
Oh, it needs some audio.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.830
So somewhere in there,
there's a parrot.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.497
Where's he gone?

00:16:33.497 --> 00:16:34.079
Hey Gallagher!

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:34.855
How you doing?

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.440
Hey, Gallagher.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.390
How's it?

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.910
Do dee, do dee, do dee do.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.250
Do dee, do dee, do dee do.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.790
Hi Gallagher, how you doing?

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.905
Yay!

00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:49.300
[CHIRPING]

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.540
TIM PANTON: Do dee,
do dee, do dee do.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.950
Do dee, do dee, do dee do.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:17:00.560
Normally I can get Gallagher
to dance, but not today.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.880
Bye!

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.991
Bye, bye, Gallagher.

00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:04.490
Right.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.670
So there you go.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.109
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:11.619
Thank Harvin for me.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:14.200
So actually, the next
version of this app

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.901
will have the ability to
push tunes to the far end,

00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:18.484
so that you can get
your pet to dance.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:26.599
So that's an app of sorts.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:32.660
But that might not be
what you really want.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.160
You might not be
building a new app.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.860
You might not be seed
funding a startup.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.510
You might be wanting to build
it into an existing app.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.015
And you may be in
an organization

00:17:43.015 --> 00:17:44.894
where it's not that
easy to get at the code

00:17:44.894 --> 00:17:47.185
base of the existing app that
you're trying to support.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.810
Well, let me just say,
what you need to do

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.810
is make sure the identity
stuff lines up correctly.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.330
You want to pick
a framework that

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.490
fits the app, that uses the
same kind of things like JQuery

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.060
and whatever.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.910
And add some magic.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.080
Do something interesting
for goodness sake.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.720
So what we're going to
do now-- and this is just

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.236
like stupidly risky.

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:16.220
Actually, so stupidly risky I've
forgotten how to-- there we go.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.320
And I must say, I
have to give credit.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:26.170
Luis-- I saw this demo
Luis did in Atlanta,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.450
and it was just
fantastically cool.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.436
So I talked to him
afterwards, and I asked him

00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:32.227
if I could steal a
couple of ideas from it.

00:18:32.227 --> 00:18:35.220
He said absolutely,
but give me credit.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.600
And I said, I am doing.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.980
And he said, I'm after a job.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.272
He's just graduated in Chicago.

00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:42.230
He's looking for a job.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.080
So if you like what I do
here, give Luis a job.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.320
What we're doing
here is we're going

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.840
to add voice to Atlassian.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.670
I'm sorry, guys.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.300
I know you've got
HipChat, but this

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.550
is something slightly different.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.940
So what we do with
this is-- now,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.470
I'm going to live
code this into Chrome.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.182
But actually it's equivalent
to running a Chrome extension.

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.890
So everything I'm
doing here is something

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.280
you can do as a
Chrome extension.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.970
They're a little messier
to set up and deploy.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.190
So it didn't seem like
that would be good theater.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.730
But it's essentially
the same process.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:31.550
So what we're going to do here
is you're going to add-- now,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.244
this is cute.

00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:34.410
I didn't know you could do
this until the other day,

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:40.130
but you can actually inject
JavaScript files with a Chrome

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.130
console into a live running
page, which is sweet.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.000
So we're now loading
JQuery on our library.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.250
And having done that, we will
sign up with that library.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.730
Now, actually one
of us should mute,

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.330
because this is going
to get noisy, OK?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.930
And now, if I-- Alex is doing
the same thing on the screen

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.350
you can't see on the same page.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.050
So the concept here
is, if you're both

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.010
talking about an
issue, like you're

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.670
both worried about an issue
and you need to discuss it,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.330
why not use the issue
page as the place where

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.080
you have the, effectively,
conference call?

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.220
So oops.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.260
That doesn't look good.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.800
What have I done wrong?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.222
What have I done wrong?

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.288
So one person say that louder.

00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:37.204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.201
TIM PANTON: Oh.

00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:42.700
OK.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.200
Thank you.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.420
You're right.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.330
Because it's up here.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.560
I'm really, really
glad somebody's

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.440
watching what I'm doing.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.550
Thank you.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.780
So if we set by name, my name.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.270
And then with any luck-- yes.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.770
Good.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:02.920
Excellent.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.570
Now the important thing
there is, and I should--

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.350
I missed that.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.725
And that was a
really good point.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.260
Because what I've done is,
up here, somewhere deep

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.140
in the DOM, it
knows my name, OK?

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.070
So the app already
knows my name.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.700
So what I've done is I've
pulled it out with that query

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.650
and pushed it into
the framework.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.640
So now the framework
knows who I am.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.790
Now, Alex on the
other side is going

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.480
to pull that out
and make a call.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.170
And we are now in a call.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.100
So we're now having a chat.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.950
But you know, actually that's
a bit unsatisfactory, really,

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.030
because the whole
point about issues

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.790
is that you're recording
what it is that you're

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.770
doing and keeping
it as a record.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.780
So you know, hey,
why don't we do that?

00:21:51.780 --> 00:22:00.030
So if I speak now, with any luck
it goes into my GitHub issue

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.335
whilst I'm talking to Alex.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.140
So I'm now recording
this conversation.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.410
And it's going into the issue.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.332
And Alex is-- if he spoke,
it would go into his.

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:13.540
And then we can combine them.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.040
Now there's a whole
lot of stuff you

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.490
would add to make
this a real app.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.300
But my point is that you
can do this in the browser.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.860
This is all happening
in the browser.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.540
This isn't something
the framework's doing.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.590
As you saw, this is whatever
that is-- six lines of code

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.700
to kick off the Google Chrome
recognizer with a web API.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.750
So there you go.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.900
We're inserting text into a
web page that I don't own.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.670
Somebody from Atlassian is
responsible for this page,

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.170
not me.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.710
So I suppose the point I'm
trying to get over here

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.650
is we can do stuff to existing
web properties and existing

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.240
contexts.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.160
And Serge mentioned
WebRTC for dogs.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.920
I did actually
whilst-- after you

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.946
said that, I hacked
something together.

00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:05.990
It turns out that some
dogs are colorblind.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.960
So I thought we could rewrite
the pet experience so that we'd

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.050
be much more in
sympathy with the dogs

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.030
and do that in black and white.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.980
So I did that.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.540
We'll just very briefly
show you that, and then

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.510
I'm out of your hair.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.930
And I'm conscious
that I'm standing

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.540
between you and the questions
and also between you and beer,

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.730
neither of which I
really want to do.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.950
So what am I doing?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:44.560
I'm going to YoPet.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:51.680
So I'm going to go to YoPet dog.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.790
So I'm now going to
log in as dog on YoPet.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.130
And now from my-- and I
want to point this out.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.882
This is a Firefox
OS phone, right?

00:24:01.882 --> 00:24:05.630
Now if this works, I'm just
going to be really happy.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:21.970
Because I hacked it together
in the-- there we go.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:27.660
So we have a sepia-toned
toned [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.150
And just as a final
thing, that was

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.550
done using the Seriously.js
library, which applies a WebGL

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.080
filter to the
incoming WebRTC call.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.740
So again, it's a few
lines of JavaScript

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.100
to do something
really-- well, that used

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.440
to be big news in the TV world.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.210
Anyway, but that's us.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.730
Alex has been an
immensely good sport

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.920
with putting up
with this nonsense.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.190
And I want to thank
him very much for that.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.340
[APPLAUSE]
