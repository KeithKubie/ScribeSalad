00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.910
So using information from the pedigree here, we should have been able to discern

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.370
that Kate could have only possibly been

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.335
one genotype. The minus minus. You'll remember the

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:11.490
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.660
homozygous combination, which is the recessive trait. And

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.710
that her brother could be either heterozygous or

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.100
homozygous. For the dominant thymine, or positive, allele.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.500
Now how do we come up with this?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.220
Well, looking at our pedigree here, we know

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.860
that Kate is affected by the trait of

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.840
lactose intolerance. We know that the trait of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.500
lactose intolerance is recessive. Meaning that there's only one

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.070
allelic combination the homozygous recessive combination that she

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.450
could be, she must be minus minus. Her

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.090
brother on the other hand we know is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.530
unaffected. Well if he's unaffected that means he can't

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.550
be minus minus, there are two other possible

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.230
options. He could be homozygous plus plus or

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.570
heterozygous plus minus based on the information for

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.520
the pedigree alone. We can't determine which is which.
