00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.770
Now to drive home some of the points that I just

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.920
made, I would like to show you a few real world examples

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.150
of architectures that kind of went astray. The first example I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.970
want to use is an example from the Linux kernel. Actually, from

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.260
an earlier version of the Linux kernel. A research group studied

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.020
the documentation of Linux, and also

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.440
interviewed several Linux developers. And by

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.710
doing that, they were able to come up with a software

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.260
architecture of Linux at different levels of obstruction. So the one that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.365
I'm showing you here on the left, is the

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:31.120
software architecture at the level of Linux's main subsystems. So

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.540
this is the prescriptive architecture of Linux at the level

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.060
of Linux's main subsystems. So the researchers, after identifying this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.420
architecture, they showed it to the developers, and the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.180
developers agreed that, that was indeed the architecture of the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.540
system. The researchers then studied the source code of Linux

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.380
and reverse engineered its actual architecture. So the architecture as

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.020
implemented, it's descriptive architecture. And this one here, on the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.610
right, is the result. And as you can see, they found

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.940
a number of differences or violations between the prescriptive architecture and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.080
the descriptive architecture. In particular, if we look at this architecture,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.820
we can see that pretty much everything talks to everything else,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.010
which is, in general, not a good thing. And in addition

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.890
to that, there are also several things that don't really make

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.630
much sense. For example the library calls the file system and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
also the network interface which doesn't make much sense. Another thing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.850
that is kind of weird is the fact that file system

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.250
calls the kernel initialization code. Which is also a little bit

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.100
weird. So basically, the bottom line here is that not even

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.020
the developers realized how the actual architecture of the system was,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.170
and how it was different from the architecture they have conceived.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.870
And in fact another interesting thing here is the reaction of

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.020
the developers when they were shown the actual architecture. So basically

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.110
they justified the differences by saying things such as, well you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.120
know it had to be done fast, and therefore I changed it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.110
and then I didn't have time to go back and update the documentation

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.800
and things of this sort. And by the way these are exactly some

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.640
of the reasons that we mentioned early on in the lesson for the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.410
discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive software

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.990
architecture. So one last thing that I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.840
want to mention here as an aside and we can get back to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.495
that later is the fact that you can probably clearly show how representing

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:10.880
software architectures graphically can be extremely useful, because it allows

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.140
for easily seeing the structure of the system. Look at different

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.140
views identify problematic points and so on. And we will see

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.740
how that can be useful in many cases also later on.
