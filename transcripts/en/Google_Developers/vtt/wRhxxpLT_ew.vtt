ABE HASKINS: Can everyone
hear me all right?

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.514
Hear me all right?

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:06.750
All right, cool.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.145
So my name is Abe
Haskins, for those of you

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:11.640
who didn't see my session
about 50 minutes ago.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.795
I am a developer programs
engineer on the Firebase team.

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:16.294
Which pretty much
means that my goal

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.230
is to help you be successful
with Firebase by talking

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.010
to you about the technical
[INAUDIBLE] devices.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.040
Today we're going
to talk specifically

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.990
about Firebase Analytics.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.049
So we look at this big
circular world of Firebase,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.795
we start to see an
obvious thing which

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:37.245
is that Firebase
Analytics is the core.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.110
[INAUDIBLE] hidden session
about Firebase Analytics.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
That's because Firebase
Analytics is super important.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.740
All of these services tie
into Firebase Analytics

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.420
At Firebase we talked about all
the time about building things

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.394
that make the lives of
our users users easier.

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:57.810
That means that if you're our
user, your a developer using

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.990
Firebase, we want to make
life easier for the people who

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.610
are using your products.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.310
And we do this by knowing
them, by understanding them,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.070
and having you
play really compete

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.504
idea about who are users are.

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.760
But it's not just about
knowing who they are.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.740
It's about having insight, and
making that insight actionable.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.245
So that instead of just saying
I have users, you can say

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.390
I have users in
India, who are 18

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.705
to 24-years old, who love buying
packs of stickers in my app.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:28.230
Or I have users
in the Netherlands

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.940
who always search for bread.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.360
I don't know why, but they
always search for bread.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.436
This is the type of
insight we want to have,

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:36.060
and then you want to
be able to say, OK

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.620
how can we make our
applications experience more

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.190
customized, and more natural
for these users, based

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.822
on this data.

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:48.030
And so Firebase Analytics
alone is super interesting.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.670
It's a great tool for capturing
data about your users,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.360
about understanding them.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.480
But then, when we
mix it in with all

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.080
these other Firebase services
we get a much more complete

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.580
picture.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.640
And one of these services
well talk specifically

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.150
about today is Remote Config.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.180
We're changing things in your
app based on who your user is.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.840
But all of these
services work really,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.340
really well with
Firebase Analytics,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.778
which is why it's
the core of Firebase.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:13.880
So here's what we uncover today.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.672
And these slides
are not in English,

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:17.630
so I'm going to try and
remember what they say.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.536
And I believe what
they say is first we're

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:21.410
going to look at the
built in-- nope, getting

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.671
started, that's the first one.

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.420
Then we'll look at the
built in reporting.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.850
What we did for free, just
by including the Firebase

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.900
Analytics SDK.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.500
Then we'll look at how to do
some more advanced reporting.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.120
Reporting custom events.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330
How that works inside Firebase.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.285
Then we'll look at--

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:39.710
let me think about this.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.470
I know the answer, we're doing
advanced reporting, and then

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.341
Google Analytics versus
Firebase Analytics.

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.590
Of course, I forget the one
that's written in English.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.292
So we'll look at comparing
Firebase Analytics to Google

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:53.430
Analytics, so we know when to
use what, and how they connect,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.020
and what that whole story is.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.222
And then we'll wrap things up.

00:02:57.222 --> 00:02:59.305
So first, if you want to
get started with Firebase

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.780
Analytics, if you want to
walk out of here today and get

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.340
Firebase Analytics inside
of your mobile app,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.636
you go to firebase.google.com,
or the Chinese localized

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:10.945
equivalent, and create
a new Firebase project.

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.140
It takes like two seconds.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.140
If you have an existing
Google project,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.239
maybe you have Google
Sign In, or something

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.780
like that enabled
on another project,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.771
you can hit this handy
import Google project button,

00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.395
and that will bring
it in and turn that

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:24.104
into a Firebase project.

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:27.660
Once we have that we can
go and we can actually

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.020
enable Analytics.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.600
And in this picture we see
Firebase Analytics as the core.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.580
And every part of this
feature is broken up

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.190
into it's own
library, it's own SDK,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.745
kind of, that we
can pick and choose.

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:42.510
So when I want just
Firebase Analytics,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.300
I ask for the Firebase Core.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.409
And if I want Firebase Remote
Config, or Firebase Dynamic

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.950
Links, I can ask
for those two later,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.010
and import those
libraries separately.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.350
But since Analytics is the
core, that's the module

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.460
we're going to look at.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.590
So in iOS that's saying,
all right [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.478
is Firebase Core we're
going to include.

00:03:58.478 --> 00:04:01.160
And then app delegate,
we [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.020
Now, in Android
it's very similar.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.000
We include com.google.firebase,
Firebase Core, and then

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.290
include the Google Services
[INAUDIBLE] plugin.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.350
And this does the equivalent of
correct configure in Android.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.330
It's a little bit
different, but it does

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.026
essentially the same thing.

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:23.720
Now with this, once we have
this set up, Analytics is done.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.690
Or it can be if you just
want the basic reporting.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.470
Because right now
Firebase Analytics

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.324
is enabled in your app, and
if you ship this out to users

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:33.240
it's going to start
reporting a bunch of data.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.800
And because Firebase
Analytics has

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.190
been built by a company who
builds really great mobile apps

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.830
and really
understands our users,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.840
we know what is
immediately useful.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.430
The things that are shared
between every single mobile

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.960
app that every mobile app
developer wants to know.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.160
And we can start reporting
those to you immediately.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.860
So what is that?

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.960
It's all of this data.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480
So we get, Immediately,
things like

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.940
how often things are happening.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.320
We get location
information about where

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.420
things are happening.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.580
We get information
about the demographic.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.100
What gender using or app?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.160
How old are they?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.630
All of this
information, including

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.230
things like how long
have they been in my app?

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.650
How often do they use it?

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.630
Have they made any
in-app purchases?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.783
All of this data is collected
by Firebase Analytics

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.880
for free, right out of the
gate, with no lines of code.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.490
Or one, if you're in iOS.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.400
So to give some idea what
these automatic events that we

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.290
include are, here's a list.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.494
We have the first time
somebody opens an app.

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:31.660
We want to know how many
people are actually opening

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.980
our app after they install it.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.530
They will want to know did
they make an in app purchase?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.560
Did they update our app?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.010
Did the OS update?

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.990
Did they open a
notification from us?

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.392
Did they open a dynamic link?

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.850
All these things,
you can see, they

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.460
connect out to the
extended Firebase world.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.500
They're related to
other Firebase services,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.240
like opening a dynamic link.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.030
And some of these are just data
we want to know about the user.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.600
Because we want to see if we
get way more crashes in our app

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.810
today then we did yesterday,
and we didn't change anything,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.560
why could that be?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.400
Well we could see that
a ton of our users

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.000
had an operating system update.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.240
A ton of people just upgraded
to that new version of Android,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.042
and that's causing
some issues for us.

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:11.497
And this is the type of
insight we can get for free

00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:13.760
through Firebase Analytics.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.980
So like I said, we
get a bunch of stuff

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.326
just immediately for free.

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:20.390
We get all those events
that got triggered

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.580
that are just built in.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.680
That are just known as things
that we need from mobile.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.449
And we get utility to just,
for free, discover things.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.990
And this is something I really
love about Firebase Analytics.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.680
It costs basically nothing.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.930
And by basically nothing,
I mean actually nothing.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.587
[INAUDIBLE] into your app.

00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:39.170
Firebase Analytics
is completely free,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.253
it's completely unlimited.

00:06:40.253 --> 00:06:42.100
So you can go, you
can drop this in,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.880
and then you can go
look at these reports

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.170
and say am I actually
understanding

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.430
my users like I think I am?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.040
Are they doing what I expect?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.775
Are they using the
devices that I expect.

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:54.275
All of this just by including
those couple lines of code.

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:56.510
To give you some idea
of, specifically,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.114
what we can get out of
it, we can get information

00:06:59.114 --> 00:06:59.780
about our users.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.290
So monthly active users.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.220
This is an easy, common
metric for measuring

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.110
the value of an app.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.870
How many people use
your app in a month?

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.570
And of course we can
see trends over time.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.800
How many people are
engaging in our app?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.090
Did that news article
really make a difference?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.840
Thinks like that.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.020
We can see the ARPU, the
average revenue per user,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.850
and other insight like
that because it is

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.090
tied into the rest of Google.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.500
It's tied into your
in-app purchases.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.000
So we immediately get
that type of information.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.260
And you're interested
in receipt validation,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.190
and other parts of the
more complex average value,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.400
average revenue
per user aspects,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.615
we've thought of a
ton of those issues

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:40.310
and already tackled them.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.960
Because we know that's
an issue for our top acts

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.102
who want to use an
analytics tool like this.

00:07:47.102 --> 00:07:49.209
We also get something
called a retention cohort.

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.000
It's my personal
favorite, mostly because I

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.916
like the way it looks.

00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:53.930
But this is a chart
that will show you

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.637
are people staying in your app?

00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:56.720
So imagine you had an app.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.525
You have a game, and this
game was really popular

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:00.830
for the first two weeks.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.829
And so in that first
week we'd have 100%,

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:05.120
because if somebody installed
the app they're obviously

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.930
going to use it the
first day they use it.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.840
So that first week
will always be 100%.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.666
The second week we have
19% who are still there,

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:12.830
and they're still doing OK.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.390
And in this case we have 12,
so this is a more average drop

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.890
off.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.181
But imagine in that third
week it just dropped to zero.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:21.257
Dropped to like 1% of users
who are still in our app.

00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:22.715
This is a situation
where you might

00:08:22.715 --> 00:08:23.960
want to reevaluate your app.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.696
And this might not be something
you think to look for.

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:29.690
You might not think to
instrument your app so that you

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.300
can see retention cards.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.900
But once this is
here, and you're

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.539
looking around and fiddling
with your Firebase Analytics,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.775
you'll probably see that.

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:38.275
And you'll be like,
why the heck are

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:42.089
my [INAUDIBLE] users dropping
off in that third week.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.880
And this is what I mean
by discoverability.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.846
We want you to be able to find
things in Firebase Analytics

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:48.577
that you're not
really looking for.

00:08:48.577 --> 00:08:51.000
Because we know the
important things

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.172
that app developers need.

00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:54.874
And if we know those we can put
them front and center for you,

00:08:54.874 --> 00:08:56.540
so you don't have to
spend a lot of time

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.270
digging in and doing all
sorts of slicing and dicing

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.962
of your data to hopefully
get some [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:01.962 --> 00:09:03.170
You can do that, if you want.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.290
If you want to export to
some gigantic database

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.910
and analyze every analytics
event ever triggered

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.470
for your million users
everywhere in the world,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.870
you can do that with
Firebase Analytics.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.570
But on the surface,
to get started,

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.872
we just wanted to be simple

00:09:17.872 --> 00:09:21.310
Another chart on the topic
of user engagement and user

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.580
retention is the user
engagement section.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.520
We have daily
engagements, or how long

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.860
has someone been in your
app on an average day?

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.205
How long do they spend?

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:32.950
How many times do
they open the app?

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.408
How long do they
spend per session?

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:35.930
All of this core
information just

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.710
helps you learn more
about your users.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.942
And we can also correlate this
to in-app purchasing data.

00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:43.067
Because this is, again,
related to user engagement.

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:45.700
And one of the ways you could,
if you were interested in it,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.790
measure engagement is
through in-app purchases.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.288
And just generally, the
success of the monetization

00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:51.650
of your app.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.390
So if we can easily see
that 96 of our users

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.150
are purchasing
something in our app,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.050
we can immediately
get some insight.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.960
And since that purchase
is just a built in event,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.487
it's just an event that
get's added automatically

00:10:05.487 --> 00:10:07.070
whenever somebody
purchases something,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.322
we can dig into that.

00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:10.030
Now I don't have a
slide to show it here,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.080
but we could easily click on
the users chunk right there

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.540
and we could see exactly the
demographic of the people who

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.747
have made in-app purchases.

00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:19.830
And we can see if they're
parts of other audiences

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.980
we've created too.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.140
But we'll dig more
into that in a minute.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.290
Something I love
Firebase Analytics

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.990
versus other analytics
tools-- so if you've ever

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.090
used Google Analytics,
you probably

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.090
know Google Analytics
tries, in general,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.370
to guess what device you're on.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.550
And this is a core split between
Firebase Analytics and Google

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.105
Analytics.

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:43.912
Firebase Analytics knows for
sure what device you're on.

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:45.370
Google Analytics
can try and guess.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.530
Can try and look at a user
agent and a web browser and say,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.421
well, we think you're
running Windows XP.

00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:52.420
We think you're running
this version of Firefox.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.080
But user agents can lie,
and they can just generally

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.572
be very hard to detect.

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.280
But with Firebase
Analytics, because it's

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.570
built for mobile first, and
because we know mobile devices,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.150
we can build it and we
can make sure we know

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.950
exactly what users are doing.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.700
So we can get really
detailed information.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.908
Like the Android operating
system version, or the iOS

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:11.600
operating system version.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.670
And so we see not only who
is using our app today,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.850
but how have they changed.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.320
And we break this down.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.950
So if I have 100
million users in India,

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.690
and 50 million users in the US,
and I know that 5% of my users

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.510
are running an ancient
version of Android.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.140
Just something abysmally
old, and I'm thinking

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.720
of not supporting them anymore.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.320
That's a blind decision to make.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.600
I don't know how many of
my users in each country

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.870
are going to be impacted
I could just wildly guess

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.430
that 5% in the US and 5%
in India will be affected.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.780
But with this, with
this information,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.764
we can dive into that.

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:46.180
And we can say,
all right, show me

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.840
the users who are running
the old Android version.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.590
Show me what country they're in.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.090
And then, based on
that information,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.980
it's really easy to make that
decision in an informed way.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.740
So now we can say yes, this user
is indeed on an old version.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.710
And Interestingly enough, all of
his friends are on old versions

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.210
too.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.751
In fact some huge
percentage of India

00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:06.810
is on an old version of Android.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.390
So if I make this decision to
stop supporting this version,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.100
it's going to hurt
me in India, but not

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.520
really impact my US market.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.870
And these are the important
types of business decisions

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.744
we can make with a really
good analytics tool

00:12:17.744 --> 00:12:21.550
like Firebase Analytics.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.630
Beyond that, beyond
the data that you get.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.740
Like, we get data
from you, right?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.137
You get data about
your users, report it

00:12:28.137 --> 00:12:30.560
to Firebase Analytics, and
you can-- that's great.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.430
But there is
something about Google

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.530
which is that it's
kind of magical.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.899
Google is an amazing company
that knows a lot about people.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.440
That's how we build
great products is

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.804
by understanding the people
who use our products.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.970
And we have a lot of
information about those people,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.344
because we really
care about them

00:12:46.344 --> 00:12:49.302
and want to make sure that what
we're doing fits their needs.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:50.760
And we want to
share that with you.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.760
So part of Firebase Analytics
is insight about your users

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.550
that they did not necessarily
provide through your app.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.760
So for example, if I go in
and I sign up for your app

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.140
and I'm just me, you might
get an email address from me,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.814
and you might be able to guess,
oh this is his Twitter profile,

00:13:07.814 --> 00:13:08.798
or whatever.

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:11.580
But you won't know who I am,
you won't know how old I am,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.230
you won't know what
my interests are.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.960
But because we can enrich
the data we get from your app

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.000
with Google data, you can
get all sorts of information.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.690
So we know where that
person's located,

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.981
we can know what their
interests are, how old they are,

00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:26.970
what there gender is, because
Google has the ability

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.340
to enrich your data.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.230
So you get that extra
sprinkle of Google magic

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.460
on top of an already great
Firebase Analytics tool.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.200
And this mixing is
really what we're

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.741
trying to do with
Firebase Analytics,

00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:41.190
is provide something
that's kind of magical.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.655
You don't have to say
what are your interests?

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:45.820
I'm curious if your
interests are aligned

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.102
with what I think they are.

00:13:47.102 --> 00:13:49.060
But we have that data
coming in, because Google

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.430
can share that with you.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.025
So what happens if we go beyond?

00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:54.400
Because this is
the simple usage.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.070
[INAUDIBLE] One to zero lines
of code to get all that benefit.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.560
What is the next step for us?

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.879
Well it's logging custom events.

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:05.359
Now a custom event
can be anything.

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:07.150
In this case, choosing
an ice cream flavor.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.649
Why?

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:08.950
Because I love ice cream.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.940
But in reality it
could be anything.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.020
It could be just a
[INAUDIBLE] that says hey,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.340
I joined a newsletter.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.270
Or it could be
something very specific,

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.690
like I selected my favorite
flavor of ice cream.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.990
In this case it's
vanilla in a cone.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.326
And that's actually true.

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:24.310
That's delicious.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.060
If we look at this,
once we log that event

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.160
it shows up in the
Firebase dashboard.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.630
We can go in and see how
many times these events are

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.380
occurring, how [INAUDIBLE]
to how many events

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.790
were occurring yesterday.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.490
All sorts of
insights [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.430
We also have the
ability over here

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.200
to mark it as a
conversion event.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.410
And once we mark an event
as a conversion event,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.264
that means it's out end goal.

00:14:48.264 --> 00:14:50.430
So in this case we have a
bunch of different events,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.534
like the achievements page,
viewed by the app install,

00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:54.950
the app updated,
things like that.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.680
We might send out a push
notification, for example.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.800
And the goal of that
push notification

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.910
might be to get you
to try a new feature.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.120
So we might mark that tried new
feature event as a conversion

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.620
event.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.005
And once we do that
we can go and get

00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:11.348
a whole bunch of insight
about that conversion event,

00:15:11.348 --> 00:15:12.806
because we've marked
it as an event

00:15:12.806 --> 00:15:13.889
that we really care about.

00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:14.656
That is our goal.

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:17.030
So we can create funnels and
other complicated analytical

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.080
things based off of that
to track if we're actually

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.371
getting to our goal once we've
decided what that goal is.

00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.112
So you click on one
of these events.

00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:28.820
One of these custom
events we're logging.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.580
We get a bunch of
interesting information.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.190
We get how often does it happen
over time, how many users

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.339
are doing it, how many times
per user is it happening?

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:39.380
And then we have this
interesting thing over here

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.960
called value, which is just
zero and a straight line.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.660
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.515
But for a simple event
you'll get all of is.

00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:50.610
And also, of course, you get
that enriched data from Google.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.360
So it's not just users
triggered this event.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.640
It's all of your female users
in Brazil triggered this event.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.140
And that's so much
more interesting.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.220
That's so much more
compelling if you

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.600
know who these people are.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.150
Because now it's
not just like, oh,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.900
a lot more people are
trying this feature.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.785
But we know for some
reason it's connecting

00:16:07.785 --> 00:16:08.660
with a certain group.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.120
So if you're interested
in retargeting that group,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.040
making sure they come
back to your app,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.740
you know have the
insight to do that.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.492
And here's us filtering that
same event of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:20.780
page views based on gender.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.405
And this is what I'm
talking about when

00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:24.080
I say we can slice
and dice the data,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.100
and look at it in a
bunch of cool ways.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.140
So we see now we're just
seeing the subset of users

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.110
who are female.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.070
But we could do it by country,
or age, or anything like that.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.770
Now we get into the
two types, and we

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.048
get into explaining that
value line that I explained

00:16:41.048 --> 00:16:43.075
was something I'd explain later.

00:16:43.075 --> 00:16:45.000
And we have two types
of events that happen.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.950
One is a Boolean event.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.750
It happens or it doesn't.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.330
So I'm joining the news letter.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.070
That is something that happens.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.900
So there's not really
any interesting data

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.210
to record with that.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.960
We just know that I
joined the newsletter.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.450
But If I do something
like view a painting,

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.750
I want to record a bunch
of different information

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.080
about that painting viewing.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.319
I want to know what
was the painting ID?

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.950
What painting did I see?

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.910
What artist made that painting?

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:09.970
What was the zoom level?

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.403
Maybe I should increase
the average zoom

00:17:12.403 --> 00:17:13.270
on all my paintings.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.930
I need to know all
this information

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.510
to make an informed decision.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.950
But there's even more then this.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.165
This is all great, and this is
stuff I want to have access to.

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:25.140
But I can also record
this value property.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.573
And the value property
is something arbitrary.

00:17:27.573 --> 00:17:31.430
In this case it could
be the amount of seconds

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.460
I spent on the picture.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.990
I spent 84 seconds
staring at this picture.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.750
And now, when I go
back into my dashboard,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.800
it will chart that value
as the core integer metric

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.500
that I'm interested in.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.810
So it gets a bunch
of interesting data.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.970
And sometimes it'll show
up in different formats.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.230
In this case, we're
tracking a level up.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.510
So we just want to know--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.431
we're reporting
a level up event,

00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:56.930
and we're saying,
all right, we want

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.700
to know what level people are.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.132
And it's showing up as
a histogram type thing,

00:18:01.132 --> 00:18:03.590
where we can easily see that
the vast majority of our users

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.180
are level two to 20.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.430
We have some who are
20 to 39, etc etc.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.460
And that's coming from
that special value event.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.370
And it doesn't have
to be in a histogram.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.995
Not all data makes
sense in this chart.

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:17.340
So If we were reporting
virtual goods sales.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.940
Imagine we had virtual
goods, like a single player

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.470
game, or a social game.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.286
Whatever these virtual goods
someone might be purchasing

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:24.786
are.

00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:27.580
In addition to in-app purchase
data, which we get for free,

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.240
we can record this
specific data.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.190
So we can see the value for
this virtual good purchase

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.102
event is this.

00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:36.352
And we can make it show up
in a really wonderful table

00:18:36.352 --> 00:18:38.780
like this, and can see
that the vast majority

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.183
of our virtual goods
are a single player

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:44.050
games that are being sold.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.390
And then, of course, with that
we get all the enriched data

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.880
and cool charting that you would
get with any other Firebase

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.320
event.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:00.740
So that's great, but
these are just actions,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.870
Knowing what a person is
doing isn't a complete story.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:09.000
We need to know who a person
is in order to truly enhance

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
the experience for them.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.450
We need to know what they
like, and what their goals are.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.650
And we need to know who
else is like them, so we

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.952
can predict what they'll need.

00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:19.160
So imagine we have this guy,
and he has a whole bunch

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.470
of different facets.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.060
As a person, like any person,
he has a fitness goal,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.890
he has a way he
pronounces gif, he

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.220
has his favorite food, and
his favorite musical genre.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.280
And all this information
is just custom information

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.190
that you can add to your app.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.405
So if you need to know
favorite musical genre,

00:19:37.405 --> 00:19:39.690
you can add what we
call a user property.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.880
And once you add
that user property

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.360
it enriches the data you
have about your users,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.282
and your ability to bucket them,
and filter them, and like I

00:19:47.282 --> 00:19:49.380
said, enhance the experience.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.865
So lets say we go and we
add in a user property

00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:58.078
And we add favorite
food, for example.

00:19:58.078 --> 00:20:00.077
And we just said your
favorite food is some type

00:20:00.077 --> 00:20:01.286
of food, whatever they enter.

00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:03.077
Now we'll have the
ability start filtering.

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:04.690
So favorite food
can be anything.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.315
You'll notice in
these slides there are

00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:07.720
a bunch of different examples.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.330
Sometimes I'll
say, oh look, we're

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.040
setting a property
called favorite food,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.831
and then the next slide
we're talking about

00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:14.090
is there favorite color pink?

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.110
And the reason I do
this is to show you

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.720
how versatile this system is.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.956
If you're selling food,
you can record about it,

00:20:20.956 --> 00:20:22.330
and you can make
insight on that.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.540
If you're selling
virtual goods, there's

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.540
insight to be had there.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.970
If you're selling
carpeting, or whatever,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.010
there's always something
interesting to know

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.010
about your user, so you
can start bucketing them

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.470
in more efficient ways.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.990
So here's another example
related to painting.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.390
If we went, and we added
a custom user property,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.170
we'd go into the
console and we'd say,

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.170
all right, I'm going to
add a new user property.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.106
The property in this
painting style, and we

00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:46.170
add a little description.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.410
And this is just so
Firebase Analytics

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.400
knows it should show
up in your dashboard,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.164
and want's to see day that
this is being recorded,

00:20:52.164 --> 00:20:54.080
and you want to be able
to view it So we go in

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.996
and create it in here.

00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:57.590
And then once It's
created we can

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.700
create an audience using that.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.080
So in this example we
want to make an audience.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080
We want to make a
group of our users who

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.040
are female Canadian shoppers
who are fans of [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.920
Now that's a pretty
specific group.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.920
And if we say something
to that group.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.360
If we had a push notification.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.770
If we change the
background of the app

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.340
to be their favorite painter,
we change this or that,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.240
we can really enrich
their experience.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.770
And they might not even
know that we're doing it.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.210
They might now know that
this app is shifting around

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.473
and changed just to
connect with them.

00:21:29.473 --> 00:21:31.556
But they'll feel more
affected, and they'll engage

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.681
better because we did this.

00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:34.222
So here we see we're
pulling together

00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:35.850
a bunch of different
data that ranges

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.400
from that in-app purchase,
that built in event.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.080
Have they ever made
an in-app purchase?

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.871
And we say [INAUDIBLE]
is bigger than zero,

00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:44.405
so yes, they have at some
point made an in-app purchase.

00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:46.210
Then we go and we use
that enriched Google.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.590
And we say all right, if
their age range is 18 to 24,

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.036
24 to 35.

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:52.830
So that's the magic of Google.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.240
Then we'll check the country.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.500
Also magical Google.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.840
So we'll say all right,
you are from Canada.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.090
And then off, we'll use
that custom user property.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.420
And we'll say you
specified you favorite

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.770
and said that was Raphael.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.835
And now we have a
really complete idea

00:22:06.835 --> 00:22:08.842
of who this person is.

00:22:11.638 --> 00:22:15.020
Once we have a person, though,
that's-- this is where most

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.586
analytics products stop.

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.580
They give you an idea
of who someone is,

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.290
and then they just stop.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.560
And they say, all right,
do something with it.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.020
Like, take the
next step yourself.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.080
And this is what really
makes Firebase amazing is

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.110
that we connect you into
other Firebase products

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.680
so that it's not
just information.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.380
It's something you can act on.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.560
So imagine we use
Firebase Remote Config.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.830
And Remote Config is just a way
to set values in the clouds,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.945
have your device receive
them, and then change

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:48.270
those values based on arbitrary
metrics that you set up.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.410
So if I want to change
a message of the day.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.940
This might be a
banner that shows up

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.196
on the top of the app,
something like that.

00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:57.590
By default we'll use
this value down here.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.080
"Remember, every day is the
first step to a better you."

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.410
That's a great slogan
for fitness folk.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:07.100
But if you're in the runners
category, the runners audience,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.690
and you specify it
there, we're going

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.540
to give you a message that
directly relates to running.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.340
And this is a small
change, like I said.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.720
But this could be anything.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.650
This could be colors,
this could be pictures,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.660
it could be huge
[INAUDIBLE] text.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.371
It could even be
features in your app

00:23:19.371 --> 00:23:22.030
that are only enabled
for certain audiences.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.620
As soon as we set this up
it's now completely automated.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.496
So if a new user comes in
and they're doing things,

00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:29.600
and they eventually get
flagged as a runner,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.600
or a female purchaser in Canada
between the correct ages,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.790
they will see their experience
shifting around them

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.160
as your app starts
to know them better.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.850
As they get bucketed
more successfully

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.700
you'll get a better and
richer experience for them

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.332
And since action is just
happening magically,

00:23:47.332 --> 00:23:49.310
without you going in
and actually changing

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.007
anything or flipping any flags.

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:52.840
Once this is set up,
it's just an experience

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.150
that naturally hones itself,
and fine tines itself

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.446
for your users.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.800
Another example of this
isn't just passive changes.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.966
Like, those are great.

00:24:03.966 --> 00:24:06.215
If we can tweak the app and
make it better for a user,

00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:07.390
that's fantastic.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.080
But what if we want to say
something to those users?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.720
We want to really reach out
and say something specifically

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.580
to them to get some [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.949
If we think, for example,
Australian purchasers.

00:24:16.949 --> 00:24:18.990
We have an audience of
just everyone in Australia

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.972
who every purchases
something form us.

00:24:20.972 --> 00:24:22.680
We want to send them
a push notification.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.200
We want to say, hey, we're
going to give you a [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.890
If you were using GCM,
Goggle Cloud Messaging,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.890
or a different push service,
sending a push notification

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.910
to a specific
group would require

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.580
an entire other set of tools.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.470
You'd need different
tooling just

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.780
to send a push notification
that hopefully integrated

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.256
with your analytics tool.

00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:43.070
Maybe it didn't,
it'd be a huge pain.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.670
With Firebase, it's
built right in.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.711
So we can use the Firebase
notifications console.

00:24:46.711 --> 00:24:48.780
Go in here, Say we're
going to compose a new push

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.360
notification, send it
to a user segment that

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.930
is that Australian
purchasers, and it will just

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.110
automatically handle all of
that looking up of ID tokens.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.616
Everything you'd have to do
in GCM, or a traditional push

00:25:00.616 --> 00:25:01.532
notification solution.

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:03.496
We just handle it for you.

00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:05.290
And something very
subtle on this slide

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.170
that you might not even
notice is down here,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.692
the conversion event.

00:25:08.692 --> 00:25:10.280
So our goal here
is to get people

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.670
to make an in-app purchase.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.341
So we're sending
out this $5 promo,

00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:15.090
we're sending it to
Australian purchasers,

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.410
and our goal is to get
them to buy our thing.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.010
And we'll tap this
[INAUDIBLE] that's

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.890
created that uses the built
in Firebase notifications

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.646
event in the core.

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:29.110
But It goes beyond
Firebase in the core,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.390
because Firebase
is part of Google

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.790
It's part of this whole
gigantic, amazing company

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.350
of tools and products.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.960
So if we stopped
at just Firebase,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.490
we'd be missing half of
the opportunity here.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.000
So Firebase will
actually integrate.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.064
Firebase Analytics will
integrate with Adwords.

00:25:46.064 --> 00:25:47.855
So there's a lot of
things you can do here.

00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:49.730
But as just an
example, if I wanted

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.720
to target those
Australian purchasers,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.170
and say my push
notification pretty well.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.240
People really seemed
to engage with that.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.710
But I want to see if I can get
more of those type of people

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.210
back.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.710
I want to get them
back into my app.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.810
You can import your
audiences into Adwords

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.000
and target those
people specifically

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.165
with remarketing campaigns.

00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:08.575
So you can say hey,
we really appreciate

00:26:08.575 --> 00:26:10.700
that you bought that in-app
purchase, why don't you

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.730
come back?

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.985
And so this reaches
outside of Firebase

00:26:13.985 --> 00:26:19.310
into other services, like
Google Cloud and Adwords,

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.110
and all these other
Google properties.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.104
Because we know that it's all
when it's connected together.

00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:26.020
And this is just a
philosophy inside Firebase,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.739
and if you use one feature it's
good, us a bunch it's great.

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:30.530
If you use the whole
suite and integrate it

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.490
with all parts of Google,
you're basically unstoppable.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.160
Let's talk, speaking of the
extended Google ecosystem,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.790
about Google Analytics.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.010
How many people have ever
used Google Analytics?

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.926
[INAUDIBLE] of people?

00:26:44.926 --> 00:26:45.900
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.400
Most people have used
Google Analytics.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.790
It's been around
for a long time.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.934
Most websites, probably in the
world, use Google Analytics.

00:26:53.934 --> 00:26:56.790
Don't quote me on that, I'm
not 100% sure that's true.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.380
But it's very, very popular.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.831
And it's easy to wonder how
do these compare and contrast?

00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.830
Why would I use Firebase
versus Google Analytics

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.120
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.800
So some key points about
Firebase Analytics.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.200
Why do we care about
Firebase Analytics?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.650
One, it's free.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.220
It's actually free, and
it is actually unlimited.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.560
Almost every other
analytics offering

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.730
is going to cost
you a lot of money.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.610
You'll pay by user, or
you'll pay by the number

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.010
of events logged, or whatever.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.200
Firebase Analytics
isn't it like.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.770
It is completely
free whether you

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.310
have 10 users, or 10 million,
or some other gigantic number.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.060
And we prove that.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.655
Many top partners use
Firebase Analytics,

00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:36.930
and we charge none of them.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.155
We also focus in Firebase
Analytics on events and users.

00:27:41.155 --> 00:27:42.750
So some other
analytics offerings

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.970
will focus more on
page flow, if they

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.806
were coming from the web world.

00:27:46.806 --> 00:27:49.480
Firebase Analytics is about
understanding users, enriching

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.460
your information
about those users,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.145
and understanding
what they're doing.

00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:54.670
So it's just a
different philosophy

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.450
about how to look at your users.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.825
Then, Firebase
Analytics integrates

00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:01.290
with the rest of Firebase.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:01.790
Obviously.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.555
This is what we've been
talking about this whole time.

00:28:03.555 --> 00:28:05.395
The value of
Firebase Analytics is

00:28:05.395 --> 00:28:07.870
that it goes beyond
Firebase Analytics

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.870
and goes into all these
other Firebase features.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.630
This is something
no other analytics

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.630
tool can do because very
few of other suites of tools

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.210
have any offering even close
to the quality of Firebase,

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.468
with so many different
features that reach

00:28:20.468 --> 00:28:22.140
into so many parts of your app.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.820
And then lastly,
this is the only one

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.403
of these that may not be super
positive in your mind, which is

00:28:26.403 --> 00:28:28.375
that Firebase is mobile only.

00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:31.250
And the reason Firebase
Analytics is mobile

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:36.120
only is because we didn't
want to do a solution that was

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.430
OK for web and OK for mobile.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.330
We knew that mobile was a
fundamentally different problem

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:42.930
then web.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.230
So if we made an analytics
solution that worked OK

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.065
in both situations, we wouldn't
be doing anything innovative.

00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:51.440
We wouldn't be
changing anything.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.670
So we said we're not
going to focus on web.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.680
We're going to build the
absolute best analytics

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.340
offering for mobile, and we're
going to do it only on mobiles.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.680
Unless we can come up with a
way to do something equally

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.160
good on web, which
we feel like we've

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.654
already done with
Google Analytics.

00:29:06.654 --> 00:29:10.520
So with Google Analytics
it is mobile and web.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.795
You can use Google
Analytics on mobile,

00:29:12.795 --> 00:29:15.000
but it's not a
natural situation.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.500
Over the years
Google Analytics has

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.116
evolved from something
that records page views,

00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:20.490
to something that
records events,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.046
and the events are
mostly all page views.

00:29:23.046 --> 00:29:25.785
So you can record
custom evens in mobile,

00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:27.660
and there are some
SDKs to do it.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.240
I But it's nowhere near
as natural and as powerful

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.530
as Firebase Analytics.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.780
Google Analytics
is also just old.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.820
It is very, very mature, and
it has really good support

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.500
for specialized reporting.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.710
If you want to do
very specific things,

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.500
visualize very specific
flows through your app,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.920
is something Google
Analytics can do.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.846
And this is really,
really powerful.

00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:52.720
You can do these types
of things in Firebase,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.261
but right now it's
a bit more manual.

00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:56.210
You have to export
it to another tools,

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.130
like data studio
that Google offers,

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.520
and build these
reports up there.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.580
But Google Analytics
has it built in.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.650
Google Analytics
also has a paid tier.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.483
And I personally don't
know the exact dollar

00:30:07.483 --> 00:30:10.760
value of the paid tier, but
this is very, very high.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.320
You're doing good
until you hit that,

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.310
and then it gets
super, super expensive.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.270
And is because at
that level you get

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.960
dedicated support and an SOA.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.910
Now we have SOAs on Firebase,
but the dedicated support,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.110
the ability to interact one on
one with someone inside Google,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.750
is not something Firebase
Analytics offers today.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.240
So, if you need that.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.150
If you really wanted a
dedicated account manager,

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.690
Google Analytics
does offer that.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.150
So if we're building
a mobile app today.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.090
Just a mobile app, not a
cross platform experience.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.510
Just an iOS and Android app, we
should use Firebase Analytics.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.400
It is really just
generally better

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.690
for doing mobile app analytics.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.395
If we're building just
a web experience today

00:30:53.395 --> 00:30:55.240
we should still use
Google Analytics.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.840
This thing's been
around forever.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.381
There's a reason
people still use it.

00:30:57.381 --> 00:30:58.800
It's an amazing product.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.600
So if you're building just a
web app, use Google Analytics.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.270
But what if we're building both?

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.160
What if we're
building an app that

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.540
is really important
we understand

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.440
our users between the platforms,
regardless of where they're at.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.035
What do we do?

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:12.310
We use both,

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.205
And this immediately
just seems kind of weird.

00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:16.490
Why would we use both?

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.417
They're different
products, I just

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:19.208
spent all this time
explaining that they're

00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:20.340
very different products.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.920
But we put a bunch of
effort into making sure

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.340
that Firebase Analytics feels
good with Google Analytics,

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.200
to the extent that
Firebase Analytics can

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.257
export all of its data
to Google Analytics.

00:31:31.257 --> 00:31:33.715
So you have all these events,
all these interesting things,

00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:35.350
all this insight on your user.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.420
You can export that
into Google Analytics

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.850
and mix it in with
all of your web data.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.616
So you can track
the same users right

00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:45.700
form mobile into your existing
Google Analytics web stuff.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.840
So there's a really huge
amount of opportunity

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.398
there for enriching the
data you already have,

00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:52.400
and connecting your
mobile experience back

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.522
with your web one.

00:31:54.522 --> 00:31:55.980
So to wrap up what
we talked about.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.260
We talked about how to get
started with two lines of code.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.642
We talked about how to
get all that benefit out

00:32:02.642 --> 00:32:03.725
of all that built in data.

00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:07.704
The Google magic of the built in
events, and the enriched data.

00:32:07.704 --> 00:32:10.120
We talked about logging events,
which are one method call.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.520
So another line of code there.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.680
And we talked about
Google Analytics

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.850
and Firebase Analytics.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.310
How to decide between them.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.470
Take away there was
Google Analytics

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.560
for web, Firebase
Analytics for mobile.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.340
And then we did this wrap up.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.970
So some links for you.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.040
Go to firebase.google.cn
for general documentation

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.880
about this.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.330
More information.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.232
And for Firebase Analytics
specifically, it will--

00:32:35.232 --> 00:32:36.940
well, firebase.google.cn
will pretty much

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.090
get you there anyway because it
is very important for Firebase.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.190
But if you're interested
only in analytics,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.470
you can go to
[INAUDIBLE] /analytics.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.380
And the last thing I
really want to push

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.040
is at Google we care a
ton about open source.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.020
A lot of my job is
writing open source code.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.560
A lot of my coworkers jobs
is writing open source code.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.060
So if you're
interested in what it's

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.090
like to build software inside
of Google, what type of code

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.130
we write.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.555
Spoiler, it's kind
of OK sometimes.

00:33:05.555 --> 00:33:08.784
But we always make it a
lot better as we progress.

00:33:08.784 --> 00:33:10.450
That's why we develop
in the open a lot,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.890
because we love getting feedback
from people smarter then us.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.306
So all of this, all of this
awesome stuff we're building--

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:18.600
Firebase alone has about 90 open
source projects of all sorts

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.040
of things, ranging
from scholar code

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.085
that we used as part of
the [INAUDIBLE] database

00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:25.480
at some point, to
the integrations

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.950
with different
services, and tools,

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.699
and apps, and stuff
we built, for example.

00:33:28.699 --> 00:33:31.750
So if you're interested in any
of that you can either go check

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.183
out my Github, or the Firebase
Github, at github.com/firebase.

00:33:35.183 --> 00:33:38.090
With that, thanks for coming,
and if you have any questions

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.210
feel free to just grab me after,
and I'm happy to talk about it.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:34:01.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:18.469
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.560
INTERPRETER: So if I
already published app

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.224
and I start to use
Firebase, will Firebase just

00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:28.270
come to new users,
or all the users

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.122
will be able to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:30.122 --> 00:34:32.580
ABE HASKINS: If you don't have
Firebase Analytics installed

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.687
when you initially
publish you're app

00:34:34.687 --> 00:34:37.399
you won't get any
data from those users.

00:34:37.399 --> 00:34:39.580
So you'll have to
enable it form the

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.880
get go to start
collecting information

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.850
on every single user.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:59.610
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.750
INTERPRETER: I have a question
about the user properties.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.300
How do identify that
a [INAUDIBLE] is

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.740
interested in Raphael painting?

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.889
How do you get that information?

00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:10.680
ABE HASKINS: That's
the type of information

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.200
that's up to your app to get.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.730
So you could prompt
the user and say,

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.060
what is your favorite painting?

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.610
Or you could get that through
looking at their activity

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.220
and saying, all right, this
person really likes paintings

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.340
from this person, I'm
going to mark them

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.540
as having this interest.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.450
But we leave that pretty
open to the developer

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.029
to collect that type of
information about their

00:35:30.029 --> 00:35:30.529
user.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.272
AUDIENCE: So I have been using
Firebase for a long time.

00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:43.470
In our product we can only see
the data over a period of time,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.950
but you can not see
the data [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.540
divided by everyday.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.630
So I just want to know
when the [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.650
ABE HASKINS: So you
were saying you only see

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.096
a subset of your data?

00:35:56.096 --> 00:35:57.542
Or you can only see [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:57.542 --> 00:36:01.398
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but I cannot see the data

00:36:01.398 --> 00:36:02.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.800
ABE HASKINS: Oh,
so you can't see it

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.090
on any daily level
of granularity.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:07.410
That's a good question.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.000
I'm assuming that's
something we're working on.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.289
The amount of work
being done on Analytics

00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:14.080
in terms of improving
the console and stuff

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.374
is just absolutely [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:15.374 --> 00:36:17.374
So I don't know specifically
when that's coming,

00:36:17.374 --> 00:36:19.560
but I know everything
related to the dashboard

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.143
and the console for
Firebase Analytics

00:36:21.143 --> 00:36:24.800
is hugely high priority
for us to really get right.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.390
So I'm guess it's in the
works, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.265
AUDIENCE: My suggestion,
you haven't [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:33.766
engineer [INAUDIBLE]
Firebase [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:33.766 --> 00:36:35.230
ABE HASKINS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:41.931 --> 00:36:43.430
All right, awesome,
Thanks everyone.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:44.330
Appreciate it.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.180
[APPLAUSE]
