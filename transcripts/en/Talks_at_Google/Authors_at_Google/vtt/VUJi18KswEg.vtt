MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.120
to "Talks at Google" in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.270
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Dr. Damon Tweedy.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.075
Dr. Tweedy is a graduate of
Duke Medical School where

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.584
his first day was
uncomfortably exciting,

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:29.310
but not in a good Google
way, Yale Law School.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.354
He is Assistant Professor of
Psychiatry at Duke University

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:36.266
Medical School and staff
physician at the Durham VA

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.138
Medical Center.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.730
He is the author of
one of the most talked

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.550
about books of
this season and one

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.080
of my favorite
books of the year,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.500
"Black Man in a White Coat:
A Doctor's Reflections

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.870
on Race and Medicine."

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.942
Writing this book is part
of his ongoing effort

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:56.890
to honor the pioneering
work of black physicians

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.758
of previous generations
by giving to the community

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:02.670
as they have done.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.739
Dr. Tweedy's
training and practice

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.985
has shown him the
challenges faced

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.815
by black doctors and
the health burdens faced

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:15.040
by black patients, why being
black is bad for your health.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.144
Along the way he's overcome
his own biases, as well as

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:22.853
those from physicians and
patients of all colors.

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:26.560
He's here today to share
with us what he's learned

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.028
and his suggestions for
how we might move forward

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:33.580
with better treatment and more
compassionate care for all.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.833
Please join me in
welcoming Dr. Damon Tweedy.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.791
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.791
DAMON TWEEDY: Thank you.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.120
Thank you.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.740
Thanks for everyone
for coming today.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.500
Yeah, so it's funny
to hear Google.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.090
My first thought
when I here Google

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.130
is that I have this sort
of connection to Google.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.100
Sergey Brin is
actually from Maryland,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.440
and briefly we've attended
the same high school,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.790
actually, and in the
same magnet program.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.540
I'll tell you a little
bit more about that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.581
when I tell you my story.

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.210
And we didn't actually
know each other.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.001
Maybe I should've picked
my friends better.

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.005
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:12.680
But yeah.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.890
So I'll tell you a little
more about that high school,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.098
because that's really an
important part of my journey

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:18.200
as to who I am today.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.700
OK.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.024
So this is the book.

00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:21.690
Here's the cover of
the book, "Black Man

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.870
a White Coat: A
Doctor's Reflections

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.940
on Race and Medicine."

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.100
So I guess the first
thought is that there's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.516
so many books out there, so
why should you read this book?

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.810
What's in it for you?

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.020
Race is all over the news.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.410
You hear about
race all the time.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.840
It's often talked about
in law enforcement.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.101
It's talked about in
crime and punishment.

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:41.350
Those are the areas we hear
it talk about so much now.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.580
But race is also an
important issue in medicine.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.550
It's an important issue
in medicine as well.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.260
And I wanted to give you a
quote from Martin Luther King

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.880
Jr. It was in 1966.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.250
And this is just sort
of to set the framework.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.560
So this is 1966, two years
after the Civil Rights

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.560
Act had passed, one year
after the Voting Rights

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.660
Act had passed.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.700
And his quote was, "Of all
the forms of inequality,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.880
injustice in health
is the most shocking

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.859
and the most inhumane."

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.650
To me, that speaks to
this idea that health

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160
is so important to all of
us, vital to all of us.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.940
I think he also was
getting to this idea

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.570
that health is about more
than simply the health

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.960
care and the medical treatment,
and so many other factors

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.320
in society also
influence health.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.060
So there are really two ways
that the book approaches

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.760
this issue.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.932
One is about the issue of
African American patients

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:25.640
and their health.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.615
And there are all sorts
of health disparities

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:28.990
that are out there,
and I'm going

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.880
to talk a little bit about
that in a few minutes.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.879
And then there's also
there's another experience

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.720
about being an African American
physician and being one of few.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.900
So nationwide, about
4% of all physicians

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.055
are African American.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.630
The population of African
American is about 13%.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.310
And in some
specialties-- it varies

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.540
depending on the medical
specialty that you're

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.740
in-- it can be 1% or 2%.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.970
It just depends on the field.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.407
So you're really
kind of out there.

00:03:52.407 --> 00:03:54.240
You're really sort of
isolated in many ways.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.290
And so the book really
explores those two areas.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.520
So I set the framework
using the quote from King

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.060
about race in society,
but this is really

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.160
very much more personal story.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.227
So many years ago-- he mentioned
that I went to Yale Law School.

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:09.810
And maybe years ago
I may have written

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.630
a book that was much more
policy-oriented solutions.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.840
Let's attack these problems,
data-driven, solution-driven.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.690
This is very much
a personal story.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.720
This is very much
how I came at it.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.350
I enjoy books by doctors,
and so many of the books

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.730
that I read going through
medical school and my training,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.420
so few of them talked
about race at all.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.711
And when they did mention
race, it was only in passing.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:31.830
But it was such an
important issue to me,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.660
and I wanted to give voice
to this other perspective

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.560
out there.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480
So some of the people
who have-- so my book

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.020
has gotten really
good reception.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.120
I've actually really
been overwhelmed

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.800
by the positive attention
that I've gotten.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.341
Media coverage, all those things
that I never really imagined

00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.800
when I first got started.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.270
But it has had some criticism.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.686
And the criticism
that I've gotten

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:53.200
is specifically about that, that
it's not policy-oriented, not

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080
solution-driven.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.789
But I do talk about
many of those issues.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.579
But even though that's
not the focus of it,

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:01.030
I still think there's a lot
to learn from this book.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.710
I'm using my own story and
the stories of other people

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.650
that I've seen, patients.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.870
And I think there's
a lot of ways

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.036
that we can learn from that.

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:08.339
And people can come up
with their own answers.

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.880
So that's really kind of where
I'm coming from in this story.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.570
But we will talk about some
of the more concrete stuff

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.530
as well.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.020
So I think since I set the
framework of this being a very

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.460
personal story, I think it's
helpful to know a little bit

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.080
about my background.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.790
So I grew up in Maryland.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.710
And the county's called
Prince George's County.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.420
It's about 10 minutes
east of Washington, DC.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.775
Now it's a predominately
African American county,

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.650
and there's been books
written about it where

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.780
they talk about it as
a very affluent, very

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.690
wealthy community for
African Americans.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.730
Now there is a part of the
county where that's the case,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.521
but that's certainly
not where I came from.

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.810
So I came from the part that's
much closer to the Washington,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.000
DC line.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.185
All black, very segregated,
very working class.

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.560
Really there were
very few models

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.310
of African Americans
in that community who

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.790
succeeded outside of the sports
and kind of entertainment

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.160
around that we're so often
familiar seeing African

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160
Americans succeeding in.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.000
So as far as going
to college, just

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.583
going to college as
a student, I mean,

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:01.620
that was a really alien
concept in the community

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.810
that I grew up in.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.190
Black men were much more
likely to find themselves

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.523
in the criminal justice system
and all those other sorts

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:09.650
of things that we all
to often hear about.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.160
So my parents did
not go to college.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.004
My dad didn't even
finish high school.

00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:16.170
I did have an older brother.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.100
My brother's ten
years older than me.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.040
And he did go to college.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.960
He was one of the first people
in my family to attend college.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.460
Went to the University
of Maryland.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.040
And he was there just
strictly on academics.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.310
And I was just a novel thing.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.250
So for me to have that in
my home was a huge example.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.000
But even still, the
idea of being a doctor

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.480
was something that was
still far beyond what

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.880
I could have ever envisioned.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.100
So in eighth grade I
was in middle school.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.400
A very sort of average, real
average kind of middle school.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.619
90%, 95% African American.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.160
And one day a teacher,
a math teacher

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.701
said, well, you should try and
take this test for this magnet

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:45.890
program.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.110
You might be able to make it.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.522
And my first thought was, no.

00:06:48.522 --> 00:06:49.230
I'm thinking, no.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.730
I'm not going to
be able to do that.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.980
No one I know has done that.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.240
But I took one of the flyers,
and I got into this program.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.810
This is a very great science
technology magnet program.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.184
And this is actually
the same one

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:04.040
that Mr. Brin was in as well.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.630
And so that really kind of
set me on a different path,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.420
in a way.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.412
And I got to see people
with different aspirations

00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:12.370
and things of that sort,
different experiences.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.560
So that's sort of how
I got on the trajectory

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.060
to where I am today.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.409
Now it was an appeal to me.

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:18.450
Like, why being a doctor?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.140
So there was appeal in
science and medicine.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.090
So I was really attracted by the
idea of formulas and equations.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.069
And it was all very objective
and it was sort of concrete.

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.360
So much of life is messy as
an African American person.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.330
Life in general can be messy,
but as an African American,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.620
it can be even more messy.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.172
And so there was
a certain appeal

00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:36.755
that science and medicine held
out for me, that was objective,

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.550
it was concrete.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.640
And I could kind of
escape this other world,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.760
this other reality.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.160
And so that's
really what kind of

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.990
led me on this path
from high school

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.740
through college and
into medical school.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.555
But when I got to
medical school,

00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:51.520
I kind of had a rude awakening.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.620
And so that's really
where the book begins.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.670
it sort of lays that groundwork.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.402
So I did really well
in college, and I

00:07:58.402 --> 00:08:00.360
had a lot of opportunities
for medical schools.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.010
And I ended up ultimately
deciding on Duke.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.926
I was deciding between
Duke and Johns Hopkins,

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:05.940
which was closer to my home.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.844
Duke was at that point
trying to recruit

00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:09.510
more African American
students, and they

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.270
started to offer
scholarships as a way

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.520
to entice African
American students,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.645
because they'd had a long
history of not being able

00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:16.100
to recruit African Americans.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.766
As you can imagine,
it was in the south.

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.370
You can imagine all
the reasons why.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.130
So let me just read
for a few minutes

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.442
the introduction to this
story, because I think

00:08:22.442 --> 00:08:23.610
that really sets the framework.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.210
So I'm coming in.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.920
I told you about my
background, where I come from,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.753
and what I was thinking
when I came to Duke.

00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:30.680
I was hoping I would be able to
come this cardiologist, someone

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.262
who's going to operate,
fix the heart, concrete.

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:35.970
Everything-- that was
sort of my mindset.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.502
And then I got to Duke, and
something else happened.

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:40.210
So let me just read
that introduction to.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.409
It will take about four
minutes, and then I'll

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.690
discuss a little
more after that.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.940
"On a spring morning
in 1997, Jim Harper,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.970
a young man from
Durham, North Carolina,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.220
woke up in his two bedroom
apartment with no clue

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.660
that he would soon
become gravely ill.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.850
The first signs of trouble
seemed innocent enough.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.480
Numbness on the right
side of his face and hand,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.660
easily chalked up to having
slept on that side of his body.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.110
He stumbled as he
got out of bed,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.310
but figured he was simply tired
from the previous day's work.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.980
His fiancee, Regina, asked
if he needed to see a doctor.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.920
He smiled and told her
that she worried too much.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.160
Her anxiety ebbed as
she went off to her job

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.460
at Kmart, only to resurface
when he didn't answer the phone

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.344
during her lunch break.

00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:25.510
When Regina rushed home a
few hours later at the end

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.180
of her shift, she found Jim
sprawled across their bathroom

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.190
floor.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.730
His eyes were wide open,
and he recognized her,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.132
but his words were garbled.

00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:34.590
He couldn't tell
her what was wrong

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.820
or how long he'd been that way.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.187
She frantically dialed 911.

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:41.270
Within a half hour of his
arrival at the emergency

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.380
department, after a neurological
exam and CAT scan of his brain,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.410
it was clear what had happened.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.675
Jim, just a few weeks shy of 40,
had suffered a massive stroke.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:54.050
The doctors learned that Jim
had high blood pressure that

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.000
had been poorly treated,
but nothing else

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.790
to account for his tragic fate.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.570
He had no heart problems,
no aneurysms, no diabetes,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.820
or high cholesterol.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.930
he didn't smoke, really drank,
and avoided street drugs.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.650
Ultimately, as best
they could tell,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.070
Jim mostly had a
lot of bad luck.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.620
About two weeks later, I
stood at the foot of Jim's bed

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.840
at Duke Hospital.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.030
Along with another first
year medical student,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.930
I was shadowing Dr.
Wilson, a neurologist,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.830
as part of a weekly
class that introduced us

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.272
to clinical medicine.

00:10:23.272 --> 00:10:24.730
This was the
highlight of our week,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.555
as it gave us a brief break from
the lecture hall and laboratory

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.180
and provided a peek
at our future lives

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.980
on the hospital wards.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.070
We wore perfectly
knotted ties--"

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.630
as I've tried to today--
"and crisp white coats

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.920
for the occasion, trying
hard to look like the doctors

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.830
we would one day become.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.230
But Jim's future seemed
far less promising.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.390
A big man, he'd once
been a football player.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.810
Now he could not move the
right side of his body.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.435
His face drooped as
saliva dribbled out

00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:50.490
of the corner of his mouth.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.340
Given his lack of
improvement, the doctors

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.780
had begun to doubt he
could make any recovery.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.672
They were preparing to
send him to a facility.

00:10:57.672 --> 00:10:59.380
This place also had
a long-term care unit

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.990
where if he made no
progress, he might

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.280
spend the rest of his life.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.080
'It's a very sad case,' Dr.
Wilson said as we left the room

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.663
and walked to a conference area
to discuss our patient and his

00:11:08.663 --> 00:11:09.272
illness.

00:11:09.272 --> 00:11:11.480
He started by telling us
that stroke was consistently

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.450
one of the top causes of death
and disability in America.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.450
Then he drilled us about
the major risk factors,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.020
going back and forth between
us in a competition of sorts.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.860
In eager medical
student fashion,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.640
we routed off the
usual suspects.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.140
Diabetes, high blood pressure,
heart disease, old age,

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.786
smoking, and high cholesterol."

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:32.780
I ran out of fingers there.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.699
"When it was my turn
again, Dr. Wilson

00:11:34.699 --> 00:11:36.490
indicated that there
was one important risk

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.290
factor we had yet to mention.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.360
He looked at me with
a worried frown.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.480
Come on, his look said.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.460
For you of all people,
this should be easy.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.460
I sighed.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.220
I'd hoped it wouldn't
come to this,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.570
but as I was quickly
learning, it always did.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.120
'Race,' I said, looking
down at my dark hand against

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920
my pristine white coat.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.420
'Our patient is black.'
'Exactly,' Dr. Wilson said,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.610
as if I'd now earned a
top score on my exam.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.160
Some would say that this is the
most important variable of all.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.380
He routed off statistics
about race and stroke.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.420
The risk is twice as
high for blacks compared

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.900
to whites for those over
65, and in younger groups,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.650
such as our patient
here, the ratio

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.810
is more like three to
one, or even four to one.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.710
I'd seen the impact of stroke
on both sides of my family.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.670
When I was 14, my dad's
brother, who would often

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.570
drive five hours each
way on a Saturday just

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.600
to visit us for
a few hours, died

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.660
within days of
collapsing at his home,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.860
putting an abrupt end to his
visits that I always enjoyed.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.670
A few years later, my maternal
grandmother, Grandma Flossie,

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.630
developed dementia from
a series of minor strokes

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.990
that slowly stole her mind
and eventually her body.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.741
Like Jim, both had
high blood pressure.

00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:49.240
'Our patient's other major risk
factor is hypertension,' Dr.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.570
Wilson continued.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.680
'This is also much more
prevalent in blacks.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.382
Nearly twice as common.

00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:56.840
No matter how you slice it,
race is a very big deal when it

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.720
comes to stroke.' Dr. Wilson had
hammered home something I would

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.080
learn time and again,
both at Duke and beyond.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.330
Being black can be
bad for your health."

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.950
So that really
lays the framework.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.290
So I'm coming to
medical school, feeling

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.820
as if I'm escaping this world
and going into a world that's

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.380
objective and concrete.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.872
And during that first year, I
was inundated by these messages

00:13:19.872 --> 00:13:21.830
that there was something
wrong with being black

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.870
in terms of health.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.930
So every time you learn
about a disease-- heart

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.786
disease, diabetes,
cancer-- the professors

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.410
would start with sort
of the biology it

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.304
it, what they call
the pathophysiology

00:13:30.304 --> 00:13:30.970
of the disorder.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.719
And then they would
always kind of go back

00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:34.510
to the end, talk about
the demographics.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.750
Who does it affect?

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.660
And there were always
two statements.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.450
It's more common
in black people,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.990
and black people who get
the disease do much worse.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.690
So those were the
statement they would make.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.670
And so for me the next
question was, why?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.840
And what could be done about it?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.240
And I never seemed
to get answers

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.300
to either of those
questions during that time.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.300
There were just sort
of these statements

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.370
that were made out there.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.467
And not only was it--
these statements-- not only

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:02.300
was there, like, an
intellectual side to it,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.925
but there was this
personal side to it,

00:14:03.925 --> 00:14:06.470
because these are things that
affected me, my own family,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.540
and my actually myself.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.410
And I'll talk about more later.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.710
And so it had great meaning.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.290
So this is really one of the
two main goals of the book,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.700
to really explore
those questions.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.060
Like, what does all this
mean, and why are we

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.770
in this situation?

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.769
So that's one of the two
main goals of the book.

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:18.250
And what I discovered
along the way

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.230
as I started to go
out into the community

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.480
and start to see patients
and get to see-- so I really

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.438
saw that there were,
like, three different ways

00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:25.750
of looking at this problem.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.580
And I talk about
these in the book.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.038
And what I do is I use case
studies of people that actually

00:14:29.038 --> 00:14:31.120
saw in various settings
that illustrate

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.590
with these issues are.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.810
So certainly there's an
issue at the big level,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.220
at the macro level, the
system level, society.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.155
Black people are much more
likely to be uninsured, much

00:14:41.155 --> 00:14:42.780
more likely to live
in communities that

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.840
are segregated, less access
to medical care, primary care

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.340
specialists.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.097
All those things are very true.

00:14:48.097 --> 00:14:49.930
And this has all been
known for a long time.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.388
What I wanted to
do in the book was

00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.335
to sort of use
examples of real people

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:56.110
to illustrate how this
plays out in real life.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.160
And so in medical school, we
one day volunteered at a clinic

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.830
about 90 minutes from campus.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.815
And this is a decent
part of North Carolina.

00:15:04.815 --> 00:15:07.580
The community's 50-50,
half white, half black.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.870
But in this clinic you go
to, everyone there is black.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.444
All black.

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.860
And it's a charity
clinic, so it's

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.160
a clinic for people who can't
afford other health care.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.620
Patients don't have
health insurance.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.860
And it's pretty clear
when you get there

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.070
that you're providing
care, a level of care that

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.974
is in many ways substandard.

00:15:21.974 --> 00:15:23.640
Despite your best
efforts or intentions,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.490
the patients can't
afford medications,

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.910
lab tests, all the usual things
that we take for granted.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.290
Even the site of
it is so different.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.081
You think about the
typical medical clinic.

00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:33.050
So this kind of clinic,
there's no nurse there,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.799
and students are taking
the blood pressure

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:38.180
and doing everything that a
nurse would ordinarily do.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.220
It was a one room house.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.928
I mean, you're not
talking about anything

00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:43.670
that any of us most
likely are experiencing.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.300
And so that really illustrated
sort of the big issue problems

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.234
in a sort of micro way.

00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:50.900
There was another
time a couple of years

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.890
later where I worked in an
inner city emergency room.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.150
So it's sort of
the opposite end.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.525
That one was a
very rural clinic.

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:58.030
This is an inner city emergency
room clinic down in Atlanta.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.170
And there, you saw many of
the same problems again.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.430
Even though Atlanta, even
though the residents-- people

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.620
are living in what seems
like a metropolitan area,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.809
there are ways that they're
cut off from society.

00:16:08.809 --> 00:16:10.350
And it really came
home to me one day

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.310
when we took an ambulance ride.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.830
I was riding with
the paramedics.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.760
And we got a call to go
out to this community.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.480
And it's like you
go off this road,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480
and you're there for,
like, five or ten minutes.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.730
It feels like you're
going into the woods,

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.510
in the wilderness in a way.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.301
It's like a suburb.

00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.640
And then you come into
this really just gruesome,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.090
horrible housing project.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.570
And you just see the
chaos, and you see

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.150
how all that affects health.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.357
And so you see obesity,
violence, addiction.

00:16:34.357 --> 00:16:35.690
Everything's just there for you.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.606
So it was a vivid
illustration, and I describe

00:16:37.606 --> 00:16:39.140
that scene in the book.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.056
I actually describe it
much better than I just

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:42.430
explained to you in the book.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.910
But those are the system
level things that you see,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.367
and how those influence health.

00:16:46.367 --> 00:16:48.950
But then the next layer to that
is the doctor and the patient,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.300
and how they get together,
how they get along or don't.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.340
And how issues like
trust and communication,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.930
bias, all these things
impact health care.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.160
And so in this part of the
book, I use other examples.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.560
So there's one
example of a gentleman

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.512
that I mentioned where he comes
to a hospital with chest pain,

00:17:07.512 --> 00:17:08.970
and seems to have
medical problems,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.500
but winds up
leaving the hospital

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.589
with a psychiatric diagnosis,
which was really unusual.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.655
And the book really explores
how that happened in a real way.

00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:20.357
And so how what seemed
like a concrete issue

00:17:20.357 --> 00:17:21.940
became something
completely different.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.700
And I also talk about a
situation where I was a patient

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.790
and had a similar
type of experience,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.180
where I went in one day to a
clinic dressed very casually,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.860
and I was perceived one way,
in a less than favorable way.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.890
And then once it was made
aware that I was a doctor,

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.040
then everything changed.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.350
Sort of like being two
different people at one time.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.500
So those are just
examples in the book

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.291
of how these things
can play out and affect

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:44.390
health care in real ways.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.085
Then there's this other piece.

00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:47.460
So we talked about
the system, we

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.440
talked about the
doctor and the patient.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.120
But then there's the person
themselves and what they do,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.336
what they eat, all the
daily things of life

00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:54.710
and how that
affects your health.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.142
And so here in the book, I
use a couple of examples.

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.600
There was one time where I saw
two different patients, very

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.300
similar backgrounds, but one was
able to make the kind of health

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.439
choices that led
to a good outcome,

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:06.480
and one was the opposite.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.560
And I explore the reasons
why and ways in which

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.691
choices are influenced
by all sorts of things.

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:13.690
Family, surroundings, all
those sorts of things.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.180
So I explore that.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.180
I also talk about it from
my own personal level.

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:20.715
Early in medical school, I
was diagnosed with high blood

00:18:20.715 --> 00:18:21.392
pressure myself.

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:23.850
And I'll talk a little bit more
about that towards the end.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.530
But I really explore how things
that the individual does also

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.030
obviously greatly
influences health.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.080
And how there are
cultural issues at work

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.325
that sometimes,
for many reasons,

00:18:33.325 --> 00:18:35.450
can affect the health of
African Americans as well.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.700
So I explore all these issues.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.910
I sort of tackle everything
in this book in that way.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.410
So that's one big
piece of the book.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.570
Why is being black
bad for your health?

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.264
The second big piece
of the book is,

00:18:44.264 --> 00:18:46.680
what is it like to be an African
American doctor, and what

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.840
is that experience like?

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.923
Because that's really the
second piece of the book

00:18:49.923 --> 00:18:50.920
that I talk about.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.020
As I mentioned at the beginning,
African Americans are about 13%

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.381
of the population,
4% of doctors.

00:18:56.381 --> 00:18:58.630
It was very common-- so when
I went to medical school,

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.680
I was in the first class
at Duke where they really

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.263
were increasing the numbers of
African Americans considerably.

00:19:03.263 --> 00:19:05.890
In previous years, there had
been much, much fewer numbers.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.100
And that raised a couple
of different issues.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.750
One was this issue about how
you perceive this perception.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.000
So you're an African American.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.850
You're sort of seen
as a rare thing,

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.100
and sometimes people don't
know how to perceive you.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.374
And so there are
a couple examples

00:19:20.374 --> 00:19:21.540
I'll talk about it the book.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.748
One occurred when I was a
first year medical student.

00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:27.170
When I came into a
classroom, a professor

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.670
approached me in a
sort of angry way

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.700
and asked me to fix the
lights in the classroom,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.940
and was under the mistaken
assumption that I was

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.326
someone other than who I was.

00:19:35.326 --> 00:19:37.950
An so I talk about that incident
and kind of how it affected me

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.075
because I was already kind
of insecure about coming

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:40.990
into medical school.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.590
So I explore how I dealt
with that situation.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.980
There was another time a few
years later as a first year

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.480
resident.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.470
So this when you finish medical
school, and your first year

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.560
is called an intern.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.759
That's when you like an MD.

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:54.800
So you're technically an
MD, but you don't really

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.215
feel like one because there's
so much responsibility

00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:57.714
and you're just
learning everything.

00:19:57.714 --> 00:19:59.830
And so it's a big
adjustment for every doctor.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:04.530
But about a month into that
first year, a patient, an older

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.190
white gentleman came in
and one of the first words

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.471
out of his mouth was that he
did not want a black doctor.

00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:13.610
And he used a racial slur to
sort of express what he meant.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.032
And only it happened that I was
the only black doctor working

00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:19.240
in the hospital at that
time, which was not uncommon.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.470
So it was sort of these
twist of fate or karma

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.720
or whatever that he would
be assigned to the same team

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.400
that I was at.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.970
So that story actually
has a surprise

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.780
ending that I won't
spoil for you here.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.280
But I'm just giving
examples of some

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.905
of the different ways
of how perception

00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:35.040
is so important to my journey.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.540
One of the issues
that also comes up

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.460
with being a black doctor where
you're one of few black doctors

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.790
and there's a large black
population around you

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.027
is that there's this
sort of supply and demand

00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:44.610
kind of issue.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.140
So there are often many African
American patients-- not always,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.380
but there are many
who would like

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.921
to have an African
American provider,

00:20:49.921 --> 00:20:52.362
particularly in a field like
primary care or psychiatry,

00:20:52.362 --> 00:20:54.070
which in my field,
where the relationship

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.855
with the doctor and the patient
is especially important.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.440
And so often there's
this issue that

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.730
comes up where
there's large numbers

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.059
of African American patients
and very few providers.

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:05.600
So for instance in
Durham-- so Duke's

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.683
in Durham, North Carolina.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:10.645
Populations about
45% African American.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.440
But you look at other medical
schools and hospitals.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.140
So Johns Hopkins is in
Baltimore, which is 60% black.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.370
And Atlanta-- in Philadelphia,
UPENN, is 50% black.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.475
Even in Boston where
it's like 25% black,

00:21:23.475 --> 00:21:25.100
something like that,
that's still about

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.950
double the black
population nationwide

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.002
which is like 12%, 13%.

00:21:28.002 --> 00:21:29.960
So even in a city like
Boston or New York where

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.990
the numbers are slightly lower.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.647
So you have this
dynamic of places

00:21:32.647 --> 00:21:35.230
where so many of the doctors or
medical students and residents

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.980
are trained, being
in these communities

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.800
where large African
American populations

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.300
and where there's
often historically

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.470
been this sort of tension
between the communities

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.040
and these very sort of
wealthy institutions.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.480
So the book kind of explores
all those dynamics as well,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.630
and what that means for you.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.760
Finally, there's
this other piece.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.449
Being a black
doctor, I come from,

00:21:53.449 --> 00:21:54.865
as I mentioned at
the beginning, I

00:21:54.865 --> 00:21:57.530
come from a very working class
African American community,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.680
segregated community.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.471
Many of the patients
that I saw reminded me

00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:01.840
of myself, my family.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.542
But then I'm becoming
part of this other system,

00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:08.736
this white coat and the
hierarchy of being a doctor.

00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:11.110
So black man in a white coat
is kind of like a symbolism.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.526
It's having two identities.

00:22:12.526 --> 00:22:14.150
You're navigating
those two identities.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.720
And so in times I would feel
as if-- many times I talk about

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.852
in the book, I feel like
I had a foot in one world,

00:22:18.852 --> 00:22:20.310
this is the African
American world.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.518
Now I'm in the medical world.

00:22:21.518 --> 00:22:22.960
And so where do I fit in there?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.419
And do I have a
foot in this world?

00:22:24.419 --> 00:22:25.876
And do I have a
foot in that world?

00:22:25.876 --> 00:22:28.490
Or do I have-- so it's like
trying to find your grounding.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.270
People have written-- many
African American philosophers

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.260
have written about this, a term
called double consciousness.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.610
I mean, there's all sorts
of ways of looking at it.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.090
But I explore it
from the context

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.120
of being a doctor in
the medical system.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.407
So that's another big
piece of the book as well.

00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:41.990
So finally the book talks about,
where does all this leave us?

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.420
So I've outlined all these
problems, these issues we have.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.870
And so in the book, towards
the end of the book,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.610
I try and touch on that.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.050
Say, where do we go from here?

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.620
And so when you go back
to what the problems are

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.555
at the level of
the system, there

00:22:52.555 --> 00:22:55.005
are all sorts of
problems of course.

00:22:55.005 --> 00:22:56.505
I talk about the
Affordable Care Act

00:22:56.505 --> 00:23:00.360
and kind of the pros and cons
of that, where that's left us.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.100
And so actually a
few years ago, I

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.742
went back to some of the
clinics that I initially worked

00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:06.450
at as a medical student
and sort of tried

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.430
to take stock of
where things had gone

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.740
and had the Affordable
Care Act helped?

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.440
And, you know, it's
a mixed picture

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.945
because it's so politicized.

00:23:13.945 --> 00:23:15.440
It's been so politicized.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.505
Many states haven't
enacted certain provisions

00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:18.630
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.838
North Carolina's one of them.

00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:23.360
And that's impact sort of
the real world effect of it.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.136
But as a doctor, I understand
we have politics and people

00:23:26.136 --> 00:23:27.260
are bitter and contentious.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.890
But as a doctor, it's hard
to sometimes understand

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.264
that because you've
seen patients

00:23:30.264 --> 00:23:32.559
from all political
backgrounds, all the time, who

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:34.350
all have the same kinds
of health problems,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.430
get sick in the same way.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.940
And so you just wonder
as a doctor, why

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.010
it's so difficult
for us to have this--

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.310
why has health care become
such a partisan issue?

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.400
That's the doctor hat.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.500
I mean, the other
side of me knows why.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.890
But it's such a frustrating
thing to see as a doctor,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.320
and I explore that as well.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.941
Another piece of it
at the macro level

00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:54.940
is, how do we get more
African American doctors?

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.100
What can we do about that?

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.599
And one of the more
troubling things

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:00.710
is that African American--
the numbers of doctors

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.610
have increased across
the board pretty much

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.570
over the last 30 years.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.028
The population
[INAUDIBLE] growing,

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:07.050
and the number of doctors
have grown with it.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.510
And that's true in all groups
of people with the exception

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.510
of African American men.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.000
So African American women and
medical students and doctors

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.375
have probably doubled
since the late 1970s.

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:18.000
But African American men, their
numbers are actually flatlined.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.250
In some place, even slightly
declined since the late 1970s.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.920
And that's completely different
than every other group--

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.349
demographic in America.

00:24:26.349 --> 00:24:27.890
So that plays out
for me in many ways

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.664
where I feel like I'm the only
person people are wanting--

00:24:30.664 --> 00:24:33.080
so you feel this sort of, like,
what is my responsibility?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.070
Where do I fit in as an
African American male?

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.850
What can I do about that?

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.266
So I explore all those kind
of issues in the book as well.

00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:41.030
And not just me, but what can
we do as a society as well?

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.488
There's also this
piece in the book

00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:45.260
where I talk about-- I think
it's a really important piece.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.195
Because we have
few black doctors,

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:49.570
most black patients
are not going

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.986
to see an African
American doctor.

00:24:50.986 --> 00:24:53.502
And so there's this
whole idea about how

00:24:53.502 --> 00:24:54.960
do we sort of get
along with people

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.890
who are very different from us?

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.431
And so in the book
I talk about this.

00:24:57.431 --> 00:24:59.400
I talk a lot about the
white patients I see,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.880
because about half of the
people I see are white.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.106
And how do we make
connections with people

00:25:05.106 --> 00:25:07.105
that we seem at first to
be very different from?

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:08.760
And so that's a really
important piece of the book.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.070
And I give a couple
examples of patients

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.290
where things were just so
completely different at first.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.070
You would never imagine that
we could have worked together.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.160
I mean, they had perceptions,
biases against me,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.620
I had biases against them.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.150
We all carry these things.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.206
But I give examples of
how we're able to work

00:25:22.206 --> 00:25:23.080
through those things.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.080
And I'd like for that to
be a lesson or inspiration

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.790
to other doctors.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.970
You know, white
doctors, Asian doctors,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.120
for how you can connect with
African American patients

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.390
from whom you may
have completely

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.306
different backgrounds.

00:25:31.306 --> 00:25:34.025
And so again, I'm using these
stories of my encounters

00:25:34.025 --> 00:25:35.824
with people to sort
of try and illuminate

00:25:35.824 --> 00:25:37.115
larger problems in our society.

00:25:37.115 --> 00:25:40.020
So that's really where I'm
coming from in the book.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.530
And really, I think that's it.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.400
I think the really
important piece

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.690
I want to get about this--
because what I'm learning along

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.731
the way in writing this
book and getting feedback

00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:48.694
is how little people
know about these issues.

00:25:48.694 --> 00:25:50.110
So I really want
to educate people

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.680
and just make-- the
awareness is so key.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.930
I mean, we always hear
about, again, race

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.007
through this lens of
criminal justice and crime

00:25:55.007 --> 00:25:56.090
and those sorts of issues.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.339
But it's a really huge deal
in the health care sector.

00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:00.672
Really in the long run, that
affects even more of us.

00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:01.630
That affects all of us.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.680
And so I really wanted to really
get people aware of this issue,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.361
and hopefully inspire them
to inspire health systems.

00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:09.860
Because I've been talking to
medical schools and health care

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.390
systems, inspiring doctors
and patients, all of us

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.630
to do better and do our part
to really address this problem.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.130
So that's really my
perspective on this issue,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.620
and that's really my story.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.094
So thank you for your time.

00:26:22.094 --> 00:26:25.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:26.974 --> 00:26:28.140
I'm happy to take questions.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.150
Actually, I often like
the question part better.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.870
Kind of engage
with the audience,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.960
see what people have to say.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.210
So thanks for bearing with me.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.503
[LAUGH]

00:26:36.503 --> 00:26:37.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.390
I would love to hear
sometime more of what

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.410
you have to say about the whole
issue you started to discuss

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.760
about young black
men, which seems

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.500
like a really problematic
group in our society right now.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.711
But I'd love it if
you'd talk about that

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.710
and what to do about it.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.890
But actually I wanted
to use my one question

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.000
on another question, which is
more about the Affordable Care

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.500
Act.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.958
DAMON TWEEDY: So I will talk
but the other part too though.

00:27:03.904 --> 00:27:05.320
AUDIENCE: The
Affordable Care Act,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.390
obviously we have some
huge problems with it

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.820
like the fact that so many
states did not expand Medicaid.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.820
Huge problem.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.620
But two things that
it's definitely done,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.510
one is it's insured a
heck of a lot more people.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.250
And number two is it has
made preventive care free.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.810
Although it did not
make the drugs free,

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.700
and that's a really
huge issue I'm

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.224
sure for issues like
hypertension, for example.

00:27:28.224 --> 00:27:30.960
But here's my question about it.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.100
With all these newly
insured people,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.430
you would think that the
demand for primary care

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.710
is now growing.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.050
It's gotta be
bigger than it ever

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.490
was before the demand for it.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.100
Nonetheless, I've read
recently that like too many

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.120
of the poor insured patients are
still going to emergency rooms.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.990
They're not making enough
use of primary care at all,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.000
and so forth.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.990
I'm wondering, how
much of this problem

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.330
is that the supply of primary
care has not improved?

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.640
And the incentives
for doctors to go

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.810
into primary care versus
specialties has not improved.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.470
Do we actually have any signs
that we're making progress

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.760
in expanding primary
care and preventive

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.610
care in those communities?

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.130
And how much of
this is a problem

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.030
that maybe there
is more of that,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.720
but people have habits
formed from long years,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.580
and they maybe
don't know about it

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.060
or they're just used to
going to emergency rooms?

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.470
How much of it is sort
of educational problems

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.520
and getting that
population to think more

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.150
about getting primary care
that may be available to them?

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.655
What are the real problems here,
and what do we do about it?

00:28:46.655 --> 00:28:48.780
DAMON TWEEDY: Yeah, I think
you touched on really--

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.190
that was a great question.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.390
So I think you touched
on many of the problems.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.790
So one is obviously
there's an under

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.540
supply of primary care
physicians compared

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.497
to specialists.

00:28:57.497 --> 00:28:59.580
Their incentives are--
they make a lot more money.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.288
You make two or three
times as much money

00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:03.380
being a specialist versus
a primary care doctor.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.963
Even within that,
primary care doctors

00:29:04.963 --> 00:29:07.350
often distribute in certain
geographic locations.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.720
So there may be a large
number primary care doctors

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.460
in a certain area in Boston or
certain cities, Washington, DC

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.120
or wherever.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.510
But then you go out to sort
of the more rural areas,

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.180
you find fewer.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.410
And even within larger cities,
the primary care doctors

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.060
are still often in
certain parts of the city.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.720
So there's still the
issue that you're dealing

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.680
with on the access level.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.329
So as to how people are trying
to address that-- for instance,

00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:31.370
I'll give you an example.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.474
So at Duke, Duke's
historically--

00:29:33.474 --> 00:29:34.890
it's one of those--
they call them

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.367
tertiary academic
medical centers

00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:38.700
or like the ones here at
Harvard where the goal is often

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.180
to train specialists
and researchers.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.310
But Duke has established
a primary care

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.720
track for medical students.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.511
This has happened in
the last three or four

00:29:47.511 --> 00:29:50.830
years where they are basically
paying for their medical school

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.260
tuition, which is
considerable, for students who

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.960
agree to go into primary care
and practice primary care

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.880
after medical school.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.490
And not only do that,
but there's also

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.656
like a-- even their education
is somewhat different.

00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:03.337
It's really geared more towards
this idea of continuity of care

00:30:03.337 --> 00:30:05.795
and not just this sort of like--
normally in medical school

00:30:05.795 --> 00:30:07.955
you're taught in a hospital
setting where it's urgent

00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:08.510
and it's acute.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.370
And so they're really trying to
build relationships with people

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.560
and follow them over
time, which is really

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.880
the purpose of primary care.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.170
So there are school-- many
schools are doing that,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:14.670
actually.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.360
I think Harvard has
a primary care track

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.526
as well that they've set up.

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:19.667
So many schools are
trying to do that.

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:21.000
We're still in the early stages.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.770
So to see what the long-term
effects of that's going to be

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.245
is still kind of unclear.

00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:26.370
So that's one aspect to it.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.078
So I think they are
trying to address it.

00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:30.460
It's clearly a problem
because of the reasons

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.860
that we just talked about.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.060
The other issue-- I just
lose my train of-- you

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.450
asked so my
questions, I'm trying

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.812
to make sure I've
addressed all of them.

00:30:37.812 --> 00:30:39.020
Gosh, what was the other one?

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.930
Oh, yeah, about the communities.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.259
And so the patterns of care.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:41.800
You're right.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.341
So African Americans
are so much more

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:46.754
likely to be seen in urgent
care clinics, emergency room

00:30:46.754 --> 00:30:48.920
settings for what could be
managed in a primary care

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.130
setting.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.713
There is a sort of
this pattern there.

00:30:50.713 --> 00:30:52.371
There's no doubt about that.

00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:53.370
Here's one road to that.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.320
One is that depending on
the kind of job you have,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.240
trying to go to see a
doctor requires sick leave.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.090
Some jobs don't have that.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.757
And I've had patients
where they get sick,

00:31:04.757 --> 00:31:06.340
they miss a few days
of work, and then

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.550
they can lose their job.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.089
And so it's so
harsh in that way.

00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:11.880
Urgent care clinics,
emergency room clinics

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.792
are always open after
hours, after work.

00:31:13.792 --> 00:31:16.250
So that's one way that it's
kind of been built up that way.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.121
That's one barrier,
for instance.

00:31:18.121 --> 00:31:19.620
So I think some
primary care clinics

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.074
have tried to set up more
flexible hours and sort

00:31:22.074 --> 00:31:22.990
of accommodate people.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.250
But then there's also a
pattern, like you said.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.360
You get used to doing
things a certain way.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.420
It's hard to break that.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.430
And it's really unfortunate
because I think--

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.901
one of the things is when
you're seeing a doctor,

00:31:32.901 --> 00:31:34.900
you don't know that doctor,
they don't know you,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.983
it's much more likely to
get this impersonal care.

00:31:36.983 --> 00:31:38.310
They're less invested in you.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.440
And you're more
likely to have things

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.190
like bias and other
things sort of intrude

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.760
in the doctor-patient
relationship.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.045
So it's a big problem.

00:31:44.045 --> 00:31:46.755
So I think you really outlined
all the problems in many ways.

00:31:46.755 --> 00:31:48.697
I hope I addressed--
I think we're trying

00:31:48.697 --> 00:31:49.780
to address these problems.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.863
But they're huge problems.

00:31:50.863 --> 00:31:52.810
Huge problems to deal with.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.863
The piece about the
African American men

00:31:54.863 --> 00:31:56.362
and in society and
doctors-- I think

00:31:56.362 --> 00:31:57.750
that was the question
you were mentioning.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.910
Yeah, I mean, it's troubling
on a lot of levels.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.580
I mean, so for me,
one of the things

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.080
that when I was the
first thinking I

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.270
could become a
doctor, there still

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.820
were very few role models.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.604
But I did a research lab-- got a
research position in the summer

00:32:10.604 --> 00:32:13.020
at the National Institute of
Health, which is in Maryland.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.811
And I met an African
American cardiologist.

00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:16.790
And so the idea of
seeing someone who looked

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.920
like me and had gone that
route, it was tremendous.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.392
I mean, so it was
tremendously important to me.

00:32:21.392 --> 00:32:23.850
And I think that all too often
as an African American man--

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.870
I can speak to this growing up--
the perceptions of what you can

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.391
do and what you can accomplish
are so narrow and limited

00:32:29.391 --> 00:32:29.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.350
And I think I feel like it
comes from the top of society

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.650
and it kind of filters
all the way down

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.560
to the community where you live.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.880
And I think that really just
narrows what you can do.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.630
I think there was a
kid in my neighborhood

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.170
who was-- I thought he
was smarter than me,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.017
but he sort of kind of
fell into that thing

00:32:43.017 --> 00:32:44.850
about you can only do
certain-- there's only

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.225
a certain narrow
road to success.

00:32:46.225 --> 00:32:49.450
And I feel like that really
limited what he ultimately

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:49.950
achieved.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.070
And so I think that's
a huge problem.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.290
And so I think we can't
have enough visible

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.650
African Americans who
are male who are just

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.140
succeeding in other ways.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.154
And so I feel this
real responsibility

00:33:01.154 --> 00:33:02.570
to try and be
someone [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.486
Even though that goes
against my personality--

00:33:04.486 --> 00:33:06.894
my personality is really
naturally very introverted

00:33:06.894 --> 00:33:07.810
and keeping to myself.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.594
But it really feels like
it's such an important issue.

00:33:10.594 --> 00:33:12.760
And the influence is so
great to be able to do that.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.250
So that's my answer
to that question.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.686
I'll try and shorten my answers
so people can ask questions.

00:33:19.686 --> 00:33:21.470
[LAUGH]

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.860
But that's such an issue of
passion for me, those issues.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.042
AUDIENCE: There's
another barrier, which

00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:31.500
I don't think I
have heard mention,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.730
but it's just it's
something that I've observed

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.740
through personal experience.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.210
So I have a son who is just--
he's a freshman at college.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.260
He's been at college
about two weeks.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.130
I also have the
privilege of my godson,

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.160
who is African American.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.070
And wonderful, bright,
nice young man.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.760
And he started school last year.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.470
He's at Mass College-- MCPHS in
Boston for pharmacy and health

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.620
services, I think.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.790
And he's in a physician's
assistant program.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.719
It's a six-year program.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:15.880
So his single mom, low
income, but they've

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.389
just worked so hard.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:24.530
Now his first semester, he went
full scholarship, full ride.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.030
Great.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.530
Wonderful.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.530
Wonderful privilege.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.800
His first semester,
he didn't do well.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.400
And second semester,
he worked really hard,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.810
brought his grades up, used
tutoring and all of that.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.940
Couldn't bring his average up
enough to keep the scholarship.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.139
So now he's going back,
loans and all of that.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:51.290
Now my son's going in, and just
for me being in college myself

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.190
and other parents
and all that, I

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.260
know that freshman often
tank the first semester.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:58.969
It's a big shift.

00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:00.176
DAMON TWEEDY: Big adjustment.

00:35:00.176 --> 00:35:01.610
AUDIENCE: It's a
huge adjustment.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.350
But people with resources,
they think, well, OK.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.670
You got Cs, get
up there, please.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.389
When I went to MIT, they'd
actually recognize this,

00:35:14.389 --> 00:35:16.430
and they have this thing
for all the freshman are

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.170
pass fail the first year
because they know about that.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:25.740
And I look at my godson, and
it feels like it's not fair.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.760
Like, people with low resources
who are depending on those

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.827
scholarships, they
have no margin.

00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:34.660
They have no margin.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.200
He comes in and it's like, whoa.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.380
This is harder than I thought.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.290
And also, I've read-- I don't
know if this is-- you tell me

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.754
if you agree with this or not.

00:35:43.754 --> 00:35:45.170
I read somewhere,
because I'm very

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.160
interesting in this whole
topic, that they looked

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.184
at people who were white,
people who were Asian,

00:35:52.184 --> 00:35:53.600
people who were
African Americans.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.890
And people who are African
American, I've read,

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:00.240
are less willing to go
out and ask for help,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.110
ask for tutoring
resources, than average.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.210
Asian Americans tend
to be more willing.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.580
And it's a cultural thing.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.350
And so he didn't ask.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.350
This semester he asked
because his mom was like,

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.724
you're talking to
the tutors, OK?

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.090
And so that also, I'm
sure, affected his grade.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.340
And this is a good kid,
but he's now kind of--

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.110
DAMON TWEEDY: Struggling more.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.804
AUDIENCE: --is now in a
more challenging place

00:36:27.804 --> 00:36:29.220
than he might have
been otherwise.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:29.760
DAMON TWEEDY: Yeah, sure.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.259
So, yeah.

00:36:30.259 --> 00:36:32.780
I would the margin
of error is thinner.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.760
I would definitely agree
with you in that part.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.290
And that is true.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.820
I think there's also-- because
when I started medical school,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.040
there's always this
sort of like-- well,

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.248
there's this whole perception
for affirmative action.

00:36:41.248 --> 00:36:43.890
You got in and you're taking
spots from other people.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.505
And so you come--
it affects you.

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.850
You hear people tell you this.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.349
And you go in, and you wonder
if you're going to measure up.

00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:51.590
And so the first times
that you don't measure up,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.466
it really-- I mean,
you don't want

00:36:54.466 --> 00:36:55.840
to ask for help
because it's sort

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.115
of fulfilling this perception
people already have of you

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.760
that you can't make it,
and so you're even less

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.660
likely to seek help because
you don't want to admit

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.930
that you might have a problem.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.290
So it's a huge problem.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.990
And so I think
several schools have

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.030
tried to be more aggressive
with being aware of that

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.520
and trying to be more aggressive
with trying to establish

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.670
support for students
in those backgrounds

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.950
from the very beginning.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.020
So for instance, in college,
I attended a state college

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.310
at the University of Maryland.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.414
And we had a summer
program which

00:37:23.414 --> 00:37:25.580
really helped with that
sort of acclimation process.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.475
We got you familiar with the
counselors and the people who

00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:29.080
could help you if
you needed help.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.210
So I think that's
a huge problem,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.626
and all too often, African
American students in particular

00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:35.030
are the ones who sort of
bear the brunt of that.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.160
So your story's one
I've heard many times

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.582
and can definitely relate to.

00:37:38.582 --> 00:37:39.790
So we're trying to do better.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.220
And I'm part of
a program at Duke

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.196
where we try and reach to people
who are younger and trying

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:47.320
to help them get through
this process, particularly

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.861
African American
men, because there's

00:37:48.861 --> 00:37:51.545
such a huge problem
that's seen all over.

00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:52.130
So absolutely.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.087
That's a great question.

00:37:54.087 --> 00:37:54.920
Any other questions?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.711
Any other thoughts?

00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:58.096
Anyone have any ideas?

00:37:58.096 --> 00:37:59.070
Yeah.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.540
I'm an open book here.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.967
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:03.425
AUDIENCE: It's OK
if you don't have

00:38:03.425 --> 00:38:04.591
an answer for this question.

00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:06.860
But I was wondering if
there's any ways you

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:12.190
think that we can help as
pretty much white people not

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.350
in medicine.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.640
What can we do to help?

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.050
Because I think a lot of
us care about these kinds

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.460
of inequalities, and we'd
like to help solve them.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.920
DAMON TWEEDY: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.961
People ask that question.

00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:26.665
So what can you-- but the thing
is, people often underestimate.

00:38:26.665 --> 00:38:28.670
I mean, there's so much
happening in the world.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.640
Problems are so big.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.940
You often feel like
you're just helpless.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.240
There's nothing you can do
versus all these problems.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.750
But never underestimate what
you can do as an individual

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.700
to really improve
someone's life.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.311
I still go back to that teacher.

00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:41.060
She took time out of
her day to say, well,

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.837
you really should try
and take this test.

00:38:42.837 --> 00:38:45.170
And she had to encourage me,
and I didn't want to do it.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.500
I was really thinking
there was no way I'm

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.120
going to be able to do this.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.300
And so for her to sort
of push me along that way

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.770
and to get me on
this path, I mean,

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.311
she really helped
get me on the path.

00:38:52.311 --> 00:38:54.310
This was a 45-year-old
white woman, you know?

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.370
And so just her
encouragement really

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.620
changed my life in many ways.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.390
I mean, something like that.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.110
I think all too often it's
easy to get discouraged and be

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.610
cynical.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:06.730
But I think that you
really underestimate

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.660
the power you can have.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.500
So she helped me, and now
I'm in the position where I

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.970
can help so many other people.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.636
And I think it sort
of builds like that.

00:39:12.636 --> 00:39:14.887
And so I think that's what
I would tell people who are

00:39:14.887 --> 00:39:16.094
in a position to help people.

00:39:16.094 --> 00:39:17.960
Because I mean, all
you folks here and just

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.534
going to help people
in your own way

00:39:19.534 --> 00:39:21.200
even if you can't fix
the whole problem.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.300
Because so much of health
is about these issues

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.400
that aren't just strictly
about health care

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.940
and the medical treatment.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.670
You don't have to be a doctor
to really improve health.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.230
If you can improve people's
educational opportunities, job

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.040
opportunities, you're
totally transforming

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.350
people's lives in ways
that you may not realize.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.225
And you're not only
transforming their lives.

00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:37.141
You're transforming their
health, potentially.

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:40.840
So just think about that as you
sort of go out into the world.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.020
That's what I would
say to your question.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.074
Never underestimate what
you can do in that way.

00:39:46.074 --> 00:39:47.010
Yeah.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.946
Yes sir?

00:39:48.946 --> 00:39:50.320
AUDIENCE: Have
you looked at some

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.120
of the stats in
the nursing field,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.590
and seeing how those kind
of differ or match up

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.390
to some of the percentages that
you mentioned with physicians?

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.150
DAMON TWEEDY: Great question.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.421
That's a good question.

00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:02.420
So I'm in mental health.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:07.410
And so I've looked actually
at-- so mental health field,

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:08.980
there's psychiatrists
and there's

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.640
psychologists and
family therapists

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.598
and all sort of things.

00:40:11.598 --> 00:40:13.460
So the numbers are
really even lower.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.980
So actually, even lower
than they are in medicine.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.260
That's also the case if
you're looking at stats for,

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.142
like-- I'm trying to
think about nursing.

00:40:20.142 --> 00:40:22.600
I put the nurse practitioners--
the nurse practitioners are

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.433
sort of like a similar--
the specialist kind

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:25.850
of advanced practiced nurse.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.470
The numbers there
are actually lower

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:28.678
than they are for physicians.

00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:30.940
So the number's,
like, less than 5%.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.250
So I think that's
pretty much across-- so

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:37.089
far as general nursing,
though, like as far as RNs,

00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:39.130
I would say if it's higher,
it's not much higher.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.200
I mean, I don't know the
specific number [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.697
but it's certainly
not much higher.

00:40:41.697 --> 00:40:43.530
The numbers are pretty
low across the board.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.490
I mean, there's just
no way around that.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.750
Yeah.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.370
I'll have to go
look that up though.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:49.870
See, I was always
told that when you

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.050
come to Google that
people are going to ask

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.140
you questions and you're not
coming up with the answer,

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.700
and you've got to
do your homework.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.818
So thank you.

00:40:54.818 --> 00:40:56.570
[LAUGH]

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.180
Any other questions?

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.360
Yeah, you have another one?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.401
AUDIENCE: So you said that
you're a psychiatrist.

00:41:01.401 --> 00:41:03.980
DAMON TWEEDY: That's correct.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.520
AUDIENCE: There
seems to be-- and I

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.790
also-- on my side of the
family have some family

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.550
history of mental illness.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.700
And so there's a shortage
of psychiatrists,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.490
and there just seems to
be not that many people

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.299
going into psychiatry,
black, white, or green.

00:41:25.299 --> 00:41:27.590
So what-- and you may have
covered this, but I'm sorry.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.490
I came in late.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.977
How did you choose psychiatry
over the other specialties?

00:41:30.977 --> 00:41:32.810
DAMON TWEEDY: That's a
really good question.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.640
Because within medicine,
psychiatry in many ways

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.730
is kind of marginalized.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.610
I mean, every walk of life has
their own hierarchy, right?

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.150
So there's a hierarchy
within medicine as well,

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.640
and psychiatrists are often
in some ways marginalized.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.660
So when I first went
to medical school,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.980
I never thought I would
be a psychiatrist.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.460
I thought I was going to
be a cardiologist, a heart

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:51.980
specialist.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.780
That's what I was really-- I
had done research in that field.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.738
I had a lot of family
history of heart disease.

00:41:55.738 --> 00:41:57.996
And so that was where
I was really going to.

00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.390
And even after medical
school, I actually

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.900
started my first--
actually matched

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.110
into a program that was
going to put me on that path.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.120
I started in the
general medicine

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.536
path, which is where you go
before you go into cardiology.

00:42:07.536 --> 00:42:09.830
So I was all on that
trajectory all the way through.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.790
And then about halfway
through the year,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.079
you're getting patients that
are admitted to your team

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:15.370
from all parts of the hospital.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.960
And some of them-- a lot of
them have mental health issues.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.660
But they were still sick
enough where they needed

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.080
to be on the medical service.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.982
And something about working
with some of those folks

00:42:22.982 --> 00:42:25.190
and realizing there's this
great need to help people,

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.790
it really just
appealed to me in a way

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.480
that I never thought it would.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.350
Because I didn't like psychiatry
much in medical school.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.210
I did a rotation at a hospital
and didn't care for it

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:31.460
that much.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.630
But there's something about
that particular setting

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.480
where I was at.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.370
And people started to tell
me that I had an attitude.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.619
Like, I would be able to get
information from patients

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:40.590
that other doctors
weren't able to get.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.870
Like, people were
connecting with me in a way

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.150
that they weren't
with other doctors.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.820
Which is all surprising
to me, because I never

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.940
considered myself this great
social person or anything.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.170
But people were sort of
connecting to me in that way,

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.180
and that really kind
of got me thinking

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.770
that maybe I could do this.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.261
And so that's really how
I got into psychiatry.

00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:56.760
It's a huge problem
as far as access

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.200
to care for psychiatrists
across the board.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.130
It's a huge problem.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.811
If you tie back
the race, there's

00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:05.310
a huge stigma within the African
American community in terms

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.260
of mental health treatment.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.176
There's a huge stigma.

00:43:07.176 --> 00:43:09.990
So the numbers of black people
seeking mental health care,

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.704
it's a big issue that
I'm dealing with.

00:43:12.704 --> 00:43:14.120
So there's so many
layers to that.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.390
I mean, part of it is how
psychiatrists are-- again,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:20.610
the perception of it.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.100
There's sort of this stigma.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.740
Many times, it was
funded separately.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.152
So the mental
health [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:25.152 --> 00:43:27.610
It would be medical care, and
people would separate it out.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.950
And that's further sort of
stigmatizing the mental health

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:30.450
treatment.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:31.979
So there's so many
factors at work.

00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:34.520
There's supposed to be-- I know
they passed the Mental Health

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.910
Parity Act, and the
Affordable Care Act

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.826
is supposed to help with
some of these issues.

00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:39.050
All that remains to be seen.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.130
I think it's still a big
issue, and then hopefully it'll

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:41.720
be getting better.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.840
But it's a huge problem.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.050
You see it every day.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.050
AUDIENCE: I just wonder
if you have any thoughts

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.900
about the separation between
medicine and dentistry,

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.410
and whether you're aware
of how any of these

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.150
issues that you talked about
our different or the same

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.199
in dentistry, or whether
that wall affects things?

00:43:57.199 --> 00:43:57.990
DAMON TWEEDY: Yeah.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.540
So the issues are pretty
similar, actually.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.790
If you're talking about
issues around race and poverty

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.940
and access to care, in
some ways they're worse.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.820
I mean, in some
ways, dentistry's

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.572
often like-- finding an
affordable dentist is

00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:12.530
almost like finding an
affordable psychiatrist.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.325
Those are really
difficult things to do.

00:44:14.325 --> 00:44:16.700
So in some ways, it's even
worse than in general medicine

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.033
actually, when you're talking
about from the perspective

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:20.534
of poverty and race.

00:44:20.534 --> 00:44:22.825
In terms of numbers of minority
providers and all that,

00:44:22.825 --> 00:44:24.860
it's even worse.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.730
As far as why they're
separated, yeah,

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.920
that I'm not so sure about.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.700
The historical basis
for separating them out,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.860
that I'm not so sure about.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.540
But the issues are still very
pertinent, very relevant.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.927
No doubt about that.

00:44:35.927 --> 00:44:37.010
It's so amazing, actually.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.850
You'll see patients in
the medical setting,

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.145
and they have all these
[INAUDIBLE] health problems,

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.270
but you can clearly see
they have dental needs that

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.290
need to be addressed.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:45.969
And then trying
to find something

00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:48.260
that they-- care they can
receive is just unbelievable.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.720
The waits for them to get care
for dental problems, I mean,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.045
we're talking several months.

00:44:53.045 --> 00:44:54.756
I mean, months and
months and months.

00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:56.130
Some would have
to come in, like,

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.835
with just a raging infection
to get any kind of treatment.

00:44:58.835 --> 00:45:00.490
You had to be really sick
to get treatment, which

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:01.450
is sort of perverse, right?

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:02.991
Because the whole
point is to sort of

00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:05.290
prevent these problems
from happening.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.030
And dentistry's
sometimes even worse.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.934
That's been my
experience anyway.

00:45:08.934 --> 00:45:09.860
Yeah.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.560
Absolutely.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.580
Great.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.330
One more question.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.310
Yeah?

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.520
AUDIENCE: So obviously this
is a very universal problem

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.490
across the US.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.410
Are there any communities
in the US or globally

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.470
that are doing this-- or
handling this issue well,

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.630
where there's
progress being made

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.880
that you guys have identified?

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.088
DAMON TWEEDY: I think there
are actually quite a few.

00:45:30.088 --> 00:45:32.320
There are a lot of sort of
small pockets of things.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.900
I mean, there are several sort
of-- what do you call them?

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.870
Non-profit institutions
that are sort of

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:39.840
dedicated to addressing
some of these problems.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.710
There's like the Kaiser Family
Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.290
Foundation.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.260
A lot of times they
will give grants

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.200
to various community level
programs, which are helpful.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.810
But again, we're
talking about limited--

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.850
it's sort of like a small
piece of the puzzle.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.540
And so the issue is,
can we replicate these?

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.540
Can we get the support we
need to make these happen?

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.707
But this is happening all
over-- even within Durham,

00:46:00.707 --> 00:46:03.206
there are programs that we've
set up that have been helpful.

00:46:03.206 --> 00:46:04.960
But it's just like,
how do we sustain it?

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.945
And how do we just-- once the
program's over, if you leave,

00:46:07.945 --> 00:46:09.570
then you're kind of
back where you are.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.150
How do we sustain
these initiatives?

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.490
So I think there are a
lot of examples, actually.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.531
I didn't give you any one
specific one, but there

00:46:17.531 --> 00:46:18.448
are many. [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:18.448 --> 00:46:19.155
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:20.300
DAMON TWEEDY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.165
Yeah.

00:46:21.165 --> 00:46:23.412
So I thank everybody for coming.

00:46:23.412 --> 00:46:25.870
I'm going to hang around if
anyone has any other questions.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.130
And there's books.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.850
I will say that I only gave a
sort of a sampling of the book,

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.411
and I think the book's-- I'm
a better writer than I am

00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:34.910
a speaker.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.884
So that's said.

00:46:36.884 --> 00:46:38.300
But I really
appreciate-- you guys

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.620
had some really good questions.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.120
And, yeah.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:40.940
This is a big problem.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.606
And I think, as you say, I think
there's something for everybody

00:46:43.606 --> 00:46:45.690
to learn about and to
think about their own role

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.790
and how they can help.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:47.190
And so I think, yeah.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.990
Don't lose sight of that.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.489
I would encourage you all to
feel that way as you leave here

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:51.070
today.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.870
So thank you.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.520
[APPLAUSE]
