00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.660
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So far, we've seen how to solve a system of equations using graphs and

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.090
substitution. Let's try and come up with one more method. Here's a system of two

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.116
equations, and what I want you to do is I want you to add these two equations

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.085
together. What would you get? You could write your answer in this box.
