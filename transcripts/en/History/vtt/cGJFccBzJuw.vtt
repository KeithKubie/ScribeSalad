00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.670
Dad.

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.430
Yeah?

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.470
You have company.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.770
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.600
Hey, Norb, how you doing?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm Mike and this is Frank.
- I'm Frank.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.500
Nice to meet ya.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.530
And your daughter Heather--

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.670
OK.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.630
--called our shop in
Iowa and told us that

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.900
you might have some
motorcycle parts

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.870
you're interested in selling.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.030
[music playing]

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.170
I'm not really interested
and don't know why

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.830
my daughter called you guys.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.870
Yeah, well, I get that.
I mean--

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.970
I'm just saying.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.530
--I've got stuff I
wouldn't sell either.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.630
I understand.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.400
OK, I got bikes but
they're all old friends.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.230
- Sure.
- I know exactly what you mean.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.230
- Yeah.
- I bought a--

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.430
I bought a motorcycle
when I was 15.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.600
I still got it.
- Do ya?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.670
Yep.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.430
MIKE: Oh, yeah, we
both ride quite a bit.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.030
One of the bike's in
there is kinda--it's been

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
with us over 40 years.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.530
Over 40 years?
MIKE: Really?

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.500
I'll be darned.
MIKE: Which one's that?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.130
That's my knucklehead.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.970
- Oh, the knucklehead.
- Yeah.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.730
Oh.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.830
That's his baby.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.330
That's his baby?

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.800
- That's his baby, Frank.
- That's his baby.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.230
Awesome.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.470
Well, why don't you take him
inside and show them around.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.300
Would you guys
like to come in?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.270
FRANK: We would love to come in.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.900
MIKE: Yeah, look
around, Heck, yeah.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.670
FRANK: Oh, yeah, this
looks good, Norb.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.130
JD, VL.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.970
This looks like Norbert's shop
where he works on his bikes

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.770
and spends some alone time.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.570
Here's your baby.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.670
NORBERT: Oh yeah.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.230
FRANK: And sitting
by the entrance

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.600
is his 1946 knucklehead.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.930
It's got an orange and
black paint job on it.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.530
I mean, it's got the
beehive taillight.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.700
NORBERT: Oh yeah.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.000
FRANK: It's got a luggage rack.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.970
It's got a cigarette lighter
with a coil cover over it.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.370
It's even got a European
speedometer on it.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.800
This thing is trick.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.700
MIKE: In the 1970s,
people were building

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.270
bikes that were expressing
what was happening

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.630
in the counterculture.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.270
Guys were cutting and
chopping everything back then.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.800
But this bike he spared.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.700
He wanted to leave
it bone stock.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.570
This was a bike
that he was really

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.630
going to honor its history.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.370
And the fact that he
hasn't erased all of that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.630
is incredible.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.430
FRANK: Can we hear it run?
- Sure.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.200
[motorcycle engine starts]

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.270
Hey.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.400
Really good job.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.030
- That's pretty cool, man.
- Pretty good.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.870
MIKE: When you hear that engine,
that big twin, it comes alive.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.930
Yeah.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.800
MIKE: If you've ridden
a bike like this,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.300
you can appreciate
that sound even more.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.800
That baby fired right up.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.100
NORBERT: Well,
she's a good old--

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
she gets temperamental
sometimes.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.930
Oh, yeah.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.530
I don't want to walk
off this property

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.270
without this knucklehead.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.770
It's a $30,000 bike, and
I'm ready to just step

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.130
up if he'll consider an offer.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.600
Have you ever thought about
selling this over the years?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.130
NORBERT: I've had some thoughts
and entertained some offers.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.470
But it's an old friend.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.870
FRANK: I got ya.
MIKE: I hear ya.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.200
NORBERT: I had it
for over 40 years.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.130
I can still start it.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.800
I can still ride it.
MIKE: Yeah.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.270
- Do you still ride it?
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.200
Oh, yeah.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.230
Well, think it
over a little bit.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870
Well, weddings and funerals.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.200
I don't really know you,
and you want my knucklehead?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.400
What are your qualifications?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.300
You know?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.400
I better get off this here.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.600
I'm getting too used to it.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
You know, I'm really
in love with this bike.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.300
But right now Norbert is
saying he's not selling.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.830
And I'm not surprised.
- I'm going to look--

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.930
I'm going to look
around a little bit.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.900
- By all means.
- Alrighty.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.170
Please.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.000
But his wife and his
daughter said he needs to sell.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.970
So I'm going to put the bike on
the back burner for right now.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.700
But I'm not done yet.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.800
You think we could take another
look at the knucklehead?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.730
You can look all you want.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.700
All right.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.930
Look but don't touch?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.400
- No, you can touch it.
- All right.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.200
- I let you touch it earlier.
- All right, that's a fact.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.500
- You know?
- I know, I sat on it.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.700
- You just got to be gentle.
- It's all good. you know?

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.330
- It felt good.
- Yeah.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.270
Be gentle, Frank.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.130
I'm practicing my windup.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.730
We've bought a few things here.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.430
Norbert's happy with our prices.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm get ready to slow
pitch on that knucklehead.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.170
So we've been walking around.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.870
We did the circle.
- Mm-hm.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.370
Mike's bought some
parts and stuff from ya.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.930
What about the knuckle here?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.630
What do you think?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.430
NORBERT: I know every bearing
in this thing, every part.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.330
A lot of them I've made.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.500
This is my pride and joy.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.370
And I've owned it for
well over 40 years.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.730
Ah-- I'd really like
to help you out.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.730
But the knucklehead's family.
FRANK: It's family?

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.730
NORBERT: The knucklehead is
part of me, part of the family.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.530
I can still ride it.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.900
It's staying here.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.430
I can understand.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.400
I can understand why he kept it.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.100
I can understand why
it's not for sale.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.300
Right.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.730
NORBERT: Like I said,
hey, when I can't start it

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.430
and I can't ride it,
I'll give you a call.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.600
All right.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.900
Frank, I'm going to
grab some of these parts.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.700
FRANK: All right.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.170
Today wasn't my time.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.930
But that's not the only
knucklehead around.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.270
MIKE: Careful on the heads.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.870
FRANK: Yeah, put these
in a box in there.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.230
If I could pick any
one that I really want,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.500
it would be the first
year 1936 knucklehead.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.270
Life's all about timing.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.830
There'll be one down the line.
MIKE: All right.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.770
Appreciate you.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.000
You guys have
a good safe trip.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.030
I had a good time.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.730
Thanks a lot for
the parts and stuff.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.830
Appreciate the parts.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.830
I want to thank you
for the entertainment.
