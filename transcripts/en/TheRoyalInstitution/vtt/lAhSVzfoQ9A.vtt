00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.160
Now let's have a look before we look at what
the structure of the DNA is,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.070
let's have a look at how we can get DNA ourselves
out of cells.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.789
So we've got a little experiment here to show
you.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.939
In this flask, in this beaker here, we've
got some human cells.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.949
Going in the laboratory.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.140
And we're going to burst those open and extract
the DNA from them.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.890
Now the way that we burst the cells open in
this case

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.550
is we add a little washing up detergent.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.690
Cells don't like detergent.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.420
So just look at what happens when I put some
of that washing up detergent there.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.460
See how it goes clear and gooey?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.149
That's the DNA being released from the cells.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.969
Now how can we separate out that DNA?

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.949
It's very simple. We add a little alcohol,
right?

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.789
Time for a bit of Christmas spirit.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.910
There we are, we add a little alcohol.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.940
Now what we can do there is we can

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.840
fish the DNA that's been precipitated by the
alcohol out of here.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.540
And we're going to show you just how pretty
it looks.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.770
Now Nigel is going to come up here and we're
going to switch on,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.550
now that's a UV light, a sort of long wave
UV that sometimes makes your shirts look blue.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.720
And when we shine that on the DNA, the DNA
will fluoresce.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.770
It'll show up nicely. Now let's have the lights
down, can we?

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.620
As we pick out the DNA. Let's have the lights
down.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.620
Let's have the lights all the way down.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.580
And then we'll see the DNA shining there.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.670
That's the DNA that we've isolated from the
centre of the cell

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.380
in just the same way that we would do

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.000
any experiments that we do in the laboratory
nowadays.
