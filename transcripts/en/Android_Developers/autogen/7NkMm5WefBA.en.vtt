learning as quickly as possible and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940
learning as quickly as possible and
 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.790

assuming that you know exactly what you
 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.840
assuming that you know exactly what you
should build you form a hypothesis that

should build you form a hypothesis that
 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.670

something might work and then you've out

then you find the fastest way to

then you find the fastest way to
 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.330
then you find the fastest way to
validate or invalidate that hypothesis

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340
validate or invalidate that hypothesis
 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.100

to you know create things that people
want to use and that they will actually

the way that makes sense so Laura word
 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.160
the way that makes sense so Laura word
on the street is that I can make some

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170
on the street is that I can make some
 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.109
on the street is that I can make some
products very quickly and on the cheap

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119
products very quickly and on the cheap
 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.600
products very quickly and on the cheap
without spending any money on design

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
without spending any money on design
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340
without spending any money on design
using this Lean Startup thing is that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350
using this Lean Startup thing is that
 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.780
using this Lean Startup thing is that
true no I know it's terrible that it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790
true no I know it's terrible that it
 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.609
true no I know it's terrible that it
isn't but it's absolutely not true

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619
isn't but it's absolutely not true
 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.140
isn't but it's absolutely not true
cuz Lean Startup really it's not about

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150
cuz Lean Startup really it's not about
 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.250
cuz Lean Startup really it's not about
being cheap and it's not about being

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260
being cheap and it's not about being
 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.230
being cheap and it's not about being
free or cutting corners and just because

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240
free or cutting corners and just because
 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.310
free or cutting corners and just because
you're bootstrapping your startup

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320
you're bootstrapping your startup
 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.580
you're bootstrapping your startup
doesn't make you lean I mean okay so it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
doesn't make you lean I mean okay so it
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.050
doesn't make you lean I mean okay so it
turns out that lean startups can end up

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060
turns out that lean startups can end up
 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.550
turns out that lean startups can end up
spending less money and time than other

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
spending less money and time than other
 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.020
spending less money and time than other
startups but that's because they're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
startups but that's because they're
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.760
startups but that's because they're
constantly evaluating whether they're

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
constantly evaluating whether they're
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.870
constantly evaluating whether they're
building the right thing and that

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880
building the right thing and that
 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.210
building the right thing and that
minimizes waste just saving money or

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
minimizes waste just saving money or
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.609
minimizes waste just saving money or
going fast does not make you lean that

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619
going fast does not make you lean that
 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.940
going fast does not make you lean that
makes sense so what is lean UX and how

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950
makes sense so what is lean UX and how
 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.039
makes sense so what is lean UX and how
is it different than Lean Startup lean

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049
is it different than Lean Startup lean
 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.140
is it different than Lean Startup lean
UX is really just a way to apply those

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150
UX is really just a way to apply those
 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.910
UX is really just a way to apply those
iterative methods to the user experience

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920
iterative methods to the user experience
 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.940
iterative methods to the user experience
design practice doing lean UX means that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950
design practice doing lean UX means that
 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.590
design practice doing lean UX means that
you're always validating with users that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600
you're always validating with users that
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.700
you're always validating with users that
you're designing something that people

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710
you're designing something that people
 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.770
you're designing something that people
are going to use it's about designing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780
are going to use it's about designing
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.889
are going to use it's about designing
products that are both usable and useful

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
products that are both usable and useful
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.810
products that are both usable and useful
that makes sense so you're in a book

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820
that makes sense so you're in a book
 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.969
that makes sense so you're in a book
about this right so what type of an

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
about this right so what type of an
 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.740
about this right so what type of an
audience would find this book useful so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750
audience would find this book useful so
 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.899
audience would find this book useful so
right the book is called UX for lean

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909
right the book is called UX for lean
 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.420
right the book is called UX for lean
startups but it's not actually just for

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
startups but it's not actually just for
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.660
startups but it's not actually just for
UX designers

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
UX designers
 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.890

and it's not even really just for

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
and it's not even really just for
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.750
and it's not even really just for
startups so I don't know maybe I could

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
startups so I don't know maybe I could
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.699

have named it better but the book is

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709
have named it better but the book is
 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.960
have named it better but the book is
really for anybody who's building a

everything is better with social but see
what happens is that the product manager

new idea for for comments and then the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360
new idea for for comments and then the

engineers go okay great how do I write
this code so that it's you know really

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250
this code so that it's you know really
 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.030
this code so that it's you know really
fast stable comments experience but

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040
fast stable comments experience but

fast stable comments experience but
instead what we should be asking is how

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500
instead what we should be asking is how
 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.170
instead what we should be asking is how
do we know whether this is even the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180
do we know whether this is even the
 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.490
do we know whether this is even the
right thing to build in the first place

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500
right thing to build in the first place

that makes sense see the whole comments

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650
that makes sense see the whole comments

key metrics are going to improve do we

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600
key metrics are going to improve do we
 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.630
key metrics are going to improve do we
really know that do we know that adding

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640
really know that do we know that adding
 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.950
really know that do we know that adding
a comments feature is going to improve

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960
a comments feature is going to improve
 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.140
a comments feature is going to improve
our business do we even know that people

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150
our business do we even know that people
 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.750
our business do we even know that people
are gonna leave comments in other words

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760
are gonna leave comments in other words
 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.870
are gonna leave comments in other words
do comments fulfill either a user need

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880
do comments fulfill either a user need
 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.450
do comments fulfill either a user need
or a business need or even better both

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
or a business need or even better both

we can't just you know assume that those

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
we can't just you know assume that those
 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.020
we can't just you know assume that those
things are true because the product

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030
things are true because the product
 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.960
things are true because the product
manager had an idea instead of assuming

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970
manager had an idea instead of assuming
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.430
manager had an idea instead of assuming
that those are facts we're gonna treat

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440
that those are facts we're gonna treat
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.810
that those are facts we're gonna treat
them as hypotheses and we're gonna test

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820
them as hypotheses and we're gonna test
 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.940
them as hypotheses and we're gonna test
them as quickly as possible and ideally

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950
them as quickly as possible and ideally
 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.140
them as quickly as possible and ideally
we're going to test them without

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
we're going to test them without
 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.540
we're going to test them without
building the entire comments feature and

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550
building the entire comments feature and
 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.250
building the entire comments feature and
then launching it and just seeing how it

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260
then launching it and just seeing how it
 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.719
then launching it and just seeing how it
does that makes sense

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729
does that makes sense
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.330
does that makes sense
so so these are hypotheses how do we

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340
so so these are hypotheses how do we
 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.580
so so these are hypotheses how do we
validate them so this is where we run

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590
validate them so this is where we run
 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.050
validate them so this is where we run

buzzword MVP yeah we need to build an

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140
buzzword MVP yeah we need to build an
 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.110
buzzword MVP yeah we need to build an
MVP and an MVP is a Minimum Viable

Product it's the smallest possible thing
that we can build that will help us to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070
that we can build that will help us to
 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.190
that we can build that will help us to
learn whether or not our hypothesis is

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
learn whether or not our hypothesis is
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.380
learn whether or not our hypothesis is
true that makes sense I've heard of

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
true that makes sense I've heard of
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.180
true that makes sense I've heard of

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190
these MVPs so aren't they just really
 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.450
these MVPs so aren't they just really
crappy versions of products they are not

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460
crappy versions of products they are not
 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.650
crappy versions of products they are not
ah so this is a common misconception but

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660
ah so this is a common misconception but
 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.570
ah so this is a common misconception but
an MVP has never you know a crappy

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580
an MVP has never you know a crappy
 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.610
an MVP has never you know a crappy
version of a product because it turns

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620
version of a product because it turns
 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.780
version of a product because it turns
out that the only thing that we learned

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790
out that the only thing that we learned
 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.890
out that the only thing that we learned
from crappy products is that people

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900
from crappy products is that people
 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.900
from crappy products is that people
like crappy products that's a well

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910
like crappy products that's a well
 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.090
like crappy products that's a well
validated hypothesis we know that people

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100
validated hypothesis we know that people
 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.730
validated hypothesis we know that people
hate crabby things the word viable is

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740
hate crabby things the word viable is
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.469
hate crabby things the word viable is
actually there for a reason it's got to

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479
actually there for a reason it's got to
 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.939
actually there for a reason it's got to
be something that we can learn from but

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949
be something that we can learn from but
 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.010
be something that we can learn from but
that made sense so what is the MVP

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020
that made sense so what is the MVP
 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.110
that made sense so what is the MVP
version of this comments feature that's

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120
version of this comments feature that's
 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.490
version of this comments feature that's
a good question there are actually a few

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500
a good question there are actually a few
 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.050
a good question there are actually a few
different versions of the MVP and you

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060
different versions of the MVP and you
 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.670
different versions of the MVP and you
could start with any of them sort of

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680
could start with any of them sort of
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.779
could start with any of them sort of
depending on what you want to validate

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789
depending on what you want to validate
 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.939
depending on what you want to validate
first so for example if you wanted to

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949
first so for example if you wanted to
 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:51.830
first so for example if you wanted to
validate whether anybody would leave a

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840
validate whether anybody would leave a
 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.810
validate whether anybody would leave a
comment at all you might create what we

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820
comment at all you might create what we
 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.999
comment at all you might create what we
call a fake door or a feature stub what

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009
call a fake door or a feature stub what
 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.150
call a fake door or a feature stub what
is a fake door so if your want to

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160
is a fake door so if your want to
 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.680
is a fake door so if your want to
validate whether anybody's going to use

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690
validate whether anybody's going to use
 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.600
validate whether anybody's going to use
something you build the very first

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610
something you build the very first
 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.090
something you build the very first
interaction with that feature and then

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100
interaction with that feature and then
 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.620
interaction with that feature and then
you record whether anybody interacts

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630
you record whether anybody interacts
 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.719
you record whether anybody interacts
with it so in this case you might put a

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729
with it so in this case you might put a
 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.520
with it so in this case you might put a
box on the page that's a little comment

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530
box on the page that's a little comment
 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.810
box on the page that's a little comment
box and it's got a little button that

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820
box and it's got a little button that
 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.670
box and it's got a little button that
says add a comment and you let people

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680
says add a comment and you let people
 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.430
says add a comment and you let people
add a comment but instead of adding the

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
add a comment but instead of adding the
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.320
add a comment but instead of adding the
comment to the page immediately you

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330
comment to the page immediately you
 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.339
comment to the page immediately you
might just give the answer a nice

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349
might just give the answer a nice
 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.390
might just give the answer a nice
thank-you message saying you're

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400
thank-you message saying you're
 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.710
thank-you message saying you're
reviewing the comment and then you'd

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720
reviewing the comment and then you'd
 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.689
reviewing the comment and then you'd
send the comment in an email to you that

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699
send the comment in an email to you that
 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.370
send the comment in an email to you that
way you'd know whether anybody tried to

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380
way you'd know whether anybody tried to
 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.290
way you'd know whether anybody tried to
leave one it's a lot faster than

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300
leave one it's a lot faster than
 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.089
leave one it's a lot faster than
building the whole system you know with

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099
building the whole system you know with
 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.670
building the whole system you know with
flagging and blocking and moderation and

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680
flagging and blocking and moderation and
 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.740
flagging and blocking and moderation and
everything and then you know realizing

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750
everything and then you know realizing
 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.420
everything and then you know realizing
that nobody has anything to say that

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430
that nobody has anything to say that
 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.010
that nobody has anything to say that
makes sense so so that's a quick way to

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020
makes sense so so that's a quick way to
 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.450
makes sense so so that's a quick way to
validate now what if people actually

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
validate now what if people actually
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.560
validate now what if people actually
start leaving comments like they

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570
start leaving comments like they
 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.969
start leaving comments like they
actually engage with this feature yeah

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979
actually engage with this feature yeah
 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.589
actually engage with this feature yeah
so once you validated the people are

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599
so once you validated the people are
 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:44.960
so once you validated the people are
that people are interested in starting

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970
that people are interested in starting
 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.250
that people are interested in starting
this process and leaving comments

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260
this process and leaving comments
 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.560
this process and leaving comments
the next minimum viable product might be

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.570
the next minimum viable product might be
 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.939
the next minimum viable product might be
to see whether adding some of those

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949
to see whether adding some of those
 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.950
to see whether adding some of those
products to the page actually makes a

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960
products to the page actually makes a
 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.379
products to the page actually makes a
difference in your metrics huh so

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389
difference in your metrics huh so
 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:55.969
difference in your metrics huh so
remember you've got some comments that

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979
remember you've got some comments that
 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.860
remember you've got some comments that
people have emailed to you and so you

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:57.870
people have emailed to you and so you
 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.719
people have emailed to you and so you
can add those to the page by hand and

00:07:59.719 --> 00:07:59.729
can add those to the page by hand and
 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.060
can add those to the page by hand and
then do an a/b test to see if the

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.070
then do an a/b test to see if the
 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.980
then do an a/b test to see if the
comments you've added make a difference

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:03.990
comments you've added make a difference
 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.750
comments you've added make a difference
for example show the same page with

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:05.760
for example show the same page with
 

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.310
for example show the same page with
comments and without and see if more

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.320
comments and without and see if more
 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.320
comments and without and see if more
people buy on the page that has comments

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.330
people buy on the page that has comments
 

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
people buy on the page that has comments
that make sense so what you're saying is

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340
that make sense so what you're saying is
 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.830
that make sense so what you're saying is
that the idea if an MVP is to learn

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840
that the idea if an MVP is to learn
 

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.020
that the idea if an MVP is to learn
weather feature product is likely to

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.030
weather feature product is likely to
 

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.850
weather feature product is likely to
succeed before you actually put in the

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860
succeed before you actually put in the
 

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.890
succeed before you actually put in the
resources to completely build it yeah

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900
resources to completely build it yeah
 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.600
resources to completely build it yeah
that's exactly right that's a hundred

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.610
that's exactly right that's a hundred
 

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.189
that's exactly right that's a hundred
percent true and that's really what this

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199
percent true and that's really what this
 

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.870
percent true and that's really what this
whole thing is about that makes sense

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:23.880
whole thing is about that makes sense
 

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.990
whole thing is about that makes sense
so now after the MVP how do you know

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000
so now after the MVP how do you know
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.790
so now after the MVP how do you know
when your hypotheses and assumptions

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800
when your hypotheses and assumptions
 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.560
when your hypotheses and assumptions
have been validated that's an excellent

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:30.570
have been validated that's an excellent
 

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.510
have been validated that's an excellent
question and it's also a huge question

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520
question and it's also a huge question
 

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.570
question and it's also a huge question
with a lot of answers to it the

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:34.580
with a lot of answers to it the
 

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.220
with a lot of answers to it the
basic idea is that you have to be able

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:36.230
basic idea is that you have to be able
 

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.110
basic idea is that you have to be able
to measure your results in some way and

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120
to measure your results in some way and
 

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.430
to measure your results in some way and
if you can't tell what effect your

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
if you can't tell what effect your
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.050
if you can't tell what effect your
changes are having on real user behavior

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:41.060
changes are having on real user behavior
 

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.210
changes are having on real user behavior
you can't actually ever know whether

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.220
you can't actually ever know whether
 

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.400
you can't actually ever know whether
your design decisions were any good that

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.410
your design decisions were any good that
 

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.060
your design decisions were any good that
makes sense

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.070
makes sense
 

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.410
makes sense
so can you illustrate that with an

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:47.420
so can you illustrate that with an
 

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.330
so can you illustrate that with an
example sure so let's say you end up

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:49.340
example sure so let's say you end up
 

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.680
example sure so let's say you end up
shipping that comments feature that

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.690
shipping that comments feature that
 

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.150
shipping that comments feature that
we've been talking about you know in

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160
we've been talking about you know in
 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.410
we've been talking about you know in
most places you just ship the feature

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:53.420
most places you just ship the feature
 

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.060
most places you just ship the feature
and then move on to the next one but

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.070
and then move on to the next one but
 

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.590
and then move on to the next one but
what if for some reason that you don't

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600
what if for some reason that you don't
 

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.390
what if for some reason that you don't
necessarily understand when this feature

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:58.400
necessarily understand when this feature
 

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.210
necessarily understand when this feature
is out in the wild comments really end

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220
is out in the wild comments really end
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.010
is out in the wild comments really end
up hurting your product oh yeah I know

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.020
up hurting your product oh yeah I know
 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.440
