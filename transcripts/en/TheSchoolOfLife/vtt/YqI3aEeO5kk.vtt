I use a percolator because that's what we use in Italy and somebody told me that it burns the coffee

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.649
because the water's boiling. Is that carcinogenic?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.820
Which one of your exes would you like to go back and sleep with?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.930
Probably my

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.249
First proper boyfriend from when I was about 16, 17

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.379
Because I mean we didn't know anything then. We were really young and I'm just a lot better at sex now

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.379
and...

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.860
I think he probably would be too, and I wonder if that would have changed anything. Would you keep him as a 16 year old?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.490
(laughter)

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.729
Which colleague or professional contact

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.809
would you like to apologize to? Do you remember when I had that

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.059
secretary job after uni? I just couldn't handle getting all of these

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.839
invoices and like contracts my desk cuz I just didn't know what to do with them um

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.538
and eventually it just really started to stress me out, so I just used to shred everything.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540
What? You didn't. That's really bad. What?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.380
I just.. I just.. Did you get found out?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.660
No. Because I I left the job after three months and also I actually

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.449
and this is... I also emailed everybody on the mailing list saying: "I'm only here for the money-

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.429
I'm going down to book the tickets to Vietnam now", but I meant to send it to my cousin

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
But I sent it to every professional contact. Yeah, no I do feel bad for that actually

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.470
because it was a family friend who got me the job. I think should have apologized way sooner actually.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.470
(laughter)

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.380
Who is the most unlikely or unusual person you've masturbated to? -oh god

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
It's probably yeah a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.100
teacher I don't if I can even remember her name

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
I think you know..

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800
Mrs. Warnock

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.029
Just you know when I was still finding finding my feet masturbation-wise

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.700
In what way do you think you might be described as bad in bed by an uncharitable person? The fun never stops.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
No I'm joking. My mind tends to wander.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.960
Might start thinking about work..

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.700
Work?

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.880
Yeah...

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.220
Has someone called you out for that? Yes many times.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.920
What did you just pause and went and answered an email? Well I cuz if I have a thought?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.020
then I need to attend to it immediately so

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.830
I'll be like yeah, so I just need to send this email send this text or take this call

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.830
No. That's terrible.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.270
So yeah

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.320
How long are you having sex for that you can take time off in the middle?

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.779
Yeah, well this does say uncharitable

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.429
so yes this going on for awhile. -And it's good to know that I'm I can call you at any time and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.869
And what about you does your partner not understand?

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.440
Nothing! You understand me completely.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060
But I

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.850
No something that's come up recently I do feel that yeah when I'm flirting I am known to be quite a flirty person

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.690
And obviously I've got a little male friends, and I think sometimes you ah you get really possessive

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500
Really possessive

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.870
Sorry I mean.. but but you know and I think it's important for my sense of

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.359
autonomy, my sense of potency to, you know feel desired by

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.090
More people than just you

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.079
Yeah, I think that's.. I do find it uhh I don't really have

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.030
lots of female friends, maybe that's it and I just like I

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.049
guess just find it weird to know where the line is

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.530
I'd like if you flirted more. I mean not with... -You can flirt with me -No -Yeah should I flirt with you?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.719
But would make me feel like you are actually desirable.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.439
