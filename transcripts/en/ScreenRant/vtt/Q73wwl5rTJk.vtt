00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.130
Writing a movie is a tough task, and arguably
the hardest part of that is coming up with

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.670
a memorable ending to your story.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.520
When everything in the film has been leading
up to this one final moment, you need to deliver

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.110
the goods or it’s going to derail the project
before it even hits theatres.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.920
Sometimes the script will go through a few
revisions, leaving some tantalizing conclusions

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.740
that never see the light of day.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.790
Here are Screen Rant’s 5 Amazing Movie Endings
That You’ve Never Seen.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.550
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.550
Terminator 2 essentially ends its story, with
the heroes stopping the creation of Skynet

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.470
and preventing Judgment Day from happening.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.660
Still, James Cameron ended his sequel with
an ambiguous shot of a dark highway as Sarah

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.940
Connor questioned the future of humanity.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.510
Originally, things were a little more clear
cut, skipping ahead to 2027 and society was

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.800
operating as normal.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.510
Sarah was a grandmother, and an adult John
was serving as a U.S. Senator.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.430
It would have been a nice way to end the narrative,
and would have made any more sequels completely

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.560
unnecessary.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.070
Given how those turned out, we doubt many
would have complained.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.070
I Am Legend

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.040
The I Am Legend viewers saw in the theater
was very different from the one they watched

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.040
at home.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.600
The theatrical cut ended with Robert Neville
sacrificing himself so Anna can escape with

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
the cure and save humanity.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.659
But the original ending available on the DVD
is regarded as the stronger of the two.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.530
Following the source material more closely,
it sees Neville’s arc come to a close in

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.110
a more emotional way, realizing that the “monsters”
he’s hunting are living people with feelings

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.290
and that he is the legend of their horror
stories.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
It was poignant and heartfelt, and may have
elevated this to sci-fi’s elite if it stayed

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.689
in the final cut.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.689
28 Days Later

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.900
Danny Boyle’s post-apocalyptic horror flick
painted a horrifying picture of a crumbling

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.340
society, reinvigorating the zombie genre as
a result.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.380
For all its terrifying scenarios and bleak
settings, 28 Days Later ends on a positive

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.470
note, with survivors Jim, Hannah, and Selena
all being rescued.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.619
But Boyle preferred the original ending, which
saw Jim die in a hospital after being shot,

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.049
leaving his two friends to move on by themselves.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.659
Test audiences found it too dark, so the more
uplifting conclusion was shot.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.340
The grim finale may have been more appropriate
tonally, but after spending the whole film

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.790
with Jim, it was nice to see him escape.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.090
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.780
When his girlfriend Gwen Stacey dies, Peter
Parker is left without a purpose in his life.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.540
Depressed, he even stops being Spider-Man,
until he watches Gwen’s high school graduation

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.730
speech for inspiration.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.880
In an alternate ending, Peter got emotional
support from a different source: his father.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840
Coming out of hiding to be there for his son,
Richard Parker gives Peter the encouragement

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.540
he needs to keep moving forward and help protect
the world with his abilities.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.510
The twist may have been jarring, but it provided
a heartfelt moment and skipped over that bad

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.510
Rhino fight.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.460
We’d call that a win-win any day of the
week.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.460
First Blood

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.900
Starting the Rambo franchise, First Blood
is thought to be a great depiction of PTSD

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.739
in the Vietnam War era and a standout vehicle
for Sylvester Stallone, who delivered one

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.440
of his finer dramatic performances.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.990
The film took its original ending from the
novel on which it was based, where John Rambo

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.330
committed suicide to escape his personal turmoil.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.570
However, test audiences deemed it too depressing,
and the conclusion was rewritten so that Rambo

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.570
lived.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.519
Having the hero die would have been a somber
way to end this journey, denying audiences

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.319
the catharsis of seeing Rambo escape from
his oppressors – and we wouldn’t get sequels.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.659
Those are our picks for alternate endings
that would have drastically altered movies.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.370
Are there any we missed?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.270
