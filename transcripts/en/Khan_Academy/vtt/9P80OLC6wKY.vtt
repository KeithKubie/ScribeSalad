00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.940
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.910
So 0.8, the 8 right over
here is in the tenths place.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.100
It is the tenths place.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.000
So you could read
this as 8 tenths.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.860
And we can write that literally
as being equal to 8 tenths,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.136
or 8 over 10.

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.760
And now we've already written it
as a fraction, and if we want,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.170
we can simplify this down.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.850
Both 8 and 10 share
common factors.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.620
They are both divisible by 2.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.290
So lets divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.536
by 2.

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.410
We are not changing the
value of the fraction

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.993
because we are dividing both the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:38.980
by the same thing.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.660
8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided
by 2 is 5, and we're done.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.069
0.8 is the same thing as 8/10,
which is the same thing as 4/5.
