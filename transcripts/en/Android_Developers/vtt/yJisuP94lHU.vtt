00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.410
VINCENZO COLUCCI: Being a
developer is not only to code.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.370
You need to put something
of you, make it personal.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.182
And I think that it gives you
the same power of an inventor.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.890
AARON MARSHALL: I am
in a tiny percentage

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.790
of people in the world that can
literally work from anywhere.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.144
And I experienced an
amazing new freedom.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.490
MOR SHANI: Our dream was to be
an amazing and inspiring game

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.340
company.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.580
Pirate King was the first game
that we created all in house,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.220
five people just
making the game.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.890
For us, this experience
was very important.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.390
JOHN EARNER: I kind
of realized if I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.670
was going to make mobile games,
the only way I was going to do

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.950
it was starting my own studio.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.747
And as a founder, you only
have yourself to blame,

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.038
which I find pretty liberating.

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:53.810
JOHAN ATTBY: I saw
a couple of friends

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.250
starting their companies.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.530
And I'm super
competitive, so I decided

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.660
to leave my career
as a scientist

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.340
and become an entrepreneur.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.170
I decided to go for the
biggest hobby, sport fishing.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.980
Fishbrain is a social
network, so anglers globally

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.170
can log their catches.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.820
They can share their
catchers, sort of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.800
brag about their catches.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.792
It feels great to be
back in Stockholm again,

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:16.750
because you can actually
develop something here

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.666
that is used globally.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.480
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Growing up, I always

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.930
wanted to be a medical doctor.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.690
But when I got to
high school, I noticed

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.740
that to innovate in a
medical space you need

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.050
like 30 years of experience.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.810
But with mobile technology,
I can innovate and actually

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.630
generate change in people's
lives a lot faster.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.520
Giftedmom is a social enterprise
to improve maternal and infant

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.120
health.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.780
MALE SPEAKER 2: Maternal
mortality, infant mortality

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.100
is a worldwide problem.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800
One of our objectives
is like, not only

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.925
to concentrate in Cameroon,
but spread this concept

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:49.270
to other developing countries.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.686
MALE SPEAKER 1: We've noticed
that 70% of smartphone users

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:53.380
across Africa are on Android.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.121
I want to leverage on this to
have a huge number of users.

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.370
MALE SPEAKER 2: The beginning
was really an adventure.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.550
But when we built it
up and started testing,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.602
it was really exciting
because the reaction

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.060
of those who were using the
app-- all of them were shocked.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.790
It makes me really proud.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.440
And it's also like motivation
to keep moving forward, yeah?

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.530
MALE SPEAKER 1: Each
time a woman in this era

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.050
just loads the application,
and we see popping up,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.969
Giftedmom, it's like, this
is just it's joy, man.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.760
And you're like, I'm
going to go do better.

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:25.510
AYNUR ABDULNASYROV: I grew
up in a small town called

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.800
[? Deartulli. ?] And
then, I understood

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.300
that education is
the way to grow,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.660
so I started learning English.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.340
Lingualeo is the next level for
interactive language learning

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.940
worldwide.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.890
The first time I saw
somebody using the app,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.900
it was in the Moscow tube.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.400
And it was a real
excitement, because when

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.680
you start understanding
that there are like millions

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.490
of people who got their English
better because of the app, then

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.330
you understand
that it's actually

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.881
changed the world a bit.

00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:04.610
CHRIS WAWRZINEK:
When I was a child,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.870
I was really inspired
by the combination

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.090
of gaming and building things.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.840
I'm a lawyer and work
together with my brother

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.727
who is a dentist.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.560
KAI WAWRZINEK: When we
were kids, both of us

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.622
were really attached to gaming.

00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:19.080
My brother was a
little bit better,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.350
but I could beat
him because I was

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.010
the one who was able to
hack the toplists and so on.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.010
So I was kind of
cheating a little bit.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.422
That was kind of the
beginning of my gaming career.

00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:30.380
CHRIS WAWRZINEK: We
founded together a company.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.550
And when we started the
company, it was a big step.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.810
We grew out of the garage
of my parents' house

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.790
and really professionalized
the company,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.530
getting all the best people
gathered in one place,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.970
and trying to make a
better and a better game.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.890
The vision for us is becoming
one of the world's leading game

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.390
companies.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.660
OLIVIER JEANNEL: I grew up
with over 80% hearing loss.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.660
That hasn't stopped me
from doing so many things

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.790
in my life.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.840
Being an entrepreneur allows
me to have the sense of freedom

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.180
and doing what I want.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.150
And I knew that I could do
something about accessibility

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.260
in telecommunications
to deaf people.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.610
Rogervoice is an app that
allows deaf people to make

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.850
phone calls.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.620
There's people in
Canada trying the app.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.430
There's people in Kuwait.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.577
There's somebody in Japan.

00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:18.160
These people I have never met,
but they're reaching out to me.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.680
And they're like,
I need this app.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.879
And they go onto the
GooglePlay store.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.420
They download it
and they try it out.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.050
And then they e-mail me.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.508
And they are like,
this is amazing.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:30.120
JOHN EARNER: You walk
into a new place that's

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.120
three times the size of
the office we're in now,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.676
and you can't
imagine filling it.

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:35.050
A year and a half
ago, I remember

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.883
walking into this office
here in Soho Square

00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:37.980
and feeling the same way.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.420
It's both an
exhilarating feeling

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.060
to realize that
we've made it so far,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.630
and also there's so far to go.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.088
The Winston Churchill
quote I guess

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:47.950
would be appropriate-- "We're
at the end of the beginning."

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.830
MOR SHANI: When we
started Pirate King,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.980
we had 200 installs a day.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.630
Today, we have over
200,000 installs a day.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.100
It's been an incredible journey
for us, growing from 5 people

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.896
to 30 people, from small offices
to bigger, improving the team

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.270
and bringing more
amazing people.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.770
This is something
really exciting,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.390
and we can't wait to bring more
amazing games to our community

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.854
and to the world.

00:05:13.854 --> 00:05:15.770
AARON MARSHALL: Around
Over, we have a mantra.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.480
We like to say, go
big and go home.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.120
We don't think you should
be sacrificing your family

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.910
in order to make some wealth
or create value or change

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.349
the world.

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.140
What good is it to have
all of those things

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.473
if you don't have a family
to then share in that success

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:29.762
with?

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:31.720
MALE SPEAKER 3: I think
[INAUDIBLE] is actually

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.680
the products of [INAUDIBLE]
more exported in the world.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.410
VINCENZO COLUCCI:
Success for me is doing

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.890
what you want with your life.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.450
For me, it's living in
my city, with my parents,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.080
with my girlfriend and be happy.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.310
And I can do it by
being a developer.
