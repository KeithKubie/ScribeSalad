However, just having one or even two of these four D's doesn't typically mean

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:10.203
it's classified as a disorder. Moreover, if a behavior is culturally accepted,

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:15.275
it cannot be a disorder. For example, in some indigenous cultures Shamen ingest

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:20.410
hallucinogenic mushrooms in order to experience hallucinations. That's

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.270
acceptable in that culture and therefore wouldn't be considered a disorder.
