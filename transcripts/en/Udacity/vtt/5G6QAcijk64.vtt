Great job.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.250
We covered a lot of
ground in this session.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.280
Loops are an extremely important
part of Ruby, and in my opinion,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.760
it's where programming really
starts to get exciting.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.550
If you're still feeling shaky on all
the different loops we've covered,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.480
feel free to repeat, repeat,
repeat this session.
