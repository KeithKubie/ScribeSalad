* Intro Music *

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.160
So you had a night out and woke up feeling...

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.600
not so great. The solution?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.280
stop drinking until next week when it happens all over again.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.800
It's inevitable and you know it.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.760
And while there are many pills and myths that claim to do the job,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.600
here are the actual scientifically proven tips to help handle your hangover.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.800
Before you start drinking, eat fatty foods and carbs.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.440
I'm sure you wanna look slim on your night out, but the fact is,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.220
fatty foods slow down the absorption of alcohol into your body,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.320
and help lessen stomach irritation.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.580
While carbs prevent low blood sugar and ease nausea.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.380
Which means ex-neigh on they vomit-ey.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.260
This also gives your body more time to process the harmful by-products of alcohol which can be explained in a previous video, here.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.040
One of the main reasons for your hangover.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.220
Next, Water.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.980
Water is your best friend before, during and after drinking.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
Alcohol is a diuretic, which means you'll be peeing out more fluid than your taking in.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.700
And with less water in your body, your other organs start to steal it from the brain, causing it to literally shrink, which causes headaches.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.200
Ouch!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.820
So while your drinking, have another drink of water.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.140
And do yourself a favour by choosing lighter coloured liquors.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.840
Dark drinks like red wine, bourbon, brandy and whisky contain higher concentrations of something called 'Congeners'.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.820
These congeners act as extra toxic chemicals your body has to eliminate.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.980
And while beer doesn't fit in this catagory, the age-old rhyme, beer before liquor, never been sicker, does apply.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.520
Carbonation, like that in beer or soda pop, increases the rate of absorption of alcohol causing a worse hangover.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.440
After the bar, more water.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640
You may be peeing all night but it's better than your head exploding tomorrow morning.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.420
Aspirin before bed is also helpful, its non-caffeinated and inhibites the release of something called 'Prostaglandin' which has been shown to contribute to hangovers.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.820
But still, stay away from Acetaminophen, most commonly called Tylenol in North America.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.540
Acetaminophen is extremely harsh on your liver and in combination with alcohol could do some severe damage.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.200
In the morning, your breakfast can make all the difference.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.420
Eggs contain Cysteine, an amino acid, which is required in the breakdown of alcohol to acetate.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.660
Bananas contain potassium which is essential for brain, muscle and body function.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.160
And fruit juice contains vitamins and Fructose, or fruit sugar, which gives you energy and increases the rate of which your body excretes toxins.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240
But perhaps the most important rule; Know Your Limit.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.880
There are major differences between genders, races and individuals when it comes to alcohol.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.440
But by using these simple strategies in the right order, you'll be on the road to avoiding those pounding hangovers.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.840
Until next week...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.040
And you do it again...

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.220
Got a burning question you want answered?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.840
