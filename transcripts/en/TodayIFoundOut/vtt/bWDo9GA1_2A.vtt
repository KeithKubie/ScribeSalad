00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello everybody, just before we get started
I wanted to say that this is something entirely

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.420
new a regular Today I Found Out video will
follow so do not worry if you're looking for

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.990
your TIFO fix that will come later today.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.519
For now this is a new experimental series
of videos we're trying.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.850
It's called This Day in History and if you
couldn't guess from the title, we're looking

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.980
at this day in history.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.609
This is June 1st.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.010
So, let's crack on, I'd love to know what
you think.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.779
Let me know in the comments below, also give
it a like if you like it.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050
You know, it's all a work in progress.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.660
So, let us know how we're doing.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.320
So, today we're looking at the Heimlich Maneuver.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.180
According to various interviews given by Dr
Henry Heimlich during his lifetime (he passed

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.530
away in 2016 at age 96), the eponymous maneuver
he championed in the 1970s is responsible

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.340
for saving the lives of tens of thousands
of people and a not insignificant number of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.340
dogs...

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.840
The genesis of the Heimlich maneuver can be
traced back to 1972 when Dr. Heimlich, who

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.360
was a Cincinnati-based thoracic surgeon at
the time before getting fired a couple years

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.980
later, read an article in the New York Times
that revealed that over 3,000 people in the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.060
United States died from choking on food in
that year alone.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.740
At the time, the general consensus among medical
professionals was that the best way for a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.990
layman to help a choking person was to slap
them very hard on the back several times.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.710
Heimlich, being an expert on all things chest-related,
reasoned that a better method would be to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.880
more directly leverage the air in the lungs
to force the blockage out.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.850
Basically, if you put pressure on the lungs,
the sealed balloon-like organ would naturally

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.800
provide the force necessary to dislodge the
food.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.850
To test his hypothesis he couldn't exactly
go around getting humans to choke, so Heimlich

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.690
started by doing this to beagles.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.030
Specifically, Heimlich and his team put small
tubes in the dogs' throats that made it difficult,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.120
though not impossible, to breathe.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.630
Once the dogs were choking, initially he experimented
with pressure to the chest itself to expel

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.750
the tube, but found this ineffective.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.520
In further experiments, Heimlich noticed that
if he pressed on the dog’s diaphragm just

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.920
right, thus compressing its lungs, the tube
would sometimes even violently be dislodged.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.010
In fact, he noted on some test runs that the
tube would fly out of the dogs' mouths and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190
travel several feet across the room.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.650
You might at this point be wondering if things
ever went wrong in the experiment, resulting

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.780
in significant harm or death of a dog; Heimlich
claims none of the dogs suffered any lasting

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.770
injury and removal of the tube was a straightforward
process- you just grab the tube and pull it

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.690
out if things got dicey.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.040
After perfecting the technique for dislodging
tubes, Heimlich then began a slightly more

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.680
dangerous procedure, giving the dogs comically
large chunks of meat to eat- meat the dogs

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.739
occasionally choked on, allowing him to perform
the technique under more realistic conditions.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.830
(Again, he claims no dogs were permanently
hurt as a result of these experiments.)

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.270
After adapting the technique for humans, Heimlich
felt this method needed to be widely disseminated

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.830
to save lives immediately, rather than going
through the normal medical research progression

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.360
including publishing a peer-reviewed study.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.670
After all, it might have taken years to prove
the efficacy of the technique over existing

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.460
recommendations and then very likely many
years more before any official medical body

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.651
would recommend it to the public, if it all.

00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:38.720
And so it was that on this day in history,
June 1, 1974, Heimlich published an article

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.850
titled, Pop Goes the Café Coronary, in Emergency
Medicine.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.099
(For reference here, Café Coronary is just
a bit of a slang way to say cardiac arrest

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.020
as a result of choking on food.)

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.800
Heimlich also pulled some strings to have
a friend who wrote for the Chicago Daily News

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.959
get the article published there, with the
friend explicitly noting, "Dr. Heimlich doesn't

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.210
know that his method will save a choking person..."
but then going on to recommend trying anyway.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.599
As to the original article, Heimlich does
note, "It's been tested only on dogs but I

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.519
believe the logic of the concept and the favorable
findings warrant public dissemination..."

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.519
He goes on:

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.409
Since aspiration must occur during inspiration
in order for the bolus to be sucked against

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.639
the laryngeal orifice, the victim's lungs
are expanded at the time of the accident - actually

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.749
there is always residual air in the lung - so
sudden forceful compression of the lungs will

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:35.430
increase the air pressure within the trachea
and larynx and thus eject the offending bolus

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.199
like the cork from a champagne bottle.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.650
There, in short, are the dynamics of the procedure.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.159
And here's how to do it:

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.930
Standing behind the victim, the rescuer puts
both arms around him just above the belt line,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.830
allowing head, arms, and upper torso to hang
forward.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.509
Then, grasping his own right wrist with his
left hand, the rescuer rapidly and strongly

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.960
presses into the victim's abdomen, forcing
the diaphragm upward, compressing the lungs,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.229
and expelling the obstructing bolus.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.619
The same effect can be obtained with the victim
lying face down on the floor, the rescuer

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:09.810
sitting astride the victim's lower torso or
buttocks.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.720
If, however, the victim is already lying on
his back, he needn't be moved.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.769
The rescuer merely sits astride him and suddenly
presses both hands - one on top of the other

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:22.009
- forcefully into the upper subdiaphragmatic
abdominal region...

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.719
We cannot be certain, of course, that the
experimental results will be duplicated in

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.719
humans.

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.889
But when tracheostomy is not feasible, there
is certainly no risk in recommending that

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.129
the procedure be tried in actual cafe coronary
emergencies since an unaided victim will die

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.129
in minutes.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.939
Then, as experiences are reported, the method
can be evaluated.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.039
Only by disseminating public information about
this simple technique can we determine whether

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.020
it will result in a significant reduction
of what amounts to 3900 totally avoidable

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.880
deaths every year.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.990
This article, or snippets of it, quickly got
re-published in hundreds of newspapers throughout

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.270
the United States.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.860
Within weeks, reports began pouring in from
people across the United States about how

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.710
the technique was saving lives.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.210
Later that year, the Journal of the American
Medical Association called Heimlich and told

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.490
him they were going to name the technique
after him.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.210
After vetoing the name The Heimlich Method,
Heimlich settled on The Heimlich Maneuver,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.339
which he felt was “more appropriate”.

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:25.580
Naturally, given a lack of hard evidence supporting
his method in favor of existing recommendations,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.259
institutions such as the American Red Cross
chose not to initially recommend the Heimlich

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.550
maneuver, which in turn caused Heimlich to
decide to market it himself, including selling

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.860
shirts and posters, and even going on The
Tonight Show to demonstrate it on Golden Globe

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.360
award winner Angie Dickinson.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.539
At this point you might be wondering if this
method actually is superior to the former

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.589
widespread recommendation of just hard back
slaps.

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:54.389
It turns out this is remarkably difficult
to say, though perhaps that shouldn't be unexpected

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:00.319
given to study the matter in a scientifically
rigorous fashion on humans isn't really ethically

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.379
possible.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:08.060
As for statistics, when Heimlich first got
his bright idea a little over 3,000 people

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.889
per year died from choking in the United States.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.909
In the two decades following the widespread
use of the Heimlich, the number of choking

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.749
deaths in the U.S. stayed approximately the
same as it was before…

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:27.009
Later, in 2000, there was a rather curious
sudden jump from 1995's 3,185 to 2000's 4,313

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.229
deaths.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:34.499
The number stayed mostly stable until 2010
when it further jumped to 4,570, with it rising

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:40.110
a bit since, with the high mark here on choking
deaths in the United States occurring in 2015

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.139
at 5,051 people.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:48.860
Given the lack of hard evidence supporting
the Heimlich over back slaps, starting in

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.669
2006, the American Red Cross, besides still
recommending first encouraging the person

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:57.289
to cough if they can and having someone call
911, they actually switched to recommending

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:01.839
back slaps before trying the Heimlich and
then alternating between the two at five times

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:02.839
each.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.729
As for the reason for adding the back slaps
back in, according to American Red Cross representative

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:11.460
Mike Higgins, Red Cross officials determined
that, to quote, "the body of scientific evidence

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.319
now states that the use of more than one method
[is] most effective in helping a person who

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.710
has an obstructed airway..."

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.430
Of note here is that the American Red Cross
(while being a very reputable organization)

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.740
is not part of ILCOR (The International Liaison
Committee on Resuscitation)- basically, the

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.649
group most all trained emergency medical providers
throughout the world use when recommending

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.979
guidelines for treating people in emergency
situations.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:39.330
On that note, the American Heart Association
is part of ILCOR and recommends in choking

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.960
situations that both medical professionals
and laymen perform the Heimlich on a conscious

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.280
person and chest compressions (the same ones
as in CPR) on an unconscious person.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.510
If this is unsuccessful at dislodging the
blocking object, medical professionals are

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.390
then trained to perform a cricothyrotomy (cutting
a hole in the neck), which, of course, is

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.000
not something untrained individuals should
try.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.920
Should you be the one choking and you’re
by yourself, researchers at the Royal Brompton

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.320
Hospital found that self-administered abdominal
thrusts produced just as much intrathoracic

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.260
pressure as when someone else does it.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.220
And for maximum effect, they found doing the
abdominal thrusts via forcibly collapsing

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.870
your abdomen on the back of a chair produced
the highest intrathoracic pressure of all.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.050
Going back to back slaps and the Red Cross'
recommendations, Heimlich stated, "I have

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.730
no desire to diminish the good work that the
American Red Cross has done, such as in times

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.080
of natural disasters, but telling people to
hit a choking person on the back could potentially

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080
lead to death.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.960
The Red Cross should do what the American
Heart Association does—recommend the Heimlich

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960
Maneuver…”

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.830
He then elaborated, "It’s been scientifically
proven that hitting a choking person on the

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.300
back can drive an object that is partially
blocking the airway more deeply into the throat."

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.100
It is not entirely clear as to what studies
he's referring to that supposedly scientifically

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.530
proved this is the case.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.390
That said, at least when talking comparing
the two with regard to internal pressure,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:09.060
a 1982 Yale study, Choking: The Heimlich Abdominal
Thrust vs Back Blows: An Approach to Measurement

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.050
of Inertial and Aerodynamic Forces, determined
the Heimlich produces significantly more intrathoracic

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.960
pressure than back slaps.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.580
It is noted, however, that this study was
partially funded by the Dysphagia Foundation

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.200
Inc. of Cincinnati Inc., later renamed the
Heimlich Institute.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.650
That said, just because Heimlich helped fund
the study, doesn't necessarily mean the results

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.310
were inaccurate, and the three Yale researchers
involved, Richard L. Day, Edmund S. Crelin

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.540
and Arthur B. DuBois, would later state that
their research was completely independently

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.430
performed with no oversight or pressure from
Heimlich.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.660
DuBois further stated the experiment was rather
straightforward and easily verifiable by others,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.800
simply measuring air pressure out of the mouths
of subjects when the researchers performed

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.300
back blows and abdominal thrusts.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.790
In response, representatives from the Red
Cross noted that the point of the back blow

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.830
is more for the jarring effect to dislodge
the stuck object, rather than creating an

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.360
artificial cough using air pressure to dislodge
it as in abdominal thrusts- hence their recommendation

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.390
to do both methods.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.740
As for one Dr. Roger White of the Mayo Clinic
and American Heart Association, he states

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.540
of his opinion of Heimlich and his work, "There
was never any science here.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.760
Heimlich overpowered science all along the
way with his slick tactics and intimidation,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.910
and everyone, including us at the AHA, caved
in."

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.580
Heimlich's son, Peter Heimlich also had less
than glowing reviews of his father's assertions,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.980
stating, his father was "a spectacular con
man and serial liar..."

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.620
Peter has since dedicated years of his life
to debunking many of the things Dr. Heimlich

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.760
would say publicly.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.110
That said, it is almost universally thought
among medical professionals that the Heimlich

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:49.690
maneuver is a fantastic tool to help choking
victims until medical professionals arrive.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.360
And, as noted, even those medical professionals
will usually start by attempting the Heimlich

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.920
or chest compressions before moving on to
other methods at their disposal for saving

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.920
a choking person.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.850
But while the Heimlich Maneuver itself has
been a boon to the world of choking victims,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.130
earning Heimlich more than a little positive
fame, Heimlich's later career was marked with

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.661
controversy owing to doing things like publicly
championing the Heimlich maneuver to help

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:13.650
people suffering from asthma attacks, heart
attacks, and cystic fibrosis, as well as advocating

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.250
its use with drowning victims.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.400
The last one there caught on somewhat, owing
to seeming to make sense on the surface- trying

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.180
to force the water out of the lungs.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.820
However, the American Red Cross Advisory Council
notes, “Studies have shown that there is

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.390
no need to clear the airway of aspirated water.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.570
Only a modest amount of water is aspirated
by the majority of drowning victims and it

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.220
is rapidly absorbed into the central circulation.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.180
Therefore, it does not act as an obstruction
in the trachea...

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.730
An attempt to remove water from the breathing
passages by any means other than suction...

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.370
are unnecessary and potentially dangerous.”

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.460
With the danger here noted as potentially
causing physical injury, vomiting and potential

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.270
subsequent aspiration, and the fact that doing
this delays the gold standard recommendation

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:03.050
to the public here in cases of an unconscious
drowning victim who isn't breathing- CPR until

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.280
professional medical aid arrives or the person
is revived.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.030
(Although, to be fair here, proper administration
of CPR is guaranteed to also cause physical

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.830
injury via breaking the cartilage that attaches
the ribs to the sternum in an attempt to compress

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.130
the heart, but in this case actually for a
proven effective purpose.)

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.830
As with its use in aiding choking victims,
it doesn't appear as if Heimlich took the

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.270
time to do the necessary research to definitively
show the Heimlich maneuver is actually more

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.690
helpful than standard recommendations in these
cases before widely publicizing it as such

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.790
in the media.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:39.070
This was succinctly pointed out by cardiologist
Dr. Joseph Ornato, who stated of the controversy,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.690
"Dr. Heimlich is trying to force the medical
community to adopt a measure that is lacking

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.900
in adequate scientific foundation.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:51.010
But if studies show he is right, I'd be the
first one to want to apply it."

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.720
Later, much more controversially, Heimlich,
in conjunction with the Heimlich Institute

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.430
and doctors from China and Ethiopia, were
intentionally infecting people that had AIDS

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.590
with malaria and then not treating them for
the malaria until the disease had progressed

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.210
to a critical state...

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.950
Known as malariotherapy, the idea here was
to try to cure the person of HIV by raising

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:18.210
the body temperature to extreme levels via
a malaria induced fever for an extended period.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.390
These extreme high fevers potentially would
be allowed to be maintained even for weeks

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:28.860
without treatment, with the hope that the
HIV would not survive such a scenario.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.230
Not without precedent, in 1927 this was a
Nobel Prize winning treatment for syphilis,

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.790
but in this case the experiments the Heimlich
Institute were involved with were considered

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.820
too dangerous, unethically administered, and
with little hope that it would actually do

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.650
anything beneficial.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.650
Heimlich's response: "If all of your peers
understand what you've done, you haven't been

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.430
creative."
