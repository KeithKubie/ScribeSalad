00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.900
Let's see the answers. Buy more powerful

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.160
hardware. Yes. That could certainly help, but it

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.970
will not provide unlimited scalability. What about optimizing

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.590
the software? Yes. That could certainly also help.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.270
But that, will not provide unlimited scalability either.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.750
Copy and run software on more servers. Well,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.230
normally, software cannot just be copied, and run

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.520
on more servers. To be able to run

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.590
on more servers, you typically have to change

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.200
the software, so this option is also an alternative.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240
In fact, if you can change your software to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.610
run on more servers, you are starting to work

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.710
with the scalable architecture. This is because the capacity

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.380
will not be limited by the hardware you use,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.090
or how much you can optimize your software. When

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.640
you need to scale, you can add more servers.
