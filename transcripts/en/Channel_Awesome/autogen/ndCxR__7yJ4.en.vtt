set it back in time you could argue that
 

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.810 align:start position:0%
set it back in time you could argue that
it's<00:21:36.690><c> a</c><00:21:36.870><c> tie</c><00:21:37.230><c> it's</c><00:21:37.680><c> a</c><00:21:37.830><c> period</c><00:21:38.250><c> piece</c><00:21:38.280><c> where</c><00:21:38.700><c> you</c>

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
it's a tie it's a period piece where you
 

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's a tie it's a period piece where you
just<00:21:39.000><c> remove</c><00:21:39.660><c> some</c><00:21:39.690><c> of</c><00:21:40.020><c> the</c><00:21:40.140><c> gritty</c><00:21:40.410><c> elements</c>

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.010 align:start position:0%
just remove some of the gritty elements
 

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
just remove some of the gritty elements
