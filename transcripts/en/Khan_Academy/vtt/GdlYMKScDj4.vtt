00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:02.408
- [Narrator] Let's now continue
with our super fast journey

00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:04.476
through history.

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:05.796
And one thing I want to point out,

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:08.039
because I already touched
on it in the previous video,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.297
is while we talk about
this ancient history,

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:15.681
I'm also referring to some
stories from the Old Testament.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.205
So let's call that religion.

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:20.093
Now, the reason why
I'm doing it is because

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:24.129
religion is such a big
part of our modern culture,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:25.789
it's clearly, especially
the Old Testament,

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.737
is the basis of three major
world religions today,

00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:32.191
and so it can help us hopefully
create a little bit more

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.635
of a narrative in our head on
some of these ancient events,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.645
because a lot of these events
described in the Old Testament

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.833
have a historical context.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:44.583
There was a Babylon, there
was a Neo-Babylonian Empire.

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:46.533
We're gonna talk about
Nebuchadnezzar in this video.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.505
There were pharaohs,
these things are described

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:51.194
in the Old Testament.

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.542
Now, there's other things
in the Old Testament

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.213
that have less of a historical context,

00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:57.659
where we really don't have evidence yet

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.400
of did they happen, or
did they happen in the way

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.795
that is described in the Old Testament?

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.170
We might be able to find
that evidence over time.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.299
And then there's clearly a lot of events

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.121
that are not described
in the Old Testament,

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.654
but we are able to find evidence,

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.258
we're able to find documents,
writing, hieroglyphs,

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:18.899
we're able to find artifacts
and date those artifacts,

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.393
we're able to find ruins.

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.750
And the fun of history is
to try to figure out, well,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.285
what do we know and what do we not know,

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.104
and can we construct
narratives that make sense?

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.600
And over time, whether
we're talking about events

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.094
that are referred to in the Old Testament,

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.684
or things where there's a
large historical basis for it,

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:39.290
as we understand more, these
dots might change a little bit,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.487
or at least our understanding
of how they occurred

00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:42.734
or the causality.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.643
So that's one of the really
fun things in history,

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:46.462
and I encourage you, everything
that you hear me say,

00:01:46.462 --> 00:01:49.079
don't take it for granted,
look it up yourself,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.865
and come to your own conclusions.

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:54.087
So with that said, let's continue,

00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:56.067
and I'll review a little
bit from the previous video.

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:58.136
We're in 1700 B.C..

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:02.588
It's the time of Hammurabi,
you have the code of Hammurabi,

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:05.421
famous, famous, as a written code,

00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:08.435
a written code of laws.

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:13.685
Now, we believe, if
the stories of Abraham,

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.150
because there are parallels
between the Old Testament

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.614
and the code of Hammurabi,

00:02:18.614 --> 00:02:23.194
it has often placed Abraham,
as a biblical figure,

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:27.361
is often placed in or shortly
after the time of Hammurabi.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:30.413
And so it's Abraham of Ur,

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:35.580
and this migration to Canaan,
which would eventually become

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:41.126
the kingdom of Judea and Israel,

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:45.796
modern-day where the states
of Israel and Palestine are,

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:49.963
that migration, people place
it at around 1200, or sorry,

00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:53.807
at around 1700 B.C.E.,

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.849
once again, roughly in
the time of Hammurabi.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.133
Now, we don't know this.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.244
There is not a lot of
historical evidence here,

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:03.760
but it fits kind of
the historical context,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.927
especially with the code,
with the code of Hammurabi.

00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:12.412
Now, we fast forward a few hundred years,

00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.735
and now we're firmly on
the side of religion,

00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:18.002
where these are stories
from the Old Testament.

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.690
We haven't found a lot of
historical evidence yet

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.954
of the migration of the
Jewish people to Egypt,

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.046
the famous story of Joseph.

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.159
So that's the migration, which is placed,

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.326
tends to be placed around 1500 B.C.E..

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.464
1500 B.C.E.,

00:03:37.964 --> 00:03:40.692
and once again, I'm gonna
put a question mark here.

00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:42.450
And so when we look at our timeline,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.875
this is Abraham going from Mesopotamia

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:49.490
and then to what is now,
or to establish this tribe

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.708
in what eventually becomes Judea, Israel.

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:55.524
They're there for several hundred years,

00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:58.387
you have the story of
Joseph, Abraham's grandson,

00:03:58.387 --> 00:04:00.251
he becomes a vizier of the pharaoh,

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.711
his family eventually joins him,

00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:03.531
but then the Jewish people get enslaved,

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.013
according to the Old Testament,

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:07.526
for several hundred years,
until they are freed

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.904
in the Book of Exodus by Moses,

00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:12.866
and they are led back to Judea.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:16.466
And so this part right over
here, we are definitely,

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.957
let me circle that in a color you can see.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.041
This part right over here,

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.082
we're definitely operating outside of

00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:23.276
a lot of historical evidence.

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:27.443
But we believe that the exodus
from Egypt back to Judea,

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:32.579
this is often placed around 1200 B.C.E..

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:37.766
So I know my map is
getting a little bit...

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:40.500
1200 B.C.E., and once again,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.784
I'm gonna put a question mark there,

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:43.366
because we don't really know.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.315
But that's where we believe that the,

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:48.809
what was essentially the
tribe of Jewish people

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.789
is now established as a real
state, as a real kingdom,

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.392
the united kingdom of Israel and Judea,

00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:58.102
and you have the famous
kings, King Saul, King David,

00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:02.043
King Solomon, King
Solomon famously noted for

00:05:02.043 --> 00:05:06.210
the construction of the
first temple at Jerusalem.

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:08.409
And now we're gonna fast forward,

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.433
because in a few hundred years,

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:13.600
that temple gets destroyed
by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:17.350
So let's fast forward a little bit.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.363
The Neo-Babylonian Empire,
led by Nebuchadnezzar II,

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.371
often known as the Chaldean Empire.

00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:24.585
This is approximately,

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.434
and I'm going very high
level in this video,

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:29.943
600 B.C.E., before the common era,

00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.549
secular way of saying
before the time of Christ,

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:35.302
before Christ, you might often see B.C.,

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.607
which would refer to before Christ,

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.720
B.C.E. is referring to
before the common era,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.887
but 600 B.C.E. and 600 B.C.
are referring to the same date.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.229
But you have the Neo-Babylonian Empire,

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.539
and I'll stress the word Neo,

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.564
because even though you
hear a lot about Babylon

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:52.718
when we talk about ancient Mesopotamia,

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.772
you notice that Babylon was only dominant

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:57.147
for relatively short periods of time

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.760
when we look at this, you know,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.463
multi-thousand year view of things.

00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:04.029
Actually, most of the
time, in this period,

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.640
the Assyrians were dominant,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.527
with their capital at Nineveh.

00:06:07.527 --> 00:06:11.252
But when we get to roughly 600 B.C.E.,

00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:13.084
you have Nebuchadnezzar II.

00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:17.191
He is the king, the emperor,
of this Neo-Babylonian Empire,

00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:18.526
and he goes...

00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:20.714
He searches for conquest.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.218
He wants to expand his empire.

00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:25.676
And he's really set on
taking over the pharaohs,

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:28.566
among other people, or the Egyptians,

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:30.590
but on his way, he's unsuccessful

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.837
on taking over the pharaohs, so let me,

00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:37.004
this is him on the way to try
to take over the pharaohs.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.566
He is unsuccessful to
try to take over Egypt.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.258
But on the way, he's able
to march through a lot of

00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:45.677
what we now call the Middle East,

00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:48.225
and relevant to the Old Testament,

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:52.468
he destroys the first
temple that Solomon built,

00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:54.538
so he destroys that temple,

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:56.607
and then he takes the
Jewish people captive,

00:06:56.607 --> 00:06:58.459
according to the Old Testament.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:01.365
And that is the famous
Babylonian captivity,

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:04.420
and that was Nebuchadnezzar who does it.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.720
Now, Nebuchadnezzar's empire, his dynasty,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.125
is relatively short-lived in
the whole scheme of things.

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.245
The Neo-Babylonian Empire,
the Chaldean Empire,

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.619
because by the time we get to the,

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.575
or we get a little bit further

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:21.075
into the sixth century B.C.E.,

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:23.549
so around 539,

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:28.557
539 B.C.E., this is when
you have the Persians

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:33.975
come and invade the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:37.775
The Persians, led by Cyrus the Great.

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:41.268
So now you have the
Persians come and take over

00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:43.132
the Neo-Babylonian Empire,

00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:45.553
and on our timeline here,

00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:47.427
this is the Persians going on,

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:50.344
going and taking over
more and more territory,

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:52.528
they take over Mesopotamia,

00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:55.665
they're able to take
over what we, you know,

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:59.047
Judea and actually this whole region

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:01.230
that is kind of the modern Middle East,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.979
and they are successful.

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:03.812
And this is a big deal,

00:08:03.812 --> 00:08:07.212
because look how long this line
of Egyptian civilization is.

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:10.046
They are able to take over Egypt,

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:12.198
and they keep going their conquest,

00:08:12.198 --> 00:08:13.389
and as we'll see in the next video,

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.013
they get very frustrated
because they're not able

00:08:15.013 --> 00:08:17.208
to take over the Greeks,
even though in a lot of ways,

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:19.961
the Greeks did not seem as
significant of an empire

00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.044
as the Egyptians or the Babylonians.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.711
But we will continue
that in the next video.
