00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello.
My name's Leslie Miller.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm the California Policy Manager here at
Google.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.430
And I am pleased to introduce Eric and our
current insurance commissioner and Republican

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.660
candidate for governor, Steve Poizner.
First, I'd like to just say a few remarks

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.230
about Mr. Poizner before they get started.
And then Eric is going to do some Q&amp;A with

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.119
him and open it up to Googlers.
Steve has had some great success here in Silicon

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.840
Valley.
He founded two companies, both of them were

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.260
acquired, the latter being acquired by Qualcomm
for a sizable amount of money.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.270
It's up to him if he wants to discuss that.
But after he sold his last company, he took

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.379
a detour and has been committed to public
service since then.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.210
He was a White House fellow.
He taught at a local high school around here

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.800
for a year.
And he's been our insurance commissioner for

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.971
the last few years.
And for those of you who don't know what an

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:05.290
insurance commissioner is or the importance
of that, it is, when you imagine insurance

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.290
companies increasing their rates or going
after you for more money than what you think

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.040
is fair as a consumer, it's his responsibility
to run the agency that has consumer protection.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.070
So it's an important job.
And I'm pleased to introduce our insurance

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.010
commissioner, Steve Poizner, and Eric.
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.997
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Thank you, all.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you, Steve.

00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:34.420
The -- Thank you very much for coming here
to Google as part of our series on our upcoming

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.490
gubernatorial race.
I have a very simple question.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.860
It seems to me, if I look at California, you've
got so far $41 billion budget deficit.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.400
You have a situation in the legislature where
it requires a two-thirds majority to essentially

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.750
enact anything that involves spending.
Redistricting and politics make it almost

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.240
impossible to build a consensus, according
to everyone who's part of it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.540
A million people, a budget that never gets
signed, huge frustration with the local government.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.070
Why are you running for this job?
[ Laughter ]

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.620
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Well, Eric, I came here for
a pep talk.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.530
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Actually, it's a great question.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.271
I get this question all the time on the campaign
trail.

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:22.390
Like, why on Earth would you want to be governor
in the midst of this meltdown.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.380
This is the worst economic crisis in the state's
160-year history.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.950
We have 3,000 people a week that pick up and
leave the state of California, the schools

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.891
are deteriorating.
You talked about the budget deficit.

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:38.640
We're out of cash, bankrupt as a state, worst
credit rating.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.280
Honestly, this is the best time to be running
for governor, it's the best time to be governor.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.260
Sometimes it takes a huge meltdown, a huge
crisis, in order to galvanize a new coalition

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.290
of people.
Over the course of our chat here, we'll talk

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.430
about some of my positions on policy, but,
honestly, I'm not here as a partisan warrior.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.570
I'm here to gather together a group of Californians,
Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.030
to put together a new working coalition of
folks to get our state back.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.360
I think California is heading completely the
wrong direction, totally.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.100
I want to take California in a completely
different direction.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.690
Sometimes a real meltdown, a real crisis,
is exactly what it takes in order to get at

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.490
some of the structural problems that face
our state.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.410
If I can mention one other thing.
I came here 30 years ago from Texas.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.920
Maybe my Texas accent will come out.
I love California.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.780
California is worth fighting for.
This is just a beautiful state, great people,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.170
great natural resources.
The state is in deep trouble.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.160
And I just can't sit on the sidelines.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It's interesting that you're

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.911
here at Google.
You went to Stanford Business School.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:47.170
You have a E.E. degree, always good to see
engineers in politics.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.410
Are there any engineers here?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Yes, okay, good.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.790
In Sacramento, it can be pretty lonely for
us engineers here.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.730
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We're send being our best
and brightest to somewhere else.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.820
It's interesting that your first company was
a mapping company of some kind, and your second

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.550
company was a GPS company.
So when you come to Google, do you see the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.230
technology that you worked on?
Is there -- what is the connection between

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.430
what you did as a young entrepreneur -- 'cause
 -- in what I read about you, you're basically

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.950
an entrepreneur.
You have started companies.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.940
It's what you think.
Does it show up here.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.430
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Thank you for calling me
a entrepreneur.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.350
I really do think that is the one word -- if
someone asked me just one word, what are you?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.980
I'm an entrepreneur.
Not only in the private sector, but I've been

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.889
an entrepreneur in public education reform
with the charter school movement, in the Department

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.940
of Insurance.
I have to say I'm thrilled to see some of

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.669
the things I worked on in my first two companies,
you have taken advantage of this.

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.100
My first company, Strategic Mapping, 1982,
could have been the first digital mapping

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.130
technology for PCs and Macintoshes back then.
We developed a G graphic information systems

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.570
technology that before was on a mainframe.
We moved that to a PC with a nice user interface.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.590
We sold tens of thousands of copies to people
who wanted to analyze data that had some G

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.780
graphic component to it and then display it
in map form on a PC or a Macintosh.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.510
And my second company came out of my first
company.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.750
People started to use our mapping software
with GPS systems to map out the locations

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.600
of things on a map.
And so my second company came out of that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.850
idea.
I was watching a TV show one day where someone

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:44.830
was being reported upon who had major handicaps,
was in a wheelchair in the back of a van.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.610
The van comes to a grinding halt on railroad
tracks.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.180
The person whips out the cell phone after
the driver has a heart attack, passes out.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.620
The person who's handicapped talks to the
911 operator, "Help me. My van is on a railroad

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.720
track. The driver is passed out."
And then the 911 operator never could locate

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.340
the person in time, and that person got hit
by a train, and it killed them.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.330
And I said, I'm going to start a company to
solve that problem.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.560
So my second company, SnapTrack, we figured
out a way to put a GPS receiver into a cell

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.960
phone.
Maybe there are some electrical engineers

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.020
in the audience.
In Sacramento, I never get to talk about this.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.381
So let me just say that it is hard to put
a GPS receiver into a cell phone and make

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:27.669
it work.
GPS receivers were designed to be used in

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.570
airplanes and ships where you have a clear
view of the sky.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.690
We figured it out.
700 million cell phones have this SnapTrack

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.370
location feature.
Sold it to Qualcomm.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.460
And, of course, you all take full advantage
of the fact that cell phones are now location-aware.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.290
And it's fantastic to see it.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: My guess is people here are

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.910
young enough that they assume it's always
been true that cell phones had GPS in it.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.229
And now we know where it came from.
After you did these successful businesses,

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:59.610
you ended up in education as -- basically,
as a teacher.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.600
Why the shift and why was -- what -- you obviously,
as governor, are going to have to deal with

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.820
education, which is roughly half or on the
order of half of the state's budget.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.949
What did you learn there?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Well, after running companies

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:17.150
in Silicon Valley here for 20 years, I did
decide a few years ago, I just can't sit on

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.540
the political sidelines, and I have to take
steps to start getting California back on

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.830
track.
I mean, it's clear even a few years ago that

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.990
California is heading off a cliff.
And the people that run our state, from both

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.169
parties, pretty much oblivious to the fact
that we're now in this new global economy

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.330
where competition's intense.
Our public schools are just deteriorating.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.150
It's a fact.
If we don't get the public schools back on

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.350
track, we'll never fix our great state.
How many of you went to California public

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.699
schools?
Just curious.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.639
Maybe most of you here.
That's the irony, I think, when many of you

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.270
went to public schools, best in the country.
California had the best public education system

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.669
in the country, bar none.
We've gone from first to worst in a very short

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:01.270
period of time.
I decided, you know, the engineer that I am,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.680
decided to plunge in, get into the trenches
in order to understand the issues firsthand.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.139
So I decided to volunteer as a teacher.
Well, easier said than done.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:13.880
They didn't exactly embrace me, the public
school system.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.720
I don't have a teaching credential.
In fact, Eric, I'm -- maybe I don't -- do

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.509
you have a teaching credential?
Do you know that you could walk into a high

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.730
school district right now and they wouldn't
let you teach?

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.010
I mean, they, of course, would be honored
to have you as a guest teacher.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.160
But what happened with me I'm sure would happen
to you or anybody at this point.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.039
It's hard to get into the public school system.
That's a problem that needs to be changed.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.919
I remember walking into the Eastside Union
High School District, which is on Story and

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.529
White, East San Jose, about 45 minutes from
my home.

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.579
Walked in there and said, "I want to volunteer
and teach.

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:48.820
I'm not looking for compensation.
I just want to help as much as I can and learn

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.050
as much as I can."
And the head of personnel comes out, she -- it

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.670
was during lunch.
She had a scowl on her face, a little mustard

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.629
on her lip, and she asked me, "Well, what
can I do for you? Why are you here?"

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:05.019
I said, "I'm looking to volunteer and teach."
Says, "What qualifies you to be in the classroom?"

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:09.759
I said, "Well, hmm, let me think about it.
I have an electrical engineering degree from

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:12.829
the University of Austin, graduated number
one in my class.

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:15.959
Then came to Stanford Business School, got
an MBA with honors from Stanford.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:19.010
Then I spent 20 years starting and running
high-tech companies in Silicon Valley.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.839
And then last year, I was in the White House,
where I worked in the National Security Council

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:28.490
in their counterterrorism group.
I got there one week before the 9/11, crisis.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.990
Helped build a new Homeland Security plan
for the whole country."

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.810
Without missing a beat, Eric, she points and
she says, "Nothing you said qualifies you

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.110
to be in the classroom."
Now, hey, I don't have a big ego or anything,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.579
but my ego shrank in size that day as she
sent me packing.

00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:47.970
But I didn't give up.
And I finally got into the classroom by getting

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.390
guest teacher status.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Why don't you just create

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.079
a charter school in that situation?
You're an entrepreneur.

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:56.339
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Funny you should say something
about charter schools.

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:00.490
So I learned everything I needed to know about
the public schools the first day I was teaching.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:06.040
I taught twelfth-grade American Government
at Mount Pleasant High School in East San

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.139
Jose.
I learned everything I needed to know the

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:10.339
first day.
It rained the first day.

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:14.149
And it leaked in my classroom and I had to
position the trash can in the right spot to

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:19.570
collect the rainwater.
Now, really, public high school, wealthy Silicon

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.110
Valley, leaky roof.
Just shameful.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.339
Who runs this school?
How come they can't fix the roof at Mount

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:28.041
Pleasant High School?
Well, when you all went to the public schools,

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:32.399
the teachers and the principals and the educators
controlled the schools and the budgets.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.439
Not anymore.
The legislature has taken over the running

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:37.399
of the public schools through the state education
code.

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:42.709
Now, the state education code are these mandates
that they apply uniformly to all public schools

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.959
at the same time.
There's 10,000 public schools.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.399
That's just crazy.
So one reason I'm running for governor, I'm

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:52.329
going to rip control of the public schools
out of the hands of Sacramento politicians

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:57.699
and move it to the local level where it belongs
and where it used to be.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:01.540
I became convinced that local control is a
key part of the answer here.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.220
I went off to help pioneer the growth of the
charter school movement.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.889
I am the founder of the California Charter
Schools Association.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:13.470
I have worked with others to build a bunch
of charter schools in East Palo Alto and Oakland.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.619
I believe that's a key part of the answer.
They are public schools but granted waivers

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:22.689
from the education code.
The education code in the 1960s was this size.

00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:27.309
Now the education code is this size, 2,400
pages and growing.

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:31.329
I want to give all schools the flexibility
that charter schools have.

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:35.949
There's over 800 charter schools in California.
The most important education reform activity

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:41.899
going on in California, in my opinion.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: After the charter school movement,

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:47.369
you ended up as our insurance commissioner.
And now you actually work, live, and breathe

00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:50.129
in Sacramento; right.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Well, actually, I have over

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:53.930
1,000 employees in 16 offices and so I do
lots of traveling around.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.269
I do have -- maybe 20, 30% of my time ends
up in Sacramento.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:01.250
My largest office is in Los Angeles.
So lots of moving around.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.249
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So from the perspective of
a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has gone

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:11.189
voluntarily, apparently, to Sacramento to
serve us, what's it actually like?

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:15.189
What is the correct criticism for the culture,
the decision-making?

00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:18.639
If you're governor, it's -- they're all going
to work for you.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.319
And you can't fire them.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Right.

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:22.819
So I have --
[ Laughter ]

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:26.369
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: You can't fire these people,
either.

00:12:26.369 --> 00:12:29.290
They're pretty good, too.
So I have an 18-year-old daughter.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:36.459
And she just loves to tease me that, dad,
you have the most boring job in the state

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:39.009
of California, insurance commissioner.
That's probably what somebody might be thinking

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.379
right now.
Insurance commissioner turns out to be a fantastic

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:45.190
job, though.
It's only one of eight positions elected statewide.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.579
I do have this massive oversight of everything
insurance in California.

00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:54.860
That turns out to be a big number, about $160
billion industry, 10% of the economy.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.239
I love my job because when I make a decision,
it impacts everybody, every business, every

00:12:59.239 --> 00:13:03.199
consumer, every family.
When I get there, three years ago, culture

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.860
shock.
I'm used to Silicon Valley companies.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.819
I get there.
Over 1,000 employees, all of my employees

00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:15.350
practically are lifetime civil servants.
What that means is that you're part of the

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.489
civil service system and you really cannot
be fired.

00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:22.160
It's almost impossible.
So in addition to their civil service protection,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.220
they also belong to public employee unions.
So there's collective bargaining agreements

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.629
that sit on top of the civil service protection.
So it took me maybe, I don't know, five minutes

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:34.769
to realize, this is not like running a company
in Silicon Valley.

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:38.649
But, Eric, your point's exactly right.
Do I want to get anything done or not?

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:42.160
This is my team.
And I had a bold, aggressive agenda and the

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.679
goals and objectives.
So I had to change.

00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.980
So I had to evolve.
The first thing I did was to go meet them

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.259
all.
Took me a few months.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:57.549
Met all thousand of my employees.
We built a strategic plan for the Department

00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:02.410
of Insurance.
I asked questions, why are we doing this program

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.579
here?
All too often, the answer was, "Well, we've

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:11.139
been doing it this way for 50 years."
Well, does it help anybody?

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:13.949
Not that we can tell.
Then stop it.

00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:16.749
We got rid of dozens of programs that didn't
make much difference.

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:20.299
Other programs we ramped up.
That's the good thing about a strategic plan.

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:23.429
You're reallocating resources to optimize.
Take my fraud unit.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:27.470
I have a couple hundred police officers who
work for me in my insurance fraud unit going

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.509
after insurance fraud in the middle of a deep
recession.

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:33.889
Now, that's high appropriate, because insurance
fraud drives up insurance rates.

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:37.239
We have arrested over 2,000 people for insurance
fraud in the last couple years.

00:14:37.239 --> 00:14:42.350
That's more people to be arrested for insurance
fraud than any other two-year period ever.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.259
But the overall impact on my budget, 'cause,
you know, we're in the middle of a financial

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:49.309
meltdown, my operating expenses are now lower,
permanently, by 15%.

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:52.429
I've generated this big surplus at the Department
of Insurance.

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:58.439
I've passed this surplus back into the marketplace
with tax cuts on insurance agents and companies

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:02.100
that fund my department.
Now, the last time the Department of Insurance

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.350
did a strategic plan in its 130-year history
was, well, never.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.239
And it can be done.
So one thing I'm going to do as governor is

00:15:10.239 --> 00:15:15.730
do the same thing across the other 399 different
state departments and state agencies.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.139
These are good people who work for the state
of California.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:23.869
The system has got lots of constraints.
But people who work, public employees, will

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:29.529
respond to great leadership, just like people
here respond to great leadership.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:32.859
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Did you find -- develop a
view about the union structure and culture

00:15:32.859 --> 00:15:38.300
of Sacramento, in particular, it's widely
reported that the teachers' union and the

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.290
prisons union and so forth have a great deal
of power.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.410
Has that been your experience?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Yes.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.689
No question.
And so all of my employees are public employee

00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:49.860
union members.
I have fantastic employees at the Department

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.269
of Insurance, honestly.
But the public employee union leadership is

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:56.999
a problem.
And we Californians are going to have to address

00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:59.209
it.
Public employee unions are a very small percentage

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:03.339
of the total population, but they have the
lion's share of the political power.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:06.259
And they use their political power in a very
sophisticated way.

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:11.189
And they have pretty much access to unlimited
political resources by tapping into the paychecks

00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:15.519
of public employee union members, do automatic
payroll deductions, and they create these

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:22.279
massive political action committee war chests.
And they have used this political power to

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:28.269
negotiate unsustainable compensation structures
and pension programs to block reform.

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:31.809
So we are going to have to take the power
back.

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:37.459
I do support a constitutional amendment that
would curb the power of the public employee

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:43.970
unions by forcing the public employee unions
to get permission from the employees first

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.899
before they yank money out of their paychecks
for political purposes.

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:52.379
And so if public employees want to contribute
to political causes, that's their right.

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:55.329
But they should have to do so with their permission
in advance.

00:16:55.329 --> 00:17:00.709
That would be an important step to curb that
power right now that pretty much blocks any

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:03.740
kind of reform in Sacramento.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's talk about this in the

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.630
context of how the governor actually works.
There is the theoretical model where the governor

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.240
goes out and gives speeches, provides great
leadership to the state.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.270
And then there's the reality, which even the
terminator could not overcome, which is the

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.610
gridlock that exists among the political parties.
As I understand it, there's a majority of

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.610
Democratic support.
The Republicans are relatively different in

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:32.100
view on both social and financial issues.
The horse trading is severe.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.202
We went through in the last couple of years
 -- you were there, so you were right in the

00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:39.730
middle of it -- two essentially failed budget
processes which ultimately have resulted in

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:45.170
an unsolvable budget situation.
So what -- as governor, how will you horse

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.290
trade better than the previous governor?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Yeah, if Schwarzenegger couldn't

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.030
do it, how can you do it?
I get that question a lot.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:57.370
No one's ever confused me with Arnold.
That's for sure.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.620
I do have a black belt.
I think I could take him, if I had to.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.660
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: But --

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank goodness, that's not
how our politics work.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.850
Only in Korea does that work.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: That could be a step in the

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.850
right direction.
You never know.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.900
Look, we are in a very serious crisis right
now.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:21.291
It really is a meltdown, a complete functional
 -- dysfunction, really, in the legislature

00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:25.390
and in Sacramento.
There's no easy answers.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:30.380
And I enter this race with the full appreciation
of how hard it's going to be.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.970
But just like any crisis, there are some steps
you can go through to make progress.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.980
The first step is, you've got to identify
what the problem is and then be honest with

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.760
people about it.
Second step is to come up with a plan of action.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.730
How are you going to fix it?
Then the third step is to have great leaders

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.420
rise up and rally the troops and to get a
new working coalition.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.430
So the way I'm running for governor is vastly
different than my opponent.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.930
My opponent, Meg Whitman, in the Republican
primary, she won't even come here and take

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.870
your questions.
She doesn't do debates.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.050
It's a different strategy.
You all can figure out, you know, what strategy's

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.610
the best for California.
My strategy is to be very open about my positions.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.180
And I'm going to take some positions today
that I know you're going to disagree with.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.270
That's okay.
You're not going to agree with me on everything.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.660
The question really is do I have the leadership
skills and the vision to get California back

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.580
on track in the middle of this deep crisis?
So I'm going to be very specific here today

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.311
with you as well as on -- through the rest
of the campaign.

00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:28.170
When I'm elected, it will be with a mandate.
Okay, we knew exactly where he stood.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.920
Didn't agree with him on everything, but he
had pretty much the right idea to get this

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.030
broken state fixed.
We're going to send Poizner to Sacramento

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.570
with marching orders, "Go get it done."
And that extra political capital that I'm

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.640
going to have once I have this mandate in
place, it's going to be very essential to

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.980
making progress in Sacramento.
Second part of the strategy is to use the

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.740
powers of the governor's office like you've
never seen before.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.500
The governor, on paper, very powerful here
in California.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.320
The line-item veto power, the statute veto
power, the appointments power, huge.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.090
I'm going to focus this authority, power,
on a reform agenda that's focused on bringing

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.480
jobs back to California and fixing the public
schools.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.850
And that will give us a chance in the middle
of this crisis, you know, with voter mandates,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.020
to actually make progress.
The alternative is, California falls off a

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.040
cliff.
That's unthinkable.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.800
If enough people rise up and say, no, we want
a different direction, then we can make progress.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.940
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's talk about the actual
race.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.031
You must have a plan to win.
You've got two months until the Republican

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:34.820
primary.
Can you describe what it's going to take,

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.610
as I understand it, again, your competitors,
Meg Whitman, has greater name recognition,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.070
she has spent more money than you and so forth.
Can you describe in what ways you're different

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:49.450
from her and when the vote -- and I believe
this is a Republican primary, and I believe

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.560
it's mostly Republicans who vote in the Republican
primary -- how will you get them to vote for

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.700
you instead of the other significant opponent,
Meg.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.210
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: By the way, if you're a decline-to-state
voter, you can also vote in a Republican primary

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.321
or the Democratic primary.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's be clear what the rules

00:21:06.321 --> 00:21:10.960
are a registered Republican can vote for or
against you and a decline to state can vote

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.040
for or against you and a registered Democrat
should not vote, that would be illegal.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.460
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: You've got it.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We like precise instructions.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.480
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: And June 8th is the primary.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And June 8th is the primary.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.990
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Right.
Google, you all were founded in 1998, yeah?

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.730
I do feel like Google back when you were starting
your company.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:35.280
Because how many search engines were on the
market when you all came around?

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.680
A lot.
And not many people gave Google much of a

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.220
chance back then, because there were a lot
of search engines on the market and big, huge

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.410
players.
How can Google survive?

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:51.230
It turns out, you all had the best search
engine, best product, and people figured it

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.550
out.
I feel the same way about this Republican

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.330
primary.
I'm up against the establishment.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.380
I'm up against someone who has spent $59 million
so far.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.490
Actually, put $59 million of her own money
into the campaign, spent about $50 million

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.510
so far and growing.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And your number is.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.580
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: I've put $20 million in my
campaign.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.210
I thought that was a lot of money.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And you've spent?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.010
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: We've spent maybe 5 or 6
or 7 million so far.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:20.460
We've saved our money here to the end.
You have to note that the most money that's

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.150
ever been spent in a Republican primary for
governor in the history of the country was

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.980
about it does 20 million.
So Meg Whitman is now -- she's going to blow

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.020
that out by a factor of 4X.
You have to -- people are going to start asking,

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.950
"Why are you spending so much money?
What are you trying to compensate for?

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.540
Why does it take so much money in the middle
of this deep recession?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:44.290
What's the purpose of the saturation advertising?"
I have to get the word out.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.670
If I was here talking to you and I didn't
have any money, no matter how strong of a

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.360
candidate, it's kind of a moot point.
But I do have plenty of money.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.270
Won't get anywhere close to Meg Whitman's
money.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.160
Doesn't have to be that way.
So just like back then when consumers started

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.080
to compare search engines, people here in
the Republican primary, they know that the

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.780
state's broken.
They know that the Republican party needs

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.690
to be revitalized.
They're going to do their comparing and contrasting.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.410
I can promise you all this, everyone who's
eligible to vote in the Republican primary

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.350
will know all about me by election day.
And we're going to have the money on TV and

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.840
radio and the Web.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And how will they see you,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.050
in your view, as different from your other
competitors?

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.080
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Part of my challenge is to
get people to understand that Meg Whitman

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.840
and I couldn't be any different.
Just because we're from the same area here,

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.030
a lot of people put us both in the same --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: All three leading candidates

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.510
are from the Bay Area.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: And that drives people in

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:42.580
Southern California nuts, by the way.
Only one of us running in the Republican primary

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.640
has actually started companies from scratch.
Now, Eric, there's nothing wrong with being

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.160
a large company, Fortune 500 CEO type, nothing
wrong with that at all.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.820
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
But that's not me.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.170
I'm an engineer.
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.590
I build things.
I fix things.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:04.790
Meg Whitman is a marketing, branding expert.
It's just different, her strengths and her

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.550
background.
Honestly, I think as people compare and contrast,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.940
if they're looking to rebrand the state, they're
going to vote for her.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.750
If they want the state to be rebuilt, they're
going to look to someone with my type of skill

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.000
set.
Between the two of us, only one of us has

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.460
actually run for office before and won, in
my case.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:25.490
Only one of us has taken a large state agency
and shrunk it, made it more efficient, less

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.650
money being spent, more productivity being
had.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.950
Only one of us has been in a classroom for
an extended period of time.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.640
Only one of us has actually voted most of
our lives.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.760
That's a big issue.
So Meg's going to have to explain, how do

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:44.930
you go from not being a Republican, not voting,
have no connection to public service at all,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.160
and now she wants to be governor.
And so people are going to start digging in

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.590
to why is all of this money being spent, what's
her background, what's my background.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.130
I'm just going to focus on my unique experience
of 20 years of starting and running companies

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.570
from scratch here in Silicon Valley.
I know how to bring jobs back to California,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.840
which is essential.
But the same time now I have eight years of

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.820
success in politics and public-sector service.
It's not like running a business in Sacramento,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.060
as you've already noted, Eric.
It's about having the leadership skills to

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.220
put coalitions of people together.
I have proven I can get that done as an entrepreneur

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.462
in both the private sector and in the public
sector.

00:25:19.462 --> 00:25:23.910
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So you've taken what are considered
to be -- The Republican primary has ended

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.580
up being focused on a lot of social issues,
as best I can tell, as opposed to some of

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.190
the other themes, maybe because people aren't
really focused on the general election until

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.400
the fall.
And, of course, you have two elections.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.960
You have the Republican primary, which you
need to win, and then, of course, you have

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.140
the general election should you win that.
In the -- on the social side of the Republican

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.280
primary, there's been a lot of discussion
about your positions on -- let's go through

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.670
the list -- immigration, Prop. 8, A.B. 32,
a couple of others.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.730
You want to sort of give us your political
and policy views on that so we can get that

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.640
out here with this audience?
I'm sure people have questions about that.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.810
And you've also been criticized by your opponent
for having changed your mind.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.620
So here's a good opportunity to say what you
really think.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:15.480
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Right.
Well, I am a pretty conservative person in

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.950
terms of my passion for small government,
low taxes.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.630
I want to create an environment for lots of
innovation.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:30.880
I'm also -- I'm a big believer that our government
spending has gotten completely out of control.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.740
I do think California has become the most
liberal state in the country.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.990
I don't say that, really, as a criticism of
liberalism per se.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.120
It's just a fact.
That if you look at the number of government

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.210
programs that have been started to solve problems
for people, California has led the way in

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:52.230
terms of putting one program in after another.
And most of these programs are very ineffective.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.630
And now the jury's in.
The state is bankrupt.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:01.790
We now have -- at least the current short-term
budget deficit is $20 billion.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.070
You know, we're firing teachers.
This is a mess.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:12.050
So eight years from now, maybe a more liberal
agenda might appeal to people.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.650
Not right now, though.
I think Republicans, Democrats, and Independents

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.651
alike are coming to the conclusion that we
need to get back to some basic principles.

00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:25.120
We've got to balance the budget.
We have to properly fund high-priority programs

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.130
like public education and higher education.
We have to scale back this mentality of people

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.440
tapping into government benefits as a way
of life.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.360
And so I'm running on a pretty conservative
platform.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.700
Some people point out, well, you seem more
conservative than you used to be.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.020
Well, I've always been pretty conservative.
In fact, some of you are too young for this

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:53.620
maybe, but "Family Ties," the TV show, I was
the Alex P. Keaton of my household for sure.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:28:01.530
I don't know how many Republicans are here,
but I suspect not as many as I hoped there

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:06.111
would be here in Silicon Valley.
But I'll say this: After the last few years

00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:13.400
of being in Sacramento, Eric, it's -- I now
have even more insights into the dysfunction

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.010
in Sacramento and all the wasteful spending
and all the tax rates that are driving people

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.160
out of the state.
My conservative principles have crystalized

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.650
in my mind.
Since I started getting involved in politics

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:30.250
for the last four, five years, the state's
unemployment rate has doubled, our budget

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.170
deficit has ballooned, the tax rates have
gone way up.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:42.470
So part of my platform that I am, you know,
pitching on the campaign trail is based on

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:48.250
the current situation we find ourselves in.
And so what will I'm proposing is what it's

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.300
going to take to get California back on track.
Okay, some specifics.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:56.770
On some social issues, of course, people want
to know where you stand on social issues.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:02.050
I believe social issues are important.
Some of my positions on social issues are

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.059
likely going to differ from some people here.
That's fine.

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:08.390
We can disagree on those.
I really do think the most important thing

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.880
of all, though, is we have to fix the public
schools and bring jobs back.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.850
And a lot of these issues I think we can probably
agree.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.830
On the controversial issues, let's get them
out here, on Proposition 8, I supported Proposition

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.850
8.
I do believe it traditional marriage, I believe

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.720
a marriage should be between a man and a woman.
It's not the engineer in me that feels that

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.320
way.
It's more of -- on issues like that, it's

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.440
more of a gut of what you think is the right
way to do it.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.930
That's my view.
It's always been my view there.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.970
On abortion, I am pro-choice, but I do believe
that we should drive the number of abortions

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.700
down to zero as best we can.
That's why I do want to take steps to reduce

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.180
the number of abortions.
I don't think abortions should be just another

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.870
medical procedure.
That's why I support parental notification.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.110
I also want to end taxpayer-funded benefits
for abortions.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:59.350
Let's go to something less controversial.
Illegal immigration.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:05.720
Just kidding.
That's controversial, too.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.230
One of the key cornerstones to my campaign
is my focus on trying to address the problems

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.559
of illegal immigration.
Honestly, there hasn't been a politician in

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:17.710
20 years that's even mentioned the words,
because most of them don't have the guts.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.900
It's one of those issues where you can't even
have a conversation without people starting

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.460
to criticize you.
The fact is, legal immigration has been a

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.059
fantastic thing for California, I mean, fantastic.
Legal immigration is part of the backbone

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:33.200
of this great economy.
I want to make the legal immigration pipeline

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.380
as big as possible.
Eric and I were talking before we started

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:43.380
here about my support for expanding the H-1B
visa program substantially, my belief that

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.090
we should be stapling green cards to diplomas
of people who come here to our colleges and

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.860
universities.
We don't want great people to come here to

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.730
U.C. Berkeley or to Stanford or anywhere and
then be forced out because they can't get

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:55.730
a visa.
That's crazy.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.850
So let's make the legal immigration pipe as
big as we can.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:03.080
But illegal immigration is a different story.
And, again, I want to be a truth teller in

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.340
this campaign.
We can't afford it any longer.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.400
We spend billions and billions of dollars
in taxpayer-funded benefits for people who

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.880
come here illegally.
And it's something that is causing us a very

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.940
difficult time in terms of balancing the budget.
In the public schools, I saw it firsthand.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:25.070
It overwhelms the public schools, it overwhelms
the emergencies and the health care system.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.450
We have to take steps to turn the magnets
off.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.051
Now, I did work in the White House.
I was in the National Security Council.

00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:35.611
I am very concerned about border security.
But I'm pretty convinced, even though we need

00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:39.890
better border security, I'm pretty convinced
you can't build a wall long enough or a fence

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.790
high enough.
This is about incentives.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.890
People come here to tap into jobs and to taxpayer-funded
benefits.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:55.470
And as governor, I will turn off the magnets.
We should stop benefits for people who are

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:58.140
here illegally.
And we should make sure that if you're an

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.059
employer and you hire someone, you better
hire someone who is here legally.

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:06.100
As governor, if a company hires people illegally,
I will revoke their business license.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.270
And if you turn off those magnets, what's
going to happen is that people will change

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.621
their behavior.
Hopefully, people won't come here in the first

00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:18.660
place illegally if we turn these magnets off.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Why don't we get some questions

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.090
from the audience.
Let me ask sort of my last formal question,

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:33.830
which is, in terms of the politics here, the
state has large, relatively liberal city centers,

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:40.690
L.A. and San Francisco, and so forth.
And then a reasonably mixed suburban area,

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.850
and then lots and lots of conservative rural
earliest.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.810
Is it fair to say that your challenge -- you'll
get the rural areas because of the Republican

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:53.809
history there and your positions and so forth.
Is the challenge to speak to the urban dweller?

00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:55.780
Is that the way to say the problem before
you?

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.640
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: If I was running for the
U.S. Senate or state assembly, it would be

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:06.429
a different campaign.
I might not be the right fit for that kind

00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:08.620
of campaign.
I wouldn't be interested in that kind of campaign.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.179
I'm running for governor, for all the people,
Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everyone.

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:17.160
The issues that I am talking about affect
all Californians.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.730
If you look at the people who have been elected
governor in California, there's only been

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.600
a handful of elected Democratic governors,
even though the legislature is dominated by

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.710
Democrats.
People understand the governor is not a partisan

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:35.270
warrior, but the leader of the state and we
need checks and balances.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.480
It's a remarkable thing how many people vote
for a Republican governor, because, honestly,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.380
to turn this state over to just one party
in Sacramento would be a disaster.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.660
Complete disaster.
I have an excellent chance of being your next

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.400
governor, because the state's in the middle
of this massive meltdown.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.370
People are going to be looking for problem-solvers
with a track record no matter which party

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.300
they come from.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand that you --

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let me just remind everybody
that you are on the record.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.419
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Trust me.

00:34:07.419 --> 00:34:12.560
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand that you have proposed and

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:19.350
still plan to force insurance companies to
diverse from Iran, which I support.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:25.109
I commend you for standing behind that since
the insurance industry has been coming after

00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:30.079
you for it.
And I know that they are -- you know, they

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:36.250
hired the campaign team that did Prop. 8 to,
you know, plant news articles and op eds against

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.249
you.
And I'm just wondering, like, what your view

00:34:40.249 --> 00:34:45.429
is of how we need to reform the influence
of business on the political process.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:52.259
You talked about public employee unions.
But in my view, the -- you know, the runaway

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:58.700
power is, you know, independent expenditures
from corporations in California and these

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.920
other kinds of attacks, like the ones against
you, that aren't even disclosed.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.249
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Well, thank you for asking
an insurance question.

00:35:07.249 --> 00:35:13.630
So, as insurance commissioner, one of my most
important duties is to make sure that insurance

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.701
companies stay financially sound.
And I mentioned my over 1,000 employees.

00:35:17.701 --> 00:35:22.770
A big chunk of them are in financial surveillance,
where we monitor the 1300 insurance companies

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.089
that do business in California very closely.
In the middle of the financial meltdown, we

00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:29.109
were making sure that they stayed financially
strong.

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:32.650
I'm pleased to report, we've been able to
keep most insurance companies safe and secure.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.770
And so when you turn in a legitimate claim,
you know, after you pay -- you know, you pay

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.789
for your auto insurance and your health care
insurance and your earthquake insurance year

00:35:38.789 --> 00:35:41.259
after year after year.
If you have a legitimate claim, there better

00:35:41.259 --> 00:35:45.400
be money there to pay off a legitimate claim.
That's why my financial surveillance duties

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.920
are important.
When I was looking at the financial health

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.200
of insurance companies, I found that they
have this massive investment portfolio, $4

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.599
trillion is the global investment portfolio
for insurance companies.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:58.440
They're the largest investor group in the
world.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.470
At least 6 billion invested in Iran, in their
military, nuclear, and defense sectors.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.480
It's just wrong.
And so I am pushing them as hard as I can

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.759
with all of my powers and duties and persuasive
skills to get them to divest.

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:19.500
They can do better than that.
They have no business really being -- investing

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.119
in companies that are propping up the Iranian
regime.

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:26.160
I think the Iranian regime, it's crystal clear
they're a big danger to its own people, to

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:32.420
its neighbors, and to our national security.
Now, $6 billion turns out to be 2 or 3% of

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.170
Iran's gross domestic product.
It's a very small, tiny percentage of their

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.099
investment portfolio.
They could easily divest here.

00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:45.359
And so, of the 1300 insurance companies, I
have gotten over 750 to agree to not only

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:50.049
voluntarily divest, but to not invest in any
new investments in Iran in the future.

00:36:50.049 --> 00:36:54.430
Now, there's a few hundred insurance companies
that are fighting back hard.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:59.470
They just want to maximize their returns independent
of the impact that they're having on our national

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.480
security.
And I'm going to fight them on it.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.970
And the fact that they're pushing back on
me so hard should tell you something.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.240
Republican or Democrat, doesn't matter, I
will do what it takes to stand up to insurance

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.049
companies to make sure that they fulfill all
of their legal obligations to policyholders.

00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:18.660
When they cancel people's insurance improperly,
I am going to go after them, make sure they

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.259
reinstate people's health insurance, even
though they canceled it sometimes in the middle

00:37:22.259 --> 00:37:25.231
of major health procedures.
In the case of Iran, I'm going to do what

00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:27.539
it takes to make sure that they purge their
investments.

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:34.220
And if I can just say, Google, you know, what
you did in China, I'm sure it was a lot of

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.560
discussion, maybe a big controversy even inside
of Google, I don't really know, I only know

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.519
what I read.
But I've got to tell you how proud I am to

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:44.779
know you all.
I think what you did in China was a fantastic

00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:47.630
thing.
There's a big difference between focusing

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.869
on just the very short term and focusing in
on the long term.

00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:56.130
And I suspect that people who focus on the
long term, where, you know, censorship is

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:02.359
wrong, investments in Iran are wrong.
If you do the right thing, I'm pretty confident

00:38:02.359 --> 00:38:07.329
it will pay off for folks who do that.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Next question.

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:10.980
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello.
I'd like to ask about Prop. 13.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:18.410
As a legal immigrant to the U.S., I find it
really bizarre that I have to pay ten times

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:23.589
as much as my neighbor for essentially the
same home.

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:29.769
And I don't understand why I need to be punished
for coming to work in Silicon Valley.

00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:34.231
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And this is a question about
Prop. 13; right?

00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:36.099
1978.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Yeah, Prop. 13 is very controversial.

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:40.559
I support Prop. 13, though, for one basic
reason.

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:45.310
It provides predictability for home owners.
So even though people across the street from

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.980
each other might be paying different rates,
on the other hand, when people get into their

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.069
homes, they know the situation.
When you bought your home, you know what the

00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:56.730
property tax was going to be and you know
what your mortgage is going to be, and you

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.039
run the numbers.
Can you afford it or not.

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:04.290
And then Prop. 13 starts to benefit you.
Once you're a home owner, then you know what

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.529
your property taxes are going to be in a very
predictable way for many decades to come.

00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:12.910
And that will benefit new the longer term.
What I like about Prop. 13, then, is it doesn't

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.119
drive people out of their homes.
When it passed in 1978, property taxes were

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:20.539
being ratcheted up.
And some people were on fixed incomes and

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:24.410
they were having to sell their homes because
they didn't have that predictability.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:28.039
I think having this cap on property taxes
is a good thing.

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:33.499
The other important part about Prop. 13 is
that it requires a two-thirds vote to increase

00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:37.400
taxes in California in most cases.
I think that's a good thing, too.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.450
I know that's also controversial.
But the fact is even with the two-thirds voting

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:46.019
rules, you have to ask yourself, if we made
it easier to pass taxes, if we lowered that

00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:50.489
two-thirds to something less than two-thirds,
would taxes go up or down?

00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:53.900
Of course they're going to go up.
Now, even though the two-thirds voting rules

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.661
have been in place now since 1978, do we have
low taxes?

00:39:57.661 --> 00:40:02.239
No.
Now, property taxes, even with Prop. 13, property

00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:07.170
taxes are at the national average, median.
All the other taxes are the highest in the

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:11.390
country, practically, highest sales taxes,
income taxes, vehicle license fees.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.700
We have gas taxes, beer taxes, wine taxes,
phone taxes, capital gains taxes.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.509
We have 900 different taxes and fees.
If you add them up and divide by the number

00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:24.780
of people, you get the per capita tax burden,
50% higher here in California than nearby

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.470
western states.
I mean, no wonder 3,000 people a week pick

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.809
up and leave the state of California each
and every week, because this place is way

00:40:32.809 --> 00:40:35.989
overtaxed.
I would never change those two-thirds voting

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:41.349
rules, because our taxes will even go up higher.
I think taxes have to come down, not up.

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:46.130
That's why, actually, one of the key center
pieces of my campaign is actually to cut taxes.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:51.760
I'm proposing a 10% cut in sales taxes, a
10% cut in corporate taxes, a 10% cut in personal

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.130
income taxes, every bracket, and a 50% cut
in capital gains taxes.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.801
People ask me all the time, how on Earth can
we afford a tax cut when we can't balance

00:41:01.801 --> 00:41:05.739
the budget as it is.
Honestly, the answer is, we can't afford not

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.670
to.
We need lower tax rates so we can become competitive

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.420
again.
And then the tax base will increase in size

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.140
as jobs return to California, and then the
tax revenues go up, not down.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.359
And just briefly, we did an economic analysis
of this.

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:24.380
We looked at the other 49 states.
We found a dozen examples of when people -- when

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.819
states actually cut taxes across the board.
Tax revenues went up, not down, immediately

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:32.430
after the tax cut.
We need to bring jobs back to California.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.449
It's essential.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Our next question.

00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:39.269
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Steve.
Thanks for coming today.

00:41:39.269 --> 00:41:43.910
You mentioned that the expenditure of your
department has decreased during your tenure.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:50.390
But what Meg Whitman is saying is that it's
increased by, like, 14%, I believe.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.710
What do you say to that?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: She's wrong.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.630
And she's very misleading.
Her negative attacks are ugly, nasty, false.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.369
Shame on her.
If you see her out there, you tell her.

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:04.460
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Here's the facts.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.859
My operating budget is down by 15% permanently.
And you know this is a fact, because when

00:42:09.859 --> 00:42:14.890
I got to the Department of Insurance, I had
a budget deficit of about $5 million, structural

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.079
deficit.
Now I have this huge surplus.

00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:20.319
And I've taken the surplus, and I mentioned,
tax cuts.

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:24.369
I've cut taxes twice on insurance agents and
brokers and companies that fund my department

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:29.420
to the tune of millions and millions of dollars.
If I hadn't been able to reduce my operating

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.430
expenses by 15%, I would never have been able
to generate the surplus.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.029
This has all been documented.
And she's just wrong.

00:42:37.029 --> 00:42:39.369
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Our next question.
Yes, sir.

00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:43.499
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Which, by the way, you may
be looking at the only person in Sacramento

00:42:43.499 --> 00:42:49.079
history that's ever downsized anything.
And right now, downsizing is not really the

00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:50.359
perfect word.
It's really right-sizing.

00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:54.720
I know you're in the growth mode.
But in Sacramento, they've been in the growth

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.890
mode for 20 years, unfortunately.
Now they need to go into the right-sizing

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.810
mode.
We need to balance the budget with no more

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:06.369
taxes, no more gimmicks, no more borrowing.
We can do it, but we're going to have to go

00:43:06.369 --> 00:43:10.979
through every line of the budget, like I have,
all 1200 pages and overhaul and modernize

00:43:10.979 --> 00:43:13.009
the entire state of California.
It hasn't been done.

00:43:13.009 --> 00:43:16.890
It can be done.
It's essential that we get it done.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.440
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming.
You mentioned the $20 billion deficit that

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.309
our state is facing, and you also touched
on, with the severe gridlock between the legislature

00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:31.549
and traditionally the governor's mansion,
the challenge in cutting costs and programs.

00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:35.789
So with your tax cuts that you're proposing,
can you talk a bit more specifically about

00:43:35.789 --> 00:43:39.359
how you plan to perhaps bring in more revenue
for the state.

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:42.509
Are you looking to perhaps stimulate certain
sectors of the economy through -- for instance,

00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:46.970
we've had the first-time home buyer's credit
that's been in effect the last year and a

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.819
half or so.
What other specific credits or policies do

00:43:49.819 --> 00:43:53.140
you have in mind to perhaps drive up the revenue
for the state?

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.070
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: This is a major difference
between Meg Whitman and me, by the way.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.579
I mentioned before some of difference in our
background, but we have some major differences

00:43:58.579 --> 00:44:02.380
on policy.
Meg Whitman definitely is a fan of targeted

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.610
tax cuts, you know, where she wants to stimulate
certain sectors.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.200
I've got to tell you, I am completely opposed
to that.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.680
The idea of empowering a bunch of Sacramento
politicians to pick winners and losers, just

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:20.089
absolutely wrong, in my opinion.
I'm proposing across-the-board tax cuts so

00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:23.240
that everyone benefits, every consumer, every
small business.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.510
We want to encourage more people to come here.
My last company, SnapTrack, you know, I came

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.900
here from Texas, I think I've said "y'all"
a couple of times.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.450
I catch myself, I'm giving away where I come
from.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:38.539
I came from Texas 30 years ago because this
was the best place on the planet to start

00:44:38.539 --> 00:44:43.049
and grow companies.
And we're not that way anymore.

00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:45.729
We have to get back to that.
I ran some numbers.

00:44:45.729 --> 00:44:50.250
If I would have started my company back in
Texas rather than California, I had 100 employees

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.970
when I sold to Qualcomm.
And we did sell for a billion dollars.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.609
It was in the Mercury News, so there's no
secreted.

00:44:57.609 --> 00:45:00.630
Qualcomm is a public company.
All my employees were shareholders.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.190
It was a great thing.
But I did run some numbers.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:09.640
If I had started my company in Texas rather
than here, the state of California would be

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.109
out $100 million, meaning that my employees
paid $100 million in state and local taxes.

00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:18.619
And so it really makes a difference where
companies set up and grow.

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:21.529
Eric, we did -- we did back of the envelope
on Google.

00:45:21.529 --> 00:45:25.150
It's hard to know for sure.
But we ran some numbers.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:31.839
If Google would have started the company in
Nevada rather than in California, we estimate

00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:37.990
at least $10 billion difference, meaning that
if you weren't a California company, California

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.599
would be $10 billion more in the hole.
You all have paid --

00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:43.559
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: In other words, we would have
had $10 billion more had we gone to Nevada?

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:45.529
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Let's get --

00:45:45.529 --> 00:45:49.099
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's get the math right.
When are we moving to Nevada, guys?

00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:55.420
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Since 1998, Google as a company
and its employees have paid $10 billion in

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.630
state and local taxes.
So thank you for being in California.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.690
Thank goodness you are here in California.
But it all has to do with creating an environment

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.779
so that the next Google or the next SnapTrack
wants to start here.

00:46:05.779 --> 00:46:11.171
And right now, we have an environment with
super-high taxes, burdensome regulations,

00:46:11.171 --> 00:46:18.710
and, I'm telling you, there is a huge exodus.
Cisco, quote, we haven't created a new tech

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.869
job in California in a decade.
Intel standing right next to President Obama,

00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:27.140
the CEO of Intel, talking about all of the
expansion of chip manufacturing in this country,

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.400
none in California.
Hewlett Packard, California is no-man's land

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.680
when it comes to new manufacturing.
NUMMI, the last automobile manufacturing plant

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:40.739
in California, just closed down last week.
5,000 jobs gone, 25,000 supplier jobs.

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:44.619
Why?
Taxes are too high; regulations are too burdensome.

00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:48.300
That's why I'm proposing sweeping, bold changes.
Half measures won't do here.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.539
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming here.
A while back, you were talking about how you

00:46:53.539 --> 00:46:58.040
are clear about your issues so that when you
get elected, you'll have the mandate.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.520
And I really appreciate your being straight
about that.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:06.589
My question is -- and you also talked about
keeping the two-thirds requirement in the

00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:11.020
legislature for the budget.
Now, if anything -- if we have learned anything

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:17.170
in the last one year, right, getting elected
based on an issue and -- you know, does not

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:22.180
give you an easy way to enact things.
Now, you're promising all these tax cuts,

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.519
but are you sure you're going to get more
than two-thirds of the legislature actually

00:47:26.519 --> 00:47:31.750
voting for it other than just sending it,
like, across veto messages?

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:36.119
How are you going to do that?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Your question's really a

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.329
great question.
And the essence of your question is, how on

00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:43.430
Earth are you going to get anything done?
And, Eric, you asked a form of that question

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.279
earlier.
And it's -- there's no easy answers.

00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:49.569
I know this: If we don't try, it'll never
get fixed.

00:47:49.569 --> 00:47:53.319
I also know that there's nothing keeping us
from fixing these problems other than political

00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:57.200
failure and leadership failure.
So we're in the middle of a meltdown, which

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.789
creates rare opportunities.
A few years ago, I don't think my bold, sweeping

00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:05.749
reforms would have much of a chance.
Maybe a few years from now, we won't need

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:08.989
to be so aggressive.
But right now, we're bankrupt.

00:48:08.989 --> 00:48:12.819
And people are suffering.
Do you know that the unemployment right now

00:48:12.819 --> 00:48:17.069
is officially 12.5%?
If you add in all the people who are -- who

00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:22.380
have quit looking for jobs, plus all the people
who have part-time jobs but need full-time

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.029
jobs, that's 20%.
So 4 million Californians are either unemployed

00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:29.839
or underemployed.
That's depression-level misery.

00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:34.869
When you have a situation like that, where
Republicans and Democrats and Independents,

00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:40.420
everyone agrees, the state's broken, and we
need to fix it, under that kind of environment,

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.749
the legislature is going to pay attention,
especially given how clear I am in my campaign.

00:48:44.749 --> 00:48:48.400
If I'm elected, it will provide that extra
political clout.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.809
But I'll say this, if I'm blocked and the
legislature simply doesn't implement these

00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:57.809
critical reforms, which, by the way, I still
maintain, it's unthinkable that we can't get

00:48:57.809 --> 00:49:00.549
this state fixed.
And we don't have much more time.

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:03.160
We're going to get steam rolled in this global
economy.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.549
We are getting steamrolled.
We need to move along at an urgent pace.

00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:11.950
If the legislature doesn't fix these problems
after I propose them after I get elected governor,

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.299
then I will take single-issue ballot initiatives
directly to the voters.

00:49:16.299 --> 00:49:19.400
If we have to, the voters will have to take
the state back.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.440
There are some very specific, simple, short
and sweet ballot initiatives that I will put

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.689
in front of the voters in order to get the
reforms that we need.

00:49:27.689 --> 00:49:29.589
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can we ask follow-up questions?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Of course.

00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:33.569
Go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If there's one person you remind me of,

00:49:33.569 --> 00:49:37.849
it's Obama, like, a candidate who --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's probably not helpful

00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:41.749
in the Republican primary.
But we'll take that.

00:49:41.749 --> 00:49:49.230
&gt;&gt;&gt; A candidate promising sweeping reforms,
you know, claiming that when he gets elected,

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:54.109
he'll have a mandate to do it.
And then going to face supermajority requirements

00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:58.509
in the legislature.
And, you know, I don't know how you square

00:49:58.509 --> 00:50:04.589
your own opposition to the health care reform
with what you're promising now and what you

00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:06.880
are saying about how you're going to handle
it later.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.950
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: It's one of these things
where if you don't try, it'll never get fixed.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:16.880
So I know I -- it's like my startup companies.
The probability of success at the beginning

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.380
was small.
And then over time, I built the confidence

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.190
of my venture capital exists they invested
more money over time.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.839
And over time, the probability of success
really ratcheted up.

00:50:26.839 --> 00:50:31.410
Here we have a situation where the state of
California is a mess, and we have to start

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.170
taking some big, bold steps in order to fix
it.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:38.160
It's going to be very difficult.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you very much.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.950
Sir, you have the honor of the last question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's great.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.009
Because I'm torn between two.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, you can have two questions,

00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:46.589
then.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:50.479
First question I have is sort of still a follow-up
along the same lines.

00:50:50.479 --> 00:50:54.329
You talked about the mandate.
Governor Schwarzenegger certainly talked about

00:50:54.329 --> 00:50:58.309
it.
Arguably, he had it because of the virtue

00:50:58.309 --> 00:51:01.690
of the recall.
No offense intended, but you're probably not

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:05.559
as popular as he is, you know, so you have
an even more --

00:51:05.559 --> 00:51:07.410
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: I'm more popular now than
he is.

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:11.549
&gt;&gt;&gt; That may be.
But, you know, you'll have even more of an

00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:15.309
uphill battle against the legislature than
he did because of that fact.

00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:17.560
How do you see yourself as being different
from him?

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.450
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: It's, again, a really good
question.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:26.200
Voters have a right to be very skeptical and
cynical, because they've heard this before.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.390
This is what Schwarzenegger said a few years
ago, and here we are in worse shape.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.990
Now, I'm a pretty good friend of Governor
Schwarzenegger.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.550
But, honestly, we're in worse shape than when
he started by a lot.

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.989
Unemployment rate's double; debt's through
the roof.

00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:45.769
Now, his heart's in the rate place.
I really do think that.

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:50.319
But the fact is, when he tried to go after
these fundamental structural reforms, he tried

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:53.630
to bite off too much in 2005 during that special
election.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:52:00.999
And there were some flaws in some of the ballot
initiatives that were pointed out by the opponents.

00:52:00.999 --> 00:52:05.279
And then he lost his appetite for reform.
That's not me.

00:52:05.279 --> 00:52:09.960
I can promise you this: I'm going to have
the tenacity, the backbone, and the will and

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.059
the drive to not budge.
You lose the first time.

00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:14.710
You try it again.
You lose again.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.999
You try it again.
We have to get this fixed.

00:52:17.999 --> 00:52:20.549
I think there's probably not much of a debate
on what we need to do.

00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:24.069
Our taxes are too high.
Our spending is out of control.

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:28.969
The regulatory system doesn't allow for permits
to be obtained to build manufacturing facilities.

00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:32.880
We have to overhaul that.
Our education system is micromanaged by the

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:38.819
legislature.
Let's' go on here is the problem, here's the

00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:41.660
solution.
And then let's figure out how to put political

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.250
pressure on the legislature to get the job
done.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:53.979
Here's one idea I have that's pretty controversial,
but I'll take it to the voters if I have to.

00:52:53.979 --> 00:52:58.289
That's to convert the legislature from full-time
to part-time.

00:52:58.289 --> 00:53:00.469
I know that's counterintuitive to some of
you.

00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:03.509
I would convert it to no time if I can get
away with it.

00:53:03.509 --> 00:53:06.329
I'm kidding about that.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: They make fewer laws because

00:53:06.329 --> 00:53:08.950
they're in office less.
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: That's a fact.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.420
Right now there are thousands and thousands
of pieces of legislation that flow through

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.089
the legislature.
Now, A few months ago, for example, in the

00:53:15.089 --> 00:53:19.059
middle of the financial meltdown, they actually
debated whether they should form a blueberry

00:53:19.059 --> 00:53:21.979
commission to promote the sales of blueberries.
Now, hey, --

00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:24.890
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You don't like blueberries?
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: I love blueberries.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.809
I just don't think we need a new commission.
Especially, we don't need the legislature

00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:31.040
focusing on it.
The other advantage of a part-time legislature

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:35.309
 -- which exists, by the way, in 42 states
have a part-time legislature -- is you change

00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:39.150
the mix of people in the legislature.
Part of the part-time legislature proposal

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:42.261
is to cut their salaries in half.
That would force people on the legislature

00:53:42.261 --> 00:53:47.510
to have a job someplace else.
That would be a good thing, people who actually

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.799
come from the trenches.
California had a part-time legislature from

00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:55.670
1850 to 1967.
And then, in my opinion, California started

00:53:55.670 --> 00:54:01.739
to deteriorate as a state when a professional,
full-time legislature emerged in the early

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.329
1970s.
And these professional politicians from both

00:54:04.329 --> 00:54:09.049
parties have done huge amounts of damage.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think that's a natural segue to the

00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:14.470
second question, which is, how do you distinguish
yourself from Governor Brown and what his

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.880
campaign is?
He's clearly a professional career politician,

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:24.099
but he at least is saying, look, we tried
the mandate with the governor, businessman

00:54:24.099 --> 00:54:25.469
who is going to come in.
That didn't work.

00:54:25.469 --> 00:54:27.210
You need a professional politician to fix
things.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.410
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: That's a great last question.
Because here, there's one of three people

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:36.329
who will be governor, that's for sure, Jerry
Brown, Meg Whitman, or Steve Poizner.

00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:40.950
There's three people that are really vastly
different in their backgrounds and approaches.

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.039
You have to love this.
Voters have choices.

00:54:43.039 --> 00:54:47.239
That's what campaigns are about is to draw
distinctions and make the choices crystal

00:54:47.239 --> 00:54:49.140
clear.
Voters have to decide.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.609
What a perfect time for an election right
now, because the state is in trouble and voters

00:54:53.609 --> 00:54:56.249
really need to give guidance, a mandate to
the next governor.

00:54:56.249 --> 00:55:03.200
You have Jerry Brown on one end of the spectrum,
40 years of political experience.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.269
He has had basically one job his whole life.
That's being in politics.

00:55:07.269 --> 00:55:12.539
And being in one elected position as another.
And some people, you know, like that extensive

00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:14.869
experience.
That's one end of the spectrum.

00:55:14.869 --> 00:55:18.519
Personally, I think a lot of voters have had
enough with career politicians.

00:55:18.519 --> 00:55:22.769
I think people are looking for someone who
actually has other experiences other than

00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:26.160
just being in politics, which takes you to
the other end of the spectrum.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.360
The other end of the spectrum is Meg Whitman,
who has no experience in politics, zero, didn't

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.619
vote, never run for office, has no idea, you
know, what it's like to be in Sacramento.

00:55:35.619 --> 00:55:38.690
Likes to say all the time, "We should run
Sacramento like a business."

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:42.839
Of course that should alert people that she
doesn't really know much about what she's

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:46.190
talking about, because it's not a business.
It's not even set up like a business.

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.299
That's not even the right analogy.
Maybe running Sacramento like a well-functioning

00:55:50.299 --> 00:55:54.170
nonprofit organization, that might be closer.
That's the other end of the spectrum.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:58.319
And I'm in the middle.
I think this is the sweet spot here.

00:55:58.319 --> 00:56:03.619
I have this 20 years of experience of starting
and running companies from scratch I know

00:56:03.619 --> 00:56:04.869
how to create jobs.
That's essential to get this economy back

00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:08.369
on track.
But I do have this eight years of success

00:56:08.369 --> 00:56:14.229
now in public service: In the White House
during the 9/11 crisis, in the classroom,

00:56:14.229 --> 00:56:18.000
running successfully as insurance commissioner,
being a very successful insurance commissioner.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.500
I think that the voters will focus in on my
hybrid skill set here and track record, and

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.200
that's going to make all the difference in
the world in the outcome of this election.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.430
Thank you, all, very much for the opportunity
to be here. I really appreciate it.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:34.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And, Mr. Commissioner, I think
all of us in California can thank you and

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:39.390
admire you for two things.
The first is that you're an example of what

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:44.660
is good about politics, that people care so
much about the state that they give up being

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:49.099
an entrepreneur to do something for the better
good of the state.

00:56:49.099 --> 00:56:51.019
And you've clearly done that.
And the second is, even if people disagree,

00:56:51.019 --> 00:56:55.390
the clarity of your positions and the clarity
with which you speak, I think, is a welcome

00:56:55.390 --> 00:57:00.079
improvement in politics today.
Thank you so much for being here.

00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:02.739
&gt;&gt;Steve Poizner: Thank you, all.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Good luck.

00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:02.779
