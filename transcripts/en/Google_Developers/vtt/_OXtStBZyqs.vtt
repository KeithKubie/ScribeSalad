[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.160
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.955
interesting developer community.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:16.079
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.110
has asked this question.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.110
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.390
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.640
questions--

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.920
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz,
and I work for YouTube.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.135
Here in the studio with me,
I have Jeremy Walker.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:35.820
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.230
JEREMY WALKER: I'm doing
pretty well today.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.910
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Good to see you.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.810
Long time no see.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.310
JEREMY WALKER: I know.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: On the
Hangout, we have Jeffrey

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.080
Posnick live from New York.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.140
How's it going, Jeff?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.500
JEFFREY POSNICK: I might
make it through the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.502
show without coughing.

00:00:50.502 --> 00:00:53.668
I think I'm at the tail end of
my illness, for those who have

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.408
been diligently following
along week to week.

00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:57.812
So pretty good.

00:00:57.812 --> 00:00:58.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Steady
progress, though.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740
That's iterative development.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.630
JEFFREY POSNICK: It
definitely is.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.340
I think I need maybe some agile
scrumming or something

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.476
like that to really get
me over the last bit.

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:10.430
I don't know.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.360
I think you need to improve
the bug fixing, Jeff.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.050
JEFFREY POSNICK: That's
probably it.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.080
So we have an exciting
show for you today.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.250
Jeremy has been quite
busy in his office.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.380
And he agreed to disclose the
project that he has been

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.430
working on.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.220
And I understand that it has
something to do with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060
application developers and
featuring applications.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.670
So maybe we'll let Jeremy talk
some more about what he has

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.773
been doing.

00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:39.190
JEREMY WALKER: Great, thanks.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.310
So yeah, I've been working on a
new showcase for the YouTube

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.940
apps for all the ones that have
been submitted to us.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.250
We basically had an older one
on the site right now.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.660
It's been around awhile.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.615
And we wanted to revamp it
to match the style of the

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:02.190
developers.google.com/showcase.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.510
Well, showcase, just
match that one.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.139
So what we started doing is
started getting together a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.150
bunch of the great apps that
you guys have put out for

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.890
YouTube, and started getting
submissions.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.970
And we hope to have the first
version up by early October,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.206
so next week, actually.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:24.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So if I'm an
application developer, and I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.430
would like my app to
be featured, what

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.325
do I need to do?

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:29.580
JEREMY WALKER: That's
a great question.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.800
So go to our Google+ page
and just write us.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.180
And we'll reach out to you,
and we'll get the process

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.680
kicked off.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.220
But yeah, if you don't see
yourself on that list next

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.420
week, definitely reach out
to us and let us know.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.490
Because we'd love to feature--

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.215
well, I mean, any of the work
you do with the YouTube APIs,

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:48.550
we always like to help
you guys out.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.450
So definitely reach out to us.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: As far as the
mechanics of submissions

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.400
go, what does one need to have
ready in addition to a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.950
beautiful, working,
innovative app?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.800
JEREMY WALKER: That's
a great question.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.060
So we actually need
a couple things.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.930
We need a description of
300 characters or less.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.790
That's very important.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.820
Some people submitted
longer than that.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.220
So if it's over 300, I'm going
to have to cut off,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.840
unfortunately.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.930
So make sure you get
it all into 300.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.510
So that just tells us a little
bit about your app and how

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.880
you're integrated
with YouTube.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.990
Screenshots and videos are good,
but most importantly are

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.990
the screenshots.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.750
They have to be in 16 by
9 aspect ratio, so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.790
make sure you do that.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.430
Otherwise, I'm going
to cut them off to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.330
make sure they fit.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And it may not match exactly
what you're looking for.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.700
So just make sure
you get those.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.530
We can have up to five.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.990
Usually one would be used for
the thumbnail, and then just

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.130
five others that people
can scroll through.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.060
And then those will be
added to the site.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.050
Outside of that, you've
just got to tell me

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.200
the name of the company.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.920
So it's really not
very much work.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.050
And then I understand that some
developers have already

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.900
submitted the information.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.280
And there's some early
entries that we were

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.180
going to show today.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.670
Is that right?

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.900
JEREMY WALKER: Yes, that's
exactly right.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.950
So we had some people.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.970
I sent out a list to the current
people that were

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.029
already part of the showcase and
people that we've already

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.640
worked with, and some of the
apps that we've already seen.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.830
I sent out a huge mailing list
with the form to everyone.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070
And we did get some feedback.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.150
So the people that did submit,
we're going to show some of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.610
them today.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.210
Let's go through some of them,
just to see what your thinking

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.390
process is like while accepting
or rejecting these

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.890
submissions.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.690
So show us some of the
ones that you think

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.110
are worth being showcased.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.950
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.800
So I'm going to share
my screen here.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.050
Give me a moment.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.860
All right.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.260
So this is the first one.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.600
This one's called VidCaster.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.880
They're a pretty neat
little app.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.920
Basically, what they do is they
help you create a video

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.000
portal very easily.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.080
So let's say you have
a bunch of videos.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.050
This happens to be my
YouTube channel.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.040
I've got some Smart Squirrels
Gets Nuts, some old-time help

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040
desk stuff.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.820
Basically a bunch of stuff that
I uploaded to YouTube.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.890
But I'm not that great at SEO,
let's say, and I don't want to

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.740
create a video player
from scratch.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.080
And I'm not necessarily using
a white label player.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.030
I just want to get a video
portal up with my content and

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.250
share it, but I don't want
to do a lot of the work.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.840
So what they let you do-- and
this is their interface right

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.820
here-- is you basically import
your channel, which I've

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.340
already done here.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.630
You select kind of a format
you want to use.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.870
So in this case, I'm
just going to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.110
use the basic rotator.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.420
You add a logo, which I actually
already did here for

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.980
the YouTube.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.130
And then you just confirm
your URL, and

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.886
you're pretty much done.

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.570
Outside of that, they help you
optimize a couple of things,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.820
and they give you
tips and tricks.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.600
There's a bit more to it, but
that gives you an idea.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.750
This is a great use of YouTube
and very little work if you

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.320
already have your YouTube
videos up.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.360
Congratulations, VidCaster.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.930
If you guys are watching,
you'll be

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.285
a part of the showcase.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:24.910
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anybody
else that you

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.870
would like to mention?

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.210
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, I got quite
a few more, actually.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
let's go for it.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.930
JEREMY WALKER: So GoAnimate--

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.350
so you guys probably saw them.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.490
We had them on a while back.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.890
They're a great site.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.870
So this is good if you're
kind of camera shy.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.240
Some people maybe want
to make some

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.580
videos about their products.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.510
And this is just a great
way to do it.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.420
You don't need to get
a video camera.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.310
You don't need to do
a whole production.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.260
You just go to their
site, sign up.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.180
And it's kind of a freemium
model, so you get a lot of

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.690
free stuff.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.950
And if you want to add some more
of the cool stuff, then

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.040
you can pay for it.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.800
But in this case, I'm going to
make a short video, an anime,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.730
because I love anime
and manga.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.290
So you just pick a couple
characters.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.610
Well, first you pick a scene.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.380
So you can see here, I'm
just going to pick

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.470
this Rice Cakes Home.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.330
You just pick a couple
characters.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.390
And then you just put
in some text.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.100
So you can use these voices.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:29.260
So I can say, "What's up?" And
then you can say, "YouTube

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.540
APIs are awesome." And
then I'm done.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.740
And I hit Preview.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.670
And you can see here it shows a
nice little preview of these

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.055
two people talking.

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:46.510
Give it a second to load.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.970
And there they go.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.430
You can't hear it.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.130
"What's up?" And then it
shows a picture of

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.240
the cookies and tea.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Nice work.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.740
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.815
So you can see I did that
in like a minute.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then the
video that is created can be

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.270
uploaded to YouTube
and share it.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.830
JEREMY WALKER: Exactly.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.000
So you can upload this
to YouTube, and

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.160
then push it forward.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then for
those of you that would like

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.080
to learn more about how this
application came about, we

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.050
actually did host GoAnimate on
this show a little earlier.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.440
So if you look through archival
coverage, actually,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.040
then to view with them,
it's here in the show.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.816
They were actually joining us
remotely from Hong Kong.

00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:31.332
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:33.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Anybody else
that you have on your list?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.610
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, I
got a couple more.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.039
And then I might turn
it over to you.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.760
So this one's called
Stupeflix.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.830
This one is pretty cool.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:48.710
So let's say I don't know
anything about editing video

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.540
together, or pictures, or
anything like that.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.040
But I want to make
something cool.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.840
I have all these cool pictures,
a couple of videos,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.500
and some music.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.390
But if I put it together, it's
going to look terrible,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.800
honestly, because I'm not
a great design person.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.280
So what this site lets you do
is basically you sign in.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.440
You get one free credit.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.870
And then you can get a plan.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.980
But what you can do is you
can upload pictures.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.280
Now here, I've already
uploaded.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.560
I just had my son, and so I put
a couple pictures from him

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.440
from Picasa.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.350
It lets you import from a lot
of sites, pretty much every

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.360
social site.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.290
So you can import a
bunch of pictures.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.530
You can even add audio-- upload
your own, or you can

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.980
just add some from their music
lounge, which is kind of what

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.730
they've already got.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.010
And then you can add more,
like some more stuff.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.830
But here, I can do
a quick preview.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.120
And you can see it'll make a
cool little video based on the

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.990
theme I picked out.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.080
So you didn't see the
theme page, but I

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.010
picked out a theme page.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.670
And it'll do a nice
little video.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.370
And I picked out the
most basic one.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.670
So you're not going
to see much of it,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.640
but you'll hear music.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.410
And you can kind
of re-edit it.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.170
And it makes a really nice video
that you can then export

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.500
to YouTube and share
with everyone.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.880
So this is just a way to take
all your pictures and stuff

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.710
and put it together.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.556
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Nice.

00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:11.110
JEREMY WALKER: And then I have
another one, Vidyard.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.220
They make a white label player
for companies, but they are

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.980
also very deeply integrated
with YouTube.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.190
So it's pretty nice.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.580
On one side, you can have the
nice UI that you've set up for

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.740
your white label player.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.180
But it also lets you actually
import the videos from your

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.750
YouTube account and also run
them with that same look and

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.700
feel with themes.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.540
So in this case, I created
a little player.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.620
And all these videos here--

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.180
Bad Morning, Smart Squirrel
Gets Nuts, and my webcam--

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.450
these are all from my channel.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.180
And actually, I just
imported them.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.380
And I chose a nice little
skin, and I play in it.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.390
You can see it looks like your
own white label player.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.250
Now, these guys offer a bunch of
extras, like analytics, and

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.950
AV testing, and all sorts of
good stuff for thumbnails.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.930
But this is just a great white
label player that's integrated

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.370
deeply with YouTube that lets
you not only have your white

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.280
label player, but also your
YouTube, and kind of combines

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.070
them a little bit.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, I think
the interesting part

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.280
about Vidyard is they're similar
to some of the other

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.860
apps that we mentioned in that
it's a business offering.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.260
So rather than consumer play,
when people create fun videos

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.210
and share with their friends,
actually they are very focused

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.140
on letting businesses really use
their video and leverage

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.090
the power of analytics to
measure things such as

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.600
conversion and how well the
video is actually going to

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.590
improve their bottom line.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.660
So a very interesting
application.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.875
Congrats, Vidyard, on
being featured.

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:40.560
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.190
And then there's one that
I know I'm going to

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.980
let you talk about.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh,
right, Groovideo.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.180
So we did host them previously
on our live show.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.670
And for those of you that missed
it, what Groovideo

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.210
allows you to do is to actually
collaboratively

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.440
create video.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.750
So the use case here
is you have

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.830
someone who has a birthday.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.280
You send a bunch of invitations
to people that

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.360
would like to congratulate the
birthday girl or birthday boy.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.400
And then they have the
ability to record

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.310
short snippets of videos.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.990
Groovideo puts it all together
in a nice, entertaining video

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.660
and then presents it to the
person that the video was

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.170
created for.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.130
So a very fun app.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.860
I really encourage you
to check it out.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.260
They have a mobile version of
the app, so you can actually

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.090
record the video with your
mobile device on the go.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.550
And they really take care of
all the stitching together,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.090
transcoding and uploading
to YouTube, so the

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.170
video can be shared.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.090
Very interesting application.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.100
Congrats to Groovideo.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.310
There is a couple of more apps
that I'm very interested in

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.880
and I wanted to highlight.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.120
One of that is Parrot.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.970
And for those of you that
participated in Google I/O,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.060
you might have seen them in
our Developer Sandbox.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.370
Those of you that didn't, I have
a couple of videos that I

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.900
wanted to share.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.220
One is a video that
I took in their

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.900
offices in Paris, France.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.322
[WHIRRING NOISE]

00:13:14.322 --> 00:13:15.572
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:22.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This
is actually a drone.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.330
Here's what it can do.

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:28.760
JEREMY WALKER: Oh, wow.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.340
Did you actually do that flip?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I was filming
the flip, but a

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.400
colleague of mine was actually
operating a drone.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.090
It's actually easier
than what it seems.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.980
You can operate it
with a tablet.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.315
They've done a really
nice job.

00:13:41.315 --> 00:13:43.312
JEREMY WALKER: That's
pretty awesome.

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:47.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then for
those of you that actually

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.920
came to Google I/O, you might
have seen the developer booth.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.620
So this is a view of
Google I/O from the

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.600
perspective of the drone.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.440
So actually, the drone is flying
over our Developer

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.900
Sandbox-- so here's YouTube,
a couple of

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.690
other Google products--

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.810
and taking video.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.900
So what they have done is
allowed you to very easily

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.240
upload video from the
drone to YouTube.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.500
So very, very interesting
application,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.520
also a lot of fun.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.170
And as you can see, it's
a pretty nice,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.240
high-quality video.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:27.500
So definitely a use case
that we like to see.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.602
And here's the drone
filming itself.

00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:34.636
All right.

00:14:34.636 --> 00:14:42.370
We're on replay, so we can stop
this video and move on to

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.620
the next one.

00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:50.390
JEREMY WALKER: All right.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.560
And then I think the other thing
that was interesting,

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.750
too, is they actually integrated
with Google TV.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:01.220
Because I remember in one of the
videos they presented of

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.890
our Sandbox, they showed
that integration.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.660
So they were showing both
at the same time.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.270
It was pretty cool.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, which
actually reminds me.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.570
One of the features that we
have on the showcase, on

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.110
developers.google.com, is we can
actually tag the product

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.090
with multiple APIs that
are being used.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.940
So if you are building an app,
and you use a bunch of

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.640
different APIs.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.660
Like in the case of Parrot's
YouTube API, Google TV, then

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.210
mention that, because that
will help your app to be

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.670
discovered.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.110
If someone's looking for
examples of specific

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.460
integrations, they
can actually see

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.570
you up right there.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.535
So is that extra points?

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:37.880
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.670
Let's look at a couple of other
applications that I

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.530
wanted to share with you.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.510
These ones are actually mobile
apps, so I'm going to switch

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.040
over to my tablet here.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.650
And I'll show you a
couple of them.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.760
So let's take a look
at the first one.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.030
And this is Band of the
Day by 955 Dreams.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.280
For those of you that came to
Google I/O, you might have

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.780
caught our joint presentation
about building mobile

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.590
applications for content
creators and consumers.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:22.250
So Kiran, the CEO of 955 Dreams,
was actually speaking.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.240
And here is their app.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.770
So what this app allows you to
do is basically, every day,

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.520
get a new band that
you can discover.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.090
So let's just check out today's
band, Freddie Gibbs.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.680
You can actually learn more
about the artist, read the

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.320
bio, read reviews,
and so forth.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.460
And obviously, you can
also watch videos.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:48.130
So they integrated the YouTube
embed player on iOS, so this

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.910
is running inside
of the UIWebView

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.810
using the iFrame embed.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:58.760
So if you hit Play, it'll
actually play the video in the

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.010
application.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.350
Now, another application
that we also have in

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.730
the gallery is Flipboard.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.819
Flipboard, for those of you that
are not familiar with it,

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.960
it's a social magazine.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.970
So you can actually integrate a
lot of various data sources.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.420
They also have their own
recommendations and curation

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.550
capability.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.390
And then you can consume it all
within a simple, beautiful

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.410
experience.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.380
Recently, Flipboard integrated
YouTube API, so this is my

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.890
Flipboard feed.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.680
I have tiles representing
various data sources.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.740
And then if I scroll
to the last page, I

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.990
have my YouTube videos.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.300
So, you can actually see
my subscriptions.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.835
I'm a big fan of PBS NewsHour.

00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:49.340
This is where I get my news.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.885
I have to admit, I'm a big
Epic Meal Time fan.

00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:54.415
And this is where I get
cooking recipes from.

00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:57.860
If you guys haven't seen them,
it's actually quite fun.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.980
So between coding sessions, it's
a great way to relax and

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.490
catch up on the latest cuisine
recommendations.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.500
And a couple of others.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.670
So really, what you see here
is the subscriptions are

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.850
actually fetched using the
YouTube API and presented

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.660
inside of the Flipboard app.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.010
And you can also interact with
the content, so you can like a

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.430
video directly from the app.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.540
You can comment on the
video as well.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.250
So as you see here, I can write
a comment directly from

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.990
the application.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.040
And the way this is implemented
is by using the

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.400
YouTube API.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.200
JEREMY WALKER: They have a
couple API integrations, too,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.040
didn't they?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.580
They launched a week
before I/O?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.430
I think they also integrated
G+ as a

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.820
part of the same release.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.510
So yeah, definitely an

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.430
interesting integration example.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.920
So I think this is all
we have for today.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.360
But I understand that the
list is actually larger.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.690
JEREMY WALKER: Yes, yes.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.640
It is much larger.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:09.350
So we're launching with
about 35, so check

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.650
that out next week.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.670
We've been talking
with most of you

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.040
anyway about this stuff.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.460
So if you also would like to
come talk to us on the show,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.880
we're very interested
in that, too.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.210
So continue reaching
out to us.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.155
And again, if you're not on
that first list, then

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:34.080
definitely reach out to us
on our Google+ page.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Don't despair,
and just reach out.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.460
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.300
We'll get you up as soon as you
get us the information.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.980
Well, not as soon, but probably
a week later or so.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds good.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.590
And I think also looking through
the gallery will give

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.800
you a good idea about the types
of applications that we

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.130
feel are interesting and worth
spreading the word about from

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.760
our perspective.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.380
So let this be the guide as
well, if you would like to

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.150
participate in the showcase.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.860
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.290
That's on
developers.google.com/showcase.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.070
Just remember "showcase."

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.080
So now we have some
time left over.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.990
So I know another thing you have
been recently working on

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.490
is some blogging, Jeremy.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.610
How's that going?

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.280
JEREMY WALKER: Good, good.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.995
I actually did my first blog
post on the YouTube API.

00:20:20.995 --> 00:20:21.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Congratulations.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.970
JEREMY WALKER: Thanks.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.880
I thought it was important to
talk about YouTube channels

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.270
and business, so I wanted
to do that first.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.530
So I don't know if any
of you guys saw it.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.640
If you went to I/O, or you've
been watching I/O videos, then

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.360
you've probably seen the
presentation by Dror and AJ.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.010
They're two of our PMs and
experts in channels.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.490
They did this great presentation
on why it's

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.260
important to have a channel
on YouTube.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.750
Not only do we have 800 million
unique users per

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:59.210
month, but people don't realize
how easy it is to have

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.330
a presence.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.140
And you notice I said
"presence." I didn't say

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.600
"create video." I said
"presence." So you can create

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.980
video, and it's very easy,
and they go into that.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.140
But a lot of channels actually
curate content from their

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.880
users that use their apps
or products or whatever.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.840
So they go into that, too.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.850
So there's really a
lot of options.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.040
So they basically broke it down
to three basic categories

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.270
around what your goal is.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.430
The first one is raising
awareness.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.870
The second one is raising money,
so any of you startups

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.790
out there, if you want
to look into that,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.090
that's pretty important.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:38.820
They go into some studies on
like how much it increases to

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.370
have video--

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.540
how much more money you get.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.190
So it's pretty important
to check that out.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.580
Again, Kickstarter, Indiegogo,
stuff like that.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.160
So check that out.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.420
And then finally, research and
supporting your users.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.310
So you can kind of figure
out-- it's a great R&amp;D

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.320
environment, YouTube is.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.580
You can figure out
what features are

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.660
popular, what are not.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.100
And you can get a lot of
analytics around that to make

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.870
your decisions.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.660
So maybe you build
this out more.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.150
You may be surprised that people
really like a feature

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.810
that you didn't think
much about.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.200
So they kind of go into little
studies about each of those.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.410
And the really neat thing about
the presentation is

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.900
every slide or so, they
show a video.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.180
And they're funny videos.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.440
They're good videos, because
they're content.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.550
They're not commercials, which
they'll drive home a lot.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.840
But basically, it's really
a joy to watch it.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.970
It's like watching a playlist
with commentary in between.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.360
So I did a short blog
post on it.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.450
That's up now, so
check that out.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.360
I embedded the video there.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.720
So I'd strongly suggest you
check it out, especially if

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.060
you're building something out,
whatever you're doing.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.650
If you're building an app, and
you want some exposure,

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:48.980
definitely follow that.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.440
And then they give you some
great resources after that.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.190
Yeah, I saw the presentation.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.960
And we actually hosted Dror and
AJ before Google I/O to

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.320
speak about the presentation.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.450
So very useful.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.530
As you said, whether you're a
content creator or you're an

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.790
entrepreneur, and you would like
to use YouTube to really

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.140
promote your product, whether
you create the content

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:16.770
yourself or you let
crowd-sourced content serve as

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.630
the promotional videos for
your product, you can

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.410
definitely do that.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.780
Jeff will probably like me to
say that YouTube Direct is a

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.370
great way to actually achieve
that, solicit

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.650
the videos from users.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.110
In fact, a lot of businesses are
doing it that way, so they

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.000
don't actually have to hire
someone to produce the videos

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.360
because the users
do it for them.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.060
And sometimes they actually are
very fun and innovative

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.230
videos that they can get.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.390
So a great, fun session.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.210
I think one thing that you
didn't mention is there's a

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.360
lot of cool videos in
the video itself.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.190
So really fun and
entertaining.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.902
I highly recommend that
you check it out.

00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:53.270
Great.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.780
So I know Jeff has been busy
with our Stack Overflow

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.320
transition.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.540
Jeff, how is that going?

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.430
Any update from your front?

00:24:05.741 --> 00:24:09.250
JEFFREY POSNICK: For those who
have not been following along

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.060
with our communication, we've
announced in a couple places

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.950
now for a while that we're going
to be getting rid of--

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.650
or I guess turning into
read-only mode--

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.310
our existing Google group that
we previously used for support

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.130
with any questions about the
YouTube Data or Player APIs.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.900
And instead, we're encouraging
folks to do one of two things

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.640
if they need any help
with the APIs.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.070
Either if it's a feature request
or if it's reporting a

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.970
bug, opening an issue in our
Issue Tracker hosted on

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.310
code.google.com is the best
way of doing that.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.350
And that'll just make sure
it gets our attention.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.990
We could assign internal bug
IDs to these things.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.830
It's actually a lot better than
the old situation where

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.630
people would post about a
bug to a mailing list.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.730
And then we'd have to track down
the original posting to

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.240
update people, and lots of
duplication, things like that.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.710
So Issue Tracker for
certain things.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.570
And then for just general
YouTube API questions, like,

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.140
how do I do this?

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.240
Is it possible to do that?

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.790
We're asking that folks
use Stack Overflow.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.710
And that's something that people
had been doing just

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.440
kind of organically anyway,
without any

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.320
encouragement on our part.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.300
Stack Overflow is a great
resource that developers just

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.390
know about and know
to go to use.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.700
And the nice thing is that
now, we're going to be

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.970
actually officially providing
support from our

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.650
team on Stack Overflow.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.860
So in addition to getting
questions answered by members

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.720
of just the general Stack
Overflow community, you'll get

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.580
me answering some questions and
Jarek and Jeremy answering

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.870
some questions as well.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.820
So yeah, I've enjoyed it.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.240
It's been nice watching my Stack
Overflow reputation grow

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.440
as I started posting.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.240
As a consumer of Stack Overflow
answers, I guess,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.380
they always tend to be great
answers that show up in search

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.180
results when you're trying
to solve something.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.990
I spent all my time posting
in Google group.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.580
I couldn't also devote the
time to Stack Overflow.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.030
So now I'm building up my Stack
Overflow reputation and

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.320
enjoying that.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, Jeff.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.960
And thanks for actually dressing
up our section there

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.310
on Stack Overflow with a nice
logo and everything.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.460
I think that makes
it more official.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.033
I think we are now legit.

00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:32.080
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yes, we are.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.197
And October 15 is the date
that we're going to be

00:26:36.197 --> 00:26:40.070
switching the old discussion
Google group

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.810
into read-only mode.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.810
But don't wait until then to
start either using the Issue

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.440
Tracker or start of
Stack Overflow.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.752
I definitely encourage you
to do one of those.

00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:52.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.880
We have some time left, so why
don't we check the question

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.270
section on our moderator.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.970
So we have two questions here.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.680
One is from Jeremy Walker.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.960
I know this person.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.880
It's about hiring.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.930
Is Google YouTube Developer
Relations hiring?

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.360
JEREMY WALKER: Yes, we are.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.700
Google Developer Relations is
hiring, and so is YouTube.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.330
So apply.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.180
We're very interested.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.130
Just go to the site and look
at the jobs listings, and

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.775
apply, apply, apply.

00:27:27.775 --> 00:27:28.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.190
Next one is from Jeffrey
Posnick, also a

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.690
very familiar name.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.060
New York City.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.520
So the question is about
playback of YouTube videos on

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.365
iOS 6, whether there have been
any changes in this area.

00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:46.720
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yes.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.835
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'll
let you answer your

00:27:47.835 --> 00:27:48.530
own question, Jeff.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.730
This is, by the way, Stack
Overflow style.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.070
JEFFREY POSNICK: This is
the only way I could

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.940
get anybody's attention.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.020
I feel like I need to use
the built-in moderator.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.640
But no, I've been seeing a lot
of questions about recently.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.970
And I don't have the full
answer, but I wanted to just

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.830
share what I think has
changed so far.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.305
I actually haven't had a chance
to update some of the

00:28:12.305 --> 00:28:15.500
test devices I have
to iOS 6 yet.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.860
But just a little bit
of background.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.850
For folks who have previously
embedded YouTube videos on web

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.210
pages and had those either play
back in the mobile Safari

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.330
on an iOS device or within a UI
WebKit view within an iOS

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.770
application, if you've
used the embed tag--

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.940
like brackets embed,
basically--

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.590
and used that to embed a video,
playback was previously

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:46.330
handled by the, I guess, now the
legacy YouTube application

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.510
that was installed
on the phone.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.500
It would actually open up the
YouTube application, play back

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.210
the video, and then go back to
your web page or application

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.550
when that was done.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.690
That's changed in iOS 6.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.150
And what I think has been
happening based on what I've

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.210
been hearing from folks is
that the tags are being

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.700
automatically translated
into iFrame embed tags.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.500
And then playback is happening
inline now, which is what you

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.510
normally see with an
iFrame player.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.130
And it's using native HTML5
video within those apps.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.350
So that's not something
we have complete

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.530
control over, actually.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.950
So if you're seeing this, it
caught me a little bit by

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.820
surprise, although it
does make sense.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.730
But I think that's what
you're seeing.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.195
I don't know whether, Jarek or
Jeremy, you've had a chance to

00:29:36.195 --> 00:29:39.850
play around at all and confirm
any of that, or what.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:40.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
I think on the

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.410
iPad is inline playback.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.120
I believe on iPhone devices,
it's still full screen.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.970
I think the difference is, as
you mentioned, it's actually

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.720
using the HTML5 video tag.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.530
So the old legacy embeds will
still continue working.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.120
They're just being rewritten
as the iFrame embeds.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.675
So now, our iFrame embed
implementation is going to

00:30:03.675 --> 00:30:07.120
kick in, although that
internally uses the video tag

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.450
implementation provided
by the browser on

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.290
these mobile devices.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.060
So if you see any issues
or any feedback,

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.970
please let us know.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.750
Ping us on G+ or ask a

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.890
question here in the moderator.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.840
If you have problems
embedding--

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.628
JEFFREY POSNICK: Don't
ping us on Google+.

00:30:26.628 --> 00:30:30.720
Ask a Stack Overflow question
or open a bug

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.700
in the Issue Tracker.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.026
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, sure.

00:30:33.026 --> 00:30:36.790
See, I'm still getting used to
the new world, apparently.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.570
But listen to Jeff.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.666
Definitely that's the
right process.

00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:42.430
All right.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.590
So I think this is it.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.550
No more questions, so I think
this is a short and sweet

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.260
session today.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.800
I would like to thank Jeremy
for spending all the time

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.060
putting together the showcase.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.120
I understand it's launching
early next quarter, so I'm

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.160
looking forward to that.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.560
And then again, if you have an
application you would like

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.960
featured, please let us know.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.200
And check out the ones that
we'll be launching just to get

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.180
a basic idea about what type of
quality we're looking for.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.430
In the meantime, keep
innovating, keep hacking, and

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.760
I guess we'll see you
again next week.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.190
We'll be looking into
a live from New York

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.180
session next week.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.900
I'm just confirming a very
exciting guest, so it should

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.480
be pretty fun.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.580
And Jeff, thank you very much.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.650
I think you're making
steady progress.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:37.540
I've been counting your coughs,
and definitely the

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.250
trend is the right one.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.500
They are decreasing right in
time for the flu season

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.250
starting on the East Coast.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.760
All right, thank
you very much.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.950
JEFFREY POSNICK:
Bye, everybody.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Until
the next week, bye.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:47.767
