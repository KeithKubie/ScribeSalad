RACHEL AMARA: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.880
Welcome to our Artists
at Google today.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.560
My name is Rachel Amara.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.920
And I am really excited today to
host and introduce Freddie

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.080
Ravel to everyone.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.480
So my story with Freddie is I
met Freddie a few months ago.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.940
And he told me about his vision
for helping others

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.600
discover how music relates to
our everyday lives, how it can

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.990
help us to tune in--

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.790
no pun intended--

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.900
to live better lives through his
Tune Up concert, which is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.170
what we're going to
experience today.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.010
So after that, I knew I had
to bring him to Google.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.050
Freddie was utterly captivated
by music since age five.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.990
Freddie has recorded and
performed across six

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.970
continents with luminaries you
may know or heard of like

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.600
Madonna, Prince, the Boston
Pops, Earth, Wind, and Fire,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.980
Carlos Santana, and
many others.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520
He's scored numerous Grammys as
well as the coveted number

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.830
one spot in US charts.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.290
In response to the
ever-increasing challenges to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.540
effective communication in the
workplace, Freddie created

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.040
Tune Up to Success, a unique
peak performance methodology

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.530
based on the universal language
of music that we all

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.630
know and love.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.980
Dubbed the "Motivational
Maestro" by the city of Los

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.760
Angeles, he continues to garner
acclaim for clients

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.720
such as Google, Apple,
Citi, and NASA.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.810
Today Freddie will share with
us his musical tools for

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.790
creating success in
our personal and

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.350
professional pursuits.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.560
So please put your hands
together and help me welcome

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.810
Freddie Ravel.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:02:14.070
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.531
FREDDIE RAVEL: Put your hands
together, everybody!

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:24.674
Good afternoon, Google!

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:26.150
All right!

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.400
Here we go!

00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:34.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.900
FREDDIE RAVEL: Thank
you very much.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.150
[SAYS "THANK YOU" IN MULTIPLE
FOREIGN LANGUAGES]

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.880
I say "thank you," ladies and
gentlemen, in all these

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.820
languages, because we live
in a world of global

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.180
opportunities and challenges.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.510
Especially in this new digital
universe that we find

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.400
ourselves in.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.870
It's racing before us, where
multiple cutting-edge

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.800
technologies are unfolding as
I say these very words--

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.520
especially in this building.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.399
And I've got a few questions.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.620
Is something as fundamental as
email a fabulous thing, or

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.690
this massive thing that eats
away, it saps away of our

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.890
time, the most commodity
that we have?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.190
Is something like harnessing the
power of Google Hangouts,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.740
LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter,
texting-- to enhance our

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.090
personal and professional
relationships--

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.350
is there a better
tool to do that?

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.550
And finally, how do we access
the power and potential of our

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.030
world's greatest asset,
the people?

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.360
The people that we work with,
the people that we play with,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.940
our clients, and
our colleagues.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.360
With all this endless data,
what's the next tool that

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.620
could help us connect the
information to the people that

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.140
need to use it?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:19.170
Today I am delighted to show you
how the structure of music

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.170
is really the structure of
success, and how it provides a

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.440
roadmap for all our pursuits,
personally and professionally.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.870
How?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.840
Well the structure of music is
the structure of success.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.240
Now some of you might be
thinking, how could my

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.740
favorite song have anything
to do with success?

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.080
Well let's take a look.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.540
Every fantastic piece of music
begins and is built on four

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.030
foundations of music.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.640
The first foundation
is melody.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.340
Throughout the ages, we find
that music that soothes the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.960
soul and survives the centuries
always features a

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.660
strong melody.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.620
Melody is then supported
by harmony.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.710
Harmony provides the backdrop
that makes the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.890
melody stand out.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.310
And then after you have melody
and harmony, you need the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.480
power of rhythm to drive melody
and harmony forward,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.840
hence we have rhythm.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.580
When melody, harmony, and rhythm
all come together, they

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.620
result in what we call
in music the score.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.145
The score is the totality of
melody, harmony, and rhythm

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:29.463
coming together.

00:06:29.463 --> 00:06:35.310
Now let's flip over and look
at any business, all right?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.300
At the beginning of a business,
the very first thing

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.130
that launches all business
is leadership--

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.020
the leader.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.660
Leadership needs the
power of teamwork.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.000
After teamwork, you need to be
able to manage this across the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.170
power of time.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.310
So the management
of time is the

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.320
rhythm that drives business.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.280
Finally when leadership,
teamwork, and time all come

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.540
together, you arrive at
the score of success.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:16.060
So the structure of music is
the structure of success.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.830
And there's a very organic
reason for

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.450
this, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.960
You see, music is with us from
the cradle to the grave.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.990
I mean you know, we all
enter the world.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.158
And the first thing
we hear, you know?

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:29.652
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:36.660
FREDDIE RAVEL: And then you
know, a few years go by.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.280
We're at about four,
five years old.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.623
And it starts to get a little
more sophisticated.

00:07:40.623 --> 00:07:45.936
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:46.902
FREDDIE RAVEL: Right?

00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:48.351
(SINGING) Down came the rain--

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:48.840
Right?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.490
And then after we get past
little "Itsy Bitsy Spider,"

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.650
you know, we get into
adolescence, right?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.430
Adolescence--

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.330
the music begins to shift
a little bit.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.460
It's more along the lines of--

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.869
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:03.817
FREDDIE RAVEL: Oh!

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.067
Dude!

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.460
Right?

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.980
And then as we progress, we get
into our 20s, 30s, and we

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.720
start to actually consider
that maybe

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.143
true love is out there.

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:28.650
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.409
FREDDIE RAVEL: Mr. Right,
Mrs. Right, right?

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.349
At least we hope.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.599
And music's there, right?

00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:46.290
And if that goes right, music's
standing right there,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.360
ready to support us, right?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.186
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:50.436
FREDDIE RAVEL: It's there.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.556
And if that goes right,
we make the next move.

00:08:58.556 --> 00:08:59.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.620
FREDDIE RAVEL: Years start to
go by, anniversary after

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.400
anniversary, right?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.300
Quinceaneras, Bar
Mitzvahs, right?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.810
The holidays, year by year.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.440
And eventually, we get to that
place where you know, I can't

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.678
do much about this one.

00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:28.410
It's going to happen.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.440
The music's there.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.958
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.480
FREDDIE RAVEL: And the really
cool thing about music is that

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.720
it's even there for
the Resurrection.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:10:05.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.340
FREDDIE RAVEL: Cradle to the
grave, music is with us from

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.650
the cradle to the grave.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.300
And there's another very organic
reason for this.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.100
We are hardwired for music.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.710
If I say to you--

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.430
and don't be shy right
now, everybody.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.440
I know you're eating your lunch,
but check this out.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.620
If I say, (SINGING) dun, dun
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.760
dun, you say--

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.320
AUDIENCE: [SINGING]

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.390
FREDDIE RAVEL: And that
concludes my talk today, and--

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.870
we are hardwired for music.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.130
We inherently understand
the power of the way

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.900
music is put together.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.860
Now music is the great
invitation for mankind to

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.500
transcend spoken word, to
enhance how we think and put

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.010
into sync so we hear what
is mostly not heard--

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.910
the ground, Mother Earth.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.810
The holy grail of everything we
do in life revolves around

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.510
the power of listening.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.650
Nothing can happen unless we are
as present as possible and

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.200
we become extraordinary
listeners.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.040
This is what makes music such
an exceptional, unique, and

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.740
powerful tool.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.930
Because music is one of the very
few things in life that

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.320
we willingly listen to.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.095
In fact, we actually
seek it out.

00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:35.530
Remember that saying, we were
given two ears but only one

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.690
mouth because God said
that listening was

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.210
twice as hard as talking?

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.780
Well he--

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.280
or she--

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.370
was right.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.220
I had the great honor and
pleasure to speak over at

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.280
Honda Motors a couple
years ago.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.640
And I spent some time with the
president, Mr. Tetsuo Iwamura.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.930
He has the North American
division of Honda.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.270
And he explained to me that
at Honda, the emphasis on

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.470
listening is so powerful, that
it's so critical to their

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.950
success, that "listen" is the
first word in their operating

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.500
principle at Honda Motors.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.220
And the operating principle at
Honda Motors is "Listen, Ask,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.020
and Speak Up."

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.380
Now listening takes practice.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.650
It's a lot of hard work.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.320
And there's reasons for this.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.720
You know, we speak at about 150
words a minute, average

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.730
human being.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.170
But our minds go at 600 to
1,000 words a minute.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.305
So you say something to
somebody, and their minds have

00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:36.630
raced way ahead of you onto
something entirely different

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.830
like where'd I put my car keys
or should I reply that email.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.500
People's minds are
wandering right?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.250
Can everyone relate
to this one?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.030
You say something to somebody
and they're wandering.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.540
Very common, right?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.920
Now there's a reason for this.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.360
There are basically two
types of listening.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.250
The first kind of listening is
called passive listening.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.316
Passive is to listen
without reacting.

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:02.990
The second one is active.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:08.470
Active listening is to
listen for meaning.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.800
Now I'd like to share with
you a little bit

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.760
about Dr. Peter Senge.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.470
Dr. Peter Senge is at MIT.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.100
He's been called the business
strategist of the century.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.680
And Dr. Senge says that to
listen fully means to pay

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.830
close attention to what is being
said beneath the words.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.590
You listen not only to the music
but also to the essence

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.100
of the person speaking.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.670
So what turns passive

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.760
listening into active listening?

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.730
Three basic ideas.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.990
The first one is you've got to
listen for meaning when you're

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.120
speaking with anybody and
listening to them.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.670
And number two, you have to
listen for what is being said

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.480
beneath the words.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.420
And then my favorite is you have
to listen for the space

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.240
between the notes.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.800
And I've got a little
tune up tip.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.350
Is it all right if I share with
you a little tune up tip?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.700
Because here it comes.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.800
The tune up tip goes
like this.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.350
If you take the word
"listen"--

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.170
L-I-S-T-E-N--

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.580
it happens to be an anagram.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.610
Just by rearranging the letters,
you simply get the

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.970
word "silent." I invite
you all to own this

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.950
one, use this one.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.350
It will serve you well.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.940
Now one of the masters of
employing the power of silence

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.420
and the space between the notes
was the great Count

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.170
Basie who we lost about
a decade ago.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:38.290
Now Count Basie was considered
the master of swing.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.260
But he was also a master of the
space between the notes.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.392
In fact, he was so good at the
space between the notes that

00:14:42.392 --> 00:14:46.290
he actually developed a riff on
the piano that was filled

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.305
with space between the notes.

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:48.260
It went like this.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.340
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.520
FREDDIE RAVEL: Audiences fell in
love with this idea so that

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.040
when his big band would play all
over the country, at the

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.190
very end of his songs when he
would play those three notes,

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.300
the entire audience-- and I'm
talking about tens of

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.650
thousands of people-- would say,
(SINGING) Count Basie.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.990
Filled with space.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.090
The audience was completely
pulled-in to

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.910
the power of this.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.810
Now the other thing that Count
Basie did is when he would

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.160
play a piece of music,
he'd put a lot of

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.190
space in the notes.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.410
If we take a song--

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.020
a classic American jazz piece
like Duke Ellington's "Satin

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.260
Doll," the song goes
like this.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:33.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.450
FREDDIE RAVEL: Very famous
jazz tune, right?

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.820
Most pianists--

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.970
many musicians--

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.700
will come to the piano, and
they'll be all about the

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.840
melody, they'll all be about how
many notes can I play and

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.670
kind of show off?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.380
What am I going to do?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.070
And they start playing--

00:15:46.070 --> 00:16:06.365
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:07.870
FREDDIE RAVEL: Ugh!

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.770
Who wants to hear that?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.540
That's a lot of notes, right?

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.482
Do we care?

00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:14.930
No!

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.730
We don't care about that.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.570
Because when people play too
many notes and when they speak

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.030
to one another and they have
so much to say, there is no

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.870
respect for the listener.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.660
And Count Basie understood
that you have

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.310
to honor your listener.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.440
And the space between the
notes invites that.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.451
So what does Count Basie
do with this song?

00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:42.486
Well he goes like this--

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:56.558
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.260
FREDDIE RAVEL: You can snap
your fingers if you want,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.275
right here.

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:01.532
Give me a little Google
click, right here.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.530
How's that?

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.050
The space between the notes is
as powerful as the notes

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.470
themselves.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.990
It is the space between the
bars of a cage that

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.010
keep the tiger in.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.820
You've got to have that space.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.650
It's awesome.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.630
It's powerful.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.260
And it is the structure
of music as the

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.370
structure of success.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:48.520
Now I have to tell you, I have
been truly blessed to discover

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.884
many of the tools I'm sharing
with you under the guidance of

00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:53.400
some amazing people.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.120
I kind of have to pinch
myself sometimes.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.810
But for many years, I had the
privilege of touring and

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.180
recording with Carlos Santana,
Al Jarreau, Earth, Wind, and

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.060
Fire, Madonna, all these
different artists.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.670
And I'm very thrilled
to be here.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.770
Because it's a privilege to
share the tools that I've

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.450
learned from these people and
offer them to you as tools

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.880
that you can use.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.470
One of these tools is the very
beginning of our first

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.880
foundation, melody.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.130
Melody.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.470
Melody is the unique signature
of virtually

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.490
every piece of music.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.040
It shapes the identity.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.420
If you ask anybody how
does that song go?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.110
People don't go [SINGING].

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.450
That's the bass line
of the drums.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.340
They sing the melody.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.850
Because the melody is the
identity of the song.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.810
This is what's critical.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.900
Now in music, we call
the melody the hook,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.900
the hook of the song.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.090
In business, it's called
the vision.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.940
And whether it comes from the
lead singer or the CEO of a

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.420
company, it represents the
strength, passion, and purpose

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.950
of the song or the vision.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.720
And it makes both leaders stand
up and say I am, and

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.420
this is my vision.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.240
Now our first foundation of
melody is that melody is the

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.520
expression of leadership.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.470
It is the lead idea in music.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.650
It's the lead idea
in business.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.850
And leaders, like songs, come
in many different styles.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.300
You know, some leaders
come in.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.690
They walk into the room.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.597
And it's big.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:30.652
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:30.652 --> 00:19:31.902
FREDDIE RAVEL: Big!

00:19:36.064 --> 00:19:37.314
Everybody!

00:19:41.476 --> 00:19:43.818
OK!

00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:44.220
Big!

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.390
They come into the room New York
style, Big Apple style,

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.230
kind of Richard Branson style.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.170
Bigger than life
kind of energy.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.660
And then you've got executives
that are the opposite.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.770
They're almost like
quiet power.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.670
You know, the energy's
along these lines.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:10.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.620
FREDDIE RAVEL: Kind of like
Warren Buffett, you know?

Quiet power, quiet power.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.160
And then you've got leaders--

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.310
and this is a trait you will
see in all leaders-- is the

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.700
ability to focus.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.050
They focus on what they believe
in to such a point

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.570
that if they're dialed in on one
note, irregardless of all

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.950
the distractions, all the
dissonance that comes up, they

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.380
stick to the knitting
of what they believe

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.630
in, along these lines.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:21:39.835
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:39.835 --> 00:21:42.076

a collective Ole!

00:21:42.076 --> 00:21:43.326
AUDIENCE: Ole!

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.550
FREDDIE RAVEL: No matter how
chaotic the situation is, the

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.770
leaders who focus on that
note irregardless of the

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.700
distractions can punch through
and get their message heard.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.720
This is what makes leadership
so powerful.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.140
Now life and business
are team sports.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.250
And if you ask any leader,
they will tell you that

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.890
they're only as good as the
team that supports them.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.260
And this brings us, ladies and
gentleman, to our second

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.440
foundation of tune up,
which is harmony.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.790
Harmony.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.700
Leaders spend a lot of time
listening to their own voices.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.450
This is kind of where
leaders hang out.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.260
They hang out on their melody.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.890
Harmony is the other
side of the coin.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.000
In harmony, we spend time really
listening to each other

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.680
and honoring the spirit
of collaboration.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.870
Harmony is about listening to
one another, but even more,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.470
harmony is collaboration
with purpose.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:50.670
The idea of harmony is making
the shift from "I am" to "we

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.430
are." I am to we are.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.570
It's almost like in the world
of music going from being a

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.400
solo musician to deciding you're
going to integrate

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.660
another member of the band.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.330
You go from I am to we are.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.640
You expand the band, right?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.290
This is very important.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.110
And one of the great tips that
I've enjoyed sharing over the

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.010
years is something I want to
share with Google right now.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:20.590
It's called listen to the
question behind the statement.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.710
Now what's really fun about this
one is that professors of

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.070
music theory often call the
balance in music as the

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.250
question and the answer.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.130
And good musicians do this
as a matter of practice.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.310
They know that music is
constructed this way.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.330
For example, Johann Strauss
writes "The Blue

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.750
Danube." The question--

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.840
[SINGING]

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.090
The answer is--

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.040
don't be shy.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.190
I'm going to try that again.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.990
The question is--

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.860
[SINGING]

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.100
AUDIENCE: [SINGING]

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.430
FREDDIE RAVEL: Ah, gracias.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.400
Now let's take this one--

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.090
Mozart, "Symphony in
G Minor." [SINGING]

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.940
AUDIENCE: [SINGING]

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.020
FREDDIE RAVEL: Thank you.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.790
It's for the San Francisco
Giants.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.372
[SINGING]

00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:13.980
AUDIENCE: [SINGING]

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.480
FREDDIE RAVEL: There you go.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.640
I heard the "buy me some peanuts
and crackerjack." I

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.030
heard that one.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.110
How about this one,
the Beatles?

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.090
[SINGING]

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.600
The answer--

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.090
[SINGING]

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.200
Big, Google.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.350
[SINGING]

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.640
Nice and big!

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.680
[SINGING]

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.570
OK, I'm going to have to get
the Google bus and take you

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.720
all on the road with me,
take you all out.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.750
So this is the power of the
question behind the statement.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.600
Because once you understand
that, you start to see that

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.250
music is the symmetry.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.660
All successful music
has a center.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.150
But what happens when you have
two different viewpoints,

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.010
people getting together--
possibly for the first time--

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.350
and they have two different
questions and

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.680
answers going on?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.160
So let's say you've got--

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.640
be hypothetical here, let's say
you've got Jane and sales

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.910
and you've got John
in marketing.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.200
And they both come in with
a lot of enthusiasm.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.710
Jane says hey, I've
got an idea.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.060
FREDDIE RAVEL: It sounds
good, right?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.340
In of its own, it's a very
complete statement, it's full

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.960
of enthusiasm, feels
good, right?

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.200
John walks in and says, hey.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.110
I've got an idea.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:40.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.020
FREDDIE RAVEL: In of its own, it
sounds pretty cool, right?

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.970
If you put Jane and John
together and they try to work

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.990
it out, this is what
it sounds like.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:26:01.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.050
FREDDIE RAVEL: Happens all
the time on planet Earth.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.900
What is the fundamental
problem here?

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.320
Well, first of all, neither of
them are really listening to

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.480
one another.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.940
Number two, they're not
acknowledging each other.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.660
Because they're in two
completely different keys.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.150
You put people together.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.500
They think they've got
the right ideas.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.270
But their keys are different.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.400
What has to happen?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.840
What is the solution?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.320
Harmony.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.470
Because the definition of
harmony in Tune Up is

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.320
collaboration with purpose.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.250
Simply by acknowledging each
other, John comes to the

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.510
conclusion that he's only
a half-step off.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.300
And instead of--

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.685
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:46.110
FREDDIE RAVEL: --he just needs
to step down a half step,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.750
readjust his listening.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:48.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.680
FREDDIE RAVEL: And all of a
sudden, we put John and Jane

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.740
together, we get--

00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:12.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.320
FREDDIE RAVEL: There we go.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.240
So there you have it.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.300
John and Jane collaborating
with purpose.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.640
And this is how we
get from harmony.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.730
Again, the structure of music
is the structure of success.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.160
We arrive at our third
foundation, rhythm.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.515
You can snap along.

00:27:35.515 --> 00:27:36.420
Oh yeah.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.250
Rhythm, the beat, the timing,
the tempo, rhythm.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.090
Now we're all going to stop on
beat four, because music that

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.720
has melody and harmony without
rhythm is left with no

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.660
direction whatsoever.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.120
So we're stopping on four.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.098
A one, two, a one two,
three, four.

00:27:57.098 --> 00:27:58.348
Space.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:08.580
Without rhythm, melody and
harmony drift off into space.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.810
And as we talk about space, I
need to share a quick story

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.370
with you about NASA.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.330
About four years ago, I spoke
at the Goddard Space Flight

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.180
Center where they launched
the Hubble telescope

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.690
in Greenbelt, Maryland.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.280
Now this place has the highest
concentration of

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.500
PhD's in the room.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.840
This is a very melody-heavy
crowd.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.260
And you have the inventors, the
people that put together

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.260
the Hubble or the Curiosity or
the next missions that are in

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.580
front of us.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.540
Well these very same
people have harmony

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.157
that supports them.

00:28:43.157 --> 00:28:46.670
You have logistics and human
resources that are providing a

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.400
harmony to those
melody people.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.010
But the third people that walk
in are the project managers.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.595
The project managers walk in and
say look, I'm really glad

00:28:56.595 --> 00:28:58.410
that you inventors, you
melody people are

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.510
having a great time.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.270
I'm thrilled that you
harmony people are

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.890
supporting the melody.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:03.510
But you know what?

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.160
If this isn't on my desk by 10
o'clock on Tuesday, that

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.050
proposal that I sent to you,
we're going to pull the

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.980
funding on the entire program.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.930
Now the drummer has shown up.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.050
Rhythm is in the room.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:25.900
Rhythm is the reality check
of where time shows up.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.230
And now we get to our third
foundation, rhythm.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.120
Rhythm paces action
across time.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.860
Rhythm paces action
across time.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.370
And time is money.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.720
And money is time.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.220
And time keeps ticking to
rhythm's bottom line.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.770
And one of the biggest robbers
of time is email.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.660
We know email's an
incredible tool.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.430
We all use it.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.640
There's about 300 billion emails
that are sent around

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.350
the world every 24-hours.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.440
It comes out to about 2.8
million emails per second that

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.060
are sent around the world.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.600
What if I told you that the
company that makes the chips

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.640
that most of us have in our
digital devices has a policy

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.750
where they ask--

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.950
and highly advise--

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:18.650
their employees to take email
out of their week, 20% of

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.180
their work week?

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.620
Anybody know who
the company is?

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.220
Let me give you little
musical clue.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.500
The musical clue is this--

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.770
FREDDIE RAVEL: Yeah, Intel.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.210
Intel has a no email
on Fridays rule.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:41.350
because they realize that one
day out of the week, it's

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:45.570
imperative that they
have interface,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:46.890
that there is no email.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.700
That there's actually
a conversation.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.460
And they found out that that
actually increases their

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.000
productivity by having
this policy.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.560
People actually interface
with each other.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.870
I might add that Deloitte
&amp; Touche also has

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.840
followed this policy.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.000
And many other companies are
jumping on, on the bandwagon.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.510
And it's all about rhythm
and keeping

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.490
time at its most efficient.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:12.420
The great Duke Ellington had a
piece of music that was all

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.750
about rhythm.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.350
He wrote a melody that
goes like this.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:22.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.910
All right?

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.335
He also write a harmony
that goes like this.

00:31:25.335 --> 00:31:32.675
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:33.640
FREDDIE RAVEL: All right.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.670
So if I got my melody over here,
and I got my harmony

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.130
over here, we get

00:31:39.130 --> 00:32:00.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.020
FREDDIE RAVEL: What's
wrong, everybody?

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.890
No rhythm.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.770
No rhythm whatsoever.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.000
In fact, Duke Ellington gave
this song a title about the

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.090
consequences of what happens
when melody and harmony run

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.090
awry and there's no rhythm.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.090
Can anyone tell me the name
of this song, anybody?

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.955
Go ahead, say it.

00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:22.735
AUDIENCE: "It Don't Mean a Thing
(If It Ain't Got That

00:32:22.735 --> 00:32:23.630
Swing)."

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.280
FREDDIE RAVEL: "It Don't Mean a
Thing (If it Ain't Got that

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.230
Swing)." Thank you.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.570
It don't mean a thing if
we're not listening.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.405
You can have empowered
individuals, leaders, who sing

00:32:32.405 --> 00:32:33.840
a great melody.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.960
You could have a fantastic
team supporting them.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.260
But until they become in sync
with the game plan of time

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.630
management and their rhythm is
paced across time, it don't

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.280
mean a thing.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.570
But when they come together and
march to the beat of the

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.580
same drummer, you get--

00:32:47.580 --> 00:33:11.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.180
FREDDIE RAVEL: Don't mean a
thing, if it ain't go that

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:20.690
swing, do wop, do wop, do wop,
as Duke Ellington would say.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.580
The structure of music is the
structure of success.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.650
You can look at it from so many
different angles, but

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.650
it's always there.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.760
We discussed the power
of listening.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.290
Then we went to the
power of melody.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.500
Then we went to the power of
collaboration with purpose, of

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.830
harmony, and discussed
the management

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.720
of time over rhythm.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.480
This seems simple on
many levels, right?

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.580
But like everything in
life, there is a

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.630
villain that shows up.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.290
It's called you know,
dissonance.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.390
It's that moment where
I've got an idea.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.350
And she's got an idea.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.550
And then someone else
has an idea.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:07.903
No one returns the call and no
one's responding to this one.

00:34:07.903 --> 00:34:09.795
And they're about to
nix this idea.

00:34:09.795 --> 00:34:10.741
And I'm really not sure.

00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:11.564
And I'm kind of overwhelmed.

00:34:11.564 --> 00:34:12.475
And why is this spam
happening.

00:34:12.475 --> 00:34:15.046
And why did the system
go down.

00:34:15.046 --> 00:34:17.726
And why isn't this working,
people screaming at me.

00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:20.166
Dissonance!

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:25.130
A reality for every human
being on planet Earth.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.159
But music has a very powerful
way of dealing with

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.260
dissonance.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.710
Dissonance is actually conflict
and opportunity at

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.570
the same time.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:42.130
And if we manage it the right
way, dissonance makes music

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.290
going from the bland
to the grand.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.850
It takes something that's very
vanilla sounding and actually

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.120
makes it astounding.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.670
And this is what happens.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.949
Especially when we learn
to agree to disagree.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.500
This is one of the key things.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.650
And I want to share with you
a quick story about two

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.480
songwriters that you may be
familiar with, John Lennon and

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.330
Paul McCartney.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.480
And John Lennon and Paul
McCartney statistically, over

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.420
the years, rank as the most
successful songwriting team in

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.210
the history of music.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.280
Their music has been around
for 50 years now,

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.630
and it still is vital.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.460
And one thing that made that
particular group exceptionally

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.760
dynamic is that they
agreed to disagree.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.670
Paul McCartney wrote the
optimistic, sunny side of many

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.690
of the Beatles songs.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.300
Whereas John Lennon would
write the more dark,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.250
melancholy perspective
on the music.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.630
So if we take a song, for
example, like "We Can Work It

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.960
Out," by the Beatles, right,
by John Lennon and Paul

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.560
McCartney, Paul comes in with
this very optimistic idea.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:36:02.070
[SINGING]

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.900
Full of optimism.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.390
We can work it out.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.600
I mean the sun shining
when he sings this.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.440
In the same song--

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.070
in the very same piece of
music-- and very few pieces of

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.940
music ever do this--

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.990
John Lennon comes in, not in a
major chord, he comes in on a

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.970
minor chord.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.250
Not in the same rhythm
that Paul just said--

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.690
in a completely different
rhythm and a completely

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.450
different message.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.795
He says [SINGING].

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.300
Completely different.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.830
The Beatles understood this.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.660
And this is why their music is
timeless in so many ways.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.960
It continues to live on because
they understood how to

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.780
agree to disagree.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.155
Conflict resolution
at its best.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.040
So my friends here at Google,
I got to tell you, we don't

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.240
just carry music in an iPod.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.340
We carry music in our hearts.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.060
Food, water, shelter, music.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.390
Music is a core survival tool.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.960
The six-year-old kid in Rio de
Janeiro who picks up a gas can

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.450
and a stick and starts drumming
on that to relieve

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.800
the pangs of hunger he feels
in this stomach.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.800
The college student who enrolls
in an after-school

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.630
music program and because of
that has a shot of increasing

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:36.200
her test scores by a national
average of 20% because she

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.380
studies music.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.990
Or a Congresswoman by the name
of Gabby Giffords who

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.540
attributes her amazing
miraculous recovery from a

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:53.765
gunshot to the head to
the power of music.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.430
We are dealing with the rocket
fuel for humanity.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.270
This is what music truly is.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.130
And we have landed on the fourth
foundation of music,

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.030
which is called the score.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.610
Melody--

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.360
to help us express leadership.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.110
Harmony to express collaboration
and teamwork.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.210
Rhythm to pace us across time.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.710
And the score where we achieve
our dreams of success.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.740
The structure of music is the
structure of success.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.440
And I want to thank my
friends at Google.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.730
I want to thank the wonderful
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.770
I want to thank Justin Oliver
and the wonderful Rachel Amara

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.100
for inviting me to be
here with you today.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.860
It has been my pleasure
to speak with you.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.890
And I want to end now with
something on the global level.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.270
All right?

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.720
This is global.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.380
And I thought we would mash up
a little bit of Mozart with

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.802
some mojitos.

00:38:51.802 --> 00:38:53.810
That OK with you?

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.190
All right.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.030
Next time I come up to Google,
we'll make sure that we are

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:00.610
serving mojitos as we're doing
this, but here it is.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.360
And a little help from
Wolfgang Amadeus.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.836
Here we go.

00:39:05.836 --> 00:42:51.670
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:52.740
FREDDIE RAVEL: Thank
you very much.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.600
RACHEL AMARA: Thanks
everybody.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.970
And we have a few moments for
question and answering.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.110
So does anyone have
any questions?

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:04.320
AUDIENCE: So you talked a lot
about what many people call

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.370
European music or the
music that came

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.390
out of European music.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.050
Now there is a very different
kind of music that you see

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:17.840
mostly in Asia and there
are different kinds.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.550
Chinese music is very different
from European music.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.140
Japanese music is
very different.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.670
And so are the business
practices.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:33.300
So are the ways people work
with their managers, how

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.360
people are treated
in their work.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.560
And even though it's very
different from what you're

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.240
describing--

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.650
for example, Japan is very
successful in what it achieves

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.410
in its companies.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.685
Can you somehow comment
on that?

00:43:48.685 --> 00:43:49.500
FREDDIE RAVEL: Absolutely.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.830
Sure, thank you.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:55.720
So one thing we need to say
about the power of melody as

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.570
you do it in Japan--

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.970
and I've had the privilege of
playing in Japan about 15

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.550
different times and spending
a lot of time there.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.860
I've noticed in that particular
culture, you have

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.500
your lead instruments, right?

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.410
You have either the voice
or the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.630
or the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.160
of the koto-- various
instruments

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.560
that take the lead.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.440
And what we're doing is we're
taking the lead instruments of

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.020
any culture, whether it's
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.250
in Australia or it's
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.760
of Japan or the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.820
of Japan.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.740
And we're simply saying that
these lead instruments that

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:33.270
lead and spotlight in the music
can be looked at in much

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.390
the same way as leadership
is looked.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.820
When you look at a bandleader
who spotlights those

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.150
instruments, they are leading
their organization.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.670
So we're using the metaphor,
if you will,

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.830
of music as a parallel.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.780
Indeed, in Japan you might
see like the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.510
system, right?

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.210
Where people work on a
more like harmony.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:00.280
Collaboration is very big in
Japanese culture, for example.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.230
You might see an even greater
level of that.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.730
There's a more uniformity
in that culture.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:10.220
Whereas you might see a brasher
more outrageous

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.430
leadership style in places
in the West,

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.140
in America for example.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.380
So they exist.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.680
But these are some of the
different ways that we can

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.860
look at them and parallel
them to music.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.250
Any other questions?

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.320
RACHEL AMARA: I have a
question I'll ask.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.250
FREDDIE RAVEL: Sure.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.700
RACHEL AMARA: So
that was great.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.090
Thank you, Freddie.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.640
And I'm wondering how a company
like Google can take

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.790
this info and have this apply
to what we do here.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.900
So knowing all of us are on
different teams, we do

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.250
different things.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:41.790
What can we take back to help
share the message and what

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.490
we've learned from this today?

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:45.090
FREDDIE RAVEL: Thank you.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.860
Thank you, Rachel.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.030
There are four particular points
that I've been driving

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:52.110
home through the talk.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.800
The structure of music is the
structure of success.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.820
And that melody is
a lead idea.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.570
And harmony is a collaborative
idea.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.980
And rhythm is an idea
about time.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.800
And the score is the holistic
sum of that,

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.150
the sum of that total.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:11.620
Sometimes when you can look
at something as complex as

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.220
teamwork or as complex as human
interfaces, right, and

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:20.080
drill it down to the way the
basic structure of music is,

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.060
it can be very beneficial.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.460
For example you're working with
a team person and they

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.440
really are in a different key.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.820
I mean they're in a completely
different key.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.890
And it really sounds like
that example I gave you.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.310
You may look at it and instead
of getting completely upset at

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.090
the dissonance that you're
having with that team member,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.250
you might step back and
say wait a second.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.400
That person's really coming
from almost a completely

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.790
different culture, a different
perspective.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.690
They are in a different key.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:53.540
So what can I do to
adapt to that key?

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.950
So this may be a message in this
context about adapting

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:01.140
and conforming, finding that
agree to disagree.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.710
Because the only way we grow,
the only way any company

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.760
becomes successful, is you've
got to have those rubs.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.550
You've got to have
those challenges.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.480
What makes our team better is
that if someone comes in with

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.750
an idea is foreign and we all
get around it and wrap

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.770
ourselves around it and
make our effort to

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.250
adjust to that key--

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.030
in the long run, that can be the
idea that explodes, that

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.850
is the next big idea.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.500
So this is the only way we get
to the next big idea is

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.270
through some dissonance.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.790
That's the message there.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:33.060
RACHEL AMARA: All right.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.670
Well thank you, Freddie.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.680
Thanks so much.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.310
FREDDIE RAVEL: You're
very welcome.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:35.840
Thank you.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:43.527
