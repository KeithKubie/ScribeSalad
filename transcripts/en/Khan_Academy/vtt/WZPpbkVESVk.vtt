00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.139
- [Voiceover] Let's say that Y is equal to

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.659
log base four of X squared plus X.

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:07.202
What is the derivative of Y

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:10.452
with respect to X going to be equal to?

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:13.222
Now you might recognize immediately that

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:14.793
this is a composite function.

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:17.509
We're taking the log
base four, not just of X,

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.387
but we're taking that
of another expression

00:00:19.387 --> 00:00:20.577
that involves X.

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:22.122
So we could say

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.683
we could say this thing in blue

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:25.955
that's U of X.

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:28.041
Let me do that in blue.

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.646
So this thing in blue

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:30.659
that is U of X.

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.058
U of X is equal to X squared

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:34.187
plus X.

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.751
And it's gonna be useful later on to know

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:37.265
what U prime of X is.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:38.377
So that's gonna be

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:39.809
I'm just gonna use the power rule here

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.001
so two X plus one

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.784
I brought that two out front

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:45.188
and decremented the exponent.

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:48.412
Derivative with respect to X of X is one.

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:49.985
And we can say the

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.688
log base four of this stuff

00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:55.299
well we could call that a function V.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:56.549
We can say V of

00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.177
well if we said V of X

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:01.427
this would be log base four

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:03.778
of X.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:06.028
And then we've shown in other videos

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:07.445
that V prime of X

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.882
is, we're gonna be very
similar that if this

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:13.188
was log base E, or natural log,

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:14.728
except we're going to scale it.

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:15.894
So it's going to be

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:17.467
one over

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.384
one over log base four.

00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:23.395
Sorry, one over

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.166
the natural log.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.622
The natural log of four

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.455
times X.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.100
If this was V of X, if V of X was just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.501
natural log of X, our
derivative would be one over X.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.192
But since it's log base four

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:37.778
and this comes straight
out of the change of base

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:39.028
formulas that you might have seen.

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.026
And we have a video where we show this.

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:42.757
But we just scale it in the denominator

00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:43.979
with this natural log of four.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.695
You think of scaling the whole expression

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:48.179
by one over the natural log of four.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.160
But we can now use this
information because Y

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.077
this Y can be viewed as

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:55.141
V of

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:57.673
V of.

00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:00.575
Remember, V is the log
base four of something.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.215
But it's not V of X.

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:03.749
We don't have just an X here.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.757
We have the whole expression

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:07.371
that defines U of X.

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.891
We have U of X right there.

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:11.840
And let me draw a little line here

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.377
so that we don't get
those two sides confused.

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:17.036
And so we know from the chain rule

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.781
the derivative Y with respect to X.

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:21.901
This is going to be

00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:23.736
this is going to be the derivative of V

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:25.910
with respect to U.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.454
Or we could call that V prime.

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:29.954
V prime of U of X.

00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:32.912
V prime of U of X.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.981
Let me do the U of X in blue.

00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:38.398
V prime of U of X

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.613
times U prime of X.

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:45.318
Well, what is V prime of U of X?

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:46.900
We know what V prime of X is.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.680
If we want to know what V prime of U of X

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.427
we would just replace wherever we see an X

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:51.715
with a U of X.

00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:54.315
So, this is going to be equal to

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:56.662
V prime of U X, U of X.

00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:58.463
And you just do is you take the derivative

00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.391
of the green function with
respect to the blue function.

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.741
So it's going to be one over

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:05.509
the natural log of four.

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.015
The natural log of four.

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:09.291
Times, instead of putting an X there

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:11.757
it would be times U of X.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:12.840
Times U of X.

00:03:14.397 --> 00:03:16.320
And of course, that whole thing

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.903
times U prime of X.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.208
And so, and I'm doing
more steps just hopefully

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:23.943
so it's clearer what I'm doing here.

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:25.528
So this is one over

00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:27.998
the natural log of four.

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:30.248
U of X is X squared plus X.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.612
So

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.029
X squared plus X.

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:36.079
And then we're gonna multiply that

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.246
times U prime of X.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:39.385
So times two X plus one.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.162
And so we can just rewrite this as

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:42.745
two X plus one over

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:46.129
over

00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:49.017
over

00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:50.745
the natural log of four.

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:52.863
The natural log of four

00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:54.780
times X squared plus X.

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:56.867
Times X squared

00:03:58.962 --> 00:03:59.795
plus X.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:00.867
And we're done, and we could distribute

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:02.143
this natural log of four

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:03.650
if we found that interesting.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.010
But, we have just found
the derivative of Y

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.593
with respect to X.
