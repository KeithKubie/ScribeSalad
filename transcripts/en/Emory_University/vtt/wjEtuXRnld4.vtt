00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.680
PROLOGO - We have three doctors visiting us today from Muhimbili Hospital in Tanzania

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.680
as part of a program called Road to IR.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.360
NARRATOR - The United States and developed nations use interventional radiology (or IR) routinely.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.320
Developing countries, however, like Tanzania, have lagged in incorporating

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.500
this cutting-edge life-saving technology into their healthcare systems.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.760
But Emory doctors like David Prologo are now working with Yale University's

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.600
Tanzania Interventional Radiology Initiative to get physicians in East Africa up to speed.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.920
RUKUNDO - There is no single, trained IR (interventional radiologist) practicing in Tanzania.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.160
So this is how big the need is.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.860
PROLOGO - So they are the first three doctors on the ground in Tanzania

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.980
performing minimally invasive interventional radiology procedures and they now are going to form

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.080
an education program to teach the next generation. So this is a birth of a subspecialty in East Africa

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.420
that we take for granted here in the United States.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.280
NARRATOR - IR is a minimally invasive imaging procedure that allows doctors to diagnose disease

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.520
or apply targeted therapy using a
real-time x-ray to enhance precision.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
The Tanzanian doctors tell us the technique will be a game-changer in their country,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
like it was for the patient who would
have died without the intervention today.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.880
AWADH - He's back to work, he's doing well, he has no complaints at all, so that was like amazing.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.920
MBUGUJE - We are aiming to do complicated procedures by 2021.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.100
NARRATOR - In addition to oversight from seasoned interventional radiologists,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.160
the project will also require funding to help build the infrastructure.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.480
PROLOGO - We don't need financial support to send us over there. We've already got the talent, insight and intelligence in place there.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.820
We need financial support to buy equipment

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.660
and build a self-sustaining machine over
there. Because if they can teach the next generation,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.080
and we have the equipment there to perform the procedures, then it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.120
will run on its own, and so many patients
in need of care will be helped.
