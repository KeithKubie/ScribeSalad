00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
 Yes, this is very beautiful. 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.040
 We talked about it in an earlier video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.149
 pandigital numbers. And a pandigital number 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.080
 a number that used all digits, from one 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.300
 to nine. And we had ... [Brady]: And zero? 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.309
 [James]: Zero was not always used, I think sometimes 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.880
 excluded zero and sometimes used zero 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.100
 and you get different numbers with 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 different properties and we had 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.620
 enjoyment of pandigital numbers 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.100
 It was fun 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.720
 [Brady]: Yes, it's there. People can click on it. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 [James]: There? 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400
 [Brady]: Er ... Yes! About there. Right. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.860
 [James]: Now I want to show you a pandigital formula 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.320
 So that is a formula that uses all numbers, 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.809
 1 to 9. And it is actually very beautiful 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 Let me write down the formula. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.730
 (1 + 9 to power, I will use -4 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.399
 up to 6 times 7, all in between 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.170
 brackets, and then I raise that to a power 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 and that is 3 to the power 2 to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510
 the power 85. So this is the formula, 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 Let's check if it's a pandigital formula 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.539
 let's see if all the numbers are there 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.590
 We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 - 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.140
 Yes. I have used all numbers from 1 to 9. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 But what's so special about that formula? 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.540
 He is very nice. 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:28.619
 This formula is equivalent to 2.718281828 ... 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.460
 ... 459 ... 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 This formula is actually ... e. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.630
 It's about e. How about then? 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.220
 How good is he? 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 This is correct to 18 trillion trillion 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 numbers, decimals. [Brady]: NO! Go away! 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 [James]: Yes, I know, it's great. This beautiful one 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.220
 small formula is incredibly precise for e 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.920
 [Brady]: How is that possible? 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.940
 [James]: It's beautiful! I'll tell you how that is possible. 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.840
 This formula is not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.070
 very old. He was discovered in 2004 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.649
 by someone named Richard Sabey, and he 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.989
 did something very clever about this one 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.200
 formula because the definition of e, 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 It is the limit for n going to infinity of 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.280
 (1 + 1 / n) to the power n. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.319
 Now he did something smart. He found one 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.629
 number that I call capital letter N. 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.249
 And that's a big number. Actually 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.240
 this thing we have here. 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.510
 This power. So he had a 3 to power 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
 2 to power 85 and he did something smart. 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 I'm gonna juggle a little with this 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.629
 and I hope you understand 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.580
 how powers work, because I use 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.160
 certain characteristics of how powers work, and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.750
 this is what i am going to do. I'm going 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.660
 take one of these 85 and me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.790
 use that to squeeze the 3. So it 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.690
 now becomes 9 to power 2 to power 84 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.630
 and now I'm going to do something smart 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.780
 if you understand how powers work 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
 this is also 9. I am going to do that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.959
 2 there double, that becomes a 4. And 84 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.019
 is cut in half, and thus becomes 42. These are all 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.989
 properties of powers, and I go 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.269
 split the 42. This becomes 9 to power 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.100
 4 to power 6 times 7, because that is 42. 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.290
 If I put a minus sign there, it becomes 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.190
 the 1 divided by N. So, what he has now is 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.130
 a formula of this form: (1 + 1 / N) 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.109
 to the power N - but this N is huge. 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.260
 This is a huge number, it's so big 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.049
 that it is an incredibly exact 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.459
 approach provides for e. Not infinite, it doesn't work 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.350
 to infinity and is exactly e. 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.989
 It's big enough for something 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.130
 that is correct up to 18 trillion 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.560
 trillion digits. There was a challenge - it was 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.000
 a kind of challenge on it 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.099
 internet - as a challenge he thought: 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.480
 I'm going to think about this. For the same 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.099
 He actually came up with competition 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.980
 a number of formulas, and he went by 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.709
 the classical mathematical constants, so he 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.320
 did e, and e is the best, and I love e so much. 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 But he also did pi and others. 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.430
 I'll show you that for Pi - I don't find it 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 so beautiful, i don't like it very much, it is 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.790
 handsome that he 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.590
 it has done with a pandigital formula, but 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.420
 I'll show you why he's not so good. 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.060
 So he has a formula for pi, and that is 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.490
 approximately equal to - 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.910
 and this is him - it is 2 to the power 5 to the power, 4 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:53.360
 -, 6 min, and by the way here, we have, 3 to the power 9 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.780
 divided by 7. And then we take that whole 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.340
 and raise it to power 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.580
 , 8, to power, 1 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.260
 [Brady]: Yes, there are many commas. 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.020
 [James]: Many commas. And instead of saying 0.6 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.080
 and 0.1 he uses a comma. He plays 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.640
 maybe false, I don't know, by none 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.770
 use zeros, I am not so satisfied with it. 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.160
 This is exact for pi to ten decimal places. 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.500
 It is much less impressive, 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.660
 so you have a pandigital formula for that 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.020
 pi, for 10 decimal places, with a bit of cheating, 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.720
 I don't know, it depends how you 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.500
 think about it - commas use something instead of zero 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.960
 I don't like that formula very much. 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.510
 [James from "Pandigital Numbers"]: And that's a number that 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.210
 can also be divided by 10, and that too 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.130
 is unique, so that would be unique 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.680
 pandigital number with zero.
