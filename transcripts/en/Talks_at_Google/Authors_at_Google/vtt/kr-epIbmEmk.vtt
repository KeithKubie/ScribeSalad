ROB LEWORTHY: Hello,
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.248
I'm Rob Leworthy.

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:06.360
And I'm very pleased to welcome
today, Zach Weinersmith, who

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.610
is the creator of "Saturday
Morning Breakfast Cereal."

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.810
Give me a cheer if we know
"Saturday Morning Breakfast

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.090
Cereal."

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.874
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:11.373
Good.

00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:13.012
Oh, thank God for that.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:13.970
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Phew.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.200
ROB LEWORTHY:
Author, entrepreneur,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.894
internet celebrity--

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:16.149
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yes.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.232
ROB LEWORTHY: we're going
with that-- and producer

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.200
of BAHFest!, which is
over for this weekend,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.317
and we will talk
about in a little bit.

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:24.150
So first of all, Zach,
thanks for coming in.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.440
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.065
ROB LEWORTHY: Perhaps
you could tell us

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.034
about what you think "Saturday
Morning Breakfast Cereal" is

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:29.950
and how it came about.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.616
Because I've wrote
down here, it started

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:32.840
in the heady days of 2002.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.110
ZACH WEINERSMITH: 2002.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.318
ROB LEWORTHY: It's a long
time ago in internet years.

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:36.349
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.890
It's a comic.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.404
It's the fourth-best
comic strip.

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:41.820
ROB LEWORTHY: As
voted for by who?

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.430
ZACH WEINERSMITH: In my head.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.305
ROB LEWORTHY: Oh, OK.

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:43.860
Right.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.700
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.490
Yeah, it's, like, "XKCD,"
"The Oatmeal," "Penny Arcade,"

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.210
and then me.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.610
ROB LEWORTHY: And then you.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.568
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:51.675
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:53.800
ZACH WEINERSMITH: It's
about science and philosophy

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.032
and economics and everything.

00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:56.740
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.320
And how did it morph
over the years?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.835
Because you have a
literature background.

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:01.960
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yes, yes.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.400
ROB LEWORTHY: And then you went
back to uni to study physics?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.540
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.730
ROB LEWORTHY: I was taking
this from Wikipedia.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.550
So I need to double
check those facts.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.510
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.970
You can use me as a citation.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.595
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah,
I will, a citation.

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:12.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.480
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah, that's
all accurate information

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.290
from Wikipedia.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.998
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:18.760
So what took you back
to study physics later?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.130
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I was
working in Hollywood,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430
in the film business,
for the studio that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890
released "Sharknado," actually.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.598
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:26.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.920
ZACH WEINERSMITH: It was 10
years before "Sharknado."

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.210
ROB LEWORTHY: Lot of facts then.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.450
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.325
That can go on Wikipedia too.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.700
Yeah, I was just
working in film.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.460
And it was awful and terrible
because everyone in Hollywood

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.260
should die.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.218
ROB LEWORTHY: OK, yeah.

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:40.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.150
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Most
if them, not all of them.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.660
And I hated it.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.715
And I wanted to get out.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:52.090
So I get to where my comics
were doing well enough that I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.490
could quit my job.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.000
And I did.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.333
And then I found it was really
difficult to write ideas.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.260
Because I was kind of happy.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.440
You know?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.460
You know, I was like,
23 and had savings.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.150
It was weird.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.376
This is a short version of it.

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:09.000
But I decided to go
back to university,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.879
just to get some
stress into my life.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.670
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.380
That's good.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.705
Nothing like deadline to really
make the creative juices flow.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:15.130
ZACH WEINERSMITH: It's true.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.780
It's true.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.488
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.660
And you do, SMBC,
has one comic a day,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.462
which I think I
didn't realize that.

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:22.990
That's incredibly high turnover.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.940
How do you find the
time or the Ideas?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.490
Why set yourself the one-a-day
target, perhaps, rather than

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.369
three a week, say?

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:30.910
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I originally did it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.300
because that's what they used to
do in the old comics business,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.883
was one a day.

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:36.250
So I was just emulating.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.620
But strategically, I
just try to read a lot.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.215
You know?

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:44.515
And if you read old books,
you can steal all you want.

00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.390
Because they're dead.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.130
But no, I do try to read three
or four or five books a week,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.969
and hard stuff.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.010
ROB LEWORTHY: So you come
up with all your ideas.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.870
And then I guess
the deadline forces

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.620
you to put something
out there every day,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.732
rather than overthink it.

00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:02.190
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.690
ROB LEWORTHY: And
I think sometimes,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.880
without those deadlines,
you know, that suffers,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.630
and the deadlines slip.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.750
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.580
ROB LEWORTHY: And so when you
put all those ideas up on SMBC,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.800
do you track what works,
what doesn't work?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.201
Do you tweak the future
comics based on likes?

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:20.325
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Actually,
my wife is a scientist.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.210
And at some point,
when we have more time,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.190
we want to do this
thing where we

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.790
try to analyze, to
see if we can predict

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.060
which jokes are successful.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.710
Which is probably a bad idea.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.543
ROB LEWORTHY: If anyone
wants a 20% project.

00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:33.790
Then that's right here.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.290
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Because, actually,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.140
I did this experiment
on myself once.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.090
Because I thought I
could predict which jokes

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.923
would be successful.

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:43.270
Successful, meaning, retweets
or Facebook likes or something.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.700
Or Google+, I mean.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.170
ROB LEWORTHY: Sure, yeah.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.850
We all use that an awful lot.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.350
Absolutely.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.270
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I'm glad
this is being recorded.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.060
Yeah, so I kept a diary,
which I would do a comic.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.120
And then I would write
down whether I thought

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.330
it would be popular or not.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.470
Not whether it was good,
just whether I thought

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.520
it would be popular.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.350
And it turned out I had just
no predictive power at all.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.210
I thought I would at
least kind of know.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.019
Totally, I would say, this
won't do well, and it did fine.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.779
So I apparently have
no predictive ability

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.600
for my own work.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.450
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.760
Well, that's good.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.551
And I guess it keeps
it fresh and original.

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:23.120
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Right, yeah.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.550
I don't try to anticipate
what people want.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.550
Because apparently, I can't.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.760
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.700
That works.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.830
I think what I noticed on
your website was that you have

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.270
digital display advertising.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.170
You've got Patreon.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.250
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Mhm.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.260
ROB LEWORTHY: If you don't
know what Patreon is,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.320
well, you can explain that.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.980
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.750
ROB LEWORTHY: And you
have Kickstarter as well.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.291
And then you sell
books in bookshops.

00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:43.180
So I wondered of those
revenue streams, which works?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.000
Which doesn't?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.290
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Sure.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.706
ROB LEWORTHY: You were very
much experimenting with those,

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:47.950
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.450
My philosophy is it's good to
have a diverse set of revenue

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.949
streams.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.640
Because if one suddenly
dies on you, you'll be OK.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.290
So yeah, ad revenue is a
great source of revenue.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.280
Except that there is a tendency,
when you serve as many ads

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.360
as we do, for the bad
stuff to leak through.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.250
We've occasionally
had malware or you

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.750
know, buy-Russian-brides
stuff, which

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.715
we didn't feel too good about.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.215
Or, like, vote Donald Trump,
which we feel even worse about.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.890
But it's a consistent
source of revenue.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.486
But actually, the downside to
ads is they're highly seasonal.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.610
There's a lot of variation.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.390
So you can't predict your
revenue stream, which

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.640
is bad for running a business.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.700
Which, as Patreon, which
for those who don't know,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.450
is essentially like a
subscription service

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.240
where you agree to
pay x dollars, like,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.180
$1 a month to an artist, say.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.490
And in exchange, you
get some token thing.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.680
Like, in my case, you
get to see a comic early.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.010
Or you get to see my
reading list or something,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.084
little stuff.

00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:45.500
But it means a lot
to the company.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.400
Because a consistent revenue
source means we can be sure

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.330
we can employ
somebody and not have

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.660
to worry about making
enough return on investment

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.664
immediately.

00:05:56.664 --> 00:05:58.580
ROB LEWORTHY: And I've
just turned my mic off.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.538
So if you can't hear me
at the back, then wave.

00:06:00.538 --> 00:06:03.715
So Kickstarter, as well,
you've had five or six projects

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:04.340
on Kickstarter.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.750
And how have you seen that
grow and morph over the years?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.160
And do you have the same people
coming back to you, and that?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.618
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, Kickstarter

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:13.420
has become a huge
part of book revenue.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.890
And it's almost like it's weird.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.224
Because we used to launch books.

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:20.473
And then we switched to
launching them on Kickstarter.

00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:22.390
And it almost increased
sales in the opening

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.440
month like an order of
magnitude, which is bizarre.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.770
Because it's the same product.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.919
So humans, I don't--

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.710
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.620
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.119
So I mean, it does
allow some stuff.

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:36.660
It's a nice piece
of software in that

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.750
we can promise to modify the
book a little bit for people.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.550
We can also service
people who want

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.720
to spend at different
levels more effectively.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.130
But that doesn't explain
the order of magnitude.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.250
There's some weird
Kickstarter magic juju.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.420
ROB LEWORTHY: Interesting.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.600
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I
don't know what it is.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.490
ROB LEWORTHY: OK,
and your latest one

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.560
is "Augie and the Green Knight".

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.270
I'm going to read it here,
"Augie and the Green Knight".

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.800
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I
have a new one out.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.720
ROB LEWORTHY: "Augie
and the Green Knight."

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.390
ZACH WEINERSMITH: We just
wrapped up a new one.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.950
That's a book called "Religion--
Ruining Everything Since 4004

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.300
BC."

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.008
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:03.189
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.480
ROB LEWORTHY: And so with
"Augie and the Green Knight,"

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.890
this is your first
children's book?

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.270
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yes.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.430
Yeah.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.210
ROB LEWORTHY: So
what was the spark

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.126
to writing a children's
book and stepping away

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:12.150
from adult comics?

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.483
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Well, I'd
wanted to do it for a while.

00:07:14.483 --> 00:07:18.370
We're also about to
have our first child.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.360
But part of it was I have
this really guilty pleasure

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.220
for old Victorian
adventure novels,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:29.269
like Henry Rider Haggard, and
Arthur Conan Doyle, and others.

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:30.560
But they're all really racist--

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.268
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.220
ZACH WEINERSMITH: --and
sexist, and everything.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.190
I was, like, can I give
these to my kid or something?

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.350
So I wanted to write a book
that had that tone to it,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.290
but was not racist.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.870
ROB LEWORTHY: And Augie
is a young girl who's

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.320
science loving, very nerdy.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.180
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.780
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah, this is
a gift for your daughter,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.281
I imagine.

00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.904
ZACH WEINERSMITH: In
a way, yeah, yeah.

00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:57.985
It's something like that.

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:59.880
Yeah.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.210
Has anyone read, there's
an old medieval romance

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.417
called going "Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight."

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.750
Maybe a few of you have read it.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.550
ROB LEWORTHY: A few nods.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.508
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:09.800
And Tolkien did a version of it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.940
But this book is about a little
girl, who you kind of get

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.630
an explanation for the weird
events in the actual story,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.777
via her exploits
manipulating things.

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:20.610
ROB LEWORTHY: Great.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.950
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.262
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:08:21.262 --> 00:08:22.020
And it was fun to write.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.490
And you got an
illustrator on board?

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.750
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.440
ROB LEWORTHY: So
that's the first time

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.180
you didn't illustrate
your own comics?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.721
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, it was great.

00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:28.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.670
Yeah, maybe some of
you know, there's

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.120
a great French
cartoonist named Boulet.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.010
And he agreed to do a series of
water colors as illustrations.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.470
So that was actually amazing.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.636
I didn't think we'd get him.

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:43.120
But he was excited to do it.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.159
ROB LEWORTHY: Oh,
it's a beautiful book.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.180
ZACH WEINERSMITH: It is.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.510
We cost ourselves
a lot of profit

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.800
making the book look nice.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.960
And this weekend,
you are over doing

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.040
BAHFest!, at Imperial College.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.020
Tell us about BAHFest!

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.680
How that's been running
the stage for a few years?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.055
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, BAHFest!,

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:03.120
it's the festival of
bad ad hoc hypotheses,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.190
which is as nerdy as it sounds.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.720
And the basic idea is we
started it at MIT in 2013.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.800
And it's, like,
the original show

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.730
was you come up with
the theory of evolution

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.840
that's clearly wrong.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.570
But you substantiate
it very well.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:26.549
So my keynote talk I gave the
first year was about how babies

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:27.590
evolved to be catapulted.

00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:31.920
And I have a lot of
good evidence, actually.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.586
And it explains why
babies are hairless.

00:09:33.586 --> 00:09:36.772
But adults aren't.

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:38.730
And, like, babies are
more, like, cartilage-y--

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.380
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah,
no it makes sense.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.180
ZACH WEINERSMITH: --so
they kind of bounce.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.971
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.690
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I even
talked to an aviation guy, who

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.880
had this theory that
babies have different load

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.599
balancing than adults do,
which keeps them stable.

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:52.390
ROB LEWORTHY: No, that
makes perfect sense.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.348
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:09:53.348 --> 00:09:56.090
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.344
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I have
other lines of argument.

00:09:59.344 --> 00:10:01.010
ROB LEWORTHY: I wish
your daughter well.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.052
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:03.426
She's past the
catapulting stage.

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:05.580
ROB LEWORTHY: OK, fine.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.380
ZACH WEINERSMITH: But yes,
we're doing an evolution show

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.792
at Imperial tonight.

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.230
It's too late to buy tickets.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.785
So I don't know why I'm
telling you about it.

00:10:13.785 --> 00:10:15.315
ROB LEWORTHY: But it's not
too late for tomorrow's show,

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:15.500
I believe.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.870
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yes.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.900
So we do another one.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.410
The theme is big science.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.320
Meaning, like, you
propose a mega project.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.500
So my example-- which I
haven't done this talk yet

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.430
is-- I call it the
relativistic refrigerator.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.610
And it takes food close
to the speed of light

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.730
so that it stays fresh.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.521
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.060
ZACH WEINERSMITH: And
I haven't actually

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.206
calculated what it would cost,
say, to get a pie, to see.

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:40.520
But I think it'd be worth it.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.771
And so you've done it a
couple of times in the States?

00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:44.728
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.840
We do a show in MIT, and
another in San Francisco,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.170
and another in Seattle.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.490
ROB LEWORTHY: Great.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:48.989
Very good.

00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:50.430
Well, I hope that goes well.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.730
We're going to open
the floor to questions.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.660
If you have a question, you
want to put your hand up?

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.370
One over There.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.711
AUDIENCE: A lot of the stuff I
find in your cartoons reminds

00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:06.835
me of the kind of thing
that Eliezer Yudkowsky used

00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:07.658
to write about.

00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:11.242
And I wondered if he or like
Scott Alexander, or anyone

00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:12.986
from that crowd that
was an influence?

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:14.527
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I don't know if I'd

00:11:14.527 --> 00:11:17.520
count him as an influence,
but I know Eliezer.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.137
He's crazy.

00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:18.637
I love him.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.590
I've read a lot of his stuff.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.930
And I stumbled upon his work.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.070
And then I really enjoyed it.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.534
But I only met him in the
last year or two, I guess.

00:11:29.534 --> 00:11:31.200
I don't think I'd
call him an influence.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.250
But he's been funny.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.540
Actually, the kid's
book, he was one

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.810
of the early reviews we got.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.686
He really liked it.

00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:38.311
Because it's kind of
in his wheelhouse.

00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.590
Because it's a little
girl who is super rational

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.080
about everything, kind of in
a fantasy world, telling it

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.770
it's wrong about everything.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.690
ROB LEWORTHY: Who are your
other influences, if any?

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.919
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Man.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.210
ROB LEWORTHY: Or who inspired
you to start doing comics

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.160
when you were young?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.370
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
There's a cartoonist

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.070
named Glen Baxter,
who's probably nobody

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.260
has-- I see one person nodding.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.220
Yeah, he's a surreal
single-panel cartoonist.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.200
And he was the main one.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.592
I don't really know.

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:11.800
I don't read a lot of comics.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.410
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.432
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I'm not into them.

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.140
ROB LEWORTHY: No?

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.110
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.530
ROB LEWORTHY: Were you
drawing from a very young age?

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.738
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:18.860
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.360
Very good.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.860
Question.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.870
Yeah?

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.370
AUDIENCE: One of
the things I really

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.750
love about SMBC is the range of
ethnicities and relationships

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.790
that have [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.991
I've wondered, do you have a
program that's a random number

00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:33.450
generator, telling you who you
should put in some situation

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.449
where it doesn't matter?

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:36.310
Or is it just wherever
the muse takes you,

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.394
or how does that work?

00:12:37.394 --> 00:12:39.310
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Every
engineer asks me that.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.393
Do I have a random number
generator for ethnicity?

00:12:43.427 --> 00:12:45.760
It's funny to me that that's
the obvious guess, I guess,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.330
that I programmed it.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
But no, I'm just at the
point of coloring it.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.250
I'm throwing in slight
variations from this.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.700
So I do have to
represent gingers,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.750
perhaps you've noticed.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.330
But no, I don't have a program.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.745
Yeah.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.680
ROB LEWORTHY: Just shout out.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.822
My favorite SMBC is
the one where you talk

00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:15.854
about having various lifetimes.

00:13:15.854 --> 00:13:18.707
But it takes nearly seven
years to master something.

00:13:18.707 --> 00:13:20.748
I'm wondering if you follow
that advice yourself?

00:13:20.748 --> 00:13:22.164
And if you do,
what are the things

00:13:22.164 --> 00:13:25.270
you feel you've mastered
or become great at?

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.771
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, I would like

00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:28.394
to be able to follow
up more, actually.

00:13:28.394 --> 00:13:30.040
I kind of stole
that idea, speaking

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.605
of stealing from the dead.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.500
[? Robert ?] Hamming,
the computer scientist,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.820
wrote a similar
thing, about how he

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.070
thought something
like an engineer

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.410
should switch field
every so often.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.500
Like, 7 or 10 years.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.791
I forget what he actually said.

00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:50.610
But I really like that
idea, a general principle

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.740
of changing what you do.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.250
As a pragmatic matter,
it's a little trickier.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.820
Because I can't
stop doing comics.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.611
Because I have a family
and they like food.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.240
But I do kind of
switch what I'm doing.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.417
Part of why I did a kids'
book was that motivation

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:08.500
to do something different.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.999
I'm working on a
different book now,

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.360
that I can't say
too much about yet.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.400
But actually, the
thing for me, now

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.440
that I'm trying to
switch into doing well,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.200
is writing prose books
instead of comic stuff.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.030
I'm still very much
interested in comics.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.230
And it's also my livelihood.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.330
But yeah, I'm trying
to get into that next.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.090
I also have a previous lifetime,
trying to get a physics degree.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.520
But I had to drop
out for comics.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.489
And I'd like to get back
to that at some point.

00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:36.030
But right now it's
a little too busy.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.200
ROB LEWORTHY: How many years of
your degree, the second degree,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.370
did you do?

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.556
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I did,
I think, four semesters.

00:14:40.556 --> 00:14:41.410
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.830
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, I got just

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.270
to where I was about to
get to the good stuff.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.140
And then I left.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.770
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.070
And would you ever go back
to Hollywood, and screenplay

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:50.570
writing?

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.350
Is that still Something Or do
you think books and that medium

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.780
is what inspires you now?

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.071
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I like books.

00:14:56.071 --> 00:15:00.380
I'm not opposed to the film
as a medium or anything.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.520
But the thing is, film is
extremely collaborative.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.680
You can't just, like, go off
by yourself and make a movie.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.475
And I am kind of an
anti-social jerk.

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:10.100
ROB LEWORTHY: A lone
wolf, if you will?

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.350
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.710
Yeah, that's what I meant.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.250
Yeah.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.456
Lone wolf.

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.673
Yeah, so I'm really more
into comics and book

00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:17.590
writing right now.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.380
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:19.917
Yes, sir?

00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:22.125
AUDIENCE: Do you tend to
plan your comics a long time

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:23.087
in advance?

00:15:23.087 --> 00:15:25.360
Or do you wake up in the
morning and get back to work?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.110
ROB LEWORTHY: How does
inspiration strike?

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.840
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yes, well, in theory,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.850
they are planned in advance.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.391
I think I'll have to draw one
the night I get home, actually.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.460
Yeah, it's got a little trickier
since we had a daughter for me

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.730
to get ahead on anything.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.180
But I do write every day.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.649
And I usually have a
backlog of a few drawn.

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:46.190
And I try to have
at least two weeks.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.020
But right now I'm
getting pretty down

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.540
to a minimum,
between these shows.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.770
And we did a bunch
of shows last winter.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.020
So it's gotten a little tough.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.770
But yeah.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.626
ROB LEWORTHY: What's
your favorite comic?

00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:59.000
I guess you get
asked that a bit?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.545
But is there one
that sticks as you

00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:01.742
being particularly proud of?

00:16:01.742 --> 00:16:02.950
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Oh man, no.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:03.600
I hate them all.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.308
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:05.014
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.769
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I'm trying to think.

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.935
I did one, all I do is a
single panel, where there's

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.143
a kid in the back of the car.

00:16:11.143 --> 00:16:15.364
And he says, mom,
dad I have ennui.

00:16:15.364 --> 00:16:17.340
So they have to pull
over so he can make peace

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.370
with the universe.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:18.810
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.434
ZACH WEINERSMITH: So
that's a good one.

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:21.580
I thought that was cute.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.056
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:25.496
ROB LEWORTHY: Yes?

00:16:29.598 --> 00:16:31.550
AUDIENCE: So I
started reading SMBC

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.382
since I was in high school.

00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:35.214
And a friend of
mine did as well.

00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:37.933
And about a year into
it, my friend said,

00:16:37.933 --> 00:16:40.266
Dude, do you know that if you
click the red button, what

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:40.861
will happen?

00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:41.361
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:43.240
And so what's the deal
with the red button?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.980
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
The red button?

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.052
Well, for those of
you who don't know,

00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:49.290
there's a little red button with
a bonus panel on each comic.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.080
So there used to be
these websites, back

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.740
in the early days of the
internet, where you could

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.750
vote for your favorite comic.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.250
And so I used it
as an inducement

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.640
to provide a bonus panel.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.230
And then those
websites went away.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.180
But people really
liked the bonus panel,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.230
so I kept doing it.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.419
And what's nice is
that people go through

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.460
and they read the comics.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.950
And then they discover
the bonus panel later.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.533
And then they have
to read them again.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.561
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.072
And that's good for ad revenue.

00:17:17.072 --> 00:17:18.405
ROB LEWORTHY: That's very smart.

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:19.282
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:19.282 --> 00:17:20.240
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.740
ROB LEWORTHY: Did anyone not
know about the red button here?

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:31.250
For the video, most of the
audience put their hands up.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.690
So any more questions?

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.438
Yeah.

00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:38.306
AUDIENCE: A lot of your
comics focus on couples,

00:17:38.306 --> 00:17:40.160
or people being
in relationships.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.338
How many, of a
percentage, do you

00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:45.182
think got inspired by
your own experiences?

00:17:45.182 --> 00:17:48.110
And what's your wife's
reaction to those comics

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.829
that you write
about relationships?

00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:52.120
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I would
say, almost none are actually

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.405
inspired by my real life.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.060
I hate to disappoint.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.132
But on the other hand, it would
be awful if that were true.

00:17:59.132 --> 00:18:00.340
What was the second question?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.104
AUDIENCE: What does your
wife think about those

00:18:02.104 --> 00:18:03.090
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Oh, man.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
What does she think?

00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:04.570
Um--

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.450
ROB LEWORTHY: Does she wish
she were in more, then?

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:06.920
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.003
ROB LEWORTHY: Does she go,
oh, this will be funny.

00:18:09.003 --> 00:18:10.440
You should put this in a comic.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.020
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Actually,
I've used her research twice.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.900
But no, not too much.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.810
She does read all
my comics before I

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.160
decide what I'm going to draw.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.650
But that's about it.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.670
Yeah, relatedly though,
one of the funny things

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.800
is you may have
noticed that I used

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.250
to do more comics where
the parents were borderline

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.230
abusive.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.570
And since we had a kid, she
doesn't find them as funny.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.800
I still do.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
But I think I'll probably
do fewer just because she's,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.680
like, this is awful.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.910
I can't read this.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.860
ROB LEWORTHY: Do you
ever feel, with SMBC,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.240
you've created a box which
you have to stay within?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.000
Or do you think you could push
it in one direction or another?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.875
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah,
I feel very fortunate

00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:52.110
both because it's the
internet age of comics

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.450
so I can change format,
which I obviously do a lot.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.510
But what's nice about
my format in particular,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.240
is it is completely open ended.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.750
So the only, I
suppose, restriction,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.750
is it has to be a comic.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.930
And I've even violated
that a few times.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.770
And so no, I do.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.520
I think if I had
kept, like, only doing

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.650
single-panel comics
or something,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.483
it would eventually
have gotten restrictive.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.800
But as it is now, it's not.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.510
ROB LEWORTHY: OK, very good.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.202
Yes?

00:19:15.202 --> 00:19:16.670
AUDIENCE: One of
the comic formats

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.380
that I really appreciated from
you is these ones where you had

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.080
these fantastical situations.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.605
And you iterate until
the level [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:24.605 --> 00:19:25.104
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:26.460
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.770
AUDIENCE: I'm sure you
know the ones I mean.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.359
Where do you get
your views for those?

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:33.900
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I actually have one

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.609
of those going up maybe Sunday.

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:37.150
I'm not sure.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.250
But I don't know, I
started doing them

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.470
just because they were fun.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.760
But I think I started
doing more since I

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.419
got into reading economics.

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:46.960
Because a lot of
economics literature

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.070
is about, like, if you
tweak one little thing,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.590
humans will just ruin it.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.270
You know?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.830
Call them perverse incentives.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.430
You create a bad structure and
then everything goes to hell.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.564
And so actually,
reading economics

00:20:00.564 --> 00:20:01.980
has been very good
for discovering

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.120
ways in which you can
accidentally ruin the world.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.905
So that's been a big
thing for me lately.

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.240
I think I've started
doing more since I

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.281
got into that literature.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.250
There's one back there.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.052
ROB LEWORTHY: Yes?

00:20:16.052 --> 00:20:19.060
AUDIENCE: Your work doesn't
seem to have any recurring

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.650
characters, or at least no
obvious recurring characters.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.740
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.323
AUDIENCE: Is that a
deliberate choice?

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:25.928
Have you ever been tempted
to introduce a character who

00:20:25.928 --> 00:20:27.580
will recur, over and over?

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.680
ROB LEWORTHY: So in
case anyone didn't hear,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.420
your work doesn't have
recurring characters in it.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.720
Is that something
you've chosen to do?

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.040
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I guess I
didn't think about it too much.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.604
Part of what's nice about it
is every day is different.

00:20:41.604 --> 00:20:43.770
I know with some people I
know, who do story comics,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.396
one of the downsides is you're
halfway through a story,

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:47.520
and you decide you hate it.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.340
And you're like, well, I've got
to do this for two more months.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.270
But I have occasionally
been tempted.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.300
And I don't have
recurring characters.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.490
But I have lots of
recurring themes and stuff.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.040
And in my head, it's
kind of the same people.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.800
But no, that's part
of why, though, I

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.070
got into writing a kid's book.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.486
Is it was a chance
to do something

00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:07.930
a little more Narrative
but I don't know, maybe

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.535
one of these days I'll do
a story on the com page.

00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:15.135
But I haven't had
the temptation yet.

00:21:15.135 --> 00:21:16.718
AUDIENCE: How do you
determine whether

00:21:16.718 --> 00:21:19.456
a particular comic
strip is actually not

00:21:19.456 --> 00:21:22.910
that complicated and easy to
understand for a lot of people?

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.120
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.510
ROB LEWORTHY: What's
the level of nerdiness,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.134
I suppose, that you
set in your comics?

00:21:27.134 --> 00:21:30.160
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, my rule of thumb

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.750
is only one Wikipedia
look up per comic.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.960
I don't know, I mean, I
used to worry about that.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.614
But everyone has access
to all the information

00:21:41.614 --> 00:21:42.280
in the universe.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.770
So I mean, you don't
want to overdo it.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.853
Because eventually, people
will just get confused.

00:21:45.853 --> 00:21:47.970
And there's some
stuff, like, I'd like

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.020
to do more literary references.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.876
But most people, I don't
think, would go there with me.

00:21:52.876 --> 00:21:54.750
Whereas the science
stuff is a little easier.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.000
Because it's more generalized.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.251
But if people don't know
a literary reference--

00:21:58.251 --> 00:21:59.750
I keep trying to
do Hemingway jokes.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.210
And no one appreciates them.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.537
It's really terrible.

00:22:03.537 --> 00:22:05.120
ROB LEWORTHY: With
that, do you think,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.471
I might say that with
Patreon, and people

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:10.970
paying you for the
comics regardless

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.260
of where you go,
could you push it

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.680
in a more literary direction,
for example, and have people

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.300
come with you on that?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.890
Or do you feel bound
by the science, nerdy?

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.390
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
No, it's not that.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.130
It's just, I mean, it's
still kind of the same game.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.320
Because you still have to have
your audience come with you.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.820
And also, Patreon is not
our main revenue source.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.384
You know?

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.800
I have a friend
named Dave Kellet.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.175
He does a comic
called "Sheldon."

00:22:35.175 --> 00:22:37.240
And he does books
that are on themes.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.039
And he did a
literature-themed book.

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:41.080
And he was, like, I couldn't
sell the damn thing.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.530
But then he did a
book about pugs.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.500
And he said, it
sold like cocaine.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.500
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah, I
would buy that book, yeah.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:47.760
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.786
I think he's got
"Pugs 2" out now.

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.330
But literature is still
gathering dust in his closet.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.400
ROB LEWORTHY: OK, very good.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.285
Yes?

00:22:57.285 --> 00:22:59.764
AUDIENCE: In your
comics, you [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:59.764 --> 00:23:01.972
receive angry
emails when you say,

00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:04.100
[INAUDIBLE], or
things like that.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.980
But first, why don't
you reply to them?

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.920
I sent something.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.753
I never got a reply.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:08.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.604
So how many do you
receive out of outrage?

00:23:11.604 --> 00:23:13.020
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
I actually don't

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.430
get that many angry emails.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.390
It kind of sucks.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.642
I've gotten little stuff.

00:23:18.642 --> 00:23:20.850
I've got a guy who said, he
wanted to break my hands.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.433
That was cool.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.810
But no, I don't get too many.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.400
I get, maybe, once a month I
get someone who is a little bit.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.150
I think it helps to
have a nerdy audience.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:37.600
Because I get more, like,
you-were-wrong stuff than

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.370
you're-a-bastard stuff.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.380
Yeah, I think it was one of
the first times I went to MIT.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.229
And I had six
freshmen around me,

00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:46.270
telling me I didn't
understand quantum mechanics.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:51.380
I don't know what I had done,
but I guess I was wrong.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.607
But not too much hate mail.

00:23:52.607 --> 00:23:53.940
Yeah, I kind of wish I got more.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.273
It feels really good now and
then, to be mad at somebody

00:23:56.273 --> 00:23:57.160
for being wrong.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.650
ROB LEWORTHY: Do you think
if you did more religion,

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.691
you'd get more hate mail?

00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:00.660
Is that the stuff?

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.580
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I do
a pretty good amount.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.040
ROB LEWORTHY: Also, this
is going on YouTube.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.855
So if you want comments,
we can get you comments.

00:24:03.855 --> 00:24:04.960
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah,
I mean, I just released

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.490
a whole book of religion jokes.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.920
And I haven't gotten much.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.980
I did a rewritten Bible, the
whole thing, I rewrote it.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.830
It's better.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.630
ROB LEWORTHY: OK.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.582
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
It was too long.

00:24:16.582 --> 00:24:18.790
ROB LEWORTHY: Much like the
actual Bible is too long.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.456
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, yeah, mine is, I

00:24:20.456 --> 00:24:22.860
think, under 1,000 words.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.210
But no, I don't.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.370
I try.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.271
I feel like I'm very,
very hateful person.

00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:31.770
ROB LEWORTHY: Something to shoot
for in 2016, more trolling.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.260
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.022
That's true, yeah.

00:24:33.022 --> 00:24:34.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:37.130
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah?

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.046
AUDIENCE: It's sort of
a small thing, I guess.

00:24:39.046 --> 00:24:43.344
But how far ahead are
you in writing comics?

00:24:43.344 --> 00:24:45.510
Like, I can't imagine you're
like, going to go home,

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.218
tonight, as you said,
and write tomorrow?

00:24:47.218 --> 00:24:49.620
ZACH WEINERSMITH: No,
but I'm pretty close.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.590
I think I have two scripts
for when I get home.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.780
But yeah, I do try
to be more ahead.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.090
But the problem
becomes on a given day,

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.595
you want to select
your best script.

00:24:59.595 --> 00:25:01.970
So if you work ahead, you're
selecting from a smaller set

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:02.928
than if you had waited.

00:25:02.928 --> 00:25:06.410
So there's this
tension between waiting

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.010
until you've written more the
next day and not doing so.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.900
It's almost bad if you
work too much ahead.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.140
Because then you're,
like I said, picking

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.501
from a smaller set of options.

00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:16.750
ROB LEWORTHY: Do you start
with a kind of single joke,

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.833
or a pun or plan on words?

00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.544
Or kind of an idea that you
want to start writing about,

00:25:20.544 --> 00:25:21.960
in the way that
people like jokes,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.501
but just writing 100 ideas down
and one of them will be good?

00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:28.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so one, I do
keep a sort of sheet of ideas.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.330
These are just random thoughts.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.400
But I try to, every
day, write at least

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.930
three potential comics.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.560
And on a good day,
I try to write six.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.795
But I don't always have time.

00:25:41.795 --> 00:25:43.920
And at the end of the night,
I whittle it way down.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.790
I think.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.184
maybe one in six
gets selected, maybe.

00:25:47.184 --> 00:25:48.600
ROB LEWORTHY: And
if somebody here

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.704
wanted to start
writing web comics,

00:25:50.704 --> 00:25:52.870
the obvious advice is just
do it and getting online.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.250
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.900
ROB LEWORTHY: But beyond
that, any thoughts?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.060
Has it got more competitive
over the last few years?

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.160
ZACH WEINERSMITH: A
lot more competitive.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.580
Yeah.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.530
The level of talent
these days is much higher

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.840
than it was when I started.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.740
So there's this sort of
joke, when people ask what

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.910
to do when you get started.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.590
And the answer is you
should start in 1998,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.720
is what you should do.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.440
But yeah, in terms
of getting started,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.480
it's just, get started.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.990
With comics, it's
kind of difficult.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.526
Because it's a lot of work.

00:26:20.526 --> 00:26:22.150
You have to write
and you have to draw.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.810
And most people can't do
either, at least, at the outset.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.260
But the other thing is I've
noticed most people can do OK

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.510
for maybe six weeks.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.920
Because you're sort of
going through every joke

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.300
you've ever written, every
thought you ever had.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.674
And you're putting
it in a comic.

00:26:34.674 --> 00:26:36.480
And then it gets really hard.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.600
And then you have to figure
out what you're doing.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.040
I actually quit
a number of times

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.580
before I got to where I
was able to keep doing it.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.209
And it was kind of just
learning about how to use

00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:46.250
your brain well, I guess.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.580
For me, I do a lot of reading.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.956
Other people, I don't
know, travel a lot.

00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:51.330
You have to do
something, though.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.730
ROB LEWORTHY: And as we said,
those self-enforced deadlines

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.040
really--

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.870
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Makes a big difference.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.900
ROB LEWORTHY: --forces
you to make something.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.900
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.414
Well, especially because if
you cartoon for a living,

00:26:59.414 --> 00:27:00.580
you're completely freelance.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.739
So you could just
Facebook-- Google+ all day.

00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:03.530
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.238
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.410
Good.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.743
A couple more questions, if any?

00:27:07.743 --> 00:27:08.300
Yes?

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.098
I'll take this one
and then this one.

00:27:10.098 --> 00:27:12.920
AUDIENCE: Hey, so Matthew
Inman, of "The Oatmeal",

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.420
had a lot of trouble
with lawsuits

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.840
and people stealing his
work, and things like that.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.062
Is that something that
you've faced yourself?

00:27:20.062 --> 00:27:21.020
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.300
I mean, my stuff
gets stolen a lot.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.280
And it gets a 9GAG
watermark on it.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.370
And there's not much
I can do about it.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.447
We haven't really pushed it.

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:32.030
I mean, I'm sure I could send a
cease and desist or something.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.370
But the problem is,
it's all decentralized.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.162
So it's, like, I say
9GAG took my content.

00:27:36.162 --> 00:27:37.870
But actually, some
random internet person

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.560
took my content.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.174
And so there's kind
of nothing you can do.

00:27:41.174 --> 00:27:43.090
I wish they wouldn't
save them as JPGs though.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.798
That's the part that
really irritated me.

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:45.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.980
But no.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.660
And I actually think that
it's becoming less relevant.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.760
So as long as people know
where to find your stuff,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.570
I think you're fine.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.417
You know, the way people
consume content has changed.

00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:00.250
It used to be, like,
you'd go to my website.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.760
Now, you got to Reddit.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.300
And you go to social media.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.320
You go to aggregators.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.450
Most people don't go to
major websites as much.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.620
Really, I'm sure that's
how my habits have changed.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.720
It's mostly, like, Reddit.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.960
And I go to a few
sites in particular.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.704
So the point being,
the common wisdom

00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:16.870
used to be to get people
to go to your main website,

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.070
so you can do ad revenue
and sell the merchandise.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.007
And now, I think it's
becoming more, like,

00:28:21.007 --> 00:28:22.840
you need people to just
know that you exist.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.212
And then they'll say,
buy premium content

00:28:26.212 --> 00:28:28.420
or become Patreon subscribers,
or that sort of thing.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.890
So I worry less
because now I think,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.580
as long as when 9GAG steals
my content, somewhere on it,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.840
my URL is present.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.900
And I'm probably getting a
reasonably good deal out of it.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.630
Not that I'd encourage
people to re-post my content.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.880
ROB LEWORTHY: Do you
have a Facebook presence?

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.580
Because I'm aware with YouTube,
there's a problem with people

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.920
re-posting videos on and
Facebook from YouTube,

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.814
and not being--

00:28:47.814 --> 00:28:49.730
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah,
I've heard about that.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.380
Yeah, we do have
a Facebook page.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.990
And it's actually quite
good for business.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.610
And I'm sure my stuff gets
reposted all the time.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.881
But I started, I
resisted for a long time.

00:28:58.881 --> 00:29:00.380
But now I put the
URL at the bottom.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.067
For that reason, I
think that things

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:03.150
have just sort of changed.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.979
And you have to do it now.

00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:08.520
AUDIENCE: I was wondering about
how you produced your comics?

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.870
Do you start
sketching in pencil?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.320
Do you go digital?

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:10.945
What do you do?

00:29:10.945 --> 00:29:13.394
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I used
to do pencil and ink.

00:29:13.394 --> 00:29:14.310
And then I would scan.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.260
But I finally switched
to digital, in 2013.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.490
It's just, I think it saves at
least 50% time on the process.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.770
And I was actually getting
hand issues, hand cramps,

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.560
from having to hand
font everything twice.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.490
Because I had to pencil
it in and then ink it.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.724
So yeah, I switched to digital,
not without misgivings.

00:29:32.724 --> 00:29:34.890
Because there is something
nice about ink and paper.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.390
There's no latency with reality.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.472
You know?

00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:40.430
But I think pretty much
everyone's digital now.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.990
It's getting to the
point where paper

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.930
is kind of like a
charming way to do comics.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.050
It's, like, the
old-fashioned way.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.130
Yeah, oh, and I use
a Cintiq Tablet.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:55.125
And Manga Studio is
the software I use.

00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:58.880
AUDIENCE: How'd you
hear about SMBC.com?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.380
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
What are they now?

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.180
Like, Sheffield
Muscle-Building Company?

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.140
I don't know.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.890
SMBC.com, I think it's
just a squatter site.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.610
There is no real Sheffield
Muscle-Building company,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.050
or whatever it was.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.330
I looked into what it would cost
me to buy it, a few years ago.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.186
Because it's a
four-letter URL, which

00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:18.310
you can't get them anymore.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.370
And I think I felt
like an idiot because I

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.030
was like, I'm willing to
pay hundreds for this.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.140
And they were like, we will not
sell this for under $25,000.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.410
So I was like, there will
never be a time in my life

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.270
that I'm willing to pay
that much money for a URL.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.889
ROB LEWORTHY: Was it
available when you started?

00:30:35.889 --> 00:30:36.680
It might have been.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.977
I don't know.

00:30:37.977 --> 00:30:39.310
Well, no, it must have not been.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.060
Because I would have
tried to get it, I think.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.080
Yeah.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.622
AUDIENCE: You talked about your
modernization a little bit,

00:30:46.622 --> 00:30:48.540
you clearly have mixed
feelings about ads.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.492
Do you use Ad Blocker?

00:30:50.492 --> 00:30:52.356
And how do you respond
to people who do?

00:30:52.356 --> 00:30:54.970
ZACH WEINERSMITH: I
don't use Ad Blocker.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.330
But I don't have a problem
with people using it.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.860
It's a problem.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.820
It's not a problem unless
everybody starts using them.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.890
So it's OK if there are
some people using it.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.600
And I figure it depends
on people's behavior.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.420
Because an individual's
contribution to my revenue

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.720
via ads is almost nothing.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.220
Right?

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.120
It's, like, pennies.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.070
But you make your money
because so many people come.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.920
So what we try to do is say, if
you do use Ad Blocker, that's

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.880
totally fine.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.150
But we encourage you
to say, go to Patreon

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.736
or buy a thing or something.

00:31:34.736 --> 00:31:35.860
I was at a convention once.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.450
And a guy ran up to
me, gave me a $5 bill

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.480
and said, I use Ad
Blocker, and then left.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.152
And that was my ideal
reader experience.

00:31:45.152 --> 00:31:45.860
That was awesome.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.440
But no, again, my
usual view is it's

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.130
you can't change the
way consumers behave.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.170
At least, I can't.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.000
Maybe Google can.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.667
You can subtly manipulate
them or something.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.500
But I can't change the
way consumers behave.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.910
So I try to just find out
what they want and deliver it.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.520
But there's a
question right here.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.355
AUDIENCE: As a
kid, were you ever

00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:10.520
forced to write or draw
with your right hand?

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.395
ZACH WEINERSMITH: No.

00:32:11.395 --> 00:32:15.135
No, I discovered I'm--
it's called-- mixed handed.

00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:16.010
I'm not ambidextrous.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.801
I just use a random
hand for each activity.

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:19.430
I play ping pong
with my right hand.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.230
But I draw with my left.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.800
Yeah, I was never forced.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.670
That'd be awful.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.642
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah?

00:32:27.642 --> 00:32:29.475
AUDIENCE: Which Operating
System do you use?

00:32:29.475 --> 00:32:32.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.730
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Chrome, OS.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.440
I actually do use a Chromebook
for most of my stuff.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.530
ROB LEWORTHY: They're very
good, I hear, so yeah.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.050
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
Yeah, wonderful.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.390
But there's no Caps Lock.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:43.890
ROB LEWORTHY: Is there not?

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.602
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
can configure it.

00:32:45.602 --> 00:32:47.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.137 --> 00:32:51.470
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah, but
other than that, it's great.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.200
Yeah, I actually
do use a Chromebook

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.540
for most of my stuff.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.537
But I just use Windows
10 for my home.

00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:01.620
ROB LEWORTHY: There's no
sense of shame with that.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.840
It's fine.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.450
ZACH WEINERSMITH:
It's not the same.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.460
It's the degradation.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.120
ROB LEWORTHY: Yes?

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.620
AUDIENCE: Having written
the children's book now,

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.078
is it different?

00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:20.200
How is it different to you
writing a book to nerds, say?

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.630
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Well, it is
a children's book for nerds.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.540
Do any of you know like
cake-cutting problems

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.960
and number theory?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.859
So there's this
class of problems.

00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:34.400
It's called
cake-cutting, because you

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.030
know how your mom would
say, one person gets to cut

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.389
and one person gets to choose.

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:40.680
Because that's the solution
for a one-cut cake problem.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.100
But it's, like, well, how
do you solve a three-cut?

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.540
And there are different
ways to go about this.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.370
And there are different shapes.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.090
And then what if
it's not homogeneous?

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.590
So I actually have
a joke about that

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:54.970
in the kids' book, which
is there's the Solomon

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.789
Solution for if two women
claim the same kid, what's

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:00.330
the solution?

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.164
So Solomon's solution is to
say, let's divide the baby.

00:34:04.164 --> 00:34:05.830
And that will prove
out the real mother.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.550
So I talked to a number
of theorists who thought,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.605
as he put it, that
solution was a bit dicey.

00:34:11.605 --> 00:34:12.796
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.580
Because it doesn't free
the false mother of her

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.730
desire to lie about it.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.339
Like, in real life, she wouldn't
be, like, yeah, that's fine.

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:24.380
I mean, because that's
what happens in the story.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.449
She's just like,
yeah, that's fine.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.469
It's not really my kid.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.590
So go ahead and chop
the child in half.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.048
You know, you don't
think about it.

00:34:30.048 --> 00:34:32.889
but it's not a great solution.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.139
So but anyway, so I have this
part where the kid in the book

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:40.510
has to solve the Solomon
Problem for three mothers.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.760
There's three moms who are
trying to claim one baby.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.343
Because you can't
say, cut it in half.

00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:46.011
Because what if one
of them gets 60%?

00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:46.969
They might go for that?

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.961
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.040
And the best part, I
originally had a joke

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.550
about how I had
wanted to include

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.024
an appendix in the
book, explaining

00:34:58.024 --> 00:34:59.190
the solution to the problem.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:03.214
Because there is
a good solution.

00:35:03.214 --> 00:35:04.630
Would y'all be
interested in that?

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.792
I could do that.

00:35:05.792 --> 00:35:07.750
I'm totally blanking on
the name of the guy who

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.552
came up with this.

00:35:08.552 --> 00:35:10.260
He's a famous game-theory
guy, and I just

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.020
can't remember his name.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.930
His solution was
that you say, whoever

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.930
claims the baby gets it.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.270
But if there's more
than one claimant,

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.599
The baby goes to an
expensive orphanage,

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.890
and everyone has to pay for it.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.750
So now, you see,
the false mother

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.500
doesn't want to falsely claim.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.440
Because she'll get stuck with
the bill for her non-kid.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:32.940
Right?

00:35:36.884 --> 00:35:38.800
The really cute part is,
I was talking to him.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.210
And I was, like, well,
how would it work?

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.010
That's a two-claimant solution.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.580
But how would it work for three?

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.710
And it turns out, it's
actually expandable.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.669
Because there are
three claimants.

00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:51.460
It's just you just have
three people paying

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.210
for the orphanage.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.980
So the kid would get a
really good experience.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.050
But then I came up
with what I think

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.060
is an original contribution
to mathematics,

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.890
which is what is the solution?

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.220
It is mothers go to infinity.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.510
Because at some point, you can't
spend more on the orphanage.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.220
And if you get infinity
moms, it goes to $0 per mom.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.220
In which case, the problem of
a false mother claiming the mom

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.420
rears its head again.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.190
I forget what my solution was.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.690
I mean, you could solve it by
having an infinitely expanding

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.024
orphanage, until it gets
to the size of the universe

00:36:23.024 --> 00:36:23.940
or something, I guess.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.630
But hopefully it won't come up.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:32.140
But anyway, so the point
being, it is a book for nerds.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.820
There is a little appendix
section discussing

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.950
the Infinite Mom's Problem.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.750
ROB LEWORTHY: We'll
leave it there and say,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.520
thank you very much, Zach.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:41.820
ZACH WEINERSMITH: Yeah.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.320
Thanks for having me.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.770
[APPLAUSE]
