00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
Aria allows us to express an extremely
broad range of semantic concepts

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.900
via the use of HTML attributes.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.540
Obviously Aria is a very complex topic
and it can take a long time to learn

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.760
all of the precise details of the best
use of Aria roles, states, and

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.680
properties, and special roles and
attributes like Aria Live.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.835
The Aria Practices document is
a great place to get information for

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:23.770
well-known Aria best practices and
design patterns.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.620
And the Aria spec has all
of the nitty gritty details

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.920
of what each of the roles and attributes
does if you need to take a deeper dive.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.120
Then like any skill, it's a matter
of experimentation, practice and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.290
persistence.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.060
There is no substitute for trying things
out with the real world assistive

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.490
technology, especially screen readers.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.430
And keep an eye out because browsers are
also developing tooling which will start

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.490
to make all of this easier.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.840
However it bears repeating that
if you don't need to use Aria,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.460
you can just not.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.140
Implicit HTML semantics can
get you a very long way and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.910
will save you a lot of effort in
re-implementing the semantics and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.220
behaviors of many standard
user experience patterns.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.640
So that wraps up our
discussion of semantics.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.345
It's been a long journey, but we're
not quite done with the course yet.

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.530
While we definitely need to make
sure are semantics are in order for

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.120
assistive technology users, we also
need to make sure that the visual UI

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.120
is usable for everyone as well.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.100
So in the next lesson,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.980
Rob is going to explain the role that
styling can play in accessibility.
