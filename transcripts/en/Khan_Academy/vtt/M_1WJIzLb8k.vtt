00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:03.349
- [Voiceover] "Tickets for a
play were $2 for each child

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:07.041
"and $4 for each adult. At
one showing of the play,

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.991
"one adult brought 4 children

00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:14.356
"and the remaining adults
brought 2 children each.

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:16.609
"The total ticket sales from the children

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.650
"and adults was $60. How many children

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.787
"and adults attended the play?"

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.922
All right, this is an interesting one.

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:25.439
OK, so let's just think

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.204
about how much was spent at the play.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:29.355
We know it had to add up to $60,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.097
but let's think about it
in terms of the children

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.653
and adults and their admissions.

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:34.673
So, you have this one
adult right over here

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:36.252
that brought four children.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:40.037
So, how much is this family,
let's assume it's a family,

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:41.801
how much are they going to spend?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.983
Well, that one adult is going to spend $4

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.512
for their own ticket, and
then four children at $2 each.

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:52.366
So, plus four children times $2 per child,

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.781
this is going to be $8 on
the children's tickets,

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:58.008
plus $4 on theirs, they're
going to spend $12.

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:01.584
So, that adult is going to spend $12.

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:03.511
And then there's some remaining number

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.578
of adults that brought two children.

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.774
So, let's say, r is, I could
say the remaining number

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:15.769
of adults, or, let's say,
adults with two children.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.484
Adults with two children. That's r.

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.176
So, each of these adults
with two children,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:27.079
how much are they going to spend?

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:30.586
Well, they're each going to
spend $4 on their own ticket,

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:34.301
for the adult, and then
they're gonna have two children

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.853
at $2 each, so they're going to spend $4

00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:39.176
on the children's tickets.

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.103
So, they're going to spend $8 in total.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:44.819
So, each of these adults
with two children are going

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.651
to spend $8 at the play.

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.091
And there's r of them.

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:51.553
So, they're going to spend $8 for each

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.385
of these adults with two
children, and there are r of them.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:57.126
So, this is the total
amount of ticket sales

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:59.215
from the adults with two children.

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.443
And you add that to the tickets sales

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:03.440
from this one adult
with the four children,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.203
and they're gonna have to add up to $60.

00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:09.686
So, this is going to
have to add up to $60.

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.288
Let's see, we can subtract
12 from both sides,

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:13.611
and on the left we'll be left

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:18.069
with 8r is equal to 60 minus 12 is 48,

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.271
divide both sides by eight,
you get r is equal to six.

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.013
So, we want to be very careful.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:25.638
You might say, "OK,
there were six adults."

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:28.355
These are just the
adults with two children.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.141
There are six adults with two children,

00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:33.278
but there's another adult.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.460
There's another adult who
brought four children.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.919
So, there's a total of seven adults.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.112
Seven adults total, pardon my handwriting.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:46.049
Seven adults total.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.230
So, we could just look at these choices.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.528
Only one of these choices
have seven adults.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:53.758
And we could verify that
this would also amount

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:54.849
to 16 children.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.541
Because this person up here, in magenta,

00:02:58.061 --> 00:02:59.538
they would bring four children,

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:01.140
so you would have four children,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.507
plus six adults brought two children.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.783
Six adults bringing two children each,

00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:09.105
that would amount to 12 children,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:14.097
and that indeed does add up to be 16.

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:16.117
If you're under time
pressure, you can see,

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:17.742
look, there's only one
choice that has seven adults,

00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:19.646
so you can just pick that one.
