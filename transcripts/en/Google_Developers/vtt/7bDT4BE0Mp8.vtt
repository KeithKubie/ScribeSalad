00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:05.950
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hi, I'm Magnus
Hyttsten for the Developers

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.650
Show, and we are here at
the TensorFlow Dev Summit.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.810
And I'm standing here
with Chris Lattner.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.407
Hello, Chris.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:12.490
CHRIS LATTNER: Hi, Magnus.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.930
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So
Chris, you are actually

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.360
one of the original founders
of the Swift language.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.330
Is that correct?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.770
CHRIS LATTNER: That's true.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.780
It started as a nights
and weekends project,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.129
and it grew to something a
little bit bigger than that.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.920
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's
absolutely amazing.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920
And you just had a talk
on TensorFlow and Swift

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.770
that may be surprising
to some people.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.655
How does these two things--
how did they get together?

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.030
CHRIS LATTNER:
Well, it turns out

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.550
that Swift has some really
interesting capabilities

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.660
that most other
languages don't have.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.400
And so one of the neat
things about Swift

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.520
is it was designed
from the very beginning

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.620
with the idea of spanning
all the way from systems

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.230
programming all the way
up to scripting languages.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.054
And it turns out that
TensorFlow is really

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:50.470
a sweet spot for
that, because you

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.840
want to be able to program
TensorFlow like a scripting

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.006
language and be able to use
high-level abstractions,

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.710
but you also care about
low-level performance as well.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.617
And so Swift is really
well-positioned to fit that.

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:02.200
Beyond that, Swift
is a great language

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.270
because it supports the
kind of compiler analysis

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.770
and all the deep
internal stuff that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.520
makes it possible to
do what we're doing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.460
with Swift for TensorFlow.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.834
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And it's very
modern in syntax, compact,

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.060
and it has the construct
that you would expect?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.143
CHRIS LATTNER: Absolutely.

00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:18.490
So Swift was starting
in 2010, so it's not

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.840
that old by language standards.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.900
And so one of the great
things about that is it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.420
gets to build on all the best
things that have been learned,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.587
that are modern techniques
in programming languages.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.753
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.740
So I think most people--
or you developers

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.890
out there-- that you associate
Swift with iOS development.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.300
But this has nothing to do
with iOS development, correct?

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.650
CHRIS LATTNER: Absolutely.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.940
Swift is an open
source language,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.606
and people use it for
server development

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:41.450
and a lot of other things
that are beyond iOS as well.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.890
And so this is just a great way
to express tensor computations

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.500
and be able to build your
machine learning algorithms

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.810
in a natural way
where the compiler can

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.190
help you write your code.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.850
It can detect errors for you.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.482
It can make your life
better so that you

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.190
can focus on getting
the job done instead

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.856
of trying to fight
through the framework

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:00.565
and trying to deal
with typical problems.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:01.731
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:03.730
So I guess the question
on everyone's mind

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.710
is how can I get
involved in this?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.720
How can I use Swift
with TensorFlow?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.303
CHRIS LATTNER: Oh,
that's really easy.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:11.600
So it's still a very
early stage project,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.050
but we're opening our
open source project

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.990
in the next month.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.840
So in the month of
April, you can sign up.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.890
At that time, we're
publishing not just the code,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.962
but also white papers.

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:21.670
And we're also allowing
open development,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.530
so you too can contribute
to the project.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.030
And so if you're
interested in that,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.944
you can go to tensorflow.org/c
ommunities/swift.

00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:29.110
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Super cool.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.984
So it's going to be
really interesting to see

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.780
what you developers create
with Swift and TensorFlow.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.930
I'm Magnus Hyttsten.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.150
This is Chris Lattner.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.300
We're at the TensorFlow Dev
Summit for Developers Show.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.750
