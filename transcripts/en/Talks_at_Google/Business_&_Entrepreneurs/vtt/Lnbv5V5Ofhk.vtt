[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.020
SPEAKER 1: So when
brainstorming how

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.300
to celebrate
International Women's Day,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.830
we had a lot of
ideas about who we

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.370
wanted to bring to the
office, whether it's

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.590
an entrepreneur or someone who
is successful in corporate.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.060
But what was really
important to us

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.130
was to bring someone
who was a shining

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.420
example of a successful
Arab woman and someone

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.630
from the region who
had spent their time

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.680
and spent their energy building
something really, really cool.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.590
And so the theme for this
year's International Women's Day

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.160
is Balanced for Better.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.800
And we couldn't think
of someone better

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.270
to have to talk about this
theme than Sarah Abdullah.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.210
Sarah is the founder
of Makooky World

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.900
and is a successful
entrepreneur from the region,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.570
has moved from corporate, and
has built her own business

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
in quite a short amount of time.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.270
Makooky World is a
platform for children.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.650
There's children's content in
the form of-- there's an app,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
there's a YouTube channel, and
it's an interactive platform

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.450
that is all in Arabic.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.340
And what's really
fantastic about it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.100
is that there are a
lot of social messages

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.010
that are being conveyed
through this platform.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.350
So I'll turn it over to Sarah
to talk a little bit more

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.060
about her journey and
Makooky World specifically.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.450
You are the chief
writer, and the content

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.590
is very dear to your heart.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.480
So I wanted to first start out
by understanding why Makooky?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.522
And what it means to you?

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.355
SARAH ABDULLAH: First
of all, thank you very

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.730
much for having me here today.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.330
It's an honor, especially
on Women's Day.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.100
I take pride in
that, so thank you.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.820
Why Makooky?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.430
Because it's all about
stories and storytelling.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.660
And storytelling has always
been so dear to my heart.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.650
I think that since
the beginning of time,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.280
people came together
around the fire

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100
at the time because
of storytellers who

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.840
always had something to say.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.680
And I think about
all the stories

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.770
that we're told that, at
a certain point in time,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.040
were seen as
superpowers like, people

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
crossing seas, or climbing
mountains, or even flying.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.750
And I think about
how those ideas

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.610
were transformed into words.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
And how these words with
the repetition of them,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.750
and when they're told
over and over again,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.010
allow one person to take a
step forward and turn them

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.400
into action.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.020
And I think the power of story,
as stories comes from here,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.320
it's the fact that an
idea can become a word,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.910
and a word can become an action
is why I find it so magical.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.500
So for a very long time,
I appreciated that.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.160
I wanted to tell stories.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.410
I wanted to tell stories that
are dear to my heart that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.350
can possibly create a change.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.450
And what better way
to create change

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.130
than start with children?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.940
Because they are the
adults of tomorrow.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.600
So if we want to aspire to
something, we start young.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.060
And that's where the idea of
creating content for children

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.320
came from.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.710
I come from a
corporate background.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.890
I started back in 2001.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700
I was at Leo
Burnett advertising.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
And I worked there
for a very long time

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.660
until in 2014, I took
the step to quit.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.700
And being in the corporate
world teaches you a lot.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.960
It teaches you that
there is a structure.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.890
Everybody can do
their job very well.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.840
They learn how to do a specific
thing really, really well.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.530
And I was a producer.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.140
I produced TV commercials,
and radio commercials,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.750
post-production, animation.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.270
And I knew a little
bit about everything,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.320
but a lot about production.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.787
And being here today actually
reminds me of things I miss,

00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:19.579
which is really funny
because we're talking

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.740
about corporate versus startup.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.380
Seeing a room filled
with people who

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.440
have a laugh and a
wonderful culture.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.860
And I'm sure all of you
connect all the time

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.930
and have great exchange.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.530
And this is the part
that the corporate world

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.775
offers you, which is amazing.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.370
But at the same
time, as beautiful

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.400
as the ship was, and as
safe, and it provided well,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.620
it had a captain,
which was leading it.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.870
And I didn't decide
where we were going.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.090
And at a certain point in time,
I wanted to go somewhere else,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.860
so I wanted to be captain
of my own boat at the time

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.950
so I decided to quit.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.700
And I don't think
you quit in a day.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.640
I think the idea to
leave where you are,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.970
where you're kind of happy,
and you love your job,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.380
and start something on your
own comes in different stages.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.980
It's an idea that starts.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.800
And I believe that ideas
grow and grow bigger,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.250
and they just take over
at a certain point in time

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.010
where they become
your companion.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.980
You wake up with this idea,
you sleep with that idea.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.170
And everything you do is
reflective of that idea,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.000
and that was Makooky.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.270
Makooky actually is the name
of the company of the startup,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.370
but it's the name of the
main character at Makooky

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.310
who is an alien who comes from
outer space, comes to Earth.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.990
And because of his curiosity,
decides to travel and come

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.350
here, and sees the
world for the first time

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.560
with the eyes of a child.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.440
And this character was
starting to build in my head.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.990
And because of my
experience and production,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.730
I could see how he looks like.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.020
I could see where he can live.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.220
I could see what
he will be doing.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.940
And we befriended
each other for a year

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.440
before I decided to
leave what I was doing,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.940
and just start a journey,
and begin my startup.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.250
SPEAKER 1: So going from
that sort of concept phase

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.340
to where it is right now,
what was the process like?

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.270
And particularly, this
is a children's platform.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.770
What were the themes
that you really

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.887
wanted to include and
make sure that we're

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:49.970
very prevalent in the
stories that you're telling?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.790
SARAH ABDULLAH: The ideas was
to have children's content

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.820
in Arabic that is providing
stories, songs, activities

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.310
for the region.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.420
But it was not a business,
in a sense, at the beginning.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.300
So it was the character, and
then it was the type of content

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.760
that I wanted to
create that's made it

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.570
to a digital platform that then
transformed into a business.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.900
And it was a very
important process for me.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.580
Makooky is an application.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.040
It has story songs for
children up to age 8.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.230
They're provided in Arabic.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.650
It's interactive, it's
animated, it's fun,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.020
but that's not what it is.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.270
It's not a place, a library
where we have content that

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.330
meets two criteria--
children and Arabic--

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.030
goes into.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.850
That's not how we think.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.260
It's a world on its own that
is supported by pillars.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.432
And those pillars were
one of the first things

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:57.140
we thought about.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.990
Those pillars are
reflective of the values

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.010
that Makooky stands for.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.330
And these values are:
imagination, knowledge,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.380
and responsibility because
we are talking to children.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.490
And childhood is one of
the most crucial phases

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.960
in a human being's life.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.360
And as a content creator,
we have the responsibility

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.310
to make sure that our messages
carry this responsibility

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.020
with a lot of care.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.610
So the pillars were
there, then the characters

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.169
were born because
of those values.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:38.320
So we have Makooky, our main
character, and his friends,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.169
[? Mahoob, ?] [? Maluma, ?]
[? Masulla. ?] Each one

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:47.000
delivering one of those messages
in the stories or the songs

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.610
that we're producing.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.270
And these values are very broad.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.960
So imagination can mean
anything and knowledge can mean

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.030
anything, but what we had
to do is decide and define

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.070
the themes that would
live under those values.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.320
So for us, imagination was
anything and everything

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.800
with no limitation
of time or space,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.720
children can go wild regardless
of the many restrictions

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.640
that we do face
in the Middle East

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.920
and while talking
to our children.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.200
This is not real, this is
not true, that is not right.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.860
We don't care.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.260
Let them imagine.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.900
There is nothing
right with an idea.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.080
Ideas can be
anything, and they can

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.380
be transformed into reality.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.770
And that was the first concept.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.860
Knowledge, for us,
needed to stay away

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.720
from preaching, and teaching,
and education in that sense.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.950
Knowledge for us
was showing journeys

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.770
through storytelling
of trial and error,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.200
failure, observation.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.600
And that's how children learn.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.410
And that was the knowledge
that is being collected.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.300
Responsibility, we
spent a lot of time

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.630
on because again being
in the Middle East

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.910
and speaking to Arab
parents and Arab children,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.490
a lot of the
responsibility values

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.920
are derived from our
traditions, from our values,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.320
especially in this
part of the world.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.260
And what we wanted
to do at Makooky

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.640
is give it a broader
look and feel.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.460
We wanted to treat children
as responsible human beings

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.480
and global citizens.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.240
So the subjects that fell under
responsibility in our stories

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.850
were not about just
respecting the elderly,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:45.040
and being kind to the young,
and doing your homework

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.900
or anything, it
was responsibility

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.750
towards one's self,
health, well-being,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.420
eating healthy,
nutrition, sports,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.850
that's under
responsibility for us.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.690
Responsibility towards the
creatures who we live with,

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.840
the animals, the plants, the
trees, the environment, that

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.120
fell under responsibility.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.160
And most importantly,
responsibility

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.190
towards our dreams,
our aspirations.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.020
So also within the
content creation,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.790
we are very keen on
the presentation.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.000
And I'm very happy
it's Women's Day.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.530
And at Makooky, we take
pride at fair representation

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.700
of both males and females in
our stories and our songs.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.670
Because I don't think that
stories and content needs

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.590
to be only reflective
of the culture

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.523
you're in, but also has to be
aspirational to where you want

00:11:40.523 --> 00:11:42.940
to be and where you want to
arrive, especially when you're

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.220
working with children.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.500
So we just released
actually a collection

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.970
of professions-- what kids
can be when they grow up.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.510
And I'm very happy because
we had the ballerina story.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:02.410
And it had a girl and a boy
because we often forget boys

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.940
when it comes to dancing.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.100
And it might not be the
most acceptable thing now,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.740
but there are male dancers,
there are boy dancers,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.130
and we have to celebrate them,
and encourage them, and accept

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.830
that this is a choice
they're making.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.630
We had a girl judge and
it exists, it's there.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.370
They're a minority.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.270
But girls and boys have
to look at those stories

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.880
and find it normal.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.420
We have to normalize
what we want to get to.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.320
And it's our job
as content creators

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.700
if we want something to
happen in the future,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.370
we have to make it
normal today, visually.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.570
We have to hear it, we have to
say it, we have to repeat it.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.520
We had a girl astronaut.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.450
I think it exists, but we
want to aspire to have more.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.450
And that's how we deal with
content in Makooky World.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.700
SPEAKER 1: And have
you found that there

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.257
is a reception to
portrayals of things

00:13:02.257 --> 00:13:04.340
that are not traditional
in our part of the world?

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.715
SARAH ABDULLAH:
Yes, yes, there's

00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:09.160
more reception than we think.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.560
I think a lot of our
reaction to the market

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.840
is based on assumptions
of what exists.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.970
So we look at what
exists, and then we say,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.550
that's what the market wants,
that's what the market needs,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.690
that's what the market
likes, but that's not it.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.430
Give them what they
didn't see and then you'll

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.080
know whether they are
receptive to it or not.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.180
And they might not be now, but
it's happening, it's a reality.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.730
So do we just keep ignoring it?

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.730
Or do we take responsibility in
participating and contributing

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.810
to change?

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.223
Because it is up to us
to create this change.

00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:50.140
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.985
SARAH ABDULLAH: And
allow the educators

00:13:51.985 --> 00:13:56.800
to have tools to provide
this visual, normalization

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.480
of change.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.110
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.577
So I want to go back to
this concept of being

00:14:01.577 --> 00:14:03.160
the captain of your
own ship because I

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.062
think that's something
that each of us

00:14:05.062 --> 00:14:06.520
individually,
whether we're working

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.145
in a corporate
environment, or thinking

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:10.480
about starting our own
thing, that comes to mind.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.970
And maybe talk to
us a little bit

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.060
about your journey towards
actually taking that step

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.390
and thinking about what it is
that you truly wanted to do,

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.275
realizing what your passion was
because it's the challenge I

00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:23.400
think a lot of people face.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:30.910
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yeah, so I
knew I wanted to start Makooky.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:38.590
And my experience was heavy
on writing, on production.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:45.880
And I had to create something
that can turn into a business

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.160
because I wanted it to
live on a digital platform,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.470
because I wanted to
change as much as I can.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.190
And because this is the
future, this is the world,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.410
and children love their apps.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.650
And it's an interactive and
it's not a passive relationship,

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.440
but getting there is
a different story.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:13.030
So a lot of the founders of
startups, as you may know,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.460
start their businesses
because they love something.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.260
So somebody who starts an
app about cars, for cars,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.900
is probably a car lover,
but doesn't know much

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:29.230
about finance, or marketing, or
digital media, or legal setups,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.500
and so on and so forth.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.270
So it is very challenging
because when I had my idea,

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.920
and when I had all
the content ready,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.250
and I worked with a developer
to create actually a prototype,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.960
and I worked with
an animator, and I

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.800
put time and money into it.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.080
So for an entire year
I created a prototype

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.300
of the app to be
able to go to market

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.630
and actually raise money.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:00.700
And that process
is not very simple

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.010
because there's a lot of market
research that goes into it.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.330
You have to put the
figures, you have

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.830
to understand how
much it'll cost.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.690
You have to put the
figures in phases.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.510
I didn't know what
the phases were.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.540
I had to ask for a lot of
advice, for a lot of help.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.040
I had to know who
was in the market.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.123
Who are the major players?

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:20.060
What are they doing?

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.050
Is it working?

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.020
If it's not, why isn't it?

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.010
So a lot of validation
goes into place,

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:31.330
but then raising money is a
completely different story

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:36.290
because I'm a creative.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.140
I'm a content creator.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.250
I've done a lot of
budgeting for production,

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.870
but when you seek
investments, you're

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:48.380
kind of converting your words
into a different currency.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.112
So I'm talking values, quality,
stories, change, social change,

00:16:54.112 --> 00:16:55.570
and you have people
in front of you

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.110
who are thinking money, dollar
signs, profits, revenue.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.599
And you're not going to
win if you don't convert.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:09.849
You have to find a way
to convert everything

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:17.859
you're saying into a language
that is investment friendly,

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.180
otherwise it won't work.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:25.180
And that process alone was very
difficult and very challenging

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.800
because it's not me,
it's not my element,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.050
it's not what I'm good at.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.790
SPEAKER 1: And it's new.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.530
SARAH ABDULLAH: It's
a new field for me.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.470
So that's where I
sought a lot of advice.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.240
I had hours and
hours of rehearsals

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.080
with friends who are very
dear friends to my heart,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.050
but were very good
at doing that part.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.640
We role played, I got upset
because I told him to be honest

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.830
and they were, and
I became defensive.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.180
So I went through rounds,
and rounds, and rounds

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.310
of presenting, getting
rejection, presenting,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.890
getting challenged at a point
that I had no idea about.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:12.250
And it was hard work because
everybody wants the founder

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.360
to go and pitch.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:22.120
And I can pitch my idea, but the
business model, it's new to me,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.730
and it's still a
work in progress.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.360
Years later, it will
always be work in progress

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.260
because you're always more
comfortable in your element.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.650
I can talk about Makooky,
the product, for hours.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:41.800
And then I have to go and speak
about figures, and numbers,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.980
and conversion.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.060
And it takes more time,
but that's normal.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.490
And I think it's
a challenge that

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.830
is shared by many founders.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:56.200
And I think that we are always
reluctant to talk about it

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.820
because you always
don't want to seem

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.288
like you don't know
it all, but the truth

00:19:00.288 --> 00:19:01.330
is you don't know it all.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.402
Nobody knows it's all;
it's just impossible.

00:19:04.402 --> 00:19:06.610
SPEAKER 1: And I think
there's a tendency for females

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.570
to be a little bit more
reluctant to take the step

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.920
to ask for advice, or to
seek help for challenges

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.040
that they're facing.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.290
Has that been your experience?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.620
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yes, if I
would give one advice to myself

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.620
three years ago, I would
say, seek more advice

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.380
without worrying about judgment.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:32.290
So today I'm not
worried about judgment

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.010
because I just simply don't
care if I'm being judged or not.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.210
What I care about is the
result of that conversation

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.190
because exchange
is very important.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.690
But when I first started,
I was always thinking OK,

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.090
the product is not
there; it's not perfect.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.600
I know I want to talk with X or
Y because they're very smart,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.760
but if I ask them
questions, will they

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.530
just assume that this question
means I don't know anything?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.480
Will they say, come
on, this was basic?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.197
If she doesn't know
how to do this,

00:20:05.197 --> 00:20:07.030
how is she running a
business if she doesn't

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.930
know this small finance?

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.650
If she has to ask
this finance question,

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.900
how is she running a business?

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.860
If she asks this tech question,
how's she running a business?

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.503
And you're always
worried because there

00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:18.670
are two things you're doing.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.180
You want to seek advice, but you
also want to prove your worth.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.510
And these can become very
conflicting at times.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:31.000
So there's always a conflict
on whether will this

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.820
give away and expose all
my lack of knowledge?

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.790
And is that smart to do?

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.880
But my advice is,
do it, it's OK.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.860
One person can think
you don't know anything,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.230
but what you get out
of that conversation

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.888
will make you know 50% more.

00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:48.430
And when you speak
to another person,

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.170
you would have known 50%
more, and that's what matters.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.940
SPEAKER 1: So speaking
of challenges,

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.040
I think everyone faces
this to a certain extent,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.150
is balancing home life
and/or personal life

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.660
with being a founder, and having
basically your work kind of

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.490
follow you 24 hours a day.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.035
So how do you do it?

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.660
SARAH ABDULLAH: I
don't have a balance.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.400
So there is no
balance in my life

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.140
because balance means
things are equal,

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.300
and things are not equal.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.350
My family comes first.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:29.320
And so I do find the term,
work-life balance not something

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.970
that I go for.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.840
I would say, how
do I manage it all?

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.580
I would talk about
time management

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.500
if that makes more sense.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.990
So I'm a mother of two.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.820
I became a mother of two
as I was starting Makooky

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.160
and building it.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.710
And I have two beautiful
daughters, Clara and Ella--

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.350
four years and two year olds.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:00.610
And Makooky is three years
old, so you can imagine

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.760
everything that goes into it.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.450
At the beginning,
it was not easy

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.710
because you are overwhelmed.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.690
A family doesn't
come with a manual,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.830
nobody tells you what to do.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.490
And they come, more people
come into your life,

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.220
and you're still stuck
with the 24 hour frame.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.080
So they don't come
with more hours.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.872
They don't come with
more nothing, nothing.

00:22:21.872 --> 00:22:23.372
SPEAKER 1: Just
more responsibility.

00:22:23.372 --> 00:22:25.450
SARAH ABDULLAH: Just
more responsibilities.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:30.130
And so it was very
challenging at the beginning.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.930
And it did throw things off
balance at the beginning.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.760
And then I realized,
OK, the only way

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.370
to do it is to set the variables
and the constants in my life.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.500
So there are constants
that will never disappear,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:52.450
which is my relationship with
my children, my well-being,

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.930
and my deliverables at work.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.190
And there are variables
that I can work with.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:04.780
And these variables are
how do I optimize my time?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.890
How do I become more efficient?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.480
How do I meet my deliverables
at different hours,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.670
different phases.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.940
And I realized that you
can't do everything--

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.630
you can't.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.010
It's impossible.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.810
So you have two
delegate and accept

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.530
that there are people in your
life that will give you help,

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.820
and you can't take
credit for it.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:32.050
So I have help at home who
are taking care of my children

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.340
when I'm working, and I'm not
going to take credit for that.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.340
And I have people who--

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.490
at work, I have a wonderful
team who have ownership

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.100
because I delegated to them.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.280
And they do a lot of the work.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.730
And I have a partner,
and I'm am very lucky.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.390
We are two parents who are
taking care of our children.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:24:01.450
And all of this comes together,
and then you compromise.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.500
So instead of cancelling
gym, I do 30 minutes instead

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.640
of an hour.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.980
Instead of cancelling
seeing a friend,

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.410
I do a power breakfast
instead of a drink.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.660
Instead of watching
movies, I watch series now

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.260
because they're much shorter.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.360
So at nights, I have 30 minutes.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.670
And you cut everything
short because it

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:26.140
is a pizza that's being sliced
and given to many more people.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.280
You had it for your own, and
then everyone wants a piece.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.110
And you just have to
have thinner slices.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.970
But I don't know if
anyone has it right.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.292
It is a compromise
on many levels, yeah.

00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:42.250
SPEAKER 1: So speaking
of these various avenues

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.020
where you spend
your time, are there

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.240
any particular ones that give
you inspiration or motivation?

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.930
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yeah, my kids
are my biggest inspiration.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:53.770
I'm very lucky.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.250
So, of course, it takes a lot
of time to raise children,

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.700
but because they're still
within the age, which

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.025
is also Makooky's target
audience-- it's amazing.

00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:04.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.250
They were very helpful.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.400
It's very helpful
for many reasons.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.810
First, I can enter
play areas and observe

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.055
without being weird.

00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:14.180
SPEAKER 1: Market research.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.580
SARAH ABDULLAH: Because I
have my children with me.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.060
Can you imagine an adult
just being there alone?

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.180
I call all their
friends for play dates,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.427
and pass on the iPad,
and watch their behavior.

00:25:26.427 --> 00:25:27.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.890
I have free access to mom
groups, and parent groups,

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.800
and fathers, and it's amazing.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.530
They come with their own perks.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.950
I shoot most of our
promotions with my children,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.820
free of charge.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.445
And I can post on social
media without consent forms.

00:25:45.445 --> 00:25:46.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.870
I love it.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.840
It's amazing.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.420
It's amazing, really.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:59.270
And it helps, but they also
have ideas of their own.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.710
My four year old thinks she
works for Makooky because we do

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.035
a lot of office hours together.

00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:06.660
SPEAKER 1: Technically
she does, right?

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.355
Technically she does.

00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:08.897
SARAH ABDULLAH:
Technically she does.

00:26:08.897 --> 00:26:10.670
She comes to the office a lot.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.790
I ask her to draw,
I ask her opinion,

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.688
and then I give
her money because--

00:26:16.688 --> 00:26:18.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.060
--she skipped a play date.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.370
So she actually thinks
she's getting paid.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.090
And it's working, and--

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.893
--we have a lot of content
coming because of that.

00:26:31.893 --> 00:26:33.310
AUDIENCE: Give her
a stock option.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.590
SARAH ABDULLAH: I
should, I should.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.862
I should but I've
worked so hard for that,

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:38.945
so I'm always in conflict.

00:26:41.922 --> 00:26:44.320
But yeah, thank you
for giving me ideas.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:44.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.650
It's good to have kids when
you're in this business.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.955
It's good, it's
good to kids when

00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:55.220
you're in this business--
that's all I can say.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.260
So they are a very big
help and inspiration.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.850
SPEAKER 1: So I have one final
question before I open it up

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:02.540
to the audience.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.780
But there was actually
a recent study

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.150
that showed that less
than 20% of business

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.750
owners within the MENA
region are held by women.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.360
And having started
your own company here,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.160
is there any advice
or inspiration

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.760
you would give to those
who are aspiring to do so?

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:28.590
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yes, first,
I think that 20% is not

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:34.050
reflective of how many women
try to be entrepreneurs

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.320
and succeeded.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.180
I think it's how many people
actually branched out, and were

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.010
brave enough to leave
the corporate world,

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.180
and be entrepreneurs.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.520
And I think that this percentage
is low because of many factors.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.730
And I really hope that
this will change soon

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.910
and everybody will
contribute to this change.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.420
I think that there are a lot
of initiatives supporting

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.860
female entrepreneurs, female
led startups, and that's great,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.500
but that's not where
the problem is.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.020
The problem is to be able
to be an entrepreneur,

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.620
you have to have
leadership skills.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.790
You have to take the
decision to be on your own.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.060
And to be able to do that,
you should be confident enough

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.350
to do it.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.060
And you should
also know that once

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.730
you do that, you are supported.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.660
And unfortunately, we still
live in a society where there

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:37.840
is this type of upbringing
of girls where they're like,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.000
don't do this, you're a girl.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.110
Is she being too messy?

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.640
While boys fall, and bump
themselves, and climb trees,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.910
and it's the norm.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.030
It's like, it's
normal, he's a boy.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.120
And then girls try to do the
same thing, and you're like,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.080
are you sure?

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.660
She's too boyish.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.220
She's too tomboyish.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.780
I heard people
saying, maybe she's

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.270
hanging out with a lot of boys.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.010
She's losing her femininity.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.460
And all this girl was doing
was being curious, falling,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.380
having more bumps, and hits,
and bruises, and that's normal.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.470
That's childhood, it's
not about girls and boys.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.220
And then you have
a lot of examples

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.830
from the corporate world
where there's still a pay gap.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:30.970
And there is still difference
in the way women are promoted

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.350
to what leadership positions.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.220
And most of the entrepreneurs
don't just graduate and become

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.520
entrepreneurs, but they
were working somewhere.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.330
And what they've been
fed and trained to feel,

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.740
they continue and carry
onto their journey

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.230
in their entrepreneur life.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.490
And also there's
the bigger problem,

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:58.050
which is the unfair
distribution of responsibilities

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.830
in families that is still
existing in our society.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.430
Female parents and
male parents are not

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:12.280
expected to have the same
responsibilities at home.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.770
And I'm not talking here
about role segregation.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.890
I'm not saying a family
unit who consciously

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.820
decided we have a breadwinner
and we have a primary nurture.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.190
I'm talking about
family units who

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.120
have a male breadwinner,
a female breadwinner,

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.100
plus primary nurturer.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.750
How do you expect this
woman or this female

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.010
to do the same
amount of work when

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.900
given half the time that this
male is doing or achieving?

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.220
It is impossible.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.140
So until we are conscious
of all of these factors,

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:54.250
and we speak up and
talk about them,

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.310
and put our foot down
and say, I am not

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.030
going to be with a partner
who does not do his share.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.290
I am not going to
raise my daughters

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.330
with a cushion and a bubble.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.930
And I'm not going to
give male attributes

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.670
to positive things and female
adjectives to negative things.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.540
And until the corporate
world realizes and fixes

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:25.250
its pay gap and gender
opportunity problems,

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.250
these numbers are not
going to improve no matter

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.110
how many initiatives
support entrepreneurs

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.300
later on in life, really.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.410
I think we have to go
back to the basics.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.640
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.037
All right to open it up
to audience questions.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.650
Females?

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.040
It's International Women's Day.

00:31:49.787 --> 00:31:51.245
SARAH ABDULLAH:
Maybe no questions.

00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:52.030
SPEAKER 1: No questions?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:52.905
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:56.700
How can men specifically help
in what you were describing?

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.430
I mean, everyone has
their role in improving

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.120
what you're mentioning here.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.323
Can men do something
more specific to try

00:32:04.323 --> 00:32:04.990
to advance this?

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.120
SARAH ABDULLAH:
Yes, first of all,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.810
thank you very much
for this question.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:16.180
I don't think that
isolation works in any way.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.220
I'll give you an example
from Makooky, actually,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.810
because it is dear
to my heart, and I

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.570
keep having arguments
with everybody about it.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.450
A lot of children's, or
forget children's-- apps

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:32.080
in, specific-- a of brands
who market for children speak

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.000
to women only when
advertising their products.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.190
And I'm talking about
clothes, diapers, creams.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:43.120
I saw a diaper ad where they
said, that should [ARABIC]

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.790
and fix it and [ARABIC] and fix.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.800
And they're
excluding the father.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.690
Fathers never change diapers.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.750
I actually messaged
them, and, of course,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.660
because it's very important
to talk about these things.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.280
So at Makooky, we never
speak to mothers alone.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.570
We never ever exclude fathers.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.680
We say, your children
[ARABIC],, do this [ARABIC]..

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.860
We don't say, [ARABIC],, which
is something in Arabic where

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.340
you speak to females
only and exclude fathers.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.930
Men can do a lot.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.390
Men have to do a lot because
this is not only a woman's

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.510
thing, it's a men's thing.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.560
First of all, I
think that men need

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.440
to start on a societal level
and change definitions.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:32.880
So instead, not call
raising your children,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.050
babysitting, or not saying
doing your part of the job,

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.248
helping your wife.

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:39.040
Because it's not a
husband-wife department,

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.380
it's a parent-parent department.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.230
Standing up for your
colleagues at work

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.250
I think that if a male is
aware that a female colleague

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.340
of theirs is underpaid
or deserved a promotion

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.500
and didn't get it,
they need to speak up

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.940
as much as the woman
are speaking up.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.660
I think that
management has to stop

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.960
punishing women for the
responsibilities they have

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.060
in their social
life, and actually

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.930
contribute to talking
to men about how

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.010
they have to do their share
so that problem wouldn't even

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.400
exist.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.510
So a lot of corporations
take the excuse of, yeah,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.550
but she might start a family,
or she might have kids soon,

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.730
and I don't think will
she be up for the job.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.380
Instead of saying that, how
about telling all the fathers

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.590
in the company you
have to leave early

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.580
because you have a job to do?

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.190
I don't know, at
Google, you probably

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.489
don't have these problems
as many as other companies,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.790
but you'll be amazed.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.489
I've been exposed to so many
men shying away from saying,

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:51.580
I have to leave because
I want to do chores.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.114
They say I want to leave
because I want to see my kids,

00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:55.489
while the female
will say, I want

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.850
to leave because
I have bath time.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:02.350
Not many males will stand up
and say, I have bath time.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.030
They will say I'm
seeing my kids.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.550
It's not a custody
battle where you have

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.170
viewership for your children.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.410
You actually have to actively
stand up and say that's normal,

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.760
it's normalized.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.550
Men have a lot to do.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:22.810
And, of course, just being good
partners, colleagues, friends,

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.070
it's very helpful.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.520
And changing our
language, I have

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.380
to insist on that
because we do tend

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.130
to use a lot of
female adjectives

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:38.560
negatively and male
adjectives positively.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.290
And I'm not going to
mention what the words are.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.580
They're not probably
censored, but we

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.260
have to change our language.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:52.450
It's very, very important
because actions follow words,

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.922
and our words are
very important.

00:35:54.922 --> 00:35:57.130
It's very, very important,
so stand up for each other

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.741
because we are in it
together, it matters.

00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:02.000
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.872
Dina.

00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:05.330
DINA: Firstly, thank you so
much for coming in and speaking

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.760
today.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:05.970
SARAH ABDULLAH: Thank you.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.400
DINA: I really enjoyed
hearing what you said.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.970
One of the core elements
of gender diversity

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.420
is to really understand what
each side is going through.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.020
As somebody who's
very knowledgeable,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.107
can you share a
little bit of insight

00:36:19.107 --> 00:36:20.690
about how you became
so knowledgeable.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.245
And what you do to
increase your awareness.

00:36:26.803 --> 00:36:28.470
SARAH ABDULLAH: I'm
a feminist at heart,

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:36.270
so I don't think there are
any limitations to what people

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.960
can do--

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.440
people are people.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.770
But I also have a lot
of men in my life,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:49.530
and I befriended both for
a very, very long time,

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.920
and just sharing
stories, connecting,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:00.390
talking to each other,
seeing the side of men.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:05.010
So I had a conversation
with a guy friend,

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:11.370
and I was telling
him, can you believe

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.990
this girl didn't
get a promotion?

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.970
Because it was known that
she would start a family.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.400
And the company was reluctant
to give her a promotion

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.040
because, in their head, they
assumed she's going to leave.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.630
Eventually, she's
going to leave.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.950
Why should we invest in her?

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.770
Why should we give her
a promotion and a raise?

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:33.300
And it was very nice to
hear his side of this story

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:39.900
where he was telling me about
the same problem his wife was

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.880
facing.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.650
And so when he was
talking about his wife,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.390
he said it with so much
anger, and frustration,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.230
and it's not fair, and
there is injustice,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.750
while when it happened
at the company,

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.210
he didn't have
the same feelings.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:38:01.110
And just being able to see not
that one person's point of view

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.820
is not consistent depending
on what social role they're at

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.280
was very interesting.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.900
And it tells you that we
have a separation between how

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.070
we feel depending on where
we are in our social roles,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.690
and maybe that is the problem.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:24.900
If we were a better integrated,
if there was an integrated

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.640
ecosystem where
society, work, children

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.900
spoke more to each other, we
could find better solutions,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.290
it would be very helpful.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.080
But maybe from speaking
both to males, and females,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.310
at work, and friends, and seeing
both sides of the same person

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.750
speaking differently.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.360
And then bringing it
to their awareness,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.120
or them bringing something
to my awareness, and just

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.090
continuous conversations,
just conversing with everybody

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:54.690
all the time.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.520
SPEAKER 1: And I think there's
one thing that is unique

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.290
about you is that
you're curious,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.758
and that you don't
necessarily settle for--

00:39:00.758 --> 00:39:02.300
you'd like to get
your answers right.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.860
And I can see you as a
child probably asking

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.940
a lot of questions.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.740
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yeah, yes, I
do like to ask questions, I do.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.490
I love debates, and
they're very healthy,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:18.270
and they become
heated, but it's always

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.000
good to question something.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.040
SPEAKER 1: Yep, absolutely.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.915
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:22.915 --> 00:39:25.890
AUDIENCE: I have a question
on the content space.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.790
So it's also a topic
that's dear to us,

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.165
but I'd like to
get your insights

00:39:29.165 --> 00:39:32.990
on what do you think the Arabic
landscape looks like today.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.400
And how you see people
in the region responding

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.270
to your content?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.270
Are people happy?

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.270
Do they want more?

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.020
What kind of feedback are
you getting about the content

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.552
that you're producing?

00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:47.260
SARAH ABDULLAH: So
when we first started,

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.030
and we started
producing the content,

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.220
the feedback was
not always positive

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.580
because our characters
looked different.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.500
For example, Makooky, when
Makooky started he had horns.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:07.770
And my idea was these are
just satellite receptors,

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.360
and he's coming
from outer space.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.300
And we started getting
a big backlash on that.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.260
And we didn't realize that,
OK, that was a big no, no, no,

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.860
so we need to change it.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.390
Where we are today is
definitely positive.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:28.980
We're getting good feedback on
our content because we listen.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.360
We look at our comments,
we look at our reviews.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.750
We get a lot of comments on
our social media platforms.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.080
And we work a lot
with academics to see

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.600
what they would like
in form of structure

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.180
so that we structure our
content in a specific way that

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.980
is age relevant.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.490
But we also work a lot with
psychologists, nutritionists,

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.650
and emotional intelligence
coaches for children,

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.340
and we get their feedback
and we produce accordingly.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.250
So there's always a
conversation about why are we

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.390
producing this content?

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.510
Because for us, it has to
be content with purpose,

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.840
be it educational
or entertaining.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.210
And we look at the
purpose before looking

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.360
at just the piece of content.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.310
In terms of where the
Arabic content is today,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.850
I think a lot of
effort is being done.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:25.800
Everybody's upping their
game on every level, be it

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.890
the creation, the content
itself, or the production.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.460
The quality of the content
is getting better and better

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.580
because we are working with
a market that has exposure

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.650
to international content.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.480
And the quality is wonderful.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.990
And the content itself is so
studies and a lot of research

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.420
has gone behind it.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.270
Our characters are loved.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:53.880
And there are pieces that get
much more views than others,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.810
much more likeability
than others.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.660
And we realizing
more and more it's

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:03.830
everything that has more humor,
entertainment value, mistakes.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.600
Children love to watch other
children do mistakes and fall

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.650
and bump their heads.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:16.180
And they love lightness
and silliness,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.930
and then they kind
of found their way.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.180
And I think they relate to it.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.900
They don't want to see heroes,
and people, and children

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.000
who never do mistakes,
who act so right,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.270
and which often tends to
be the messaging here,

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.690
all the preaching.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.240
So we're also adapting
to that and we're

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.610
making sure that we have more of
that happening in our content.

00:42:41.165 --> 00:42:42.540
AUDIENCE: So you've
been thinking

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.630
about the character for a
while before you left your job.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.360
At what point did you feel
ready to quit and to proceed

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:49.860
full time?

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.298
How much had you actually
gotten done before you did that?

00:42:52.298 --> 00:42:53.340
SARAH ABDULLAH: Not much.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.060
I thought that I will not
get much done before I quit.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:02.420
So which is also--

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.320
There are two ways to doing it.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.040
You either start working on
your business before you quit,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.150
and once you see
something materializing,

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:16.630
you quit your job,
or you just say, OK,

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.990
the only way to move
forward with this

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.310
is if I disconnect, detached,
breakup, and start my new life.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.640
And it's a character,
and that's my character.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.100
I can't overlap.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:35.930
I don't like overlapping
because I think

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.890
the separation happened here.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.990
And the minute I was
attached to Makooky so much

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.110
I don't think I will be
doing my job very well.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.770
So walking into the office
became just another day

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:50.860
at the office.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.970
And it's not fair, and you
are kind of disconnected.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:44:01.420
So I just left, and then started
focusing really on Makooky,

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.600
but the idea was there,
but not much of it

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.670
was materialized while
I was at my old job.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.060
Plus, it was very demanding,
and the hours were very long,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.530
and the meetings were
endless because that's

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.300
what corporates love to do.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.978
So it was not easy
so I disconnected

00:44:20.978 --> 00:44:22.020
and then started Makooky.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.370
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.920
AUDIENCE: Give me a bit
about your start journey.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.190
So I'm sure you started
with a romantic idea of what

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.497
you really wanted to do, right?

00:44:34.497 --> 00:44:35.330
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yes.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.720
AUDIENCE: The idea that you are
really passionate about then.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.550
Like you said, when
you sit across people

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.250
who are investing in your
business or your customers,

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.120
you usually tend to move away
and let the market guide you.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.040
Did you have to make
such a movement?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.680
If yes, how did
that make you feel?

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:59.440
SARAH ABDULLAH: Yes, and I
had to do that type of shift.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.600
I still have to
do it, and I think

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.760
I will continue to do it because
there's the part of you that

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.920
is romantic.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.860
And I have still a lot of
ideas that probably won't

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:21.080
see the light for a while
until I convert them

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:27.750
into a valid business,
ideas, and revenue streams.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.020
But yes, you do tend to do
that, and it's not easy.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.540
It's frustrating, it's
very, very frustrating

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.340
to the creative in me, and
there's always a conflict.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.260
But then I also
understand that if I

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.350
don't make the business
side of it work,

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.410
I will never have
this creative outlet.

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.940
So I have to make it work, and
I have to do the compromises.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.260
Now, the only difference
is I pick my battles.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.120
So there are things
that I will not

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.740
do no matter what
happens because there

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:10.100
is no point in then going on if
you lose your brand identity.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.810
That, I won't compromise on.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.440
But there are things that
you give your character

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.950
a make over, you give
a touch here and there.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.910
We introduce
dialects, for example,

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.110
so now the characters
speak Saudi, Emirati,

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:29.140
Egyptian, Lebanese,
and you do that, right?

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:37.040
But it cannot just be a dream
because if I just wanted

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.220
to produce what I
love to produce,

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:44.390
then I should have just
produced it myself and continued

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:50.390
as an artist-- probably had
the blog or had a social media

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.120
platform where I upload things.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.100
But the minute it
becomes a business,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.820
it has to make business sense--

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.220
it has to.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.190
And I don't fight that
anymore because there's

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:05.120
no point fighting it and
still wanting people's money.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.850
You just can't
have it both ways.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:13.520
So it is frustrating,
but I do have two hats on

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.780
and I exchange them.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.210
And it's funny,
because I do tend

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:22.790
to do the writing at night
and the business work

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:24.390
during the day.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.080
So I have a time
split between both.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.850
I can do both.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:33.020
So at night I'm like horrible
at business, and during the day,

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.988
I'll meet my target--

00:47:36.988 --> 00:47:38.030
that's the kind of thing.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.902
It is frustrating, though,
it's very frustrating.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.550
SPEAKER 1: So I
personally really enjoyed

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.070
listening to your
story and gained

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.610
a lot of valuable insights,
which I'm sure everyone shares.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.650
So thank you so much.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.273
It was a pleasure to have you.

00:47:55.273 --> 00:47:56.940
SARAH ABDULLAH: Thank
you for having me.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.940
Thank you so much.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.194
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:48:00.194 --> 00:48:01.810
SARAH ABDULLAH:
That was so nice.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.230
Thank you so much, really.
