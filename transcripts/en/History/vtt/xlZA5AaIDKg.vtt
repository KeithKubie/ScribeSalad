00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:02.961
RICK HARRISON: Is
there something

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.003
wrong with the AC in here?

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.380
AUSTIN RUSSELL: The AC's fine.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.256
RICK HARRISON: It's
hot in here, it's warm.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.757
You having hot flashes?

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.634
I'm not having hot flashes.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:13.471
Maybe you're going
through male menopause.

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.765
There's no such thing
as male menopause.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.268
COREY HARRISON: No, there's
male menopause, dude.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.147
Male menopause is said to
be the result of gradual drop

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.481
in testosterone.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.817
OK, my testosterone is fine.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.736
I am not going
through menopause.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.196
COREY HARRISON: What are
some of the symptoms of this?

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.115
Night sweats in men?
AUSTIN RUSSELL: Yep.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.367
I don't night sweat.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.619
AUSTIN RUSSELL: That's
not what I hear.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.121
COREY HARRISON: Depression?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.706
You know, one of the
biggest signs of depression

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.666
is being angry all the time.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.585
That's definitely you.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.170
COREY HARRISON: Loss of hair.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.298
Then you might have had
menopause for like, 10 years.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.424
He might be the
(LAUGHING) longest

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.759
known case of menopause.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:55.054
[music playing]

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.514
[dog barking]

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.099
[cannon fire]

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.309
RICK HARRISON: Hey, guys,
how do you like the swords

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.435
I just bought?

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.811
All from the Napoleonic era.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.688
COREY HARRISON: I
know who Napoleon is.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:04.981
He's your hero.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.149
RICK HARRISON: Why
would he be my hero?

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.192
COREY HARRISON:
You're both short.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.651
You both want to be dictators.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.073
You guys are just haters.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.950
I mean, I could
win a Nobel Prize,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.828
and you guys would sit
around say it's not shiny.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:22.248
What could you possibly
ever win a Nobel Prize in?

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.042
I don't think I'll
ever win a Nobel Prize.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.877
I'm just using it as
an example that if I--

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.004
Who uses that as an
example for something--

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.131
if I won a Nobel Prize.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.758
That's like where your mind is.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.884
That's what you
think of yourself.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.427
This is why I--

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.012
You have considered the
fact that you could possibly

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.555
win a Nobel Prize one day.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.391
[music playing]

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.854
Oh, this kid was just
trying to sell me an old

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.940
16-millimeter movie camera.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.441
It's garbage, isn't it?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.526
RICK HARRISON: Well, sort
of, but you know there's

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.069
still cool things about film.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.737
COREY HARRISON: Like what?
Give me an example.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.197
Yeah.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.367
Well, like depth of
field, color reproduction,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.202
like really high
resolution photos.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.120
I can do more
on your cell phone

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.914
than you can with one
of those old cameras.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.666
RICK HARRISON:
What are you doing?

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.001
AUSTIN RUSSELL: I'm showing you
the resolution my phone gets.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.255
I know you look mad, (LAUGHING)
but that's how you always look.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.049
Digital is great, it's
faster, it's more convenient.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.134
But there's a few things with
film you can't reproduce.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.804
It's faster, it's more
convenient, it's better,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.181
but I'm old and I like film.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.350
COREY HARRISON: Is this one of
those things like the old man

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.602
used to go through, that just
because like you're starting

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:27.063
to see stuff from your
past become useless,

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.898
you're afraid you're
going to be useless?

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.025
You're not going to replace
me like they replaced film,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.402
are you?

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.862
[music playing]

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:38.241
[wolf whistle]

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.118
RICK HARRISON: I just
tried to buy a really

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.870
early Jim Henson vinyl puppet.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.872
AUSTIN RUSSELL: Like Jim Henson
from the Muppets and all that?

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.373
RICK HARRISON: Yeah.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.708
COREY HARRISON: You know,
if you were a Muppet,

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.167
you'd definitely be
one of the old guys

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.211
up top in the
balcony complaining

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.713
and whining about everything.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.339
RICK HARRISON: Actually,
I think if I was a Muppet,

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.675
I would be like Sam the Eagle.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:56.885
COREY HARRISON: Was
he a bald eagle?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.636
RICK HARRISON: Yes.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.930
Then that's the only thing you
have to do with Sam the Eagle.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.100
[music playing]

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.354
RICK HARRISON: On
the weekends, I

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.606
think it's just sort
of a waste of time

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.232
to watch TV for 14 hours.

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.984
COREY HARRISON: You binge
on stuff all the time, Dad.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.904
But that's me binging in my
garage working on something,

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.739
or reading a book, or something
like that, something--

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.240
What's the difference
between binge watching

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.783
TV and binge reading a book?

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.869
Well, you actually
learn something.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.078
You see, you get
more out of a book.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.788
Rick, you like to binge argue.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.874
RICK HARRISON: I don't
like to binge argue.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.542
You guys turn it into arguments.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.003
AUSTIN RUSSELL: No you like
to binge argue, for sure.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:36.090
And I bet one of your
three wives could agree.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.508
[sighing]

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.970
[laughter]
