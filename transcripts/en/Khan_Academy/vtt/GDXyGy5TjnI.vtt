00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.240
Let P, Q, R, and S be the points
on the plane with position

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.480
vectors negative 2i minus j,
4i, 3i plus 3j, and negative 3i

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480
plus 2j, respectively.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.810
The quadrilateral
PQRS must be a--

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.010
So let's just graph each
of these positions vectors,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.690
or graph the points
that they're specifying.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.170
So let me draw my coordinate
axes right over here.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.840
So this is my vertical.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.570
I can draw a
straighter line that.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.916
There you go.

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.290
That's about as
good as I can do.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.450
Let me draw the horizontal.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.600
That's a better job, I think.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.900
And then let me mark it off.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Let's see.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.060
We go as high as 4.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.012
We go up to 4i.

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:52.650
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.650
We goes as low was negative 2i.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.430
So 1, 2.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.350
Just making sure I
make it a little bit

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.308
even, because we're going
to have to figure out

00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:02.560
the shape of whatever we draw.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.940
Then we're going to go up 3.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.220
1, 2, 3.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.755
And we actually go
down 1, as well.

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:14.380
So I think that'll give us-- and
we could keep marking them off

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.600
if we wanted to, but
we don't need to,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.640
based on the positions
that have been specified.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.870
So let's draw these vectors.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.100
So let's draw vector P first.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.200
Negative 2i minus j.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.465
So negative 2i, i is
along the horizontal,

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.340
or as you can imagine,
it's the x-coordinate.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.130
So negative 2i minus j.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.170
So it is this position
vector right over here.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230
If we put it in
standard form, starting

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.330
with its base at the origin.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.460
It's that position vector.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.600
But it's specifying
that point over there,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.417
which is the coordinate
negative 2, negative 1.

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:50.500
Let me just write it down.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.880
Negative 2, negative 1.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.830
Now let's do 4i.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.480
So 4i is literally-- that's
just 4 in the x direction.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.420
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.890
There's no j component,
no vertical component.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.520
So it specifies that
position right over there,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.540
or it specifies the point 4, 0.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.510
Then we have 3i plus 3j.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.400
So 1, 2, 3.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.860
1, 2, 3.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.470
That is that point right there.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.610
The position vector
specifies that point,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.700
or specifies the point 3, 3.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.567
And then finally,
we have negative 3i.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:36.900
Let me do this in another color.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.800
Negative 3i.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.340
So 1, 2, 3, plus 2j, 1, 2.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.120
So right over there.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.460
So that is that last
position vector,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.640
and it's specifying the
point negative 3, 2.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.030
And they want to know,
what's the quadrilateral made

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.770
by these four positions?

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.980
So let's draw it.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.800
Let's connect the dots.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.280
So this is P, go to Q. It gets
us that line right over there.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.300
Then from Q to R, we're
going to go like that.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.874
And then from R to S, we're
going to go like that.

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:17.790
Actually, it's going to
go a little bit more--

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.050
it's going to go like that.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.320
Sorry, that's from R
to S. And then S to P

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.250
is going to be like that.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.695
So just eyeballing it,
it's clearly not a square.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.230
It's clearly not a rectangle.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.830
It's coming off at
different angles.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.840
It's clearly not a rhombus.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.850
A rhombus would have
all of the same sides.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.510
So a square would
be all 90 degrees,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.522
would be all the same sides and
all the angles are 90 degrees.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.480
That would be a square.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.330
It's clearly not a square.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.610
A rectangle would be all
the angles are 90 degrees,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.950
but two sides are
going to be the same,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.170
and the other two sides
are going to be the same.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.510
These do not look
like 90 degree angles.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.050
And you could try if you want.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.675
I mean, just eyeballing
it, it's pretty

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:09.470
clear these aren't
90 degree angles.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.730
But if you wanted to, you
could find the slope of this

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.100
and find the slope of that
line, and if they're not

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.579
the negative inverse
of each other,

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.537
then they're not
perpendicular, and they're not

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:19.890
coming at 90 degree angles.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.970
And so the last one
is are they a rhombus.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.210
A rhombus is a parallelogram
while the sides are the same.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.510
So a rhombus would
look like that.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.800
Clearly not a rhombus.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.320
These sides are
clearly much longer

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.880
than those sides over there.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.940
Now just from
deductive reasoning,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.580
it looks like the answer
is A. it's a parallelogram.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.570
But we can verify it.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.000
In order for this to
be a parallelogram,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.110
these two sides
have to be parallel,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.802
and these two sides
have to be parallel.

00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:52.260
Or another way to
think of it, they

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.610
would have to have
the same slope.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.420
So we could verify it.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.090
If we were taking this on
exam under time pressure,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.100
we would just cross these
out, and it looks pretty good.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.420
We would just go with A.
But let's just verify it.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.220
So what's the slope down here?

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.000
So it's change in
y over change in x.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.940
So 0 minus negative 1,
over 4 minus negative 2,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.460
or this is equal to 1
over 4 minus negative 2,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.880
is positive 6.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.330
This is 1/6.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.660
Or another way to think
about it, we ran 6

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.040
and we only rised 1.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.210
This is 1/6.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.450
Now what happens over here?

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.630
Well, it's the same thing.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.840
We're going from
negative 3 to three.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.420
So we're running 6.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.060
So we say 3 minus
negative 3 is equal to 6.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.680
And how much did we rise?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.920
We have 3 minus 2,
which is equal to 1.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.440
So this is also a slope of 1/6.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.270
So these two lines
are clearly parallel.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.220
And now let's do it
for these other two.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.160
What's the slope over here?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.110
And actually, you could
just do rise over run.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.960
So that's exactly what
we were doing before,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.876
but just to give you the
taste for everything.

00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:07.420
So we ran, to go
from here to here,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.070
we have to move to the right 1.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.540
So we run 1.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.280
And how much do we rise?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.140
Well, we had to go down 3.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.220
So it's negative 3.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.520
So the slope here is negative 3.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.710
And what about here?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.340
To go from this point to this
point, we went to the right 1.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.890
So we ran 1.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.090
And we had to go
down-- we started at 2,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.720
and we ended up at negative 1.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.060
We had to go down 3.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.690
So the slope here
is also negative 3.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.240
So these lines
are also parallel.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.440
So we're definitely dealing
with a parallelogram, which

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.924
is neither a rhombus
nor a rectangle.
