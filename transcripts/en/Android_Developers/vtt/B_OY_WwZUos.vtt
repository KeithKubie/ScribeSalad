FLORIAN GSCHWANDTNER:
I grew up on a farm.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.390
It was a very cool
childhood, because you're

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.400
growing up next to your
dad, working on the fields.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.920
One thing what I really
learned is, what does work

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.290
all day long actually mean?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.300
This is where, for
me, my heart to become

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660
an entrepeneur somehow started.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.480
Just a few years ago,
me and my co-founders

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.530
started almost with nothing.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.910
Now having more than 200
employees and more than 220

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.300
million downloads.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.300
And being part of Adidas,
this is incredible.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
NINETTE GIARDINA: I was 40 years
old when I started running,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.690
and it all started
with a challenge.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.320
I signed up Alexis, my
daughter, for a 10k.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080
And I decided to
sign up for a 5k

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.140
to show her that I support
her, and that she's not going

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.820
to be the only one running.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.770
Alexis didn't think
that I can do it.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
She said, like you're going to
get off the couch and run a 5k.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.760
She told me to use Runtastic,
and I took the challenge,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.170
and I ran the whole 5k.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.190
Since I've started running, I've
been doing all kinds of races.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.140
I am currently training
for my second marathon.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.470
What running has taught me is
that I can achieve so much.

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:17.300
BRETT KOPF: I was
diagnosed with a bunch

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.810
of learning
disabilities, and I spent

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.950
two years struggling in school.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.200
I had this teacher
named Ms. Whitefield

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.377
who totally changed my life.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:26.210
Hey, Ms. Whitefield!

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.330
The whole ethos of Remind
was built around the thought

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.100
that if we could help give the
Ms. Whitefields of the world

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.240
superpowers and make
them more efficient,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.860
it could have an enormous
impact on the education system.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.360
So I would spend
my time speaking

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.580
to hundreds of teachers
across the country

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.760
while my brother was locked in
a room learning how to code.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.680
Today, Remind has over 23
million active teachers,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560
students, and
parents in over 90%

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.110
of US K-12 school districts.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.720
We would have never been
able to reach those customers

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.550
if Google Play did not exist.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.134

TINA LEMIRE: One of
my students, Jason--

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.220
he struggled, especially with
turning things in on time.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.300
One day, he came to me--

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180
JASON MURRAY: And then
I was like, I bet you

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.600
that if I do all my
work and pass the test,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.790
you'll throw us a party.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.350
I kept receiving
messages from Ms. Lemire

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.270
and my other classmates to
help me and motivate me.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.650
TINA LEMIRE: As
a result, I lost.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.150
They got to have
an ice cream party.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.691
It was probably some
of the best work

00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:25.090
that I've ever seen him produce.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.457

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.190
PRANSHU PATNI: Over
30 million users

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.640
are currently using the app.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.570
We're bigger than any
university or school that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.790
has existed for ages in India.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.190
What inspires us as a
team and what motivates us

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.740
the most is when
we hear users talk

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.080
about how learning
English with the app

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.780
has impacted them in
such a positive way.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.240
That truly empowers
us to keep going

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.110
and to make a bigger impact.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.520
SIDIQUE MALIK: When I
retired from my job,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820
I decided to do
something useful.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.640
That's why I joined
Hello English.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
I believe that there are
so many kids around us--

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.550
they want to learn English.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.790
Joining Hello English
gave me enough confidence

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
to go to my hometown and
teach the poor and needy.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.740
Hello, children.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.326
How are you?

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:17.896
What is your name?

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.020
SPEAKER 1: I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.065
SIDIQUE MALIK: Very good.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.130
SPEAKER 2: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.570
SIDIQUE MALIK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.323
English is for higher education.

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:31.340
The key for a better life.

ODED BEN DOV: I started
Sesame about five years ago.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.670
At the time, I was
doing computer vision

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.300
and gesture technology.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.000
And I got on TV to
demonstrate a game

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.281
I developed that was
controlled using head gestures.

00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.780
And I got a phone
call the next day,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.810
and the guy said, hi, I can't
can move my hands or legs.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.376
Can you make me a
smartphone I could use?

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:55.834
GIORA LIVNE: He
came, looked at me,

00:03:55.834 --> 00:04:00.009
and said, well, I
have a new company.

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.960
I told him that this
will be much better

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.900
to do good for the whole world.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.980
And he was convinced.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.160
ODED BEN DOV: It really
put a new perspective

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.850
on what technology
can accomplish

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.270
and how it can change lives.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.740
And the Android operating
system's open nature

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.050
really allowed me to
innovate beyond what

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.204
I could imagine at first.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.530
Every successful user
is not just a number.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.420
It's a whole life.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.860
It's a whole story.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.670
And we take those with us,
and those propel us forward

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.810
to keep doing what we do.
