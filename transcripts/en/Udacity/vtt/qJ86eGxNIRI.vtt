00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The best answer is the third one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It definitely raises some concern that the time to factor

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is much less than what was estimated here

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but maybe that just wasn't a very good estimate to begin with.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It doesn't mean that RSA is fundamentally broken.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we make our keys large enough,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
unless we understand more about the cost effector, maybe that's still good enough.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we'll talk about that next.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It is the case that the message could be decrypted.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Once you have these factors, it's easy to compute d.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The actual message was "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage."
