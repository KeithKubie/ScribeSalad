00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this unit, we look at models with flows between different compartments.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The obvious use was in epidemiology where we had susceptible persons

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who became ill and eventually recovered, but what about economy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Money may flow from one account to the other or goods may flow from one country to the other.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In chemistry, you may have several types of molecules

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that combined to form other types of molecules.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In biology, the members of a species are born young, become adolescent, and then mature.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the next unit, we are going to look at examples from biology, in particular, to study equilibria

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that is situations in which one falls is exactly balance by another falls.
