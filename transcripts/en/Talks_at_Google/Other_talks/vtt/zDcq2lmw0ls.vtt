00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; Hey, everyone.
Welcome to today's Authors at Google talk.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.710
I'm pleased to introduce Gordon Bell and Jim
Gemmell.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.010
They're the authors of Total Recall, which
is coming out this week I believe -- last

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.050
week -- Oh, congratulations.
It details their decade-long experiment with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.610
recording as many waking moments of Gordon's
life as possible.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.200
This is happening at Microsoft Research.
It's called "My Life Bits".

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.800
And we're looking forward to having them tell
us more.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.260
So, please join me in welcoming Gordon Bell
and Jim Gemmell.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.410
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:48.030
Gordon Bell: I'm losing my mind and so is
everybody else.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.010
As you age, it's a phenomena of just getting
a little bit older.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.300
And we use things like this to remember where
you parked or anything you can -- lists, grocery

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.939
lists, whatever, are ways of dealing with
this.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.859
What we're speculating is, What if you could
remember everything?

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.289
And, What are the tools that you need to do
that?

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.590
So it's really, everything you've ever read,
everything you've ever seen, and everything

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.479
you've ever heard.
So that really became the mantra of the project

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.560
that we did.
This was a quote by Bill Gates in the 1995

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.880
book that he wrote.
And then, as we got into the project, we found

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.459
there's just much more to just beyond 'what
you heard and seen', but it was all of the

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:52.600
ambience around you -- that is everything
from, especially location, on through your

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.049
total environment.
And centers are everywhere.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.590
So if you want, you can have total recall
when you have all of that and can get access

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.049
to it.
And as we all recall, there are three reasons

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.929
 -- or three technologies -- that are driving
this.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.430
One is simply the ability -- we can record
it.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.780
There are devices out there -- the digital
camera probably being the most important bit

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.390
 -- that has caused everybody to need to do
it.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.260
In addition, there are more and more devices
all of the time being put on us.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.920
And including especially all of the cameras,
the various cameras, particularly the new

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.800
Apple nano iPhone.
And then, storage -- the second component

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.280
 -- namely, that it's abundant and cheap.
You know, it's enabling our companies to do

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.960
the amazing things that we can do by being
able to store everything.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.460
And then, finally, as you guys know, the issue
is You've got to be able to get it back.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.270
So, search is a key part of being able to
deal with the recall.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.180
So we believe total recall is inevitable.
And Jim is going to talk about some of the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.040
details.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:31.960
Jim Gemmell: Thanks, Gordon.
So we do believe total recall is inevitable.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.340
And in the book, we're talking about not just
our experience with My Life Bits, but about

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.870
what's possible.
And we try to write it in a way accessible

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.380
to the layperson and get the general public
excited about what this could mean for their

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.790
lives.
And also to get people to see the business

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.820
opportunities here -- that there's going to
be a building demand in the general public

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.210
to do something with all this data I'm churning
out -- to take advantage of it.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.710
So Total Recall starts today.
It's already taking off.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.600
And we're going to see within ten years, it's
should be full-blown, something that's already

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.850
shaking our society.
Now, to be clear what we're not talking about

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.930
is, 'Life Blogging.' Of course, there's people
out there like the Jennycam and all these

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.250
different sites where people are putting their
whole life on the web.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.440
And, if you like doing that, go ahead.
We think it's kind of crazy -- risky.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.840
We don't do it.
What we're more like is these diaries with

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.060
the locks on them.
It's my stuff.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.910
I want to keep it.
I want to keep it safe.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.960
It's for my benefit.
So let me tell you a little bit about our

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.870
experience and how we got into this.
It started in 1999.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.720
We were actually working on telepresence,
and Gordon, wanting to be a good teleworker

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.180
said, "I can't drag my filing cabinets around
with me everywhere.”

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.620
So he started scanning all his paper.
And then we said, "Well, why just paper?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.270
What if you digitize everything you possibly
could and put it on your hard drive?”

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.590
At the time -- it was about 2001 by now -- and
we were saying, "Gee.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.280
We'll all have terabytes by about 2007.
What could we stick on those things?”

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.490
And we said, "Well, we could keep all our
e-mail and we could record every web page

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.530
we see and we could scan a bunch of paper
every day and roll audio for eight hours and

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:29.880
take ten photos and it would take us five
years to fill up our 80-gig drives, and by

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.560
then, we'll have terabyte drives that will
last us another 65 years.”

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.050
So at that point, we were like, "Wow! A whole
life on a terabyte."

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.540
Now, mind you, since then, our expectations
have gone way up.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.050
So ten photos a day isn't enough anymore,
nor is that amount of audio and so on.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.810
But, we call this now "20th century resolution.”
So this would have impressed anybody in the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.390
20th century if they actually had this much
of their life -- and you could put that on

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.419
a terabyte.
So off goes Gordon to become IM data, pulling

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.199
paintings and posters down off the walls,
scanning metals which turn out to go really

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.011
nice on a scanner instead of trying to get
the lighting just so with a camera.

00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:16.520
Old home videos, notebooks.
Here's the memo proposing the VAX architecture,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.090
all kinds of goodies go into that big collection.
And it ends up with a whole bunch of stuff.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.400
So if we count the number of items: There's
a lot of e-mails, there's a lot of pictures,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.320
there's a lot of web pages.
But if you go by space, video, audio, and

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.210
pictures dominate.
And relatively speaking, Gordon doesn't even

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.050
have that much video.
So really, the picture we ended up with is,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.090
In the future it's, "We've got all our video.”
And, "Oh yeah, we've got that little blip

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.900
of the other stuff.”
You know, probably audio and pictures are

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.080
in the story there too, but the dominance
of media there.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.880
So now he's got it.
What can he do with it?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.810
Can you ever find anything? Can you organize
anything?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.620
Once you find it, would you know what it is?
Gordon pulled up some photos, and he goes,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.210
"Wow. Great picture. I have no idea what that's
a picture of.”

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.889
And if you found it once, could you find it
again?

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.880
So eventually, Gordon wanders into my office
grumbling,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.930
"Agh, it's all just a bunch of bits. I can't
do anything with this.”

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:30.040
Our boss, Jim Gray, asked us, "Have you guys
invented the 'write once/read never' memory?”

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.090
So with encouragement like that, I got involved
and started building a system, putting everything

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.851
in a database.
And started to build up a suite of applications

00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:44.330
that would record everything we could, beginning
with sucking in our files, having somewhere

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:51.110
to search and browse, adding comments with
text or by speaking, capturing a copy of every

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.330
web page we see -- not just the URL, but the
actual page -- recording our instant messenger

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.669
chats, sucking in our e-mails, recording telephone.
Gordon's office was set up to say, "Recording."

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:06.270
That's the first thing you hear when you call,
so the California law is satisfied and you

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.169
can opt out and hang up if you want.
We played with recording TV and radio.

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:15.570
In the end, we thought, It's not so interesting
to keep copies of all the shows, because we

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.630
believe everything will be on-demand eventually.
But what is interesting is to keep a log of

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.400
what you're watching and when you watched
it.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.500
Screensavers are perhaps the killer ap, once
you have so much stuff you can't even remember

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.300
you have it all to go look for it.
And so, something needs to just bring it up

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.690
by random and let you enjoy the stuff.
And when it's there, you have to capture the

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.880
moment and be able to rate things and comment
on them.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.700
GPS, Sensecam -- we'll talk about in a moment
 -- and finally "gooey logging" where we were

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.750
recording everything that goes on, on our
desktops and what we're doing with our PCs.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.940
I'm wearing a Sensecam here.
This is invented by Lyndsay Williams who used

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.620
to be in our Cambridge lab.
And what it is, is a camera that's designed

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.760
to take pictures automatically at a quote/unquote
"good time.”

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.149
So it has a light-level sensor and if I walk
out this room to outdoors in the sunshine,

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.770
it'll notice the light levels change -- let's
say, "Something's different.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.160
Let's take a picture of it.”
It has a passive, infrared sensor like a burglar

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
alarm.
And so, if it detects a warm body, it says,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.000
"Oh, there's a person in front of you.
Take a picture.”

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.460
It has accelerometers, so if it's jiggling
around, it'll say, "Let's wait to take that

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.230
picture so I don't get a blurry one.”
Here's Gordon armed with Sensecam and Voice

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:35.660
Recorder, his standard issue equipment.
And here's putting things together in time-lapse

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.160
video of a friend riding around in Cambridge,
England.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.690
You see the -- condense your day, and see
a quick overview of what you were doing.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.630
Great for vacations.
The other thing that happens is, when you

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.700
automatically capture, you get moments that
you'd never otherwise capture.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.860
I have here -- these are some of my favorite
Sensecam moments.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.450
The top is a sequence of having lunch with
Peter Hart, who heads the Ricoh Innovations.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.420
And he has these very vivid gestures and so
on.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.620
There's no way I could kind of capture that
feeling of having lunch with Peter apart from

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.041
doing something like this.
Or on the right, I have the moment that I

00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:20.140
first ever met Ben Shneiderman, the user interface
guru.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.240
And that's him walking up and reaching out
to shake my hand.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.510
And I would never have pulled the camera out
and snapped that, but I've got it.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.440
And a number of other special moments.
One is bumping into a colleague by accident

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.320
at a hotel check-in desk.
There's a fellow named Cathal Gurrin at Dublin

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.500
City University, who decided to wear a Sensecam
constantly for a year, you know, every waking

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.830
moment.
He thought, "This would be a crazy experiment.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.750
And when it's all over, I want to throw that
thing away.”

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.390
But, actually, when the year ended, he wouldn't
give it back.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.760
And he's still wearing it today.
I think he had about 800,000 photos in the

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.300
first year and he's up to several million
by now.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:07.630
But anyhow, Cathal said to me that he captured
the moment where he first met his girlfriend.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.290
But, of course, he didn't know that she would
become his girlfriend.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.100
So these are the kind of moments we get when
we have automatic capture.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.070
And instead of being the typical story of,
you know, the parent takes a lot of photos

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.890
of the first child, and then a little less
on the second child, and it goes down -- because

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.680
you actually want to live -- you don't want
to just be the cameraman.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.580
And then the fourth child has to go to therapy
for, "Why didn't Daddy love me?”

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.110
This way, you get to capture it and enjoy
what you're doing.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.690
So capturing where you walk, recording your
meetings.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.662
This is tracking what's going on, on a PC
 -- so showing hour by hour how much is the

00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:47.450
PC usage and what are the top programs being
used, the files being accessed.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.649
So, in the end, My Life Bits isn't a product.
It's just a proof of concept.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:55.070
And in fact, it's a suite of applications,
as I explained.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:00.250
And we also started a larger research community
with the CARP-A research group and we funded

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.510
14 universities and gave them our software
and Sensecams.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.149
And they did a bunch of wonderful work and
came up with all kinds of things we could

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:10.230
have never thought of.
I like to boast on their work a bit, and I'll

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.680
show a bit of it later on.
But we got enough of a picture to say,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.670
"Look. We see where we're headed here, and
we know that we really want it.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.330
We think it's very compelling.”
So now, I want to tell you some of the benefits

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.690
of Total Recall.
I don't have time to get into all of them,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.399
but let me do a few.
I'll talk about memory and health and life

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.769
and afterlife.
And here -- this picture is just to give you

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:40.019
a flavor of one thing which is, Total Recall
gets rid of clutter.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:44.370
That was one thing we didn't quite appreciate
until after you scan stuff and toss it out,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.160
it's like, "Wow.
I had a huge filing cabinet I could get rid

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.050
of.”
And all this junk and stuff on your shelves

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.930
says good-bye.
So it's a very liberating kind of feeling.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:01.630
Memory. Human memory has all kinds of problems
 -- from losing memories over time, assigning

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:11.320
memories to the wrong source, bias, people
 -- this is why they find problems with witnesses

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.320
in court cases.
They end up reciting things they read in the

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.950
newspaper and believing that that's what they
saw.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.260
Absentmindedness. You actually do remember
it, but you just didn't remember it when you

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.870
really needed to remember it.
And you get home from the grocery store and

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.810
you're kicking yourself that, yet again, you
did not buy the kitty litter, or whatever.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.399
And it's on the tip of your tongue; you can't
bring it back.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.680
Those are just some examples of the problems
of human memory.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:40.350
But of course, our e-memories are cold, hard,
objective.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.209
They never get bored.
They record all the tedium down to the last

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:49.279
drop.
And I just want to show you a few interfaces

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:52.010
of the feeling of having more of your memory
online.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.970
This is an interface done by Greg Smith in
a _______ lab.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.779
And saying, Okay, here's all Gordon's stuff.
And he wants to look at "What do I have for

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:04.320
last year?”
So it's going to re-factor this to show what's

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.000
available in the past year.
Let's say, "Well, okay.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.870
What do I have from Florida of last year?”
Let's drill in on location and narrow down

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.070
to Florida.
Now you see, "Oh, yeah.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.329
There's the stuff from Florida of last year.
But maybe I don't want just last year.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:27.040
Well, what's everything for Florida?”
Let's drop that restriction.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.029
And I had to make this small for the little
video capture I wanted to have it on, but

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:39.029
here's the same interface on 18 LCD panels.
And this is, I think, where we're headed.

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:44.720
You know, large displays, and seeing the vista
of our life laid out and being able to browse

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.570
it and gain insights and see patterns in ways
we never have before, and just enjoy it.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.250
You know, when this is your -- it's hard for
me to describe.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.230
A lot of the things that we do, when it's
not your stuff, you go, "Oh, that's kind of

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.010
interesting.”
I remember one prototype I came in with and

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.490
I went, "This is amazing.
Look! It's automatically detecting such and

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.810
such," and the guy in the next office goes,
"Eh, big deal.”

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.510
And then he did it on his stuff, and he comes
running back into my -- "Wow! That's really

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:14.450
cool!" you know, when it's his stuff.
And when that's your life, it's amazing.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.040
You know, here's another example of working
with memory.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.750
I had an instance where there'd been an e-mail
discussion about storage, and I remember that

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.920
that guy said that really cool thing.
I want to look that up.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.910
So I wasn't too good on search terms, but
doing a search for 'storage' got me down to

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.390
only 5500 e-mails.
But by looking at the attributes that we had,

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.730
looking at the Who sent the mail?
And having it sorted by frequency, I was able

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.019
to spot a name that I recognized and get to
it.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:52.130
Or if you're recording -- you're logging your
phone calls and you know what's going on with

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.180
your phone calls -- now, let's say Gordon
has a discussion with his real estate agent

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.720
while he's selling his house, and she says,
"Look at this comparable property.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.200
Bring up this web page.”
And he looks at it and they talk about it

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.870
and he hangs up.
And now a week passes, two weeks, three weeks

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.870
pass, and he says, "Oh, I want to go back
and check out that comparable property again.”

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.889
What's he going to search for?
'House'? 'Real estate'?

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:17.731
He'll get all these different pages he looked
at.

00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:23.529
But instead, he starts with, "Well, I know
who my real estate agent is, and Let's take

00:16:23.529 --> 00:16:27.490
the phone call with her and say, What happened
at the same time as that phone call?"

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.761
And then, when he does that, not too much
actually happened during the phone call.

00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:35.389
And we have a copy of the page, which probably
isn't on the web anymore because the house

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:39.529
is already sold, but we can get back to it.
So by bringing all these different things

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:46.690
together from our life, we're able to hop
from item to item, use correlations between

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.140
them to start with your little memory hook
and get to what you need to find.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.950
Now, let's talk about health and how Total
Recall will impact health.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.290
I visited Gordon at the hospital.
He was just recovering from bypass surgery.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.069
The doctor came into the room and said, "Oh,
let's check you out.”

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.481
And he opened up his robe and looked at his
chest, and he says, "Yeah.

00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:12.250
Oh, it's looking a bit better, I think.
All right. Well, looks good.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.929
You should be able to get out this weekend.”
And he leaves the room.

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:18.500
I said, "What's that all about?”
Gordon says, "Well, I want to go home this

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.860
weekend.
It's my birthday.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.069
But they're worried that this rash on my chest
is a sign of infection.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:27.030
And they won't let me out if it's not getting
better.”

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.429
I said, "Oh, well, it's good that it's getting
better then.”

00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:32.700
He says, "No, it's not getting better.”
I said, "Well, how do you know that?”

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.530
He says, "Well, because I've got my digital
camera out, been taking a picture of it every

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.890
day.
And so, I know that, in fact, it's not getting

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.150
better at all, but the doctor believes it's
getting better, so that's good enough.”

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.750
And so, Gordon actually got to go home that
weekend and fortunately, it didn't turn out

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.559
to be a scary infection.
But this is -- the nature of our health -- so

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:54.660
much of it is subjective right now or depends
on our memory.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.941
"When did he start feeling crummy?”
"Oh, I think it looks a bit better." or

00:17:57.941 --> 00:18:01.700
"How long have you had this fever? I don't
know, maybe since Tuesday.”

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:08.030
We want to change all that.
Starting with our health records -- even though

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.400
patients' charts are available nearly all
the time, most visits have problems with missing

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.190
information.
RAND thinks the U.S. could save 77 billion

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.520
each year from adopting electronic health
records.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.160
And there's estimates that it could also save
as many as 100,000 lives every year.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.299
Clearly, our paper-based records aren't cutting
it right now.

00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:31.610
We believe in health records "By the individual/For
the individual.”

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.160
They're yours; you should have them.
The problem is just bringing them all together,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.750
because some are at the G.P., some are at
the hospital, some are at the specialist's,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.460
some are at the lab -- they're all over the
place.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.830
Let's bring them all into one place where
we can take advantage of them.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:49.900
And Gordon's actually done this -- gone and
collected all his records and digitized them

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:55.750
and has them available.
This is an interface from University of Pittsburg

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.720
called My Health Bits, looking at what it
would be like to try and have something to

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.790
manage all that yourself.
Then, let's go a step further.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.000
Besides the records that already exist, let's
start keeping new records.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.720
Philips is already selling these devices that
are wirelessly or wired transmitting data

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.580
to a hub that can forward it up to the web
and to your doctor or wherever you want it

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.091
to go.
So there's a scale; there's a blood pressure

00:19:23.091 --> 00:19:28.070
cuff.
The lady in the picture there has a oxygen

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:33.110
level -- oximeter, I think they call it -- on
her finger to check the blood oxygen level.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.669
And there's a glucose meter there, I think
 -- is one of those.

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:41.159
So these are already on the market.
Gordon and I are both wearing these Bodybuggs

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:45.070
 -- so now we're talking about wearables where
you're tracking the calories that you burn

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.110
and the number of steps that you take, and
there's lots of fitness products along that

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.910
line.
We'll see more and more wearables tracking

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.760
more and more values.
And eventually, we'll get into "smart materials"

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.830
where it's just in our clothing, in our shoes,
in our shirts.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:04.780
And it'll just be -- I saw some other work,
also at Dublin City University, with the fabrics

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:10.520
that are checking the pH in your sweat and
noting when you're dehydrated, or even checking

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:16.429
on your posture through your shirt.
Eventually, we reach the final frontier here

00:20:16.429 --> 00:20:23.169
of health sensing, which is in-body.
You know, swallowing cameras, having wireless

00:20:23.169 --> 00:20:28.070
pressure sensors in your aneurysm sac that
are wirelessly telling what the pressure is

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.210
to the outside.
Eventually, we'll have things crawling around

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.420
in our bloodstreams and reporting on how things
are looking.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.150
And what's the payoff?
Well, we talked about this -- the doctor saying,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.540
"When did he start feeling this way?”
Instead of me saying, "Gee, I'm not really

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.799
sure.”
No, I want to walk in, "Here's the log of

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:46.340
my blood pressure.
Here's the graph of my temperature.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:52.860
Here's the heart data." Incentives.
It turns out there's a big problem with people

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:58.460
taking medications -- except painkillers,
which have their own potent motivator.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.340
But everything else, people are pretty bad
at.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.660
But it turns out there's a number study showing
it can be really helpful if you can see, you

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.610
know, some value -- your blood pressure actually
going down as you're taking your medication.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.730
Then you're more likely to take your medication.
It can help out.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.241
We could do data mining on this and discover
correlations.

00:21:17.241 --> 00:21:20.090
And find out the things that you're doing
that tend to lead to being sick.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:26.210
Or we could have even proactive advice -- something
kicking in and saying, "Hey, you know what?

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.590
You haven't been getting enough sleep.
You better take some extra vitamin C.”

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.590
Or whatever your electronic nurse wants to
advise you.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:38.270
And if we anonymize some of this data, we
can start getting involved in studies on a

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:43.500
scale hard to imagine before.
I spoke with someone at Xerox Park yesterday

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.470
who had done some early work at expert systems
taking data and mining it and came up with

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.110
publishable medical results showing drug side
effects.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.500
And he said, "Wow! This would be incredible,
you know?

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.299
It was so expensive and hard for us to even
study a few thousand people.

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:05.720
With this, if people felt safe with the steps
to anonymize, we could do studies much faster,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:13.780
much larger, and mine things for new results.”
Let's talk now about your every day life and

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.179
your afterlife.
What do e-memories do for that?

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:21.820
I overheard a woman in a restaurant -- an
older lady -- saying, "I'm going to give you

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.490
my cell phone number.
You can't leave messages on my home phone,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.990
because I've saved too many from my grandson.”
And she just loaded up the old home answering

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.419
machine and that was it.
And what does she want?

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:36.530
Not just the transcript of what her grandson
said.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.480
She wants to hear his voice.
It's very precious to her.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.720
And there's a real special quality to the
kind of media that people are going to want

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.630
to collect -- much richer story telling that
we get from it.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:55.070
And there's another effect that we hadn't
quite realized is that, by digitizing everything

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.941
 -- while most of my physical mementos used
to sit in the attic or in a shoebox somewhere,

00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:03.520
or maybe even in a really nice photo album,
but it's tucked away and it only comes out

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.160
every few years, now they're on screensavers
and of course, we're getting more and more

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.880
of these little photo stand kind of displays
that can sit on your end table and more and

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.179
more displays everywhere.
And now, we're just enjoying them more.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:21.920
They come out of the dust and onto our living
rooms.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.340
Here's a shot -- a timeline -- of pictures
of Gordon's son.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.500
And down at the bottom is the distribution
in time of the photos, which didn't say anything

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.460
to me, but Gordon said, "Oh, yeah.
I see.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.970
Well, they drop off here because Brigham went
to college then.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.150
And then, there's a few spikes -- those are
family events.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.200
And at the end, there's another burst and
that's when the grandkids arrived.”

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.020
So to Gordon, even the data distribution tells
a story.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:54.490
Of course, your location tells a story.
Here's where I went on a trip to Los Angeles

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.610
with my kids, and I was taking my boys to
some hockey games.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:06.070
And here's the GPS of everywhere I went.
And the photos that I took.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:13.890
And then, I could re-segment by time and I
could pick a particular trip here and animate

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:20.160
driving back up to the hotel.
And I got home and saw this -- once I sucked

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:27.400
into the PC -- and I had my calendar also
with all the games we were going to, and I

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.400
went, "Wow.
I have enough here.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.110
If someone could just package this up, I could
just send it to my mom, and she'd have the

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.140
story of what the grandkids did this weekend,
which she's dying to hear, but I would never

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.110
do the work to do.”
So we got an intern in doing automatic blogging

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:47.011
based on this and did some cool versions of
automatically telling the stories of your

00:24:47.011 --> 00:24:50.690
little episodes in your life.
Going even further, if you're wearing one

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.480
of these Sensecams, you easily get several
thousand photos a day.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.830
How do you tell that story?
Dublin City University has a wonderful prototype

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:05.799
of this of working on event segmentation of
those images and then looking for faces trying

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:10.710
to find similar faces, looking at what people
are wearing and How does that change? Looking

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.251
at changes in the accelerometer to get an
idea of activity changes, looking at your

00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:19.000
GPS and where you are.
And then, based on that, they can say, "Well,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.320
you're in the usual place with the usual kind
of faces and clothing, you know.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.900
No big deal." Or else they can tell, "You're
doing something out of the ordinary.”

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:33.020
And so, then, they bring up this 'visual diary',
as they call it, that makes the "out of the

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.360
ordinary" things -- more novel things -- big.
And shrinks down the stuff that's likely boring

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.059
and you've done it a zillion times.
And in there is, If you mouse over it, you

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:46.441
see that stop motion/playback of your life.
So automatic summarization, telling the story

00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:51.240
of your day just based on shooting thousands
of photos as you go.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.250
In the end, once we have all this stuff, what
do we pass on to the next generation?

00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:02.380
Ed Feigenbaum was called the "Father of expert
systems.”

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.530
I got to have lunch with him one day, and
he drew this on a napkin -- he said, "Here's

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.530
how we thought things would be when we started
working on expert systems.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.410
We have this logic module, we have this data
module, and, you know, we go to town.”

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.700
But he said, "Years and years of experience
showed us that the picture looks more like

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.760
this: Lots and lots and lots of data and really
less logic as you often better.”

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:31.230
Well, when we get to e-memories, we got lots
and lots and lots of data to bring you.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.669
You know, based on just what Einstein left
behind, Carnegie Mellon did an interactive

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:39.990
system where you could ask Einstein questions.
And if it was stuff published about him, he

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:48.220
could virtually answer you.
MyCyberTwin.com went through the Simpsons

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.250
transcripts and allow you to chat with Bart
Simpson.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.230
And sounds a lot like Bart.
And when you say, "Do you have a pet?”

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.500
He can say, "Who needs a pet when I have Homer?”
And actually, by that, he does actually answer

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.620
who his dog is.
Now, but this data is trivial compared to

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.330
what Gordon's recording is like.
And actually, what Gordon's got -- he's missed

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.380
most of his life already.
When we look at what the next generation will

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.230
have -- we'll have an incredible corpus of
their usual phrases, what happened to them.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:24.490
We'll be able to really use their kind of
expressions and simulate a person to have

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:31.990
a little taste of digital immortality.
Total Recall will be a revolution.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:37.059
It's going to shake up our society.
Just like previous things that we call revolutions,

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:42.929
like the Industrial Revolution or the PC Revolution.
It's going to mean we live differently, and

00:27:42.929 --> 00:27:45.919
we're going to have to deal with it.
We see that some of it we think there's problems.

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:49.110
There will be bugs to be fixed.
And then, there's some things that are just

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:54.360
going to be changes.
Just like the fact that we have vastly greater

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.180
transportation today means we can get fresh
fruit from the other side of the world.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.539
Things are just different.
Or that we can commute long distance in cars.

00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:09.789
One bug that we're going to have to deal with
is 'data decay', where -- here's a little

00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:14.760
flight of fancy by Gordon of Data writing
to its application, "Dear Appy, I thought

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.640
we had a commitment.
You were going to support me forever, but

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.950
now you've abandoned me.
Where are you?”

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.570
You know? You had this wonderful format and
you stored something in it and now there's

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:31.049
no ap to play it back in anymore.
I think there's going to be -- you know, another

00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:34.900
thing is outright data loss.
So backup and replication is going to become

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.990
a service that's much more mainstream than
it even is today and in much more demand.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:45.580
And that, coupled with that will be a service
to roll forward formats, to keep them current,

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.529
or to warn people, "You're in a kind of fringe
format.

00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:50.929
That's risky.
There's only, you know, ten of you in the

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:53.559
world using that thing.
It might be gone pretty easily.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:29:00.110
Gordon and I put the ACM'97, 50th anniversary
meeting on the web.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.490
And it didn't take that many years before
we got an e-mail saying, "I can't play one

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.010
of the videos.”
So I contacted the Window's media team.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.860
I said, "Guys, c'mon.
Let's get this Kodak posted.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.210
We've got to play this video.”
A few days later, they replied and said, "Well,

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.650
we had a license to play that.
The company that owned the license went bankrupt;

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.610
it's in receivership.
There's no one to go to, to get a new license.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.520
And for us to release the Kodak would be breaking
the law.”

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.750
So, I mean, there's a totally dead format.
So we have to watch out for that.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.049
How about privacy?
What will this do to our privacy?

00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:39.929
We're going to have to develop etiquette in
our society about, When is it acceptable to

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:43.590
record each other?
And laws that deal with that even.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:49.840
But already, we have to grapple with privacy.
Already you may be posted on DontDateHimGirl.com

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.279
with warnings of what a jerk you are.
Or of course, we all know about embarrassing

00:29:53.279 --> 00:30:00.110
videos on YouTube and pictures and whatnot.
Steve Mann does a funny experiment where he

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:04.150
and a bunch of people wear these T-shirts
that say, "For your protection, you may be

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.919
recorded and all criminal acts prosecuted.”
To try to kind of echo the words we see on

00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:11.620
surveillance cams.
And they wander around with these things and

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.380
watch people in stores and various museums
and various places panic.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.481
And they get a big kick out of that.
And it turns out you don't even need to have

00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:25.470
a camera to make people upset, because it's
the mere possibility that you might be recorded

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.039
that's going to change your behavior or make
you worry.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:33.470
And in a way, we're already there.
Already recording is so miniaturized that

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.799
you might be recorded and you don't even know
it.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:39.740
And so, some of this isn't so much even what
we're advocating people do.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.880
You know, we're not telling you, you ought
to record video and audio 24/7.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.669
We're telling you that more and more e-memories
will have more and more benefits.

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:52.330
But even without us saying anything -- even
if the book didn't exist, we weren't advocating

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.000
anything, there's already -- we're hitting
a point where society has to grapple with,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.029
What does it mean that I might be recorded?
Then there's the legal side of things.

00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:08.529
Will my e-memories testify against me?
So one idea is, "Maybe I could just get some

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:12.080
of them wrong on purpose.
If I put in some junk in there that's false

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.880
then that won't be any good in court." Some
of the people at USC were working on that

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.492
idea but then some lawyers had told them,
"No, that's not going to cut it.”

00:31:21.492 --> 00:31:25.010
Could we change the law?
We think the law probably should change.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:30.380
There's been some interesting rulings lately.
One judge said that a man didn't have to give

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:37.120
an encryption key to the cops.
He said, "No. That's testifying against himself.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.990
More like that.”
So that's a very interesting ruling, and we'll

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:44.730
see how that holds up.
In another case, a judge ruled that, "Well,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.159
okay.
If you do have to hand it over, the standards

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:50.720
should be higher.
It should be more like having a strip search

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.980
than just having to hand over some papers."
So recognizing, This is more intimate than

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.100
kind of maybe your typical paperwork.
And we think really, it's an extension of

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.850
your brain, and it should be given that kind
of legal protection.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.559
I'd like to put all my memories in a Swiss
databank.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:11.049
So just like a Swiss bank hides money, and
it's plausibly deniable, and no one knows

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:13.649
it's there.
That's where I want to stash all my memories.

00:32:13.649 --> 00:32:17.750
I want someone to store it for me.
I'd like to have a second password, which

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:23.179
is the "I'm compromised" password, where I
log in and it goes off and it shreds all the

00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:30.950
nasty stuff.
So, we were doing all this recording and I've

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.880
been doing quite a lot of it myself too.
And I thought, "Well, this is kind of fun.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.620
It's kind of a novelty.”
And in particular recording every web page

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.960
that I visited.
And then, here's a timeline of some of my

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.149
web pages from 2003 -- I think it is -- and
there's a gap in the middle there, which is

00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:51.880
where my harddrive crashed and I hadn't backed
up for four months.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.500
And that day, I had an epiphany.
I went from going, "Oh, this is a novelty.”

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.700
To going, "Oh, no! I'm really upset that I
lost a bunch of my memories.”

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.570
Was the way I thought of it.
It was very distressing to me.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.570
And I found that after that, I would go looking
for things, expecting them to be there and

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.950
they weren't.
They'd be lost.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:13.360
And it dawned on me, "Well, this isn't just
fun and games. I count on it.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.370
I rely on the fact that, if I've seen a web
page, I've got it forever.”

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:23.740
And that it actually is life-changing.
We talk about the era before humans did any

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.270
writing as 'pre-history'.
It's almost like it doesn't count -- wasn't

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:31.840
in the record.
Well, I think soon, we'll talk about pre-Total

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.240
Recall.
We'll talk about those people back before

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.789
when all you had was a few shoeboxes and a
bunch of papers, and you're lucky if you left

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:42.399
that behind.
That really, the e-memory revolution is going

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:47.330
to change up everything and really make us
live different lives.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.330
Thanks.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.330
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:33:49.330 --> 00:34:03.720
Jim Gemmell: So I guess we have time for some
questions?

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.409
Q [inaudible]

00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:15.129
Jim Gemmell: Well, you still do have to remember.
That's a great question, you know.

00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:18.809
Apparently Plato was concerned about this
in terms of writing.

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:22.149
He said, "Oh, no. Our memories are going to
go to hell now, because you guys are writing

00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:27.230
stuff down. What a terrible idea writing is.”
Ironically, we know this because it was written

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.269
down.
But it's the same thing here.

00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:35.779
My mind is still full to overflowing of things
that I have to memorize.

00:34:35.779 --> 00:34:39.339
The difference is, What do I memorize?
So I'm not memorizing phone numbers anymore

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:42.440
 -- they're on my cell phone.
Or I'm not memorizing things that I know I

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.399
can look up quickly in my system in a few
seconds.

00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:48.450
But there's still things that you want on
the tip of your tongue.

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:51.869
You want to be able to say right away without
even a five-second lookup.

00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:55.759
And there always will be.
So I hope it just frees us up to think different

00:34:55.759 --> 00:34:56.759
things.

00:34:56.759 --> 00:35:02.799
Q Reinforcing your point.
Plato was nothing compared to Pythagoras,

00:35:02.799 --> 00:35:12.119
Buddha, Jesus, the whole Celtic Druids, all
the great spiritual feelings that basically

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:17.509
never wrote down a single word, forbade their
disciples from ever writing down a single

00:35:17.509 --> 00:35:18.960
word.
Of course the disciples disobeyed, which is

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.890
why we know anything about all of them.
But because of that -- the written word is

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.479
a dead word.
But I found it particularly interesting that

00:35:27.479 --> 00:35:32.979
you picked the Swiss databank example when,
less than a month ago, a Swiss bank just agreed

00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:39.769
to give all the secret data on tens of thousands
of U.S. taxpayers -- or rather, not quite

00:35:39.769 --> 00:35:42.859
fully taxpayers -- to the U.S.
government.

00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:52.440
And beyond the Fifth Amendment, the Fifth
Amendment has never been applied to nonphysical

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.569
individuals, as opposed to other provisions
of constitutional law.

00:35:57.569 --> 00:36:03.890
As Microsoft knows well, and basically everybody,
the more you put in e-mail -- the closest

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:09.109
thing we have to Total Recall today -- the
more toast you are whenever anybody sues you.

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:18.359
So, how can any company support any recording
at all going on inside their buildings when

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:23.840
it can be definitely subpoenaed and used against
them in court, because there is no Fifth Amendment?

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.119
Jim Gemmell: Do you want to do this one?

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:33.430
Gordon Bell: Yeah. I know that's -- certainly
the corporate view is to get rid of everything.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:38.190
I don't know what it is here.
I know Intel -- I've done some consulting

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.920
for awhile at Intel, and they're probably
one of the strongest in terms of cleaning

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.049
out everything.
Now, the beauty of doing that, it lets you

00:36:47.049 --> 00:36:54.200
reinvent things every few years.
But I subscribe to -- that you're going to

00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:01.349
win more than you lose when you are able to
have a long record.

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:12.780
And so, but I can't support it.
It's just a belief that I have.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.359
Jim Gemmell: You know, also, I think -- isn't
this a great challenge for Google?

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:21.019
I mean, when I think of storing things in
Gmail, you guys need to come up with a system

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:25.749
where you can't give it over to the government.
You never see anything but it's encrypted,

00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:30.380
as I said, where there's escape passwords
that shreds stuff for you.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.759
There's a lot of innovation left to do here.
And I sure hope people here at Google jump

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:41.499
all over it and deliver some new ideas that
are different than that Swiss databank that

00:37:41.499 --> 00:37:42.499
we just talked about.

00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:49.459
Q There are a couple of situations where it's
either clearly illegal or it's of dubious

00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:51.670
legality to photograph.
And I'm thinking of situations like riding

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:57.210
the subway in New York or going to watch a
movie.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:02.950
Or there have been a lot of incidents lately
about people videotaping law enforcement actions.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:11.480
How do you make this kind of recording consistent
with that kind of uncertain legal environment?

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.170
Gordon Bell: I think the laws are going to
determine that.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:23.989
You know, as technologists, we'll be providing
the fodder for the creation and the definition

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:30.720
of the laws.
But all we can do is observe that they are

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:38.160
 -- either we're creating them or our friends
or you are -- we're all together here creating

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.970
these kinds of opportunities with the technology.
And, as you go there, we'll hit these boundaries

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:51.369
and then those boundaries will determine them.
Each state, each country determines them quite

00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:56.579
differently.
So you just have to be aware when you go into

00:38:56.579 --> 00:39:01.609
a country.
For example, I spend a fair amount of time

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:06.499
in Sydney, and even photographing some of
the public buildings -- if it's going to be

00:39:06.499 --> 00:39:16.619
for a commercial use, Sydney expects you to
pay for a picture of the Opera House if it's

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:24.529
going to be some money-making venture.
In fact, that's why we had a very subdued

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:32.050
music with this, because we regard that as
fair use, but when it's played on YouTube,

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:37.710
of course -- and you're helping define all
of those, by the way.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.019
YouTube helps define what's fair use.

00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:44.910
Jim Gemmell: I think the other aspect is,
Gordon talked about use for commercial use.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.709
We're talking about a lot of things here that
will be recorded and no one else will ever

00:39:48.709 --> 00:39:52.479
see.
And a lot of laws -- it'll be one thing to

00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:55.799
have a law forbidding recording -- where the
rubber really meets the road is whether you

00:39:55.799 --> 00:39:59.859
share it with anybody.
And so, you know, sometimes I wonder whether

00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:04.289
people will obey these laws any more than
they obey posted speed limits where they know

00:40:04.289 --> 00:40:09.430
no cops are around.
I think there's going to be a lot of working

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.469
out -- a lot of it, I think, is cultural as
much as legal.

00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:17.499
Will there be a special bond between people
who don't record?

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:20.100
Or will there be a special bond if I trust
you to record everything?

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.949
Or How will it work out, you know?
And laws will change -- different countries,

00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:25.829
as Gordon says.

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:33.849
Gordon Bell: As we were writing the book -- there's
a book out there by a woman who basically

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:40.209
has a two-way, associative, videocamera built
into her brain.

00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:46.199
I mean, she has a hard time living with herself,
because these images are constantly there.

00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:52.400
But she can retrieve any bit by day or she
can retrieve by image.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:59.640
So in a way, she is a walking, absolute video
 -- the ultimate of what we expect.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:06.029
So if you hired her to be part of something,
why, you basically are getting a recorder

00:41:06.029 --> 00:41:09.680
of this capability.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:19.170
Q So, just to follow up on that previous question.
Do you record any audio conversations other

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:24.759
than the ones on the phone?
Like any face-to-face conversations?

00:41:24.759 --> 00:41:31.190
Gordon Bell: Very rarely. I record a few.
I've got an audio recorder.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:40.279
I'm not recording this, because it was captured.
I happen to be a strong believer in recording

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:46.630
meetings -- audio recording of meetings, in
particular -- so you can go back and find

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.839
out what they have.
In fact, I helped fund one company -- and

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:57.150
I'm not exactly sure where they are at this
point -- a company called Quindy that has

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:01.769
audio and video capture of meetings.

00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:09.210
Q This kind of avoids the issue of the previous
question with regard to wiretapping conversations.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:16.140
I mean, I heard you kind of talk about the
future changes in the law in response to the

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.630
previous question.
But what do you guys personally do yourselves

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.799
now?
Do you actually go around and pay attention

00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:25.160
to the laws of What things you're not allowed
to photograph, and turn off your things?

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.000
I mean, practically, are you just assuming
you're probably going to be fined?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.190
You know, It's like five miles an hour over
the speed limit.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.619
Or are you paying careful attention to the
exactly where you are and what the law is

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:38.259
there and what you are not allowed to photograph
and when you need to -- I mean, it seems like

00:42:38.259 --> 00:42:39.349
a hard work, right?

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:40.599
Gordon Bell: I think we're okay.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:45.130
Jim Gemmell: For the record, I put it in my
pocket when I walked past the big sign in

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.160
the hallway here that had your secret sauce
on it.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.730
Gordon Bell: And I turned mine over, so.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:57.700
Jim Gemmell: But actually a lot of laws are
fairly lenient with picture-taking, especially

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.599
in public places.
For your own use, it's fair game.

00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:04.660
It's the audio gets really, really sensitive
where there's this presumption of privacy.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.479
And also, that's more natural in a way, if
you will.

00:43:07.479 --> 00:43:12.019
Like, when we're out with people and you see
cameras around, we kind of -- that's normative

00:43:12.019 --> 00:43:16.469
here -- in this country, anyhow.
But when you record audio, people are more

00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:21.239
sensitive, and we tend to let them know, "Okay,
is it okay if I record this conversation or

00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:24.480
this meeting or whatever we're in?"

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.329
Gordon Bell: I do record some phone conversations
periodically.

00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:34.329
I tell the people -- I had a long, long CNN
interview, and the guy said, "I'm recording

00:43:34.329 --> 00:43:35.540
this.”
And I said, "Okay, I'm going to record it

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:42.279
too.”
Because it turned out there were a lot of

00:43:42.279 --> 00:43:47.510
interesting sort of questions from the interview.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.849
Q One of you talks about the emotional value
of memories that will never go away.

00:43:50.849 --> 00:43:57.089
In other words, wouldn't _____ be a little
bit different from what it used to be?

00:43:57.089 --> 00:44:05.410
Jim Gemmell: Yeah. So even there's memories
that -- usually people say even "Well, there's

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:11.029
bad memories that I want to forget, and Isn't
it more healthy for me to forget things?"

00:44:11.029 --> 00:44:17.279
And what that misses is, there's a wonderful
distinction between electronic memory and

00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:21.539
human memory -- that with human memory, when
people say, "Oh, I really ought to forget

00:44:21.539 --> 00:44:23.170
that.”
What they really mean is, "I really ought

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.969
to stop recalling it.”
It's not that they have it in their memory,

00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:31.630
but they're having flashbacks of the war,
or they're having, you know, they can't stop

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:36.329
dwelling on that fight they had with their
girlfriend or what have you.

00:44:36.329 --> 00:44:40.039
And with an e-memory, we can do that.
You can say, "Okay, seal this off.

00:44:40.039 --> 00:44:44.119
Not for access unless I give the key.”
Or however you want to do it.

00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:48.870
Just hide it away.
So there is a difference there, in terms of,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.959
we can keep things that maybe later -- maybe
years down the road -- you'll be really glad

00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:58.519
you had or might be useful.
We had one lady call in and say, "Oh, I had

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:02.920
a son who was bipolar, and the memories of
his childhood are just horrible.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.239
And I would hate to think of having kept them.”
But, actually, if you think about it.

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:12.799
Yeah, she probably wants to lock them down
and she doesn't want them bothering her, but

00:45:12.799 --> 00:45:18.449
maybe when that kid is 25, that might be incredibly
valuable stuff for his therapist.

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.710
So you never know.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:27.410
Q And another related one is, Even for the
good memories, we sometimes see more value

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.369
in them when we haven't seen them for awhile.
As opposed to say, if you had pictures of

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:37.069
your child all around you all the time.
Wouldn't you kind of get bored and not be

00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:41.489
as happy about them as if you could see them
every five years or whatever?

00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:47.599
Gordon Bell: Having some kind of ranking,
particularly when it's sort of memory refresh,

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:54.499
we almost like that it's like dynamic RAM,
that you're periodically looking at that,

00:45:54.499 --> 00:46:03.809
and those things are coming into your memory.
And we have a control so that you can say,

00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:10.160
"Well, that's not so important.”
But what you want to do is really be able

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:19.380
to have a kind of a quality threshold of all
of these -- of that, you know, when it's in

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.430
screensaver mode.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.999
Jim Gemmell: Yeah. Talk about a ranking problem
 -- it's really interesting.

00:46:23.999 --> 00:46:27.881
When you make it purely random, if you have
more pictures of something, then of course

00:46:27.881 --> 00:46:32.269
they'll show up.
And I had somebody else's collection of a

00:46:32.269 --> 00:46:36.749
thousand photos on my hard drive for some
reason, and I keep seeing these photos.

00:46:36.749 --> 00:46:39.390
And like you say, it's like, "That's boring.
I don't want them.”

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:44.660
So there's some work here to do on, How do
we figure out that, because I was hitting

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.839
'skip' on the screensaver -- you know, skip
to the next photo -- you ought to be able

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:52.359
to learn that I'm getting bored of that collection.
You know, hide it for the next six months,

00:46:52.359 --> 00:46:54.410
and then we'll kind of try it out on me again
and see whether I've changed my mind.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:47:01.699
Q I have a question.
There's a lot of work that looked like getting

00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:08.989
implicit metadata on time, place, people,
retain things like that which was really good.

00:47:08.989 --> 00:47:14.109
But I'm curious -- does the system keep track
of how long you actually are using the system

00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:16.049
to go back and use it?

00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:19.559
Jim Gemmell: Yeah.
We were tracking all that, yes.

00:47:19.559 --> 00:47:24.709
Q Okay, but I mean, as a percentage of time
 -- this is sort of a follow on question -- is,

00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:30.160
it seems very backward-focused.
In other words it's sort of encouraging you

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.199
to go back and revisit things and correlate
and so forth.

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:40.209
And I'm curious, What has it let you do that
you otherwise couldn't, going ahead or going

00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:41.209
forward?

00:47:41.209 --> 00:47:45.289
Jim Gemmell: Well, first of all, no, I don't
think we -- I mean, aside from of course we

00:47:45.289 --> 00:47:49.460
were building this experimentally and it's,
you know, bailing wire and bubble gum and

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.119
there's some pain involved.
But apart from that, I don't think no, it

00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:57.869
does make us look back more or get more focused
on the past or anything like that.

00:47:57.869 --> 00:48:00.510
But it just does enable.
It's just like we've got it there, you know.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:06.319
So I don't spend, you know -- people really,
these cameras get a lot of attention, but

00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:10.989
think about, to me, it was having every copy
of every web page that I visited.

00:48:10.989 --> 00:48:14.829
That didn't mean I spent a lot of time looking
or, "Oh, let's look at old web pages.”

00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:16.890
Because that's boring.
I never do that.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:20.299
But what I do all the time is go, "Oh, I need
to get back to that page.”

00:48:20.299 --> 00:48:24.630
And you know think of how many of your customers,
it was like a seven-step thing if they did

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.410
a search and they clicked on something and
they followed and they followed until they

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:32.180
finally got to the page they wanted, and then
the next time for them to repeat that, "Okay.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.039
What's the magic incantation?
What are the links to follow?”

00:48:35.039 --> 00:48:37.529
It's much easier when you're getting it out
of your own collection.

00:48:37.529 --> 00:48:38.529
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:48:38.529 --> 00:48:48.369
Q Can you speak to the flipside of this?
So clearly, everything is getting recorded.

00:48:48.369 --> 00:48:53.380
Like I stand here, I can see two cameras over
there, two cameras over there, one camera

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.779
over there.
Everything I do is getting recorded, even

00:48:55.779 --> 00:49:03.380
if you weren't carrying it around your neck.
But can you talk about the society we will

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.990
get when everything is recorded and everything
is searchable?

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.459
So if you are in Soviet Russia, and everything
is recorded, and you really cannot hide, like

00:49:09.459 --> 00:49:11.940
in 1984, what happens?
I mean what happens to -- what kind of a society

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.980
do we get?

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:21.500
Gordon Bell: Well, I mean the most publicity
I think of is not Russia, but in the U.K.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.849
The real examples I think of -- I'll say spectacular
finds -- are really from all the cameras in

00:49:23.849 --> 00:49:34.869
Britain.
They have more cameras per area and per person

00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:49.809
than any place around, I believe.
We're getting -- I notice we're getting more

00:49:49.809 --> 00:49:56.769
and more whether it's at the airport or wherever.
I've always felt it would be very interesting.

00:49:56.769 --> 00:50:06.709
When all of these ______-- like this room
or so I don't have to have the thing, but

00:50:06.709 --> 00:50:15.029
I'll say, "I want to go back to the room.”
I'll say, "Room! Tell me about this.”

00:50:15.029 --> 00:50:24.809
So I think we'll get to this point.
I think there will be the point when I say,

00:50:24.809 --> 00:50:27.219
"Gee.
I had a meeting in that room.

00:50:27.219 --> 00:50:28.219
I forget what went on.”
Ask the room.

00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:29.219
I think that these things will take on this
capability.

00:50:29.219 --> 00:50:30.219
Like a car. You know a car.
"Car, what did I do?" or "Where did I go,

00:50:30.219 --> 00:50:31.219
car?" and you know, then you get into the
thing -- Can the car testify against you?

00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:32.219
And that's already happening.
Because the car knows where it's been and

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:42.440
it knows how fast and all of these things.
And so, you get into this privacy of the car

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:49.859
 -- privacy of the occupants of the car -- are
happening.

00:50:49.859 --> 00:50:58.589
Jim Gemmell: Yeah, and I think this raises
a great point that we already are being recorded

00:50:58.589 --> 00:51:03.880
so much that, in one sense, if you aren't
doing recording of your life, you might be

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.730
the only one who isn't.
Your government, the bank, your credit card

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:10.609
company -- they know all about you, but you're
kind of clueless.

00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:12.699
You don't know your patterns as well as they
do.

00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:15.710
Q But then, what do you do when the government
does evil?

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:20.140
Or it doesn't -- or you're doing something
that the government doesn't like.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.589
Like in China, and you're speaking up against
the party.

00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:23.589
What do you do?
I mean, you cannot hide.

00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:29.319
Jim Gemmell: Well, so what about, I think
it would be wonderful if we want to advocate

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:35.059
for governments to do less recording.
I think, the individual -- we can work out

00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:37.049
what we believe about recording each other
and so on.

00:51:37.049 --> 00:51:40.039
But if we want to say to the government, "You
should be doing less recording.”

00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:42.009
That's great.
That's totally different than what we're talking

00:51:42.009 --> 00:51:43.910
about.
In the book, we're not advocating that governments

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:48.309
record us, or each other.
We're saying, Your memories, like an extension

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:52.219
of your brain, right? I'm with you.
If you want to do some kind of petition to

00:51:52.219 --> 00:51:53.699
slow down the government, I'm there.

00:51:53.699 --> 00:51:59.700
Gordon Bell: By the way, the focus on the
book is strongly around the individual.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:06.839
And what do you get.
What the individual gets by having more and

00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:11.309
more things recorded.
And the thing is, Well, do we wear these cameras?

00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:15.450
Do we take more pictures? No.
Do we record this or that?

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:21.619
I'd say, "Not really.
As people who work with computers and other

00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:26.779
people in the knowledge industry -- what we
need it for usually is, We've got this enormous

00:52:26.779 --> 00:52:33.209
amount of traffic going back and forth in
e-mails and all of the stuff that's on our

00:52:33.209 --> 00:52:37.709
screen.
We want all of that to be recorded, because

00:52:37.709 --> 00:52:40.559
that's really where the payoff is in the professional
life.

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:46.049
Or in a personal life, it's every transaction
 -- every financial transaction -- that goes

00:52:46.049 --> 00:52:52.299
on so that when we, you know, do our income
tax or have to fill out a travel form or anything

00:52:52.299 --> 00:52:55.289
like that, that that stuff is all there for
us.

00:52:55.289 --> 00:53:01.609
The fact that we've gone paperless.
I was paperless in 2002 and you know, it just

00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:11.170
makes life so much nicer to not have to think
about any of those documents, any of the bills

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:16.309
and stuff like that.
And the banks and all the financial guys are

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:22.179
now trying to make, "Please go paperless.”
They want to save money, but from our standpoint

00:53:22.179 --> 00:53:27.420
 -- from a user standpoint -- it's a great
advantage, because you can finally find something

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.339
that you couldn't have found.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:35.400
Q Didn't you recently have to tell Australia
every time you'd be in and out of the country,

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.400
or something?

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.809
Gordon Bell: Oh yeah. And now.

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:46.809
Q So, right now you're wearing cameras around
your neck; you're carrying voice recorders

00:53:46.809 --> 00:53:50.529
in your pocket.
I imagine to get sort of wider adoption on

00:53:50.529 --> 00:53:53.900
something like this, you'd need some kind
of less-conspicuous hardware.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.170
Have you spent any time thinking about that?
What's your vision on What's this going to

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.180
look like?

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:04.289
Jim Gemmell: Actually, so Lyndsay Williams
who invented this -- her goal ultimately was

00:54:04.289 --> 00:54:08.009
to have it as a nice little bit of jewelry
that she'd be able to put on her dress.

00:54:08.009 --> 00:54:12.089
And really, you know, this is just a prototype.
So it's literally some other digital camera

00:54:12.089 --> 00:54:14.130
ripped apart, and stuck in here with these
sensors.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:19.339
It could really, really shrink down and we
think it could be fashionable in clothing,

00:54:19.339 --> 00:54:22.910
you know?
Already the miniaturization is there.

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:27.910
It's just how you pack it up.
You can stuff it into an iPod nano now, no

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:28.910
problem, right?

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:34.209
Q According to the Russian ____ , there are
a bunch spy stories around.

00:54:34.209 --> 00:54:35.900
So you can, depending on how much you want,
you can?

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:43.199
Q But do you envision people actually embedding
these things in their bodies somehow so you

00:54:43.199 --> 00:54:49.359
don't even have to wear it as an item of clothing
or jewelry or something?

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:51.449
Gordon Bell: I don't know whether that's going
to happen for recording.

00:54:51.449 --> 00:54:58.279
We've got a long way to go before people get
any value out of this.

00:54:58.279 --> 00:55:06.750
The big problem with all of the audio stuff.
I've got two or three thousand telephone conversations.

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:16.640
I stopped doing it, because it was only a
few cases that I want to transcribe stuff.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.819
The value wasn't there.
So as engineers, it was like, "We did all

00:55:18.819 --> 00:55:21.109
this stuff to find out, What's the value in
them?

00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:24.150
Do you want to bother with it?
Is it paying off?”

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.380
So our stuff is strongly payoff-driven.
If there were good speech-to-text.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.489
If there were great speech-to-text, better
than that, if you had great speech-to-text,

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.489
believe me, there would be recording going
on all the time.

00:55:27.489 --> 00:55:30.660
The only reason you don't record often -- people
don't record audio -- it takes as long to

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:35.900
listen to the stuff as it did to have the
original.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:45.910
Whereas text, you know, our e-mail and stuff
like that, you can read that stuff so fast;

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:50.829
computers can read it.
But a computer basically can't touch audio.

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:59.589
It can barely touch video in terms of Does
it know anything about it?

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:19.219
It's whether the computer knows.
So we are strongly -- It isn't really information

00:56:19.219 --> 00:56:20.743
unless the computer -- or it isn't valuable
to us unless the computer knows about it.

00:56:20.743 --> 00:56:25.390
Jim Gemmell: Yeah, I think also, as we talk
about this growing starting now, Where's the

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:28.199
value?
The value is in What's everything I've ever

00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:33.569
read as a knowledge worker? What's all my
health data to deal with my health? And then,

00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:37.420
when you get into pictures, I think it's,
When can someone make one of these that's

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:42.029
really easy to take on vacation and come back
and do your travel log, right?.

00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:46.329
It's not so much miniaturized.
It's a big jump to talk about the society

00:56:46.329 --> 00:56:52.209
that's 24/7 recording as we ramp up along
What's valuable enough for us to bother with?

00:56:52.209 --> 00:56:53.849
It's going to be these kind of applications.

00:56:53.849 --> 00:57:03.670
Gordon Bell: By the way, we should mention,
we have the books back there and we would

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:08.940
happily sign them.
There are a dozen.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.089
I think we've had up to ten start-up ideas.
So we wanted to stimulate people, because

00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:21.760
we see the industry already -- that there
are products and features coming out that

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.729
are really memory enhancement things.

00:57:26.729 --> 00:57:34.689
Q I appreciate that you're sort of looking
for the positive things and looking how to

00:57:34.689 --> 00:57:43.160
kind of move forward, but it seems to me that
you also have to take responsibility for looking

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.999
at the negative side.
Looking at the dystopian side as well.

00:57:45.999 --> 00:57:52.640
Because, some of your comments about, well,
somebody brings up an objection, What if this

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.019
happens?
And you say, "Well, the laws have to change.”

00:57:55.019 --> 00:58:01.750
The laws won't change in a positive way unless
people have examined both sides of things.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:08.179
Otherwise, the law is going to be reactive.
As 1984 showed, the government doesn't have

00:58:08.179 --> 00:58:12.039
to record everything if they can convince
your neighbors to do it for you.

00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:18.420
So, you know, you don't have to worry about
necessarily the government recording everything

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.759
you do if your neighbor walks out and you
know walks through the street every day.

00:58:22.759 --> 00:58:26.969
They'll have a pretty good picture of what's
going on in your neighborhood.

00:58:26.969 --> 00:58:33.759
So, like I said, while I do appreciate what
you're looking for, I think it would also

00:58:33.759 --> 00:58:37.799
be good to really focus on some of the problems
that come up as well.

00:58:37.799 --> 00:58:41.900
Jim Gemmell: Well, you're right.
And we spend some time in the book talking

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:45.209
about these problems of What does the revolution
mean to us?

00:58:45.209 --> 00:58:51.519
And one of our points is, Probably more than
Big Brother, you need to worry about Little

00:58:51.519 --> 00:58:57.199
Brother -- exactly as you said.
And that electronic gossip is the biggest

00:58:57.199 --> 00:59:04.309
threat that probably will face us in the short-term.
And again, that we face that now.

00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:07.499
That's already here.
So even if nobody reads our book or pays any

00:59:07.499 --> 00:59:12.369
attention to us, we are already at that point
where Little Brother could be spying on you

00:59:12.369 --> 00:59:15.219
and gossiping about you.
And that we need to come to grips with it.

00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:18.160
And we need to, you know, whether it's developing
new laws.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.559
Or whether, as technologists, are there things
we can do?

00:59:21.559 --> 00:59:26.279
I mean, can we develop devices that will share
permissions with each other about what you

00:59:26.279 --> 00:59:28.599
can record, and say, "Yeah, you're allowed
to record me.

00:59:28.599 --> 00:59:31.049
No, you're not. I trust you. I don't trust
you."

00:59:31.049 --> 00:59:34.990
I'm just speculating here when I say,
"Yeah. These are real problems, and we have

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.539
to come to grips with them."
And we have to now.

00:59:37.539 --> 00:59:42.929
So part of what we're saying too about it
being inevitable is, it's here; it's happening.

00:59:42.929 --> 00:59:46.989
Even the people who think, "I don't want to
have anything to do with this.”

00:59:46.989 --> 00:59:49.109
It's coming.
You know, I think even the people who say,

00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:50.809
"I don't want to have anything to do with
this.”

00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:55.329
Will still record their life on a scale that
will blow away everyone from the previous

00:59:55.329 --> 00:59:59.009
century.
That will be -- last century will be considered

00:59:59.009 --> 01:00:04.009
nothing, absolutely nothing for you to max
out what you would have had from the 20th

01:00:04.009 --> 01:00:07.289
century.
And yeah, we're going to grapple with it.

01:00:07.289 --> 01:00:10.650
It's here.
So what are we going to do about it?

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.640
It's not us advocating "Should we or shouldn't
we?”

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640
It's going to happen.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.630
&gt;&gt; All right. Gentlemen, thanks for speaking
with us today.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:18.000
It was a great presentation. Thank you.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.069
&gt;&gt; [clapping]
