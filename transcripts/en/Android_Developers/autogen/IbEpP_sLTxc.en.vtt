00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.410
 Hi, I'm a husband, I had a husband. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 relations in Brazil and in this video we will 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 see how to add fitness to the new 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.890
 versions of android to your applications and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 still compatible with 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.109
 previous versions of the platform where 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.980
 phones that have version 2.1 2.2 other 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.680
 versions 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 after all that is lab support is a set 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 of libraries that can be included in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.170
 your application 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 each of these libraries supports a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 android version specific group and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 also gives you the possibility to use a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 different group of functionalities and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can include these libraries in the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 your project in eclipse the android studio 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 but also in your idea it is preferred that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.070
 Are you announcing the project? 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.379
 sport life is divided into five versions a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.559
 The first is to see four positive 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.559
 from android 1.6 or skin takes 4 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.530
 which brings features like fragments 20 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.880
 where i stayed shams saw pg drug layout 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.369
 for you power of those less than 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.080
 slide left to right louder 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.500
 which has mechanisms such as scintigraphy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.650
 improve performance your application 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
 then we have 17 that is divided into three 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 different libraries that you can 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 use for set of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.299
 features we have up to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.189
 with the free pat he adds is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.320
 compatibility with such 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 expected with edson will fill action 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 approved 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.799
 remembering that is the part of android 2.1 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.659
 ap level 7 and this library is one thing 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.159
 which is as follows: 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.070
 so when did you add to your 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 Remember to check if you want to see 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 which was also thoughtfully added to the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.759
 eclipse 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.829
 You're going to have a surprise when it comes to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.479
 combine or export only pk 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 Then we have a tiger once. 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.040
 layout that was created specifically 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.380
 you need to have a great layout in your 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.000
 application is also the same thing 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 part of version 2.1 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.649
 then we have very interesting that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.689
 is versatile media holter that can give 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.689
 media support to other holter media 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.580
 prove and related classes that I will 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.379
 give it a google preview 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 cast that you could do some 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.240
 applications that interact with chrome 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.010
 cash for example 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 and last but not least 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 we have nine and 13 she goes 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.040
 add support for fragments 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.690
 applications in the applications from the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 version 3.2 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.870
 so you have the resources that were 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.270
 presented after three points 2 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.350
 was released and with tear support 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 version 13 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.920
 Can you add it in your 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.140
 application so let's learn now 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 how to put lake support in your project 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.110
 in case I'm going to use a project that already 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.000
 it's ready and eclipse 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.560
 I'll make a support of this project 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.330
 so we are seeing the support and the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.490
 I called the project you click with the button 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.410
 right on top of the project and downstairs 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.050
 a yes option is quite simple android 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.300
 all selecting the titles will also 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.150
 draw very easy that is the support lake 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.740
 no mysteries and clicks and it will download 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.990
 the library data that is 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.000
 compatible with your project and then 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.130
 will present a license that you have 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.080
 that agreeing to such a license is the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.420
 free is open but only has to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.170
 agree to the license given to you by 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.380
 of the license click accept and then 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.480
 installed after that it will download the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.980
 library to add the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.590
 your project so that it can be 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.570
 always use the latest version 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.850
 after he has downloaded it already made the 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.830
 and you can check this through 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.800
 of the director where you can see 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.390
 here android support aggre g 4 if you 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.460
 You want three versions just in this 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.280
 walk and download the version that you 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.720
 interest or need and in addition to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.270
 to use eclipse together with people 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.580
 you can also use the 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.820
 android studio that is even easier is 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.740
 only you include in addition to dependency on 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.750
 the governor's script so that he can 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.470
 bild puts the correct dependency on your 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.210
 project 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.300
 Let's have a look at each stringhi. 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.140
 for each library to see 4s is in 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.960
 screen where you have with a point android point 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.990
 support two points support trace see 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.000
 table two points 18.10 point more 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.890
 Then everyone else I'm going to talk to 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.050
 are based on this rule of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.700
 information and each is to put an 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.070
 Specific we explained in a video 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.940
 previously we have to see set efe with 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.900
 part 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.780
 then we will have the v7 great layout 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.960
 then the media holter and finally see 13 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.160
 in the case of versions 3 with 2 onwards 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.050
 then the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.970
 stayed a doubt want to know more 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.190
 details on the support there you can 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.930

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.880
 all explanation all tapes 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.790
 in detail and if you have lost some 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.800
 how to place the bracket on your 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.840
 project also has a page about the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.300
 setap gives online support to help 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 in this process of using it and 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.450
 application that is richer in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.430
 functionalities 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.350

 from now on and can include 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.710
 in your project and make use of the victims

 application and still continue 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.020
 supporting previous platform version 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.690
 do not forget to check the documentation
