00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.340
We have three different addition
problems right over here.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.250
And what I want you to do so
you get the hang of things

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.740
is to pause the video
and try them on your own.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.180
But as you do them, I want
you to really keep in mind

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.660
and think about what the
carrying actually means.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.520
So I assume you've
tried it on your own.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.780
Now I'll work through
them with you.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.420
So we have 9 plus 6.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.820
9 ones plus 6 ones.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.110
Well 9 plus 6 is 15.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.810
Well, we can write the
5 in the ones place,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.580
and then we can carry the one.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.650
But what did we just do?

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.100
W.hat does this 1 represent?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.670
Well, we put it in the tens
place-- one 10 represents 10.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.280
So all we've said is that 9
plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 5.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.250
Is equal to one 10 plus
5, which is equal to 15.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, in the tens place, we have
1 plus 0 plus 9 which is 10..

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.350
So we can write 0 and carry
the 1 1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.020
Now what does that really mean?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.240
Well this is 1 ten plus 0 tens
plus 9 tens, which is 10 tens.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.970
10 tens is 100.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.500
Or another way to think
about 100, it's 1 hundred,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.920
and 0 tens.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.030
So that's all that
carrying represents.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870
So now we have a 1,
plus a 7, plus a 9.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.754
That is going to be 17.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:19.730
Now we have to remind ourselves,
this is in the hundreds place.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.390
This is actually 1 hundred
plus 7 hundred plus 9 hundred

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.350
17 hundred.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.430
Or 1 thousand, 7 hundred.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.380
And of course we
have this 5 here.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.220
And we are done.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.690
Now let's try to
tackle this one.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.540
Now the reason why
I wrote it that way

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.640
is to make sure that we
remind ourselves to align

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.440
the proper places under
the appropriate places.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.388
So this we rewrite as-- let me
do that same green color-- we

00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:53.187
could rewrite this
as 373 plus-- we

00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:55.270
want to write the ones
place under the ones place,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.810
and the tens place
under the tens place,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.880
so that we're adding
the appropriate values.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.220
So 3 plus 8 is 11.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.090
The 1 in the ones place,
and the 1 in the tens place.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.090
10 plus 1 is 11.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.100
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.890
8 plus 8 is 16.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.830
This is actually 16 tens.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.610
So let me just
write down the 16.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.800
What is 16 tens?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.860
Well, that's 160.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.290
So this 6 is a 60, and
then I have a hundred.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.940
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.320
But these are actually
hundreds, so it's 4 hundreds.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.610
So we get 461.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.620
Now finally, 9 plus 3 is 12.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770
2 ones, and 1 ten.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.120
12 is the same
thing as 10 plus 2.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.780
Now in the tens place,
1 plus 4 plus 9 is 14.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500
So we write the 4,
and carry the 1.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.550
But remind ourselves this
is actually 10 plus 40

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.340
plus 90, which is 140.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.500
Which is the same
thing as 40 plus 100.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.559
And then 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.850
But this is the hundreds place.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.940
So this is actually 1 hundred,
plus 1 hundred, plus 2 hundred,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.180
or 4 hundred.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.290
And we're done.
