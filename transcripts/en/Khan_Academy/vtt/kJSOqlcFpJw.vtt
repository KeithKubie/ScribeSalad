00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.030
In the last video,
we had a large cloud

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.590
of hydrogen atoms
eventually condensing

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.010
into a high pressure, high
mass, I guess you could say,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.030
ball of hydrogen atoms.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.450
And when the pressure
and the temperature

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.880
got high enough-- and so this
is what we saw the last video--

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.190
when the pressure and
temperature got high enough,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.040
we were able to get
the hydrogen protons,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.050
the hydrogen
nucleuses close enough

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.170
to each other, or
hydrogen nuclei

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.900
close enough to each other, for
the strong force to take over

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.770
and fusion to happen
and release energy.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.810
And then that real
energy begins to offset

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.290
the actual gravitational force.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.460
So the whole star--
what's now a star--

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.520
does not collapse on itself.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540
And once we're there, we're now
in the main sequence of a star.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.956
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.580
to take off from
that starting point

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.310
and think about what
happens in the star next.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.390
So in the main sequence, we
have the core of the star.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.130
So this is the
core-- star's core.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:11.590
And you have hydrogen
fusing into helium.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.670
And it's releasing
just a ton of energy.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.410
And that energy is what keeps
the core from imploding.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.770
It's kind of the
outward force to offset

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.310
the gravitational force that
wants to implode everything,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130
that wants to crush everything.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.670
And so you have the core of
a star, a star like the sun,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.480
and that energy then heats
up all of the other gas

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.760
on the outside of the core
to create that really bright

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.070
object that we see as a star, or
in our case, in our sun's case,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.310
the sun.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.380
Now, as the hydrogen
is fusing into helium,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.480
you could imagine that
more and more helium

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.310
is forming in the core.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.160
So I'll do the helium as green.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.590
So more, more, and more
helium forms in the core.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.460
It'll especially form-- the
closer you get to the center,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.980
the higher the
pressures will be,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.950
and the faster that this fusion,
this ignition, will happen.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.930
In fact, the bigger
the mass of the star,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.240
the more the pressure, the
faster the fusion occurs.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.660
And so you have this helium
building up inside of the core

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.245
as this hydrogen in
the core gets fused.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:20.620
Now what's going
to happen there?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.300
Helium is a more dense atom.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.590
It's packing more mass
in a smaller space.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.940
So as more and more
of this hydrogen

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.880
here turns into
helium, what you're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.555
going to have is the core
itself is going to shrink.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.000
So let me draw a
smaller core here.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.700
So the core itself
is going to shrink.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.350
And now it has a lot
more helium in it.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.240
And let's just take it
to the extreme point

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.610
where it's all helium,
where it's depleted.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.330
But it's much denser.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.410
That same amount of mass
that was in this sphere

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.230
is now in a denser sphere,
in a helium sphere.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.470
So it's going to have just
as much attraction to it,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.140
gravitational attraction.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.220
But things can get
even closer to it.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.400
And we know that the
closer you are to a mass,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.730
the stronger the
pull of gravity.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.120
So then instead of having just
the hydrogen fusion occurring

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.650
at the core, you're
now going to have

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.380
hydrogen fusion in a
shell around the core.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.770
So now you're going to
have hydrogen fusing

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.210
in a shell around the core.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.120
Let me just be clear.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.786
This isn't just happens
all of a sudden.

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:48.170
It is a gradual process.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.280
As we have more and
more helium in the core,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.560
the core gets denser
and denser and denser.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.960
And so the pressures become even
larger and larger near the core

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.600
because you're able to get
closer to a more massive core

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.880
since it is now more dense.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.130
And as that pressure
near the core

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.840
increases even more and
more, the fusion reaction

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.300
happens faster and
faster and faster

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.910
until you get to this point.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.060
So here, let me be clear.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.899
You have a helium core.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.089
All of the hydrogen in
the core has been used up.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.590
And then you have the
hydrogen right outside

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.505
of the core is now
under enormous pressure.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:26.880
It's actually
under more pressure

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.650
than it was when it was
just a pure hydrogen core.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.300
Because it's-- there's so
much mass on the outside here,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.570
trying to, I guess you could
say, exerting downwards,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.200
or gravitational force trying to
get to that even denser helium

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.980
core because everything
is able to get closer in.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.165
And so now you have fusion
occurring even faster.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.140
And it's occurring
over a larger radius.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.020
So this faster fusion
over a larger radius,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.890
the force is now going to
expel-- the energy that's

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.490
released from this
fusion is now going

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.630
to expel these outer layers
of the star even further.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.740
So the whole time,
this gradual process

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.060
as the hydrogen turns
into helium, or fuses

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.900
into helium in the
core, the hydrogen right

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.280
outside of the core,
right outside that area,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.020
starts to burn
faster and faster.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.090
I shouldn't say burn.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.890
It starts to fuse
faster and faster

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.580
and over a larger
and larger radius.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.670
The unintuitive
thing is the fusion

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.407
is happening faster
over a larger radius.

00:05:38.407 --> 00:05:40.740
And the reason that is is
because you have even a denser

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.410
core that is causing even
more gravitational pressure.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.050
And as that's happening,
the star's getting brighter.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.640
And it's also-- the fusion
reactions, since they're

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.260
happening in a more intense
way and over a larger radius,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.350
are able to expel the material
of the star even larger.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.950
So the radius of
the star itself is

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.800
getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.980
So if this star looked
like this-- maybe

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.100
let me draw it in
white-- That's not white.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:18.060
Now what's happening
to my color changer?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.230
There you go.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.380
OK, this star looked like
this right over here.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.054
Now, this star over here,
since a faster fusion reaction

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:30.470
is happening over
a larger radius,

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.410
is going to be far larger.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.480
And I'm not even
drawing it to scale.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.820
In the case of our sun,
when it gets to this point,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.230
it's going to be 100
times the diameter.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.250
And at this point,
it is a red giant.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.880
And the reason why it's
redder than this one over here

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.430
is that even though the fusion
is happening more furiously,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.010
that energy is being dissipated
over a larger surface area.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.060
So the actual surface
temperature of the red giant,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.500
at this point, is actually
going to be cooler.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.839
So it's going to emit a light
at a larger wavelength, a redder

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.380
wavelength than this
thing over here.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.360
This thing, the core, was
not burning as furiously

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.130
as this thing over here.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.200
But that energy was
being dissipated

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.290
over a smaller volume.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.390
So this has a higher
surface temperature.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.580
This over here, the core
is burning more-- sorry,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.980
the core is no longer burning.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.030
The core is now helium
that's not burning.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.370
It's getting denser and
denser as the helium packs in

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.340
on itself.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.990
But the hydrogen
fusion over here

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.500
is occurring more intensely.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.910
It's occurring in a hotter way.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.360
But the surface here is
less hot because it's just

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.790
a larger surface area.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.650
So it doesn't make--
the increased heat

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.260
is more than mitigated by how
large the star has become.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.560
Now, this is going
to keep happening.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.480
And this core is
keep-- the pressures

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.100
keep intensifying because more
and more helium is getting

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.880
produced.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.700
And this core keeps collapsing.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.330
And the temperature
here keeps going up.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.670
So we said that the first
ignition, the first fusion,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.040
occurs at around
10 million Kelvin.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.230
This thing will keep
heating up until it

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.466
gets to 100 million Kelvin.

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:26.090
And now I'm talking
about a star that's

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.700
about as massive as the sun.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.830
Some stars will never
even be massive enough

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.210
to condense the core so
that its temperature reaches

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.919
100 million.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.539
But let's just talk about
the case in which it does.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.539
So eventually, you'll
get to a point--

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.870
so we're still sitting
in the red giant phase,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.400
so we're this huge
star over here.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.850
We have this helium core.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.360
And that helium
core keeps getting

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.580
condensed and condensed
and condensed.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.790
And then we have a
shell of hydrogen

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.800
that keeps fusing
into helium around it.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.050
So this is our hydrogen shell.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.740
Hydrogen fusion is occurring
in this yellow shell over here

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.390
that's expelling,
that's allowed--

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.990
that's causing the radius of the
star to get bigger and bigger,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.280
to expand.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.607
But when the temperature
get sufficiently hot--

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:15.690
and now I think you're
going to get a sense of how

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.569
heavier and heavier elements
form in the universe, and all

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:20.860
of the heavy elements that
you see around us, including

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.960
the ones that are
in you, were formed

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.190
it this way from,
initially, hydrogen--

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:32.990
when it gets hot enough at 100
million Kelvin, in this core,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.550
because of such enormous
pressures, then the helium

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.830
itself will start to fuse.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.160
So then we're going
to have a core in here

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.860
where the helium itself
will start to fuse.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.340
And now we're talking
about a situation.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.245
You have helium, and
you had hydrogen.

00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:53.430
And all sorts of
combinations will form.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.600
But in general, the
helium is mainly

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.906
going to fuse into
carbon and oxygen.

00:09:58.906 --> 00:10:00.280
And it'll form
into other things.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.821
And it becomes much
more complicated.

00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:04.040
But I don't want to go
into all of the details.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.182
But let me just show
you a periodic table.

00:10:06.182 --> 00:10:07.640
I didn't have this
in the last one.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.030
I had somehow lost it.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.510
But we see hydrogen
here has one proton.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.060
It actually has no neutrons.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.230
It was getting fused
in the main sequence

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.500
into helium, two
protons, two neutrons.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.740
You need four of these
to get one of those.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.110
Because this actually
has an atomic mass of 4

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.650
if we're talking about helium-4.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.430
And then the helium, once we
get to 100 million Kelvin,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.900
can start being fused.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.590
If you get roughly
three of them--

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.339
and there's all of
these other things that

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:33.930
are coming and leaving
the reactions--

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.080
you can get to a carbon.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.277
You get four of
them, four of them

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:38.860
at least as the
starting raw material.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.930
You get to an oxygen.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.130
So we're starting to fuse
heavier and heavier elements.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.190
So what happens
here is this helium

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.690
is fusing into
carbon and oxygen.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.697
So you start building a
carbon and oxygen core.

00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:53.030
So I'm going to leave you there.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.520
I realize I'm already past
my self-imposed limit of 10

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.094
minutes.

00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:58.510
But what I want
you to think about

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.840
is what is likely to happen.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.730
What is likely to happen
here if this star will never

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.660
have the mass to begin to
fuse this carbon and oxygen?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.180
If it does have the mass, if
it is a super massive star,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.530
it eventually will
be able to raise even

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.390
this carbon and oxygen
core to 600 million Kelvin

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.824
and begin to fuse that
into even heavier elements.

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:20.240
But let's think
about what's going

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.230
to happen for something like
the sun, where it'll never

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.330
have the mass, it'll
never have the pressure,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.390
to start to fuse
carbon and oxygen.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.650
And that'll be the
topic of the next video.
