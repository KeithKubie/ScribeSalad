00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.695
We've spoken a lot
about monopolies.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.835
And we've spoken a lot
about perfect competition.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.130
And we kind of view
them as polar opposites.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300
Over here you have
exactly one player.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.830
Here you have many players.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.850
In a monopoly, you get to set
the price and the quantity.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.400
Here, you have to
be a price taker.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.730
In a monopoly, there's
huge barriers to entry.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.190
In perfect competition,
there's no barriers to entry.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.440
What I want to think about
in this video is, are there

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.930
other situations
or especially are

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.450
their terms for other
situations that are in between?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.700
And to think about that, I'm
going to draw a spectrum.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.491
I'm going to do a two
dimensional spectrum.

00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:41.200
I could probably think
of more variables

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.470
where there's nuance
between these terms,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.945
but these are the two big ones.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.570
So in one dimension,
I'm going to think

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.910
about the number of
competitors there are.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.745
So this is the number
of competitors.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.490
And obviously a monopoly
is one competitor.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.239
Perfect competition, you've
got a bunch of competitors.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.075
So I'll put one right over here
and a bunch of competitors.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:08.700
If this was 0, then
there wouldn't even

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.760
be a market to speak of.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.040
No one is doing is
participating there.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.920
In this axis, in
the vertical axis,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.010
I want to think about
how differentiated

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.500
the competitors
in the market are.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.900
How different are their
products or their brands?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.420
Differentiation in the market.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.210
And this is low
differentiation and this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.450
is high differentiation.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.470
So let's think of a
bunch of industries

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.060
and think about
where they sit here.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.810
And then I'll introduce
you to two new words, other

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.180
than just a monopoly
or perfect competition.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.430
So let's just say that
we live in a world

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.440
where there's 50 producers of
screws and all of those screws

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.920
are completely identical.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.319
And so if one producers
charges even a penny more,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.360
no one's going to want to
go to them because they

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.901
can get the exact
same thing from one

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.100
of the other of
the many producers.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.880
So that would be a case right
over here, low differentiation.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.020
All the screws are the same and
there's a bunch of competitors.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.419
So that's about as perfect
as perfect competition

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.949
can get in the real world.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:18.445
So bunch of identical
screw manufacturers.

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:20.070
I'm not sure if the
actual screw market

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.820
has a bunch of
competitors, but let's just

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.440
assume if it did then you
would be sitting right over

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.740
here, pretty close in the
world of perfect competition.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.440
In the other spectrum, you
imagine your utilities.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.180
In most places in, especially
the US, but probably the world,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.500
there's only one utility.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.539
There's only one entity that's
managing the power lines.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.080
A lot of times,
because of that, it's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.380
actually run by the government.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.580
But in most of the US it's
a regulated private company.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.032
And so here you have one player.

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.490
And you could debate whether
it's low differentiation or so

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.500
high differentiation that
it's the only player,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.210
but let's just stick
it right over there,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.720
low differentiation.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.250
This right over here
might be a utility.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.050
And that's about as
close to a monopoly,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.680
or that actually is a monopoly.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.620
They are the only
player there, mono.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.550
Mono comes from one,
poly comes from seller.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.490
One seller, that
would be a utility.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.260
Now there are things
that are in between.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.600
So for example, if you
thought about your,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.520
let's say that the telephone
providers in your area--

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.340
there normally are a few people
who can provide phone service,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.590
especially with the age
of internet telephony, now

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.970
the cable companies are starting
to provide phone service

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.640
and the telephone
companies are starting

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.930
to provide internet
and cable service.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.830
So we could think
of that market.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.690
So let's put this
market right over here.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.760
So the number of competitors is
low, so it's going to be here.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.852
And they are somewhat
differentiated.

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:43.560
They might give you
a different cable box

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.310
or might offer you slightly
different levels of bandwidth,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.410
or whatever else.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.570
So they're somewhat
differentiated right over here.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:04:02.010
So I'll call that the cable,
internet, telephone providers

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.460
right over there.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.910
Then you could think
of markets where

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.890
there is a bunch of competitors.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.760
There's a bunch of
competitors, but they

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.620
are somewhat differentiated.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.090
And I could think
of fine dining.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.820
So let's say-- so here,
there's a bunch of restaurants

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.320
in any place that sells nice
food, that they really define

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.980
themselves by the quality of
the food that they produce.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.740
So they're highly
differentiated.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.210
Each restaurant is unique.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.170
The chefs have specialties
and all the rest.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.960
But there's a bunch of them.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.790
So right over here I
will put fine dining.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.270
You could also imagine
name brand clothing.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.000
There they're very
differentiated,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.700
certain designers,
certain materials,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.000
all of those type of things.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760
But there's a bunch of them.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.925
So name brand clothing.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.010
It's not quite
perfect competition.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.110
It's very competitive.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.780
There's a bunch
of players there.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.670
But they're not selling
the same product.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.940
They are very, very
differentiated.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.430
To some degree, you almost
feel like even though there's

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.090
all this competition they have
a monopoly on their own product.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.840
Another one could be-- you could
imagine something like high end

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.130
laptops, or high end
computers, or nice computers.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.340
Or maybe I'll just say,
computers in general.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.620
Some people might want
to go for an Apple.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.350
That's what they've
associated with.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.680
And some people might
want to go for a Sony.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.790
So maybe I'll put branded
computers up here.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.220
But then you could also have
something like the unbranded PC

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.720
market.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.370
And that might be
something closer to here,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.370
where you might have these
random manufacturers.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.717
You don't even care, some
manufacturer from overseas.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.550
You don't even care.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.760
But they're saying, they're
using the same processor,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.580
the same memory chip.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.288
They're saying, using
all the same thing.

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:57.899
So they're much
less differentiated.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.690
So this might be right
over here unbranded.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.870
And that tends to happen with
the personal computer industry.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.800
They're just like, well, they're
using the same Intel chip.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.070
They're using the same memory.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.680
They're all running
Windows, whatever else.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.650
There's not a lot of
difference between them.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.360
So those actually
start getting closer

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.300
to this perfect competition.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.640
So the whole reason that I've
introduced these ideas to you

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.289
is that there are names
for these things that

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.330
aren't quite perfect
competition, because they're

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.332
highly differentiated.

00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:28.040
And there are names
for these things that

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.910
aren't quite monopolies, because
they have a few providers.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.340
These right over here-- so we
could put other things around

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.250
here, so I'll circle
this general area.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.660
We would call these oligopolies.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.800
And oli, this comes from
this part right over here.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.790
And I'm not an expert in
Greek but this comes from few.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.810
And obviously the
poly, once again,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.580
just as with monopolies,
comes from sellers.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.752
So this means few sellers.

00:06:56.752 --> 00:06:58.460
And oligopolies, and
we're going to study

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.410
this in much more detail,
they're not quite monopolies.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.470
They can't set the
price and the quantity.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.040
And they can kind of--
depending on the oligopoly,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.810
depending on the
market, they might

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.640
start acting more
like a monopoly.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.330
The players could
coordinate with each other

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.410
to their mutual
benefit, or they might

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.020
become fiercely
competitive, even

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.780
if there's only a few providers.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.974
So oligopolies can kind
of, in their personality

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:23.390
characteristics, they can
either look more like monopolies

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.850
or they can look like kind of
very competitive industries.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.900
And these things up
here, where these

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.570
are quite competitive
industries,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.290
but they are highly
differentiated--

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.380
to some degree, you can
say that, for example,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.700
in branded computers Apple has
a monopoly on selling Apple

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.330
computers.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.580
It doesn't have a
monopoly on computers.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.150
Obviously there's
many, many people

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.940
who could provide computers.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.060
But they have a brand.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.710
If someone wants
an Apple Computer,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.715
you have to go to Apple.

00:07:50.715 --> 00:07:53.370
It's almost-- it's a
self-evident statement.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.460
But it's highly
differentiated, highly branded.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.940
And so they have a
monopoly on their product

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.840
but there are many, many,
many, other competitors

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.700
who are out there that
won't let them just

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.720
set price because they
can offer products

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.640
that serve the same
purpose but they're

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.340
differentiated in some way.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.530
And so these
players up over here

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.990
we would call these,
or these markets,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.775
these are monopolistic
competition.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.480
And when you first hear that, it
sounds-- because the first word

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.660
you here is monopolistic--
but this is more,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.090
at least in my mind, closer
to perfect competition

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.200
than it is to a monopoly.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.741
Because this is a-- or at least
the way I view it in my mind,

00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.140
monopoly is completely
uncompetitive.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.960
While this is still
highly competitive,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.550
it's still not quite
as highly competitive

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.900
as perfect competition.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.570
But it's close.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.120
You have a monopoly
in just your product

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.500
but there are other not too
different similar products--

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.140
there are other products on
the market whose prices affect

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.830
your price.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.530
Or there are other
alternatives, I should say,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.560
in the market that will
affect people's demand

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.570
for your product.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.170
And the best giveaway between
a monopolistic competitor

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.340
and a perfect
competition is that there

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.220
is some differentiation
with the products over here.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.260
There is some maybe
branding here.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.400
There's maybe some
quality difference

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.192
between the products.
