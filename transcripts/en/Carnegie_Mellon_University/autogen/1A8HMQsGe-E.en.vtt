00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.800
think there's a the other part of the
equation also has is that there's also

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:55.810
equation also has is that there's also
 

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.750
equation also has is that there's also
large users so think about for example

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760
large users so think about for example
 

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.600
large users so think about for example
cadastro are conic you know just in

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:00.610
cadastro are conic you know just in
 

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.430
cadastro are conic you know just in
North America we use nine figures in

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440
North America we use nine figures in
 

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.710
North America we use nine figures in
electricity and so if you think about

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720
electricity and so if you think about
 

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.500
electricity and so if you think about
the side of the research and development

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:07.510
the side of the research and development
 

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.030
the side of the research and development
the other part of that equation is that

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.040
the other part of that equation is that
 

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.830
the other part of that equation is that
people to actually use the energy and so

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840
people to actually use the energy and so
 

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.630
people to actually use the energy and so
there's a lot of large players in the

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640
there's a lot of large players in the
 

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.780
there's a lot of large players in the
region that are ideal customers for

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:15.790
region that are ideal customers for
 

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.160
region that are ideal customers for
those technologies that were developing

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.170
those technologies that were developing
 

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.620
those technologies that were developing
and we're actually not a slouch as a

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:19.630
and we're actually not a slouch as a
 

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.810
and we're actually not a slouch as a
state in terms of producing that energy

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:21.820
state in terms of producing that energy
 

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.700
state in terms of producing that energy
and electricity there were second in the

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:23.710
and electricity there were second in the
 

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.500
and electricity there were second in the
nation in terms of electricity

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:25.510
nation in terms of electricity
 

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.210
nation in terms of electricity
production we're second

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.220
production we're second
 

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.460
production we're second
for natural gas production or second for

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:29.470
for natural gas production or second for
 

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.380
for natural gas production or second for
nuclear power generation I mean these

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:31.390
nuclear power generation I mean these
 

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.630
nuclear power generation I mean these
are out of 50 states Pennsylvania is

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640
are out of 50 states Pennsylvania is
 

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.960
are out of 50 states Pennsylvania is
already poised to really be the center

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:36.970
already poised to really be the center
 

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.670
already poised to really be the center
of a lot of the energy production side

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:38.680
of a lot of the energy production side
 

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.070
of a lot of the energy production side
so it is it's the users it's the

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080
so it is it's the users it's the
 

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.200
so it is it's the users it's the
research it's the ideas that are already

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.210
research it's the ideas that are already
 

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.690
research it's the ideas that are already
developing here and then sort of how you

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:45.700
developing here and then sort of how you
 

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.250
developing here and then sort of how you
pull it all together so does the

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:47.260
pull it all together so does the
 

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.810
pull it all together so does the
Allegheny conference have a marketing

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:48.820
Allegheny conference have a marketing
 

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.210
Allegheny conference have a marketing
strategy about energy or related to

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:51.220
strategy about energy or related to
 

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.220
strategy about energy or related to
energy so the Allegheny conference is a

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:53.230
energy so the Allegheny conference is a
 

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.090
energy so the Allegheny conference is a

really what's new now is focusing more

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:03.580
really what's new now is focusing more
 

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.270
really what's new now is focusing more
on the innovation side and on how we can

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.280
on the innovation side and on how we can
 

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.340
on the innovation side and on how we can
do a better job not just us but with a

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:08.350
do a better job not just us but with a
 

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.930
do a better job not just us but with a
lot of partners who are in the room and

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.800
the energy startup assets
here that is sort of something that I

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:20.810
here that is sort of something that I

here that is sort of something that I
think a lot of us have talked about

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:22.730
think a lot of us have talked about
 

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.170
think a lot of us have talked about
being a gap that we've never really

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:25.180
being a gap that we've never really

advantages does Pittsburgh have in
 

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.070
advantages does Pittsburgh have in
either of those two sectors in terms of

either of those two sectors in terms of
 

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.470
either of those two sectors in terms of
resources and competitive advantages

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480

with other regions I think I'll take a

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:17.810
with other regions I think I'll take a
 

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:22.870
with other regions I think I'll take a
stab at that although I think one of the

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880
stab at that although I think one of the
 

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.240
stab at that although I think one of the
things that the positions Pittsburgh to

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.250
things that the positions Pittsburgh to
 

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.740
things that the positions Pittsburgh to
be considered an energy capital of the

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:26.750
be considered an energy capital of the
 

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.500
be considered an energy capital of the
world is that for the most part we take

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:29.510
world is that for the most part we take
 

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.850
world is that for the most part we take
a all of the above approach to energy so

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:32.860
a all of the above approach to energy so
 

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.840
a all of the above approach to energy so
it's not necessarily as limited in scope

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:37.850
it's not necessarily as limited in scope
 

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.730
it's not necessarily as limited in scope
or in category and I think that the

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:42.740
or in category and I think that the
 

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:47.110
or in category and I think that the
innovation piece of that where perhaps a

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120
innovation piece of that where perhaps a
 

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.230
innovation piece of that where perhaps a
little bit more willing to apply new

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240
little bit more willing to apply new
 

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.790
little bit more willing to apply new
technology to existing applications so

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:56.800
technology to existing applications so
 

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.170
technology to existing applications so
what was the what was a question again

00:28:59.170 --> 00:28:59.180
what was the what was a question again
 

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.630
what was the what was a question again
actually what advantages do we have in

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640
actually what advantages do we have in
 

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.770
actually what advantages do we have in
either a traditional fossil fuel energy

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:04.780
either a traditional fossil fuel energy
 

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.770
either a traditional fossil fuel energy
sector or in the alternative clean tech

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:08.780
sector or in the alternative clean tech
 

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.490
sector or in the alternative clean tech
energy sector so I think one of the

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:12.500
energy sector so I think one of the
 

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.410
energy sector so I think one of the
advantages is just experience we've been

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:16.420
advantages is just experience we've been
 

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.070
advantages is just experience we've been
challenged by demand whether it was - in

our fuel plants for a couple centuries

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:25.890
our fuel plants for a couple centuries
 

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.080
our fuel plants for a couple centuries
now so we've had to figure out how to

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.090
now so we've had to figure out how to
 

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.049
now so we've had to figure out how to
innovate whether it was how to burn wood

00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059
innovate whether it was how to burn wood
 

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:37.700
innovate whether it was how to burn wood
how to burn coal other fossil fuels and

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:37.710
how to burn coal other fossil fuels and
 

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:45.190
how to burn coal other fossil fuels and
utilize them and I think that we also

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200
utilize them and I think that we also
 

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.990
utilize them and I think that we also
have then spun out all of these other

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000
have then spun out all of these other
 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.960
have then spun out all of these other
industries that have also had a

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:52.970
industries that have also had a
 

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.430
industries that have also had a
requirement of sorts so whether it was

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440
requirement of sorts so whether it was
 

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.080
requirement of sorts so whether it was
materials expertise that that we gained

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.090
materials expertise that that we gained
 

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.279
materials expertise that that we gained
and then looking at taking that

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:01.289
and then looking at taking that
 

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:02.659
and then looking at taking that
experience and turning it right back

00:30:02.659 --> 00:30:02.669
experience and turning it right back
 

00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:06.380
experience and turning it right back
into applying it into maybe new energy

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:06.390
into applying it into maybe new energy
 

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:10.730
into applying it into maybe new energy
sources or technologies I would I would

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740
sources or technologies I would I would
 

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.610

say it's the diversification that we

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620
say it's the diversification that we
 

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.940
say it's the diversification that we
have here it's not necessarily you know

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:16.950

we're banking on and if you look at the
 

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.770
we're banking on and if you look at the
Gulf Gulf Coast it's is all oil and gas

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:27.780

think what what we lack is that we're

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220
think what what we lack is that we're
 

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.399
think what what we lack is that we're
not capturing it and streamlining it to

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:10.409
not capturing it and streamlining it to
 

00:31:10.409 --> 00:31:13.190
not capturing it and streamlining it to
where it could be commercialized and

where it could be commercialized and
 

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.409
where it could be commercialized and
accelerated and I think once we once we

00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419
accelerated and I think once we once we
 

00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:17.360

bit more complex than that and it takes
 

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.970
bit more complex than that and it takes
and it's a long wave and I think once we

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980
and it's a long wave and I think once we
 

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.610
and it's a long wave and I think once we
figure that out

across the board though we are very

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:26.190
across the board though we are very
 

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:30.710

even the older technologies have on you
know on our communities and we'll

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880
know on our communities and we'll
 

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.880
know on our communities and we'll
continue to try to get better at that -

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:40.890
continue to try to get better at that -

I think climate change is really really

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.090
I think climate change is really really
 

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.690
I think climate change is really really
really big right and sometimes I think

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700
really big right and sometimes I think
 

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:52.430
really big right and sometimes I think
it's so big that people forget you know

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440
it's so big that people forget you know
 

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.920
it's so big that people forget you know
that we can take steps in solving the

there really is that two parts right
there's the production side you know it

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.410
there's the production side you know it
 

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.589
there's the production side you know it
coming where is carbon coming from and

how can we reduce that but then also on

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880
how can we reduce that but then also on
 

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.509
how can we reduce that but then also on
the end user side right reducing our

00:53:13.509 --> 00:53:13.519
the end user side right reducing our

efficiency and again we've got a lot of

00:53:18.219 --> 00:53:18.229
efficiency and again we've got a lot of
 

00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:20.680
efficiency and again we've got a lot of
the leading research and ideas and

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:20.690
the leading research and ideas and
 

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.959

so the one thing we could always use

00:53:30.489 --> 00:53:30.499
so the one thing we could always use
 

00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:32.170
so the one thing we could always use
more of is probably more research

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:32.180
more of is probably more research
 

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.089
more of is probably more research
dollars and that to build off what Jeff

00:53:34.089 --> 00:53:34.099
dollars and that to build off what Jeff
 

00:53:34.099 --> 00:53:35.410
dollars and that to build off what Jeff
was saying that's one thing where as I

if we wanted to actually make it

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:45.170
if we wanted to actually make it
 

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.479

technologies across a couple of fronts
 

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.999
technologies across a couple of fronts
one is sources of energy so example

00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:16.009
one is sources of energy so example
 

00:54:16.009 --> 00:54:17.799
one is sources of energy so example
renewables so we're looking at wind

00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:17.809
renewables so we're looking at wind
 

00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:20.650
renewables so we're looking at wind
power we're looking at solar we're also

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:20.660
power we're looking at solar we're also
 

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.269
power we're looking at solar we're also
looking at the other part of the

00:54:22.269 --> 00:54:22.279
looking at the other part of the
 

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:24.489
looking at the other part of the
equation which is consumption and so we

00:54:24.489 --> 00:54:24.499
equation which is consumption and so we
 

00:54:24.499 --> 00:54:27.309
equation which is consumption and so we
we've invested a ton of money in making

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319
we've invested a ton of money in making
 

00:54:27.319 --> 00:54:30.519
we've invested a ton of money in making
our processes more efficient so you know

00:54:30.519 --> 00:54:30.529
our processes more efficient so you know
 

00:54:30.529 --> 00:54:32.289
our processes more efficient so you know
we've we've come up with new ways one of

00:54:32.289 --> 00:54:32.299
we've we've come up with new ways one of
 

00:54:32.299 --> 00:54:34.479
we've we've come up with new ways one of
the big things we make is chlorine and

00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:34.489
the big things we make is chlorine and
 

00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:36.789
the big things we make is chlorine and
it takes a massive amount of electricity

00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799
it takes a massive amount of electricity
 

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:41.140
it takes a massive amount of electricity
in that and so we spent you know huge

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:41.150
in that and so we spent you know huge
 

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.939
in that and so we spent you know huge
dollars come up with technology that

00:54:42.939 --> 00:54:42.949
dollars come up with technology that
 

00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:44.859
dollars come up with technology that
could reduce that energy usage by 25

00:54:44.859 --> 00:54:44.869
could reduce that energy usage by 25
 

00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:46.839
could reduce that energy usage by 25
percent so I don't think kind of a will

00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:46.849
percent so I don't think kind of a will
 

00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:47.900
percent so I don't think kind of a will

01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:06.819
behind or to get the nation behind
 

01:00:06.819 --> 01:00:09.009
behind or to get the nation behind
factoring in all of the other things

01:00:09.009 --> 01:00:09.019
factoring in all of the other things
 

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:11.739
factoring in all of the other things
that we should be factoring in that are

01:00:11.739 --> 01:00:11.749
that we should be factoring in that are
 

01:00:11.749 --> 01:00:15.370
that we should be factoring in that are
very important to to create that type of

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:15.380
very important to to create that type of
 

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.739
very important to to create that type of
system so you know I think that it's

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:17.749
system so you know I think that it's
 

01:00:17.749 --> 01:00:19.479
system so you know I think that it's
going to happen but I think it's going

01:00:19.479 --> 01:00:19.489
going to happen but I think it's going
 

01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:20.920
going to happen but I think it's going
to continue to take a while before we

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:20.930
to continue to take a while before we
 

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.589
to continue to take a while before we
get there Jeff could you explain to the

01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599
get there Jeff could you explain to the
 

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:26.170
get there Jeff could you explain to the
audience what EU is for the energy IQ

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:26.180
audience what EU is for the energy IQ
 

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.999
audience what EU is for the energy IQ
well I just meant and I just met the

01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:31.009
well I just meant and I just met the
 

01:00:31.009 --> 01:00:34.109
well I just meant and I just met the
European Union in that case and not

01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119
European Union in that case and not
 

01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:37.420
European Union in that case and not
energy you see yeah too many acronyms

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:37.430
energy you see yeah too many acronyms
 

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.579
energy you see yeah too many acronyms
yeah yeah that's right

01:00:41.579 --> 01:00:41.589
 
 

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:46.420
 
okay Jeff and I also were other hats

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:46.430
okay Jeff and I also were other hats
 

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.739
okay Jeff and I also were other hats

anyone interested in climate change it's

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079
anyone interested in climate change it's
 

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.019
anyone interested in climate change it's
a great book he didn't write it but he

01:01:02.019 --> 01:01:02.029
a great book he didn't write it but he
 

01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:03.339
a great book he didn't write it but he
talked to a hundred of the smartest

01:01:03.339 --> 01:01:03.349
talked to a hundred of the smartest
 

01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:05.890
talked to a hundred of the smartest
people in the world who identified and

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:05.900
people in the world who identified and
 

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.269
people in the world who identified and
had been working on climate change

01:01:07.269 --> 01:01:07.279
had been working on climate change
 

01:01:07.279 --> 01:01:09.239
had been working on climate change
issues for years and he identified

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:09.249
issues for years and he identified
 

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:12.039
issues for years and he identified
hundred small things that we can do to

01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:12.049
hundred small things that we can do to
 

01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.849
hundred small things that we can do to
really reverse

01:01:12.849 --> 01:01:12.859
really reverse
 

01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:14.890
really reverse
climate change so I highly recommend

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:14.900
climate change so I highly recommend
 

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.430
climate change so I highly recommend
that to anybody who's interested this

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440
that to anybody who's interested this

nearby university is collaborating on
 

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.749
nearby university is collaborating on
energy innovation research startups what

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:25.759
energy innovation research startups what
 

01:01:25.759 --> 01:01:27.460
energy innovation research startups what
are your opinions on how this can be

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:27.470
are your opinions on how this can be
 

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:35.410
are your opinions on how this can be
improved so a lot of the companies that

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:35.420
improved so a lot of the companies that
 

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.150
improved so a lot of the companies that
end up coming to innovation works are

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160
end up coming to innovation works are
 

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.979
end up coming to innovation works are
going into our accelerators are coming

01:01:38.979 --> 01:01:38.989
going into our accelerators are coming
 

01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:40.989
going into our accelerators are coming
out of the universities here in

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:40.999
out of the universities here in
 

01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:44.259
out of the universities here in
Pittsburgh other universities around the

01:01:44.259 --> 01:01:44.269
Pittsburgh other universities around the
 

01:01:44.269 --> 01:01:50.349
Pittsburgh other universities around the
country and I think that the

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359
country and I think that the
 

01:01:50.359 --> 01:01:53.380
country and I think that the
universities that embrace innovation and

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:53.390
universities that embrace innovation and
 

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.710
universities that embrace innovation and
give students who've got great ideas a

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720
give students who've got great ideas a
 

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.319
give students who've got great ideas a
space to to to grow those ideas is a

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:02.329
space to to to grow those ideas is a
 

01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:05.019
space to to to grow those ideas is a
great thing so we really benefit my

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:05.029
great thing so we really benefit my
 

01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:08.319
great thing so we really benefit my
group from from those universities that

01:02:08.319 --> 01:02:08.329
group from from those universities that
 

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:11.220
group from from those universities that
are supporting it there's a little bit

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:11.230
are supporting it there's a little bit
 

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:13.870
are supporting it there's a little bit
there's more than a billion dollars a

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880
there's more than a billion dollars a
 

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.960
there's more than a billion dollars a
year now coming into the region in

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:18.970
year now coming into the region in
 

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:23.589
year now coming into the region in
federal research dollars and the startup

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599
federal research dollars and the startup
 

01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:26.529
federal research dollars and the startup
community ends up becoming a kind of

01:02:26.529 --> 01:02:26.539
community ends up becoming a kind of
 

01:02:26.539 --> 01:02:30.579
community ends up becoming a kind of
secondary beneficiary of that and so

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:30.589
secondary beneficiary of that and so
 

01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:32.259
secondary beneficiary of that and so
they're able to leverage that once they

01:02:32.259 --> 01:02:32.269
they're able to leverage that once they
 

01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:36.370
they're able to leverage that once they
start their companies but I think that

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:36.380
start their companies but I think that
 

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.079
start their companies but I think that
we can always there's always room to

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:38.089
we can always there's always room to
 

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:41.410
we can always there's always room to
strengthen the connections throughout

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:41.420
strengthen the connections throughout
 

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.059
strengthen the connections throughout
the ecosystem so we could be doing more

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:45.069
the ecosystem so we could be doing more
 

01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:49.059
the ecosystem so we could be doing more
with some of the larger companies that

01:02:49.059 --> 01:02:49.069
with some of the larger companies that
 

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:51.059
with some of the larger companies that
are in the region we could be doing more

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:51.069
are in the region we could be doing more
 

01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:54.940
are in the region we could be doing more
we being the startup community of

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:54.950
we being the startup community of
 

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.859
we being the startup community of
connecting and maybe even deeper into

01:02:56.859 --> 01:02:56.869
connecting and maybe even deeper into
 

01:02:56.869 --> 01:03:00.299
connecting and maybe even deeper into
the universities figuring out how we can

01:03:00.299 --> 01:03:00.309
the universities figuring out how we can
 

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:05.829
the universities figuring out how we can
move faster this next question goes back

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839
move faster this next question goes back
 

01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:08.499
move faster this next question goes back
to the fossil fuel industry what's the

01:03:08.499 --> 01:03:08.509
to the fossil fuel industry what's the
 

01:03:08.509 --> 01:03:10.599
to the fossil fuel industry what's the
Holy Grail you see in oil and gas

01:03:10.599 --> 01:03:10.609
Holy Grail you see in oil and gas
 

01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:12.940
Holy Grail you see in oil and gas
technology referring to what would be

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:12.950
technology referring to what would be
 

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:18.590
technology referring to what would be
the ideal disrupter to the industry

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:18.600
 
 

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.260
 
well I think it depends because from

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:21.270
well I think it depends because from
 

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.080
well I think it depends because from
from a petrochemical standpoint it's

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:24.090
from a petrochemical standpoint it's
 

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.020
from a petrochemical standpoint it's
really looking at it going from those

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.030
really looking at it going from those
 

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:30.110
really looking at it going from those
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:30.120
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a
 

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.150
fossil fuels to bio-based and that's a
huge challenge if that's if that you

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160
huge challenge if that's if that you
 

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.940
huge challenge if that's if that you
know making that a reality would would

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:34.950
know making that a reality would would
 

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.010
know making that a reality would would
would be a huge step forward in this

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020
would be a huge step forward in this
 

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.410
would be a huge step forward in this
this whole sustainability aspect of of

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420
this whole sustainability aspect of of
 

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.050
this whole sustainability aspect of of
production of all the plastics and

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:42.060
production of all the plastics and
 

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.340
production of all the plastics and
polymers that we use on a day to day

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:43.350
polymers that we use on a day to day
 

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:45.620
polymers that we use on a day to day
basis so that would be enormous from an

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:45.630
basis so that would be enormous from an
 

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:46.880
basis so that would be enormous from an
energy standpoint it states the

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:46.890
energy standpoint it states the
 

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.620
energy standpoint it states the
renewables basically you're not going to

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:48.630
renewables basically you're not going to
 

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:51.350
renewables basically you're not going to
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:51.360
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think
 

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.040
use fossil fuels anymore I mean I think
we we know that at least from a

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.050
we we know that at least from a
 

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:57.680
we we know that at least from a
transportation fuel standpoint we are

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:57.690
transportation fuel standpoint we are
 

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.590
transportation fuel standpoint we are
not going to be as dependent on fossil

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:00.600
not going to be as dependent on fossil
 

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.860
not going to be as dependent on fossil
fuels as we have been now there's going

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:03.870
fuels as we have been now there's going
 

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:07.610
fuels as we have been now there's going
to be a shift in in other areas as well

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:07.620
to be a shift in in other areas as well
 

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.990
to be a shift in in other areas as well
but I think it's I think it's clear that

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000
but I think it's I think it's clear that
 

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.580
but I think it's I think it's clear that
Eevee will be the predominant

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:15.590
Eevee will be the predominant
 

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:18.620
Eevee will be the predominant
transportation technology within our

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:18.630
transportation technology within our
 

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:23.300
transportation technology within our
lifetimes for most applications and so I

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:23.310
lifetimes for most applications and so I
 

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:27.860
lifetimes for most applications and so I
think that is driving unintended you

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:27.870
think that is driving unintended you
 

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.590
think that is driving unintended you
know driving us away from the dependency

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:30.600
know driving us away from the dependency
 

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.810
know driving us away from the dependency
at least in some areas of the energy

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:32.820
at least in some areas of the energy
 

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.400
at least in some areas of the energy
sector on and where I've said it really

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:37.410
sector on and where I've said it really
 

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:40.130
sector on and where I've said it really
seems like energy storage technology is

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140
seems like energy storage technology is
 

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.840
seems like energy storage technology is

add are going to be people in those less
 

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080
add are going to be people in those less
developed countries and so we've got

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.090
developed countries and so we've got
 

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:52.180
developed countries and so we've got
about 33% more people coming on board

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:52.190
about 33% more people coming on board
 

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:55.240
about 33% more people coming on board
between now and 2050 and if you look at

that's I think that's at a par in terms

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520
that's I think that's at a par in terms
 

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.090
that's I think that's at a par in terms
of quality of life with what many folks

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:31.100
of quality of life with what many folks
 

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.770
of quality of life with what many folks
in more developed countries have at the

01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:32.780
in more developed countries have at the
 

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.830
in more developed countries have at the
same time our greatest scientists are

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840
same time our greatest scientists are
 

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.450
same time our greatest scientists are
telling us well we need to be providing

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:37.460
telling us well we need to be providing
 

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.340
telling us well we need to be providing
so many more resources over the next 30

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:39.350
so many more resources over the next 30
 

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.680
so many more resources over the next 30
years the best scientists in the world

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:41.690
years the best scientists in the world
 

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:43.600
years the best scientists in the world
have made it clear to us now that we

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:43.610
have made it clear to us now that we
 

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:45.070
have made it clear to us now that we
need to reduce our greenhouse gas

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080
need to reduce our greenhouse gas
 

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.580
need to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:48.590
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x
 

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:51.010
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x
over the next just over the next thirty

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:51.020
over the next just over the next thirty
 

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.220
over the next just over the next thirty
years going to 2050 so to me this is our

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:54.230
years going to 2050 so to me this is our
 

01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:55.240
years going to 2050 so to me this is our
defining challenge

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:55.250
defining challenge
 

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:56.490
defining challenge
we've got to provide a lot more

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:56.500
we've got to provide a lot more
 

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.170
we've got to provide a lot more
resources and services to people so we

01:14:59.170 --> 01:14:59.180
resources and services to people so we
 

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.480
resources and services to people so we
can get the global middle class growing

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:01.490
can get the global middle class growing
 

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:04.600
can get the global middle class growing
and create human wellbeing at the same

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:04.610
and create human wellbeing at the same
 

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:07.060
and create human wellbeing at the same
time we've got a 5x challenge in terms

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:07.070
time we've got a 5x challenge in terms
 

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.250
time we've got a 5x challenge in terms
of reducing our emissions so this is a

01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:09.260
of reducing our emissions so this is a
 

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.500
of reducing our emissions so this is a
huge challenge a huge opportunity and

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:11.510
huge challenge a huge opportunity and
 

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.720
huge challenge a huge opportunity and
the way I like to frame this up is in

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:13.730
the way I like to frame this up is in
 

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:17.380
the way I like to frame this up is in
the context of a 70 Giga ton per year of

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:17.390
the context of a 70 Giga ton per year of
 

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:20.380
the context of a 70 Giga ton per year of
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:20.390
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if
 

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:21.730
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if
you look at just about where we are

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:21.740
you look at just about where we are
 

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.800
you look at just about where we are
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:23.810
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per
 

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.740
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per
year of emissions and if you look at all

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:26.750
year of emissions and if you look at all
 

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:29.430
year of emissions and if you look at all
of the projections for where we might go

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440
of the projections for where we might go
 

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.230
of the projections for where we might go
the middle case projection which i think

01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:32.240
the middle case projection which i think
 

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.540
the middle case projection which i think
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:34.550
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at
 

01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:37.060
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at
about 80 and so if you look at that

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:37.070
about 80 and so if you look at that
 

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:40.270
about 80 and so if you look at that
future where we may be headed versus

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280
future where we may be headed versus
 

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.670
future where we may be headed versus
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:42.680
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga
 

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.690
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga
ton gap which is pretty significant and

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:45.700
ton gap which is pretty significant and
 

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.700
ton gap which is pretty significant and
the way that we view this is that we're

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:48.710
the way that we view this is that we're
 

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.810
the way that we view this is that we're
quite optimistic there are a lot of

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:49.820
quite optimistic there are a lot of
 

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.520
quite optimistic there are a lot of
great technologies that are now in the

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:51.530
great technologies that are now in the
 

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.290
great technologies that are now in the
market are coming down in costs we have

01:21:04.299 --> 01:21:04.309
emissions and that's about 1% of today's
 

01:21:04.309 --> 01:21:07.660
emissions and that's about 1% of today's
of today's emissions and so from our

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:07.670
of today's emissions and so from our
 

01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:09.520
of today's emissions and so from our
perspective that's the the opportunity

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:09.530
perspective that's the the opportunity
 

01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:12.939
perspective that's the the opportunity
to challenge the partnership that we

01:21:12.939 --> 01:21:12.949
to challenge the partnership that we
 

01:21:12.949 --> 01:21:14.739
to challenge the partnership that we
want to put forward to you and other

01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:14.749
want to put forward to you and other
 

01:21:14.749 --> 01:21:16.839
want to put forward to you and other
innovators all around the world is what

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:16.849
innovators all around the world is what
 

01:21:16.849 --> 01:21:20.469
innovators all around the world is what
are those half Giga ton impact problems

01:21:20.469 --> 01:21:20.479
are those half Giga ton impact problems
 

01:21:20.479 --> 01:21:23.080
are those half Giga ton impact problems
and what are your ideas to build great

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:23.090
and what are your ideas to build great
 

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:24.669
and what are your ideas to build great
companies around those and we call this

01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679
companies around those and we call this
 

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:27.879
companies around those and we call this
the half Giga ton year challenge and so

01:21:27.879 --> 01:21:27.889
the half Giga ton year challenge and so
 

01:21:27.889 --> 01:21:29.649
the half Giga ton year challenge and so
what you just kind of abstract what's

01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:29.659
what you just kind of abstract what's
 

01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:32.620
what you just kind of abstract what's
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:32.630
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to
 

01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:33.969
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to
kind of frame it up for you

01:21:33.969 --> 01:21:33.979
kind of frame it up for you
 

01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:37.089
kind of frame it up for you
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts

01:21:37.089 --> 01:21:37.099
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts
 

01:21:37.099 --> 01:21:43.600
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts
of wind or solar replacing Hall or about

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:43.610
of wind or solar replacing Hall or about
 

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:45.549
of wind or solar replacing Hall or about
50 billion gallons per year of zero

01:21:45.549 --> 01:21:45.559
50 billion gallons per year of zero
 

01:21:45.559 --> 01:21:47.469
50 billion gallons per year of zero
carbon transport fuels like like second

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:47.479
carbon transport fuels like like second
 

01:21:47.479 --> 01:21:49.419
carbon transport fuels like like second
generation biofuels so this kind of

01:21:49.419 --> 01:21:49.429
generation biofuels so this kind of
 

01:21:49.429 --> 01:21:52.000
generation biofuels so this kind of
frames up how big we're talking here and

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:52.010
frames up how big we're talking here and
 

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:54.790
frames up how big we're talking here and
to put that in comparison 2016 over the

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800
to put that in comparison 2016 over the
 

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.229
to put that in comparison 2016 over the
history of mankind we had deployed about

01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239
history of mankind we had deployed about
 

01:21:56.239 --> 01:21:59.560
history of mankind we had deployed about
500 gigawatts of wind power about twice

01:21:59.560 --> 01:21:59.570
500 gigawatts of wind power about twice
 

01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:02.199
500 gigawatts of wind power about twice
that half gig at time and then if you

01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:02.209
that half gig at time and then if you
 

01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:03.969
that half gig at time and then if you
look at how you know the 50 million

01:22:03.969 --> 01:22:03.979
look at how you know the 50 million
 

01:22:03.979 --> 01:22:05.859
look at how you know the 50 million
gallons is about a third of all of us

01:22:05.859 --> 01:22:05.869
gallons is about a third of all of us
 

01:22:05.869 --> 01:22:08.469
gallons is about a third of all of us
gasoline demand today so you know a half

01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:08.479
gasoline demand today so you know a half
 

01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:11.560
gasoline demand today so you know a half
a Giga ton win is is a really just put

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:11.570
a Giga ton win is is a really just put
 

01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:12.759
a Giga ton win is is a really just put
it in perspective is that really it's a

01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:12.769
it in perspective is that really it's a
 

01:22:12.769 --> 01:22:14.560
it in perspective is that really it's a
high bar there aren't a huge number of

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:14.570
high bar there aren't a huge number of
 

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:16.930
high bar there aren't a huge number of
problems that if you solve them are half

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:16.940
problems that if you solve them are half
 

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.279
problems that if you solve them are half
Giga ton kind of problems but those are

01:22:18.279 --> 01:22:18.289
Giga ton kind of problems but those are
 

01:22:18.289 --> 01:22:19.930
Giga ton kind of problems but those are
the problems we're interested in and in

01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:19.940
the problems we're interested in and in
 

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.810
the problems we're interested in and in
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I

01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:22.820
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I
 

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.879
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I
wanted to also frame up the economic

01:22:24.879 --> 01:22:24.889
wanted to also frame up the economic
 

01:22:24.889 --> 01:22:27.100
wanted to also frame up the economic
opportunity and I was trying to think of

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:27.110
opportunity and I was trying to think of
 

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:28.899
opportunity and I was trying to think of
a good comparison about you know how

01:22:28.899 --> 01:22:28.909
a good comparison about you know how
 

01:22:28.909 --> 01:22:31.359
a good comparison about you know how
many large companies are likely to be

01:22:31.359 --> 01:22:31.369
many large companies are likely to be
 

01:22:31.369 --> 01:22:34.899
many large companies are likely to be
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton

01:22:34.899 --> 01:22:34.909
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton
 

01:22:34.909 --> 01:22:36.669
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton
gap closing and so I looked at

01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679
gap closing and so I looked at
 

01:22:36.679 --> 01:22:38.739
gap closing and so I looked at
ExxonMobil if you look at their amount

01:22:38.739 --> 01:22:38.749
ExxonMobil if you look at their amount
 

01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:40.689
ExxonMobil if you look at their amount
of production of fossil fuels it was

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:40.699
of production of fossil fuels it was
 

01:22:40.699 --> 01:22:43.449
of production of fossil fuels it was
about 0.6 around 1/2 a Giga ton per year

01:22:43.449 --> 01:22:43.459
about 0.6 around 1/2 a Giga ton per year
 

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:45.669
about 0.6 around 1/2 a Giga ton per year
last year and that company's worth about

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679
last year and that company's worth about
 

01:22:45.679 --> 01:22:48.160
last year and that company's worth about
80 billion dollars and so if you take

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:48.170
80 billion dollars and so if you take
 

01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:50.830
80 billion dollars and so if you take
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's
 

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.859
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's
140 you're 70 divided by 0.5 half a Giga

01:22:53.859 --> 01:22:53.869
140 you're 70 divided by 0.5 half a Giga
 

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:57.069
140 you're 70 divided by 0.5 half a Giga
ton more than a hundred Exxon Mobil kind

01:22:57.069 --> 01:22:57.079
ton more than a hundred Exxon Mobil kind
 

01:22:57.079 --> 01:22:58.540
ton more than a hundred Exxon Mobil kind
of economic opportunities are on the

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:58.550
of economic opportunities are on the
 

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:01.419
of economic opportunities are on the
table out to 2050 so this is a big huge

01:23:01.419 --> 01:23:01.429
table out to 2050 so this is a big huge
 

01:23:01.429 --> 01:23:03.339
table out to 2050 so this is a big huge
opportunity so that's why we think we

01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:03.349
opportunity so that's why we think we
 

01:23:03.349 --> 01:23:04.959
opportunity so that's why we think we
can create a huge impact but also create

01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:04.969
can create a huge impact but also create
 

01:23:04.969 --> 01:23:07.390
can create a huge impact but also create
huge companies by doing what we're

01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400
huge companies by doing what we're
 

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.589
huge companies by doing what we're
looking to do a breakthrough energy

01:23:08.589 --> 01:23:08.599
looking to do a breakthrough energy
 

01:23:08.599 --> 01:23:11.109
looking to do a breakthrough energy
ventures so I wanted to frame it up you

01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:11.119
ventures so I wanted to frame it up you
 

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.370
ventures so I wanted to frame it up you
know that we were trying to think a

01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:12.380
know that we were trying to think a
 

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.629
know that we were trying to think a
little bit differently you know there

01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639
little bit differently you know there
 

01:23:13.639 --> 01:23:16.299
little bit differently you know there
there were some successes but a lot of

01:23:16.299 --> 01:23:16.309
there were some successes but a lot of
 

01:23:16.309 --> 01:23:18.279
there were some successes but a lot of
failures in clean tech 1.0 so we've been

01:23:18.279 --> 01:23:18.289
failures in clean tech 1.0 so we've been
 

01:23:18.289 --> 01:23:19.839
failures in clean tech 1.0 so we've been
trying to think hard about how are we

01:23:19.839 --> 01:23:19.849
trying to think hard about how are we
 

01:23:19.849 --> 01:23:21.459
trying to think hard about how are we
going to do things differently you know

01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:21.469
going to do things differently you know

prices at scale in many places so this

01:24:34.329 --> 01:24:34.339
prices at scale in many places so this
 

01:24:34.339 --> 01:24:36.790

of exponential learning curve and that's
 

01:25:34.939 --> 01:25:36.040
of exponential learning curve and that's
something that we're paying a lot of

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:36.050
something that we're paying a lot of
 

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:38.799

one of the big challenges that I saw in
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go

01:25:45.609 --> 01:25:45.619
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go
 

01:25:45.619 --> 01:25:48.609
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go
build these really big plants and you

01:25:48.609 --> 01:25:48.619
build these really big plants and you
 

01:25:48.619 --> 01:25:50.349
build these really big plants and you
know let's say a biofuels plant you put

01:25:50.349 --> 01:25:50.359
know let's say a biofuels plant you put
 

01:25:50.359 --> 01:25:51.609
know let's say a biofuels plant you put
a bunch of money a new company you do

01:25:51.609 --> 01:25:51.619
a bunch of money a new company you do
 

01:25:51.619 --> 01:25:53.649
a bunch of money a new company you do
the science you do the engineering it

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:53.659
the science you do the engineering it
 

01:25:53.659 --> 01:25:55.029
the science you do the engineering it
looks like it works then you go build a

01:25:55.029 --> 01:25:55.039
looks like it works then you go build a
 

01:25:55.039 --> 01:25:57.279
looks like it works then you go build a
pilot then you go build a demo then you

01:25:57.279 --> 01:25:57.289
pilot then you go build a demo then you
 

01:25:57.289 --> 01:25:59.199
pilot then you go build a demo then you
build a first commercial and none of

01:25:59.199 --> 01:25:59.209
build a first commercial and none of
 

01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.979
build a first commercial and none of
those are profitable

01:25:59.979 --> 01:25:59.989
those are profitable
 

01:25:59.989 --> 01:26:01.839
those are profitable
you know that is a lot of risk to take

01:26:01.839 --> 01:26:01.849
you know that is a lot of risk to take
 

01:26:01.849 --> 01:26:04.120
you know that is a lot of risk to take
on and so one thing that we're

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.130
on and so one thing that we're
 

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.709
on and so one thing that we're
particularly interested in is investing

01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719
particularly interested in is investing
 

01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:07.720
particularly interested in is investing
in distributed modular technologies

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:07.730
in distributed modular technologies
 

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.660
in distributed modular technologies
where you can get in the market with and

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:10.670
where you can get in the market with and
 

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:14.109
where you can get in the market with and
actually be profitable and get into kind

01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119
actually be profitable and get into kind
 

01:26:14.119 --> 01:26:15.970
actually be profitable and get into kind
of niche first markets with modular

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:15.980
of niche first markets with modular
 

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.319
of niche first markets with modular
smaller technologies as opposed to

01:26:17.319 --> 01:26:17.329
smaller technologies as opposed to
 

01:26:17.329 --> 01:26:19.270
smaller technologies as opposed to
having to bite off that multi hundred

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280
having to bite off that multi hundred
 

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.770
having to bite off that multi hundred
million dollar bet before you have any

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:20.780
million dollar bet before you have any
 

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:24.520

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:40.569
geographies and backing them and then
finally urbanization and so what we're

01:27:40.569 --> 01:27:40.579
finally urbanization and so what we're
 

01:27:40.579 --> 01:27:42.250
finally urbanization and so what we're
seeing is with the rapid move towards

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:42.260
seeing is with the rapid move towards
 

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.779
seeing is with the rapid move towards
urbanization we're much more interested

01:27:43.779 --> 01:27:43.789
urbanization we're much more interested
 

01:27:43.789 --> 01:27:44.770
urbanization we're much more interested
in solutions that are going to solve

01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:44.780
in solutions that are going to solve
 

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.870
in solutions that are going to solve
urban problems than problems that are

urban problems than problems that are
 

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.290
urban problems than problems that are

those they're by no means comprehensive
 

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.400
those they're by no means comprehensive
you may have ideas in other areas if you

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:18.410
you may have ideas in other areas if you
 

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:19.960
you may have ideas in other areas if you

so we're really we have sub teams you
 

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:25.990
so we're really we have sub teams you
have teams around these five sectors

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000
have teams around these five sectors
 

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.400
have teams around these five sectors
each of which have very significant

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:27.410
each of which have very significant

01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280
and buildings and I'm going to talk
 

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.850
and buildings and I'm going to talk
about examples of things that were very

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:36.860
about examples of things that were very
 

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.680
about examples of things that were very
interested in each of those areas except

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:38.690
interested in each of those areas except
 

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:41.080
interested in each of those areas except
for buildings and but we are still very

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:41.090
for buildings and but we are still very
 

01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:42.400
for buildings and but we are still very
interested in buildings just a matter of

really one of the big mega trends that

01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440
really one of the big mega trends that
 

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.830
really one of the big mega trends that
we are we are investing around that we

01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840
we are we are investing around that we
 

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.840
we are we are investing around that we
believe in we've analyzed is this ultra

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:52.850
believe in we've analyzed is this ultra
 

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:54.820
believe in we've analyzed is this ultra
low-cost renewable electricity again

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:54.830
low-cost renewable electricity again
 

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.100
low-cost renewable electricity again
we're seeing two three cents per

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:57.110
we're seeing two three cents per
 

01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:00.700
we're seeing two three cents per
kilowatt hour wind and solar PBA's we

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:00.710
kilowatt hour wind and solar PBA's we
 

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:03.790
kilowatt hour wind and solar PBA's we
are being told that people expect to see

01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800
are being told that people expect to see
 

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.980
are being told that people expect to see
some of the the first one cent per

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:05.990
some of the the first one cent per
 

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:08.260
some of the the first one cent per

America coming up soon and you know we

01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:10.640
America coming up soon and you know we
 

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.670
America coming up soon and you know we
it's slowing but we see this continuing

01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:12.680
it's slowing but we see this continuing
 

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.100
it's slowing but we see this continuing
to move so what are the opportunities

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:15.110
to move so what are the opportunities
 

01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:17.140
to move so what are the opportunities
and challenges that you get when you

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:17.150
and challenges that you get when you
 

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:19.720
and challenges that you get when you
can't when you are in a world awash in 1

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:19.730
can't when you are in a world awash in 1
 

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.760
can't when you are in a world awash in 1
2 3 cent per kilowatt hour but

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:21.770
2 3 cent per kilowatt hour but
 

01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:23.740
2 3 cent per kilowatt hour but
intermittent or a low capacity factor

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:23.750
intermittent or a low capacity factor
 

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:26.020
intermittent or a low capacity factor
wind and solar and so one of the areas

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:26.030
wind and solar and so one of the areas
 

01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:28.990
wind and solar and so one of the areas
that we're really interested in is in

01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000
that we're really interested in is in
 

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.050
that we're really interested in is in
ultra long duration grid storage so this

01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:32.060
ultra long duration grid storage so this
 

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:33.730
ultra long duration grid storage so this
is as you're getting higher and higher

01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:33.740
is as you're getting higher and higher
 

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.490
is as you're getting higher and higher
penetrations of wind and solar you know

01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:36.500
penetrations of wind and solar you know
 

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:37.960
penetrations of wind and solar you know
what are the challenges you get is that

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:37.970
what are the challenges you get is that
 

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.580
what are the challenges you get is that
these are bidding into the market when

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:39.590
these are bidding into the market when
 

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:41.410
these are bidding into the market when
they're available right and so

01:29:41.410 --> 01:29:41.420
they're available right and so
 

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.570
they're available right and so
essentially they bid in at zero because

01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:43.580
essentially they bid in at zero because
 

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.640
essentially they bid in at zero because
they have no marginal cost no fuel costs

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:45.650
they have no marginal cost no fuel costs
 

01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:47.500
they have no marginal cost no fuel costs
and so as you bid in more and more you

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:47.510
and so as you bid in more and more you
 

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:49.990
and so as you bid in more and more you
where you're you know if you're a solar

01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000
where you're you know if you're a solar
 

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.430
where you're you know if you're a solar
plant and you're bidding in the middle

01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440
plant and you're bidding in the middle
 

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.750
plant and you're bidding in the middle
of the day the more and more solar there

01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760
of the day the more and more solar there
 

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.330
of the day the more and more solar there
is the lower the price is getting

01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:54.340
is the lower the price is getting
 

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:56.920
is the lower the price is getting
there's a bit of a falling knife problem

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:56.930
there's a bit of a falling knife problem
 

01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:58.360
there's a bit of a falling knife problem
I think that when you get to higher and

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:58.370
I think that when you get to higher and
 

01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:59.830
I think that when you get to higher and
higher penetrations of wind and solar

01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840
higher penetrations of wind and solar
 

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.810
higher penetrations of wind and solar
the price that you're gonna get paid is

01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:01.820
the price that you're gonna get paid is
 

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.460
the price that you're gonna get paid is
getting lower and lower and lower and

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:03.470
getting lower and lower and lower and
 

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:05.080
getting lower and lower and lower and
you're kind of chasing that cost curve

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:05.090
you're kind of chasing that cost curve
 

01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:08.260
you're kind of chasing that cost curve
and so you need other technologies in

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:08.270
and so you need other technologies in
 

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:10.870
and so you need other technologies in
our view like grid storage to help

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880
our view like grid storage to help
 

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.450
our view like grid storage to help
ameliorate the the issues that you face

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:13.460
ameliorate the the issues that you face
 

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.490
ameliorate the the issues that you face
around getting really high penetrations

01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:15.500
around getting really high penetrations
 

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.500
around getting really high penetrations
of wind and solar that you're going to

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:17.510
of wind and solar that you're going to
 

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:19.480
of wind and solar that you're going to
need to dramatically decarbonize the

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:19.490
need to dramatically decarbonize the
 

01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:22.960
need to dramatically decarbonize the
grid and so lithium ion is going coming

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:22.970
grid and so lithium ion is going coming
 

01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:25.250
grid and so lithium ion is going coming
down so fast yeah

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260
down so fast yeah
 

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.260
down so fast yeah
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:27.270
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a
 

01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:29.060
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a
lot of analysis in this area but you

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:29.070
lot of analysis in this area but you
 

01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:30.920
lot of analysis in this area but you
know when we talked to experts they say

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:30.930
know when we talked to experts they say
 

01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:32.990
know when we talked to experts they say
10 years from now they wouldn't be

01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000
10 years from now they wouldn't be
 

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.870
10 years from now they wouldn't be
shocked if a fully installed grid

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880
shocked if a fully installed grid
 

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.480
shocked if a fully installed grid
storage plant with lithium ion is $150

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:38.490
storage plant with lithium ion is $150
 

01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:40.280
storage plant with lithium ion is $150
per kilowatt hour and they definitely

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:40.290
per kilowatt hour and they definitely
 

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:42.650
per kilowatt hour and they definitely
wouldn't completely bet against it being

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:42.660
wouldn't completely bet against it being
 

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.930
wouldn't completely bet against it being
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more

01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more
 

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.730
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour

01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:46.740
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour
 

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.430
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour
today and so you know that is low enough

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440
today and so you know that is low enough
 

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.250
today and so you know that is low enough
to cover multiple hours right so let's

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260
to cover multiple hours right so let's
 

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.440
to cover multiple hours right so let's
say five six seven eight hours that you

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:54.450
say five six seven eight hours that you
 

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:58.030
say five six seven eight hours that you
might need to provide some buffering of

01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040
might need to provide some buffering of
 

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.400
might need to provide some buffering of
renewable power provide some firming and

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:01.410
renewable power provide some firming and
 

01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:03.140
renewable power provide some firming and
so I'd say on one hand were very

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:03.150
so I'd say on one hand were very
 

01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:05.750
so I'd say on one hand were very
interested in any technology solution

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760
interested in any technology solution
 

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.330
interested in any technology solution
that can get below that about $100 per

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340
that can get below that about $100 per
 

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.700
that can get below that about $100 per
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:10.710
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to
 

01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:12.680
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to
us that are higher than that we think

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:12.690
us that are higher than that we think
 

01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:15.650
us that are higher than that we think
it's probably a a big gamble in terms of

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:15.660
it's probably a a big gamble in terms of
 

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:17.630
it's probably a a big gamble in terms of
where we see with the amaya ongoing so

01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:17.640
where we see with the amaya ongoing so
 

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.420
where we see with the amaya ongoing so
that's kind of a floor so it we're

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:20.430
that's kind of a floor so it we're
 

01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.040
that's kind of a floor so it we're
interested in things that are below $100

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:22.050
interested in things that are below $100
 

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:22.940
interested in things that are below $100

a lot of people think about that we're
 

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.080
a lot of people think about that we're

noisy chart but you know you can see

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:33.150
noisy chart but you know you can see
 

01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:35.030

are kind of two use cases that would be

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:49.170
are kind of two use cases that would be
 

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.680
are kind of two use cases that would be
in the like hundreds to thousands of

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:12.090
base load asset but in order to do that
 

01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:13.670

you need something that's on the order

01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:13.680
you need something that's on the order
 

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.240
you need something that's on the order
of $20 per kilowatt hour and then when

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:17.250
of $20 per kilowatt hour and then when
 

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:18.800

are moving in that direction that you
actually have this seasonal imbalance

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:32.790
actually have this seasonal imbalance
 

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:35.390
actually have this seasonal imbalance
right like the the amount of Sun that

01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400
right like the the amount of Sun that
 

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.270
right like the the amount of Sun that
you get on an average day in Germany at

in the winter than it is in the summer
so you need to find ways to buffer

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:43.650
so you need to find ways to buffer
 

01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:46.490
so you need to find ways to buffer
energy over over months you know over a

01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500
energy over over months you know over a
 

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.700
energy over over months you know over a
thousand hours and so the when you're

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:49.710
thousand hours and so the when you're
 

01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:51.230
thousand hours and so the when you're
looking at the kind of base load

01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:51.240
looking at the kind of base load
 

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.510

renewables case you need about something

01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520
renewables case you need about something
 

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.120
renewables case you need about something
like twenty cycles a year not a daily

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:56.130
like twenty cycles a year not a daily
 

01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:57.800
like twenty cycles a year not a daily
cycle but something like 20 deep cycles

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:57.810
cycle but something like 20 deep cycles
 

01:32:57.810 --> 01:32:59.360
cycle but something like 20 deep cycles
a year and you need to get down to about

01:32:59.360 --> 01:32:59.370
a year and you need to get down to about
 

01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:00.890
a year and you need to get down to about
like I said $20 per kilowatt or if you

01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900
like I said $20 per kilowatt or if you
 

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.510
like I said $20 per kilowatt or if you
want to do that seasonal you need to get

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520
want to do that seasonal you need to get
 

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.790
want to do that seasonal you need to get
into the realm of like $1 per kilowatt

01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800
into the realm of like $1 per kilowatt
 

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.620
into the realm of like $1 per kilowatt
hour and so when we've been out talking

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:06.630
hour and so when we've been out talking
 

01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:08.030

to the community this is a use case that

01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040
to the community this is a use case that
 

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.470
to the community this is a use case that
a lot of people hadn't thought of and

01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480
a lot of people hadn't thought of and
 

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.690
a lot of people hadn't thought of and
basically what it means is there are an

01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:11.700
basically what it means is there are an
 

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:14.330
basically what it means is there are an
extremely limited set of materials that

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340
extremely limited set of materials that
 

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.750
extremely limited set of materials that
are cheap enough to even go $20 peel-out

01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760
are cheap enough to even go $20 peel-out
 

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.120
are cheap enough to even go $20 peel-out
hour or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:20.130
hour or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so
 

01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:21.650
hour or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so
you end up having to try to figure out

01:33:21.650 --> 01:33:21.660
you end up having to try to figure out
 

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:23.750
you end up having to try to figure out

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:34.650
cost materials and make a storage system
 

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:37.250

that can be at that kind of cost and

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260
that can be at that kind of cost and
 

01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:38.780
that can be at that kind of cost and
well it's also interesting because it

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:38.790
well it's also interesting because it
 

01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:40.340
well it's also interesting because it

time you know we don't believe that
storage is the panacea right so you're

01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360
storage is the panacea right so you're
 

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.930
storage is the panacea right so you're
gonna need in addition to a lot of

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940
gonna need in addition to a lot of
 

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.570
gonna need in addition to a lot of
renewables that wind and good amounts of

01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:17.580
renewables that wind and good amounts of
 

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.010
renewables that wind and good amounts of
very low cost storage you're gonna need

01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020
very low cost storage you're gonna need
 

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.920
very low cost storage you're gonna need
other dispatchable scalable zero

greenhouse gas electricity sources so

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:23.550
greenhouse gas electricity sources so
 

01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:25.490
greenhouse gas electricity sources so
we're looking at nuclear we're looking

01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500
we're looking at nuclear we're looking
 

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.160
we're looking at nuclear we're looking
at CCS but in terms of the megatrends I

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:28.170
at CCS but in terms of the megatrends I
 

01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:29.690
at CCS but in terms of the megatrends I
talked to you about one area that I am

01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:29.700
talked to you about one area that I am
 

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:30.770
talked to you about one area that I am
particularly interested in we're

01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780
particularly interested in we're
 

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:33.410
particularly interested in we're
particularly in turmoil and so you know

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420
particularly in turmoil and so you know
 

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.970
particularly in turmoil and so you know
geothermal has been really niche right

01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:34.980
geothermal has been really niche right
 

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:38.090
geothermal has been really niche right
it's like a couple gigawatts it's you

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100
it's like a couple gigawatts it's you
 

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.730
it's like a couple gigawatts it's you
know 1% or less of North American

01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:40.740
know 1% or less of North American
 

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.860
know 1% or less of North American
electricity and if you look at most

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:42.870
electricity and if you look at most
 

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:44.540
electricity and if you look at most
projections almost all projections it's

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:44.550
projections almost all projections it's
 

01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:46.580
projections almost all projections it's
there for the next 3040 years out to

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:46.590
there for the next 3040 years out to
 

01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:49.850
there for the next 3040 years out to
2050 but when you look at when you look

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860
2050 but when you look at when you look
 

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.890
2050 but when you look at when you look
at the shale boom

01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900
at the shale boom
 

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:54.709
at the shale boom
right there were projections at do-e of

01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719
right there were projections at do-e of
 

01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:56.540
right there were projections at do-e of
where natural gas production would go

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:56.550
where natural gas production would go
 

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:58.870
where natural gas production would go
and when shale came in it diverged

01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880
and when shale came in it diverged
 

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.490
and when shale came in it diverged
exponentially and so we think there's a

01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500
exponentially and so we think there's a
 

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.050
exponentially and so we think there's a
really interesting intersectional

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060
really interesting intersectional
 

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:07.130
really interesting intersectional

01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:21.439
technology from the oil and gas industry
that's moving on an exponential curve

01:35:21.439 --> 01:35:21.449
that's moving on an exponential curve
 

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:24.080
that's moving on an exponential curve
into the geothermal space and we're

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:24.090
into the geothermal space and we're
 

01:35:24.090 --> 01:35:25.100
into the geothermal space and we're
working with some innovators in this

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:25.110
working with some innovators in this
 

01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:26.750
working with some innovators in this
area we actually think this there's a

01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760
area we actually think this there's a
 

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.640
area we actually think this there's a
real shot that this could be a

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:28.650
real shot that this could be a
 

01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:30.760
real shot that this could be a

shale technology learning curve in terms
of transportation big you know actually

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:37.350
of transportation big you know actually
 

01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:39.260
of transportation big you know actually
interesting is about 15 percent of

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:39.270
interesting is about 15 percent of
 

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:40.850
interesting is about 15 percent of
global greenhouse gas emissions which is

01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860
global greenhouse gas emissions which is
 

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.770
global greenhouse gas emissions which is
kind of low as a sector but that's gonna

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780
kind of low as a sector but that's gonna
 

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.510
kind of low as a sector but that's gonna
go up like crazy as the rest of the

01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520
go up like crazy as the rest of the
 

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.660

everyone starts buying cars all around

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960
everyone starts buying cars all around
 

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.720
everyone starts buying cars all around
the world and so we've done a lot of

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:50.730
the world and so we've done a lot of
 

01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:52.520
the world and so we've done a lot of
analysis here as I mentioned we're quite

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:52.530
analysis here as I mentioned we're quite
 

01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:55.220
analysis here as I mentioned we're quite
bullish in our kind of internal analysis

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:55.230
bullish in our kind of internal analysis
 

01:35:55.230 --> 01:35:58.399
bullish in our kind of internal analysis
on the rate of deployment of electrified

01:35:58.399 --> 01:35:58.409
on the rate of deployment of electrified
 

01:35:58.409 --> 01:36:00.470
on the rate of deployment of electrified
vehicles and so we tend to agree more

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480
vehicles and so we tend to agree more
 

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.380
vehicles and so we tend to agree more
with these these kind of higher

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:02.390
with these these kind of higher
 

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:05.090
with these these kind of higher
projections here that at about 2030 gets

01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100
projections here that at about 2030 gets
 

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:07.760

you to about 20 million new evie sales

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:07.770
you to about 20 million new evie sales
 

01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:11.000
you to about 20 million new evie sales
light duty vehicle sales per year and so

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:11.010
light duty vehicle sales per year and so
 

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:13.669
light duty vehicle sales per year and so
what we started thinking about is well

01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679
what we started thinking about is well
 

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:15.380
what we started thinking about is well
you know let's not think too near-term

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:15.390
you know let's not think too near-term
 

01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:16.340
you know let's not think too near-term
you know there are definitely challenges

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:16.350
you know there are definitely challenges
 

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.870
you know there are definitely challenges
for this industry in the near term there

01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880
for this industry in the near term there
 

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.979
for this industry in the near term there
are a lot of companies getting after

01:36:18.979 --> 01:36:18.989
are a lot of companies getting after
 

01:36:18.989 --> 01:36:21.890
are a lot of companies getting after
those but in terms of you know what are

01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900
those but in terms of you know what are
 

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:22.850
those but in terms of you know what are
the things that could slow this down

01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860
the things that could slow this down
 

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.340
the things that could slow this down
right in five years 10 years 15 years

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:25.350
right in five years 10 years 15 years
 

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.290
right in five years 10 years 15 years
what are the things that when you do

01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300
what are the things that when you do
 

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.669
what are the things that when you do
your analysis and you think forward

01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679
your analysis and you think forward
 

01:36:28.679 --> 01:36:31.610
your analysis and you think forward
could turn this exponential into a into

01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620
could turn this exponential into a into
 

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.490
could turn this exponential into a into
and do an up-and-down or a long flat

01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.500
and do an up-and-down or a long flat
 

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.919
and do an up-and-down or a long flat
flat part and so we've been looking at

01:36:36.919 --> 01:36:36.929
flat part and so we've been looking at
 

01:36:36.929 --> 01:36:40.790
flat part and so we've been looking at
both downstream so you know what kind of

01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800
both downstream so you know what kind of
 

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.899
both downstream so you know what kind of
charging infrastructure what kind of

01:36:41.899 --> 01:36:41.909
charging infrastructure what kind of
 

01:36:41.909 --> 01:36:43.430
charging infrastructure what kind of
charging rates are people going to need

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440
charging rates are people going to need
 

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.649
charging rates are people going to need
to get like to get all those different

01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659
to get like to get all those different
 

01:36:45.659 --> 01:36:47.000
to get like to get all those different
segments of people be willing to adopt

01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:50.540
segments of people be willing to adopt
V's what kind of what kind of what kind

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:50.550
V's what kind of what kind of what kind
 

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:53.360
V's what kind of what kind of what kind
of a range are you gonna need you know

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:53.370
of a range are you gonna need you know
 

01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:54.680
of a range are you gonna need you know
increasing the range increasing the

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:54.690
increasing the range increasing the
 

01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:56.270
increasing the range increasing the
charging rate but then the other thing

01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280
charging rate but then the other thing
 

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.209
charging rate but then the other thing
we look at is upstream and so when an

01:36:59.209 --> 01:36:59.219
we look at is upstream and so when an
 

01:36:59.219 --> 01:37:00.680
we look at is upstream and so when an
industry is moving this fast it can

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:00.690
industry is moving this fast it can
 

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:02.959
industry is moving this fast it can
often be limited by the availability

01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:02.969
often be limited by the availability
 

01:37:02.969 --> 01:37:04.520
often be limited by the availability
of the fundamental materials that go

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:04.530
of the fundamental materials that go
 

01:37:04.530 --> 01:37:05.930
of the fundamental materials that go
into the thing and so we've identified

01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940
into the thing and so we've identified
 

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.439
into the thing and so we've identified
both cobalt and lithium as two essential

01:37:09.439 --> 01:37:09.449
both cobalt and lithium as two essential
 

01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:11.419
both cobalt and lithium as two essential
elements that that could end up being a

01:37:11.419 --> 01:37:11.429
elements that that could end up being a
 

01:37:11.429 --> 01:37:13.219
elements that that could end up being a
bottleneck for the growth of this

01:37:13.219 --> 01:37:13.229
bottleneck for the growth of this
 

01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:15.799
bottleneck for the growth of this
industry and so to look at just one of

01:37:15.799 --> 01:37:15.809
industry and so to look at just one of
 

01:37:15.809 --> 01:37:17.270
industry and so to look at just one of
those rights which I say is the more

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280
those rights which I say is the more
 

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.779
those rights which I say is the more
severe is cobalt if you look at a

01:37:19.779 --> 01:37:19.789
severe is cobalt if you look at a
 

01:37:19.789 --> 01:37:21.680
severe is cobalt if you look at a
projection where you're at about 20

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:21.690
projection where you're at about 20
 

01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:24.529
projection where you're at about 20

electrification in which we think is is
 

01:38:57.869 --> 01:39:00.410

these are not going to be electrified so

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:04.190
these are not going to be electrified so
 

01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:06.109
these are not going to be electrified so
what are we going to do to get after

01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119
what are we going to do to get after
 

01:39:06.119 --> 01:39:08.330
what are we going to do to get after
these applications these emissions and

01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340
these applications these emissions and
 

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.180
these applications these emissions and
that is where we see the need for

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:10.190
that is where we see the need for
 

01:39:10.190 --> 01:39:12.500
that is where we see the need for
cost-effective low greenhouse gas

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:12.510
cost-effective low greenhouse gas
 

01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:15.020

emissions liquid fuels and the two areas

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:15.030
emissions liquid fuels and the two areas
 

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:16.340
emissions liquid fuels and the two areas
the way that we're thinking about

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:16.350
the way that we're thinking about
 

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.750
the way that we're thinking about
is that it if you really want these to

01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760
is that it if you really want these to
 

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.940
is that it if you really want these to
be carbon neutral greenhouse gas neutral

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:19.950
be carbon neutral greenhouse gas neutral
 

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:21.410

you've got to take co2 out of the air

01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420
you've got to take co2 out of the air
 

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:24.230
you've got to take co2 out of the air
and put it back in it's a cycle right

01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:24.240
and put it back in it's a cycle right
 

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.360
and put it back in it's a cycle right
and so the two ways that we see that you

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:26.370
and so the two ways that we see that you
 

01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:28.670
and so the two ways that we see that you
can do that is biofuels so we're taking

01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:28.680
can do that is biofuels so we're taking
 

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.820
can do that is biofuels so we're taking
a very serious look basically there was

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:31.830
a very serious look basically there was
 

01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:33.800
a very serious look basically there was
a lot of carnage as we all know in the

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:33.810
a lot of carnage as we all know in the
 

01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:35.600
a lot of carnage as we all know in the
in the recent kind of biofuels wave for

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:35.610
in the recent kind of biofuels wave for
 

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:36.920
in the recent kind of biofuels wave for
second generation biofuels like

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:36.930
second generation biofuels like
 

01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:38.990
second generation biofuels like
cellulose and biofuels a lot of progress

01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000
cellulose and biofuels a lot of progress
 

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.180
cellulose and biofuels a lot of progress
but they didn't quite get that and so

01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:41.190
but they didn't quite get that and so
 

01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:42.860
but they didn't quite get that and so
we're taking a fresh look at that and

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:42.870
we're taking a fresh look at that and
 

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:44.240
we're taking a fresh look at that and
seeing are there ways that we can put

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:44.250
seeing are there ways that we can put
 

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:46.910
seeing are there ways that we can put
together the puzzle pieces of the really

01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920
together the puzzle pieces of the really
 

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.650
together the puzzle pieces of the really
amazing technology that was developed in

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:48.660
amazing technology that was developed in
 

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.060
amazing technology that was developed in
various parts of the supply chain and

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:50.070
various parts of the supply chain and
 

01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:52.370
various parts of the supply chain and
put those together in creative ways and

01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380
put those together in creative ways and
 

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.110
put those together in creative ways and
also perhaps leverage the latest

01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120
also perhaps leverage the latest
 

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.820
also perhaps leverage the latest
breakthroughs in synthetic biology to

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:55.830
breakthroughs in synthetic biology to
 

01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:58.010
breakthroughs in synthetic biology to
deliver a biofuel company that can

01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020
deliver a biofuel company that can
 

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.380
deliver a biofuel company that can
actually deliver at cost at scale and

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:00.390
actually deliver at cost at scale and
 

01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.720
actually deliver at cost at scale and
you know we've also been looking

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:02.730
you know we've also been looking
 

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:06.380
you know we've also been looking
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:06.390
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels
 

01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:07.940
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels
technologies and so we're very

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:07.950
technologies and so we're very
 

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:09.560
technologies and so we're very
interested in carbon capture and

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:09.570
interested in carbon capture and
 

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:13.370
interested in carbon capture and
conversion to fuels and in the long run

01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380
conversion to fuels and in the long run
 

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.570
conversion to fuels and in the long run
if you want that to be carbon neutral

01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580
if you want that to be carbon neutral
 

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.340
if you want that to be carbon neutral
you have to be looking at air capture

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:16.350
you have to be looking at air capture
 

01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:18.680
you have to be looking at air capture
and so we're looking quite seriously at

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:18.690
and so we're looking quite seriously at
 

01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:20.420
and so we're looking quite seriously at
air capture as an important long term

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.430
air capture as an important long term
 

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:22.640
air capture as an important long term

would consider ourselves more energy

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:31.950
would consider ourselves more energy

nerds than AG nerds I would guess right

01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860
nerds than AG nerds I would guess right
 

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.950
nerds than AG nerds I would guess right
yeah it's an energy conference but when

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960
yeah it's an energy conference but when
 

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.020
yeah it's an energy conference but when
I went from the partment of energy to

you a little bit more about that but
 

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.000
you a little bit more about that but
two-thirds of that comes from just the

part of the problem here that we're
 

01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:26.660
part of the problem here that we're
looking at food waste it's a huge

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:26.670
looking at food waste it's a huge
 

01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:27.910
looking at food waste it's a huge
challenge that

01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920
challenge that
 

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.280
challenge that
was shocked to learn is basically the

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:30.290
was shocked to learn is basically the
 

01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:33.970
was shocked to learn is basically the
size the food waste emissions are the

01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:33.980
size the food waste emissions are the
 

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:36.400
size the food waste emissions are the
equivalent or they exceed the emissions

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:36.410
equivalent or they exceed the emissions
 

01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:38.740
equivalent or they exceed the emissions
of the country of China this is a huge

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:38.750
of the country of China this is a huge
 

01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:42.490
of the country of China this is a huge
problem and then nitrogen fixation this

01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:42.500
problem and then nitrogen fixation this
 

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.140
problem and then nitrogen fixation this
is basically fertilizer right you know

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:44.150
is basically fertilizer right you know
 

01:41:44.150 --> 01:41:47.439
is basically fertilizer right you know
fertilizer for for agriculture both in

01:41:47.439 --> 01:41:47.449
fertilizer for for agriculture both in
 

01:41:47.449 --> 01:41:49.390
fertilizer for for agriculture both in
terms of the energy and missions it

01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400
terms of the energy and missions it
 

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.360
terms of the energy and missions it
takes to make ammonia which is about 1%

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:52.370
takes to make ammonia which is about 1%
 

01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:54.400
takes to make ammonia which is about 1%
of global ghts and then the other part

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:54.410
of global ghts and then the other part
 

01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:56.290
of global ghts and then the other part
is when you don't use the the ammonia

01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:56.300
is when you don't use the the ammonia
 

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.990
is when you don't use the the ammonia
very efficiently that turns into n2 or

01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000
very efficiently that turns into n2 or
 

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.970
very efficiently that turns into n2 or
nitrogen oxide which is a really potent

01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:00.980
nitrogen oxide which is a really potent
 

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:02.800
nitrogen oxide which is a really potent
greenhouse gas as well which is you know

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:02.810
greenhouse gas as well which is you know
 

01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:04.689
greenhouse gas as well which is you know
those are about 50/50 in terms of impact

01:42:04.689 --> 01:42:04.699
those are about 50/50 in terms of impact
 

01:42:04.699 --> 01:42:08.530
those are about 50/50 in terms of impact
of that sector so we're very interested

01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:08.540
of that sector so we're very interested
 

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.870
of that sector so we're very interested
in looking at you know this is an

01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880
in looking at you know this is an
 

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.580
in looking at you know this is an
exponential technology domain on the

exponential technology domain on the
 

01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:14.919
exponential technology domain on the
nitrogen fixation side focusing maybe

01:42:14.919 --> 01:42:14.929
nitrogen fixation side focusing maybe
 

01:42:14.929 --> 01:42:18.189

nitrogen fixation you know there are a

01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239
nitrogen fixation you know there are a
 

01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:27.550

very limited set of plants that could

01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560
very limited set of plants that could
 

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.130
very limited set of plants that could
actually fix their own nitrogen but

01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:30.140
actually fix their own nitrogen but
 

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.390
actually fix their own nitrogen but
people haven't been able to port those

01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400
people haven't been able to port those
 

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.930
people haven't been able to port those
traits over to major crops like corn or

traits over to major crops like corn or
 

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.750
traits over to major crops like corn or
others and so we're excited about

01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760
others and so we're excited about
 

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.729
others and so we're excited about
looking at a number of companies that

either dramatically improving the
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:45.530
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or
 

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:48.610
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or
even a big vision of completely

01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:48.620
even a big vision of completely
 

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.169
even a big vision of completely
eliminating the need for fertilizer by

01:42:50.169 --> 01:42:50.179
eliminating the need for fertilizer by
 

01:42:50.179 --> 01:42:52.050
eliminating the need for fertilizer by
pulling nitrogen straight out of the air

01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:52.060
pulling nitrogen straight out of the air
 

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.640

in terms of food waste I'll admit this

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:54.650
in terms of food waste I'll admit this
 

01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:56.590
in terms of food waste I'll admit this
is a tough space this is a very

there and so ideas around like

01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:28.460
there and so ideas around like
 

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.890
there and so ideas around like
innovative delivery models or other

models are all being considered there
 

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.550
models are all being considered there
but I'd say we're a little bit early and

01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560
but I'd say we're a little bit early and
 

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.990
but I'd say we're a little bit early and
are thinking there would be really open

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000
are thinking there would be really open
 

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.359
are thinking there would be really open
to your creative and big idea

01:43:36.359 --> 01:43:36.369
to your creative and big idea
 

01:43:36.369 --> 01:43:38.250
to your creative and big idea
but I say the biggest opportunity we're

01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:38.260
but I say the biggest opportunity we're
 

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.689
but I say the biggest opportunity we're
pursuing right now is in this low gh

01:43:39.689 --> 01:43:39.699
pursuing right now is in this low gh
 

01:43:39.699 --> 01:43:42.479
pursuing right now is in this low gh
g-protein area and so two-thirds of this

01:43:42.479 --> 01:43:42.489
g-protein area and so two-thirds of this
 

01:43:42.489 --> 01:43:46.169
g-protein area and so two-thirds of this
is the cow about half of that cow

01:43:46.169 --> 01:43:46.179
is the cow about half of that cow
 

01:43:46.179 --> 01:43:47.760
is the cow about half of that cow
emission comes from the whole supply

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:47.770
emission comes from the whole supply
 

01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:49.979
emission comes from the whole supply
chain of just keeping that cow alive and

01:43:49.979 --> 01:43:49.989
chain of just keeping that cow alive and
 

01:43:49.989 --> 01:43:52.530
chain of just keeping that cow alive and
growing and the other half is from an

01:43:52.530 --> 01:43:52.540
growing and the other half is from an
 

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:55.439
growing and the other half is from an
enteric fermentation so this is the the

01:43:55.439 --> 01:43:55.449
enteric fermentation so this is the the
 

01:43:55.449 --> 01:43:58.620
enteric fermentation so this is the the
burping of methane and so we're looking

01:43:58.620 --> 01:43:58.630
burping of methane and so we're looking
 

01:43:58.630 --> 01:44:00.870
burping of methane and so we're looking
seriously at innovative ideas for

01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880
seriously at innovative ideas for
 

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.729
seriously at innovative ideas for
addressing you know the methane

01:44:02.729 --> 01:44:02.739
addressing you know the methane
 

01:44:02.739 --> 01:44:04.290
addressing you know the methane
emissions so there microbiome approaches

01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:04.300
emissions so there microbiome approaches
 

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:06.330
emissions so there microbiome approaches
that instead of emitting methane would

01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:06.340
that instead of emitting methane would
 

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.689
that instead of emitting methane would
allow a methane conversion in the gut

01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699
allow a methane conversion in the gut
 

01:44:08.699 --> 01:44:10.830
allow a methane conversion in the gut
that's an interesting area to look at

01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840
that's an interesting area to look at
 

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.870
that's an interesting area to look at
the other is just to completely

01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880
the other is just to completely
 

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.209
the other is just to completely
eliminate the cow the other half of the

01:44:15.209 --> 01:44:15.219
eliminate the cow the other half of the
 

01:44:15.219 --> 01:44:17.760
eliminate the cow the other half of the
emissions and so we're looking seriously

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:17.770
emissions and so we're looking seriously
 

01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:22.169
emissions and so we're looking seriously
at opportunities to provide at scale

01:44:22.169 --> 01:44:22.179
at opportunities to provide at scale
 

01:44:22.179 --> 01:44:26.100
at opportunities to provide at scale
you know palatable you know solutions

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:26.110
you know palatable you know solutions
 

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:28.500
you know palatable you know solutions
for food that would have much lower

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:28.510
for food that would have much lower
 

01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:30.300
for food that would have much lower
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around

01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:30.310
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around
 

01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:33.300
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around
using plant-based materials and then

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:33.310
using plant-based materials and then
 

01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:36.780
using plant-based materials and then
adding in small amounts of of kind of

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:36.790
adding in small amounts of of kind of
 

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:39.030
adding in small amounts of of kind of
specialty materials like heme like

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040
specialty materials like heme like
 

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.890
specialty materials like heme like
impossible foods you may know about it

01:44:40.890 --> 01:44:40.900
impossible foods you may know about it
 

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:42.899
impossible foods you may know about it
as a has a burger that is plant-based

01:44:42.899 --> 01:44:42.909
as a has a burger that is plant-based
 

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:45.750
as a has a burger that is plant-based
but actually tastes like a real burger

01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760
but actually tastes like a real burger
 

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.910
but actually tastes like a real burger
because it introduces these heme or

01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920
because it introduces these heme or
 

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.250
because it introduces these heme or
blood like additives at very small

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:50.260
blood like additives at very small
 

01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.680
blood like additives at very small
percentages and then you've got

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:52.690
percentages and then you've got
 

01:44:52.690 --> 01:44:53.910
percentages and then you've got
companies out there who are actually

01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920
companies out there who are actually
 

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.859
companies out there who are actually
taking mammalian cells and culturing

01:44:55.859 --> 01:44:55.869
taking mammalian cells and culturing
 

01:44:55.869 --> 01:44:57.120

actually making you your whole steak

01:44:59.839 --> 01:44:59.849
actually making you your whole steak

without the cow turns my stomach a

01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920
without the cow turns my stomach a
 

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.350
without the cow turns my stomach a
little bit right now but I think it's

01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360
little bit right now but I think it's
 

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.640
little bit right now but I think it's
very interesting it could have a huge

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:05.650
very interesting it could have a huge
 

01:45:05.650 --> 01:45:09.930
very interesting it could have a huge
impact and then you know I think those

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:09.940
impact and then you know I think those
 

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.520
impact and then you know I think those
are some of the areas we think are a

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:11.530
are some of the areas we think are a
 

01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:13.320
are some of the areas we think are a
really big opportunity but another thing

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:13.330
really big opportunity but another thing
 

01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:16.140
really big opportunity but another thing
that was really new to me coming to this

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:16.150
that was really new to me coming to this
 

01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:18.120
that was really new to me coming to this
is that you know when you look at all

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:18.130
is that you know when you look at all
 

01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:19.709
is that you know when you look at all
the emissions from the cow half is from

01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719
the emissions from the cow half is from
 

01:45:19.719 --> 01:45:22.589
the emissions from the cow half is from
beef you know which half is ground beef

01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599
beef you know which half is ground beef
 

01:45:22.599 --> 01:45:24.780
beef you know which half is ground beef
and the rest is kind of different forms

01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:24.790
and the rest is kind of different forms
 

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:27.240
and the rest is kind of different forms
of beef the other half is dairy and so

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:27.250
of beef the other half is dairy and so
 

01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:28.979
of beef the other half is dairy and so
if we can find really innovative ways to

01:45:28.979 --> 01:45:28.989
if we can find really innovative ways to
 

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:32.750
if we can find really innovative ways to
create dairy either like use

01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760
create dairy either like use
 

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.740

fermentation or other approaches to take

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:34.750
fermentation or other approaches to take
 

01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:36.419
fermentation or other approaches to take
plant-based molecules and makes things

01:45:36.419 --> 01:45:36.429
plant-based molecules and makes things
 

01:45:36.429 --> 01:45:37.919
plant-based molecules and makes things
that are the functional equivalent of

01:45:37.919 --> 01:45:37.929
that are the functional equivalent of
 

01:45:37.929 --> 01:45:41.100
that are the functional equivalent of
milk or if we can develop other kind of

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:41.110
milk or if we can develop other kind of
 

01:45:41.110 --> 01:45:42.810
milk or if we can develop other kind of
milk substitutes that are really

01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:42.820

preferable or palatable people that

01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440
preferable or palatable people that
 

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.109
preferable or palatable people that
would have a huge impact on the space as

01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:46.119
would have a huge impact on the space as
 

01:45:46.119 --> 01:45:48.540
would have a huge impact on the space as
well so I think hopefully a number of

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:48.550
well so I think hopefully a number of
 

01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:49.630
well so I think hopefully a number of
problems that that are

01:45:49.630 --> 01:45:49.640
problems that that are
 

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.220
problems that that are
new to you but these are areas that we'd

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:51.230
new to you but these are areas that we'd
 

01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:52.780
new to you but these are areas that we'd
love to engage with innovators on

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:52.790
love to engage with innovators on
 

01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:55.570
love to engage with innovators on
and then the final sector I wanted to

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:55.580
and then the final sector I wanted to
 

01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.430
and then the final sector I wanted to
talk about is the what I think is the

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440
talk about is the what I think is the
 

01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.500
talk about is the what I think is the
hardest sector and this is the industry

01:45:59.500 --> 01:45:59.510
hardest sector and this is the industry
 

01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:02.160
hardest sector and this is the industry
sector this is making stuff at scale and

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:02.170
sector this is making stuff at scale and
 

01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:04.990
sector this is making stuff at scale and
and so I consider that you know there

01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000
and so I consider that you know there
 

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.180
and so I consider that you know there
aren't a lot of really great scalable

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:07.190
aren't a lot of really great scalable
 

01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:09.310
aren't a lot of really great scalable
ideas out there for these sectors and

01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320
ideas out there for these sectors and
 

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.650
ideas out there for these sectors and
this represents a third of global

01:46:11.650 --> 01:46:11.660
this represents a third of global
 

01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.510
this represents a third of global
emissions and I think there's I think

01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520
emissions and I think there's I think
 

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.410
emissions and I think there's I think
there's relatively less attention paid

01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:17.420
there's relatively less attention paid
 

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.970
there's relatively less attention paid
by entrepreneurs and innovators in this

01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:18.980
by entrepreneurs and innovators in this
 

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.440
by entrepreneurs and innovators in this
sector than there needs to be and we'd

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:20.450
sector than there needs to be and we'd
 

01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:21.910
sector than there needs to be and we'd
really love to engage with people in

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920
really love to engage with people in
 

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.160
really love to engage with people in
this area and the three big problems

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:24.170
this area and the three big problems
 

01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:26.710
this area and the three big problems
that I'd say we it would are most

01:46:26.710 --> 01:46:26.720
that I'd say we it would are most
 

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.990
that I'd say we it would are most
interested in is steel production which

01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000
interested in is steel production which
 

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.310
interested in is steel production which
is between two and three Giga tons

01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320
is between two and three Giga tons
 

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:33.220
is between two and three Giga tons
emissions cement production - and

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:33.230
emissions cement production - and
 

01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:35.020
emissions cement production - and
ammonia production which is a key part

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:35.030
ammonia production which is a key part
 

01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:38.320
ammonia production which is a key part
of the fertilizer emissions in the case

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:38.330
of the fertilizer emissions in the case
 

01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:40.840
of the fertilizer emissions in the case
of of steel you know it's really coming

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:40.850
of of steel you know it's really coming
 

01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:42.880
of of steel you know it's really coming
from the coal that's being used to turn

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:42.890
from the coal that's being used to turn
 

01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:48.070
from the coal that's being used to turn
iron iron ore or an oxide into iron and

01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080
iron iron ore or an oxide into iron and
 

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.510
iron iron ore or an oxide into iron and
so we think they're exciting

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520
so we think they're exciting
 

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.460
so we think they're exciting
opportunities you know some of the best

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:51.470
opportunities you know some of the best
 

01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:53.110
opportunities you know some of the best
ideas out there or potentially using

finding ways to make really cheap

01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:54.830
finding ways to make really cheap
 

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:56.980
finding ways to make really cheap

emissions and then using that to convert

01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360
emissions and then using that to convert
 

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.690
emissions and then using that to convert
the the iron ore instead of coal so and

01:47:01.690 --> 01:47:01.700
the the iron ore instead of coal so and
 

01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:04.090
the the iron ore instead of coal so and
so no emissions I'll talk about another

01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:04.100
so no emissions I'll talk about another
 

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.030
so no emissions I'll talk about another

cement is a really tough one and I say

01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:09.140
cement is a really tough one and I say
 

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.660
cement is a really tough one and I say
we're like steel we're not seeing a lot

01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:10.670
we're like steel we're not seeing a lot
 

01:47:10.670 --> 01:47:13.480
we're like steel we're not seeing a lot
of really big ideas coming out of top

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:13.490
of really big ideas coming out of top
 

01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:16.450
of really big ideas coming out of top
innovators in these areas a few but here

01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:16.460
innovators in these areas a few but here
 

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.820

the real challenge is the Portland

01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:18.830
the real challenge is the Portland
 

01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:20.650
the real challenge is the Portland
cement you know like only order of ten

01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:20.660
cement you know like only order of ten

percent of what goes into concrete is
incredibly emission intensive and

01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:25.900
incredibly emission intensive and
 

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:28.180
incredibly emission intensive and
basically you take calcium carbonate

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:28.190
basically you take calcium carbonate
 

01:47:28.190 --> 01:47:30.130
basically you take calcium carbonate
like chalk and you have to heat it up to

01:47:30.130 --> 01:47:30.140
like chalk and you have to heat it up to
 

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:32.110
like chalk and you have to heat it up to
make calcium oxide and that not only

01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:32.120
make calcium oxide and that not only
 

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.780
make calcium oxide and that not only
requires energy heat which about half

01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:34.790
requires energy heat which about half
 

01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:36.520
requires energy heat which about half
the emissions but you're also in that

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:36.530
the emissions but you're also in that
 

01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:38.470

chemical version making a lot of co2 and
 

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.260
chemical version making a lot of co2 and
so you know innovative ways to reduce

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:41.270
so you know innovative ways to reduce
 

01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:42.760
so you know innovative ways to reduce
the amount of Portland cement that's

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:42.770
the amount of Portland cement that's
 

01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:45.700
the amount of Portland cement that's
needed completely new approaches to

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:45.710
needed completely new approaches to
 

01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:48.040
needed completely new approaches to
cement alternatives to cement wood based

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:48.050
cement alternatives to cement wood based
 

01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:49.950
cement alternatives to cement wood based
construction and other kinds of things

01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960
construction and other kinds of things
 

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.790
construction and other kinds of things
are all things that we're very

01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800
are all things that we're very
 

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.450
are all things that we're very
interested in then in ammonia we see

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:55.460
interested in then in ammonia we see
 

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.340
interested in then in ammonia we see
some you know I think almost all the

01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:57.350
some you know I think almost all the
 

01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:59.140
some you know I think almost all the
emissions for ammonia are from making

01:47:59.140 --> 01:47:59.150
emissions for ammonia are from making
 

01:47:59.150 --> 01:47:59.910
emissions for ammonia are from making
hydrogen from

01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920
hydrogen from
 

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.070
hydrogen from
gasps so again I think a game-changer

01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080
gasps so again I think a game-changer
 

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.419
gasps so again I think a game-changer
there would be if we could find ways to

01:48:03.419 --> 01:48:03.429
there would be if we could find ways to
 

01:48:03.429 --> 01:48:05.459
there would be if we could find ways to
make hydrogen we think you know if it's

01:48:05.459 --> 01:48:05.469
make hydrogen we think you know if it's
 

01:48:05.469 --> 01:48:08.130
make hydrogen we think you know if it's
$1 to $2 per kilogram you change the

01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:08.140
$1 to $2 per kilogram you change the
 

01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.470
$1 to $2 per kilogram you change the
world and so these are all areas we're

01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480
world and so these are all areas we're
 

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.810
world and so these are all areas we're
very interested in the last thing I

01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:12.820
very interested in the last thing I
 

01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.040
very interested in the last thing I
wanted to talk about is something that

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:14.050
wanted to talk about is something that
 

01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:16.380
wanted to talk about is something that
actually Jay and I are working together

01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:16.390
actually Jay and I are working together
 

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:17.939
actually Jay and I are working together
on and that I'm hopeful breakthrough

01:48:17.939 --> 01:48:17.949
on and that I'm hopeful breakthrough
 

01:48:17.949 --> 01:48:19.979
on and that I'm hopeful breakthrough
will we'll be partnering with with

01:48:19.979 --> 01:48:19.989
will we'll be partnering with with
 

01:48:19.989 --> 01:48:22.650
will we'll be partnering with with
Carnegie Mellon on to figure out whether

01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:22.660
Carnegie Mellon on to figure out whether
 

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.820
Carnegie Mellon on to figure out whether
there might be a big opportunity here

01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:23.830
there might be a big opportunity here
 

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:27.330
there might be a big opportunity here
and so generally speaking I'd say you

01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:27.340
and so generally speaking I'd say you
 

01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.370
and so generally speaking I'd say you
know the hardest sector industry to

01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:29.380
know the hardest sector industry to
 

01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.860
know the hardest sector industry to
decarbonize bridging it to a sector that

01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:31.870
decarbonize bridging it to a sector that
 

01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:33.870
decarbonize bridging it to a sector that
many are very optimistic will be

01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880
many are very optimistic will be
 

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.459
many are very optimistic will be
decarbonize more rapidly and more

01:48:35.459 --> 01:48:35.469
decarbonize more rapidly and more
 

01:48:35.469 --> 01:48:38.370
decarbonize more rapidly and more
efficiently and even in a more ready way

01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:38.380
efficiently and even in a more ready way
 

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:40.709
efficiently and even in a more ready way
the power sector so how do we bridge

01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719
the power sector so how do we bridge
 

01:48:40.719 --> 01:48:43.860
the power sector so how do we bridge
electricity to the industry sector so

01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:43.870
electricity to the industry sector so
 

01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:45.750
electricity to the industry sector so
electrifying industrial production and

01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760
electrifying industrial production and
 

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.400
electrifying industrial production and
more specifically how do we take

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:47.410
more specifically how do we take
 

01:48:47.410 --> 01:48:48.360
more specifically how do we take
advantage there's kind of a new idea

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:48.370
advantage there's kind of a new idea
 

01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:49.169
advantage there's kind of a new idea
we'd love to

01:48:49.169 --> 01:48:49.179
we'd love to
 

01:48:49.179 --> 01:48:51.209
we'd love to
I'd love to engage with top innovators

out there on and JE and I would love to
 

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.979
out there on and JE and I would love to
do that with you is how do we take this

01:48:55.979 --> 01:48:55.989
do that with you is how do we take this
 

01:48:55.989 --> 01:48:58.580
do that with you is how do we take this
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour

01:48:58.580 --> 01:48:58.590
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour
 

01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:00.660
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour
intermittent renewable electricity low

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:00.670
intermittent renewable electricity low
 

01:49:00.670 --> 01:49:03.240
intermittent renewable electricity low
capacity factor electricity that we were

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:03.250
capacity factor electricity that we were
 

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:05.820
capacity factor electricity that we were
seeing come on in larger larger scale

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:05.830
seeing come on in larger larger scale
 

01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:07.800
seeing come on in larger larger scale
and more and more places and how do we

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:07.810
and more and more places and how do we
 

01:49:07.810 --> 01:49:10.229
and more and more places and how do we
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas

01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas
 

01:49:10.239 --> 01:49:13.110
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas
emission stuff how do we bridge that to

01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:13.120
emission stuff how do we bridge that to
 

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.950
emission stuff how do we bridge that to
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could
 

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.750
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could
do that in a cost-effective manner and

01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760
do that in a cost-effective manner and
 

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.880
do that in a cost-effective manner and
that power is really cheap which makes

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:20.890
that power is really cheap which makes
 

01:49:20.890 --> 01:49:21.810
that power is really cheap which makes
it really possible

01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:21.820
it really possible
 

01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.390
it really possible
especially using the the most promising

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400
especially using the the most promising
 

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.680
especially using the the most promising
platform I see is electrochemistry

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:25.690
platform I see is electrochemistry
 

01:49:25.690 --> 01:49:27.510
platform I see is electrochemistry
things like an electrolyzer electrolysis

01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520
things like an electrolyzer electrolysis
 

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.250
things like an electrolyzer electrolysis
getting the big technology challenge an

01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:32.260
getting the big technology challenge an
 

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.650
getting the big technology challenge an
opportunity here is that that people

01:49:34.650 --> 01:49:34.660
opportunity here is that that people
 

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:36.990
opportunity here is that that people
haven't really thought about using

01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000
haven't really thought about using
 

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.600
haven't really thought about using
renewable intermittent low capacity

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:39.610
renewable intermittent low capacity
 

01:49:39.610 --> 01:49:41.640
renewable intermittent low capacity
factor energy to directly power

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:41.650
factor energy to directly power
 

01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:44.430
factor energy to directly power
industrial processes and so the big

01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440
industrial processes and so the big
 

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.870
industrial processes and so the big
difference here is you'd have a factory

01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880
difference here is you'd have a factory
 

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.090
difference here is you'd have a factory
you'd have a plant that would only be

01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:48.100
you'd have a plant that would only be
 

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.890
you'd have a plant that would only be
able to operate 40 percent of the time

01:49:49.890 --> 01:49:49.900
able to operate 40 percent of the time
 

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.020
able to operate 40 percent of the time
50 percent of the time 25 percent of the

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:52.030
50 percent of the time 25 percent of the
 

01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:53.850
50 percent of the time 25 percent of the
time and so you have to think in a

01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:53.860
time and so you have to think in a
 

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.040
time and so you have to think in a
completely new way about dramatically

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:56.050
completely new way about dramatically
 

01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:57.689
completely new way about dramatically
reducing the capital cost of these

01:49:57.689 --> 01:49:57.699
reducing the capital cost of these
 

01:49:57.699 --> 01:49:59.610
reducing the capital cost of these
systems because you're only using them

01:49:59.610 --> 01:49:59.620
systems because you're only using them
 

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.620
systems because you're only using them
part of the time you're getting super

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:01.630
part of the time you're getting super
 

01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:03.120
part of the time you're getting super
cheap energy but you're only getting a

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:03.130
cheap energy but you're only getting a
 

01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:04.620
cheap energy but you're only getting a
part of the time so you've got to build

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:04.630
part of the time so you've got to build
 

01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:05.880
part of the time so you've got to build
it you've got to envision a new kind of

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:05.890
it you've got to envision a new kind of
 

01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:08.010
it you've got to envision a new kind of
factory that is completely different

01:50:08.010 --> 01:50:08.020
factory that is completely different
 

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.660
factory that is completely different
that is dramatically lower capital cost

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:09.670
that is dramatically lower capital cost
 

01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:13.060
that is dramatically lower capital cost
and so this is something that Jay and I

01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:13.070
and so this is something that Jay and I
 

01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:15.730
and so this is something that Jay and I
so with that I want to thank you for

01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:15.740
so with that I want to thank you for
 

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.950
so with that I want to thank you for
your time I hope you got to know a

01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960
your time I hope you got to know a
 

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.980
your time I hope you got to know a
little bit about us I hope that some of

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:20.990
little bit about us I hope that some of
 

01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:22.540
little bit about us I hope that some of
these problems are problems that you're

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:22.550
these problems are problems that you're
 

01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:25.570
these problems are problems that you're
interested in tackling with us the

01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:25.580
interested in tackling with us the
 

01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:27.040
interested in tackling with us the
bottom line I want to put out there is

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:27.050
bottom line I want to put out there is
 

01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:30.160
bottom line I want to put out there is
is that we are we are here to support

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:30.170
is that we are we are here to support
 

01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:32.290
is that we are we are here to support
your big ideas and it's really about

01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:32.300
your big ideas and it's really about
 

01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:36.180
your big ideas and it's really about
those big half Gigaton ideas and so

01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:36.190
those big half Gigaton ideas and so
 

01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:39.100
those big half Gigaton ideas and so
we've got a lot of work to do but we've

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:39.110
we've got a lot of work to do but we've
 

01:50:39.110 --> 01:50:40.720
we've got a lot of work to do but we've
got a good amount of capital we've got

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:40.730
got a good amount of capital we've got
 

01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:43.120
got a good amount of capital we've got
some great investors and we think

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:43.130
some great investors and we think
 

01:50:43.130 --> 01:50:45.130
some great investors and we think
there's a tremendous opportunity to

01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:45.140
there's a tremendous opportunity to
 

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.470

very good thank you fantastic thanks
again for coming and we've got a number

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:10.370
again for coming and we've got a number
 

01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:11.590
again for coming and we've got a number
of questions from the audience so I'm

01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:11.600
of questions from the audience so I'm
 

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.440
of questions from the audience so I'm
just going to sort of sit here and

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:13.450
just going to sort of sit here and
 

01:51:13.450 --> 01:51:16.090
just going to sort of sit here and
recite some of them first one actually

01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:16.100
recite some of them first one actually
 

01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.390
recite some of them first one actually
is another think big point that some

01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400
is another think big point that some
 

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.980
is another think big point that some
folks have raised as a potential for

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:20.990
folks have raised as a potential for
 

01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:23.620
folks have raised as a potential for
geoengineering instead of reducing

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:23.630
geoengineering instead of reducing
 

01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:24.940
geoengineering instead of reducing
carbon emissions I mean which is

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:24.950
carbon emissions I mean which is
 

01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:26.650
carbon emissions I mean which is
obviously the right fight to fight other

01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:26.660
obviously the right fight to fight other
 

01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:28.750
obviously the right fight to fight other
folks are considering injecting certain

01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760
folks are considering injecting certain
 

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.460
folks are considering injecting certain
like sulfur species or other things in

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:30.470
like sulfur species or other things in
 

01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:32.980
like sulfur species or other things in
the high atmosphere to reduce the impact

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:32.990
the high atmosphere to reduce the impact
 

01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:35.620
the high atmosphere to reduce the impact
of the Sun and to reduce global warming

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:35.630
of the Sun and to reduce global warming
 

01:51:35.630 --> 01:51:36.490
of the Sun and to reduce global warming
in a different way

01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:36.500
in a different way
 

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:37.930
in a different way
are you guys considering that sort of

01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:37.940
are you guys considering that sort of
 

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.610
are you guys considering that sort of
thing at all are you more focused on

01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:39.620
thing at all are you more focused on
 

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.560
thing at all are you more focused on
mitigating the problem through carbon

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:41.570
mitigating the problem through carbon
 

01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:43.960
mitigating the problem through carbon
reduction yeah you know we haven't

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:43.970
reduction yeah you know we haven't
 

01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:46.270
reduction yeah you know we haven't
explicitly put it off the table but I'd

01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280
explicitly put it off the table but I'd
 

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:49.060
explicitly put it off the table but I'd
say for now we are very very focused on

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:49.070
say for now we are very very focused on
 

01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:51.300
say for now we are very very focused on
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:51.310
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation
 

01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:53.650
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation
and so there definitely a few folks out

01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:53.660
and so there definitely a few folks out
 

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.330
and so there definitely a few folks out
there including high net worth folks who

01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:55.340
there including high net worth folks who
 

01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.400
there including high net worth folks who
are backing some teams that are looking

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:57.410
are backing some teams that are looking
 

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:59.170
are backing some teams that are looking
at some of these geoengineering things

01:51:59.170 --> 01:51:59.180
at some of these geoengineering things
 

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:01.780
at some of these geoengineering things
but say for now we're completely focused

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:01.790
but say for now we're completely focused
 

01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:04.810
but say for now we're completely focused
on reducing emissions and not focusing

01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:04.820
on reducing emissions and not focusing
 

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:08.140
on reducing emissions and not focusing
on geoengineering great what about what

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:08.150
on geoengineering great what about what
 

01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:12.400
on geoengineering great what about what
you view infusion you know like I said I

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:12.410
you view infusion you know like I said I
 

01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:15.340
you view infusion you know like I said I
think that zero zero greenhouse gas

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:15.350
think that zero zero greenhouse gas
 

01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:18.670
think that zero zero greenhouse gas
emissions dispatchable generation which

01:52:18.670 --> 01:52:18.680
emissions dispatchable generation which
 

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.650
emissions dispatchable generation which
in a world of high renewables

01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:20.660
in a world of high renewables
 

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.050
in a world of high renewables
penetration you're going to need you're

01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:23.060
penetration you're going to need you're
 

01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.510
penetration you're going to need you're
going to need very low cost technologies

01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520
going to need very low cost technologies
 

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.960
going to need very low cost technologies
that are dispatchable or firm and so you

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:28.970
that are dispatchable or firm and so you
 

01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:30.400
that are dispatchable or firm and so you
know we believe that it is absolutely

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:30.410
know we believe that it is absolutely
 

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:34.060
know we believe that it is absolutely
critical for us to develop some number

01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:34.070
critical for us to develop some number
 

01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:36.130
critical for us to develop some number
of solutions that are going to scale you

01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:36.140
of solutions that are going to scale you
 

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.260
of solutions that are going to scale you
know to at least kind of ten ten percent

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:38.270
know to at least kind of ten ten percent
 

01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:41.140
know to at least kind of ten ten percent
or you know fifteen percent of capacity

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:41.150
or you know fifteen percent of capacity
 

01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:43.360
or you know fifteen percent of capacity
that can support those high of renewable

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:43.370
that can support those high of renewable
 

01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:46.540
that can support those high of renewable
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:46.550
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear
 

01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.930
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture

01:52:48.930 --> 01:52:48.940
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture
 

01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:51.490
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture
geothermal are all on the table but I'd

01:52:51.490 --> 01:52:51.500
geothermal are all on the table but I'd
 

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.470
geothermal are all on the table but I'd
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer

01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer
 

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:56.440
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer
you know obvious wins in that area so I

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:56.450
you know obvious wins in that area so I
 

01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:57.430
you know obvious wins in that area so I
think we're gonna have to look at a lot

01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440
think we're gonna have to look at a lot
 

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.020
think we're gonna have to look at a lot
of a lot of different things one thing

01:52:59.020 --> 01:52:59.030
of a lot of different things one thing
 

01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.360
of a lot of different things one thing
that's interesting though is that what

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:01.370
that's interesting though is that what
 

01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:02.410
that's interesting though is that what
they've been realizing is if you do

01:53:02.410 --> 01:53:02.420
they've been realizing is if you do
 

01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.790
they've been realizing is if you do
believe in a high or at least in

01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:03.800
believe in a high or at least in
 

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.870
believe in a high or at least in
geographies that would have high

01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880
geographies that would have high
 

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.820
geographies that would have high
renewable intermittent renewable

01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:06.830
renewable intermittent renewable
 

01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:09.340
renewable intermittent renewable
penetration like wind and solar it's no

01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:09.350
penetration like wind and solar it's no
 

01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:11.620
penetration like wind and solar it's no
longer enough to just think of like an L

01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:11.630
longer enough to just think of like an L
 

01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:15.520
longer enough to just think of like an L
seolhui a base load plant LCOE for these

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:15.530
seolhui a base load plant LCOE for these
 

01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:16.900
seolhui a base load plant LCOE for these
kind of dispatchable things because

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:16.910
kind of dispatchable things because
 

01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:18.430
kind of dispatchable things because
they're gonna go up and down they're

01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440
they're gonna go up and down they're
 

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.500
they're gonna go up and down they're
gonna be operating at lower capacity

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:20.510
gonna be operating at lower capacity
 

01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:22.780
gonna be operating at lower capacity
factor and so I think we're beginning to

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:22.790
factor and so I think we're beginning to
 

01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:25.720
factor and so I think we're beginning to
work on some more appropriate metrics

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:25.730
work on some more appropriate metrics
 

01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:27.910
work on some more appropriate metrics
that we should be having these kind of

01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920
that we should be having these kind of
 

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.950
that we should be having these kind of
plants target and so like the one thing

01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960
plants target and so like the one thing
 

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.600
plants target and so like the one thing
I would say is it like you know LCOE

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:31.610
I would say is it like you know LCOE
 

01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:33.700
I would say is it like you know LCOE
base load that's not the right metric

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:33.710
base load that's not the right metric
 

01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:35.830
base load that's not the right metric
for these dispatchable sources that we

01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840
for these dispatchable sources that we
 

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.050
for these dispatchable sources that we
should be targeting so someone else

01:53:38.050 --> 01:53:38.060
should be targeting so someone else
 

01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:39.490
should be targeting so someone else
asked you know this is actually a hybrid

01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:39.500
asked you know this is actually a hybrid
 

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:40.690
asked you know this is actually a hybrid
of a couple different questions that I'm

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:40.700
of a couple different questions that I'm
 

01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:42.850
of a couple different questions that I'm
going to put together you have to think

01:53:42.850 --> 01:53:42.860
going to put together you have to think
 

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:45.550
going to put together you have to think
big right and and there is so much like

01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:45.560
big right and and there is so much like
 

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.680
big right and and there is so much like
many of these solutions bridge outside

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:47.690
many of these solutions bridge outside
 

01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:49.840
many of these solutions bridge outside
the realm of one country even right if

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:49.850
the realm of one country even right if
 

01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:51.160
the realm of one country even right if
you really want to have it's a global

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:51.170
you really want to have it's a global
 

01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:53.470
you really want to have it's a global
impact it's a global solution that

01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480
impact it's a global solution that
 

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.570
impact it's a global solution that
suggests maybe also there need to be

01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:55.580
suggests maybe also there need to be
 

01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.870
suggests maybe also there need to be
some global or at least nationally

01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880
some global or at least nationally
 

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.360
some global or at least nationally
cogent policy drivers to create

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:01.370
cogent policy drivers to create
 

01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:03.220
cogent policy drivers to create
incentive or to create space for this

01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:03.230
incentive or to create space for this
 

01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:05.140
incentive or to create space for this
are you guys looking at ways to do that

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:05.150
are you guys looking at ways to do that
 

01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:06.790
are you guys looking at ways to do that
as well you can't

01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800
as well you can't
 

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.710
as well you can't
maybe there's a you know not just a

01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:08.720
maybe there's a you know not just a
 

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.150
maybe there's a you know not just a
technical solution that's purely

01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:10.160
technical solution that's purely
 

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:12.220
technical solution that's purely
economically beneficial it may need a

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:12.230
economically beneficial it may need a
 

01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:13.930
economically beneficial it may need a
nudge one way or another are you is be

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:13.940
nudge one way or another are you is be
 

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.730
nudge one way or another are you is be
evey because it's so different in its

01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:15.740
evey because it's so different in its
 

01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:17.230
evey because it's so different in its
mission gonna position itself like that

01:54:17.230 --> 01:54:17.240
mission gonna position itself like that
 

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.210
mission gonna position itself like that
as well yeah so break their energy

01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:19.220
as well yeah so break their energy
 

01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.360
as well yeah so break their energy
ventures is is just one activity I'd say

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:22.370
ventures is is just one activity I'd say
 

01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:26.230
ventures is is just one activity I'd say
that that these you know 21 high net

01:54:26.230 --> 01:54:26.240
that that these you know 21 high net
 

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.540
that that these you know 21 high net
worth you know influential visionaries

01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:28.550
worth you know influential visionaries
 

01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:30.880
worth you know influential visionaries
are backing and so but I'd say a

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:44.950
companies for a long haul and these are
often capital intensive businesses I

01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960
often capital intensive businesses I
 

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.220
often capital intensive businesses I
also say excuse me

01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:48.230
also say excuse me
 

01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:50.860
also say excuse me
relative to the more traditional fund I

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:50.870
relative to the more traditional fund I
 

01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:53.500
relative to the more traditional fund I
think we're gonna be much more you even

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:53.510
think we're gonna be much more you even
 

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:55.750
think we're gonna be much more you even
more interested in syndicates and

01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760
more interested in syndicates and
 

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.390
more interested in syndicates and
collaboration and co-investment because

01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400
collaboration and co-investment because
 

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.790
collaboration and co-investment because
these problems are hard and they require

01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800
these problems are hard and they require
 

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.380
these problems are hard and they require
you know a reasonable amount of capital

01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:02.390
you know a reasonable amount of capital
 

01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:03.970
you know a reasonable amount of capital
and we want to make sure that and so

01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:03.980
and we want to make sure that and so
 

01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.130
and we want to make sure that and so
we're you know there are some kind of

01:58:06.130 --> 01:58:06.140
we're you know there are some kind of
 

01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:07.240
we're you know there are some kind of
investors who are kind of trying to

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:07.250
investors who are kind of trying to
 

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:08.979
investors who are kind of trying to
crowd out others I think we're gonna be

01:58:08.979 --> 01:58:08.989
crowd out others I think we're gonna be
 

01:58:08.989 --> 01:58:10.510
crowd out others I think we're gonna be
quite the opposite we're looking to pull

01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520
quite the opposite we're looking to pull
 

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.370
quite the opposite we're looking to pull
in other investors around that the

01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:12.380
in other investors around that the
 

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.530
in other investors around that the
investments that we're doing time for

01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:14.540
investments that we're doing time for
 

01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:16.660
investments that we're doing time for
maybe one or two more questions someone

01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:16.670
maybe one or two more questions someone
 

01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:20.100
maybe one or two more questions someone
asks I didn't see much discussion around

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:20.110
asks I didn't see much discussion around
 

01:58:20.110 --> 01:58:22.900
asks I didn't see much discussion around
building or building efficiency we all

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:22.910
building or building efficiency we all
 

01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:24.670
building or building efficiency we all
know that efficiency improvements can

01:58:24.670 --> 01:58:24.680
know that efficiency improvements can
 

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:26.890
know that efficiency improvements can
have a huge impact if you guys have is

01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:26.900
have a huge impact if you guys have is
 

01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:28.300
have a huge impact if you guys have is
that part of your thesis or are you more

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:28.310
that part of your thesis or are you more
 

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:31.030
that part of your thesis or are you more
focused on because individual companies

01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040
focused on because individual companies
 

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.590
focused on because individual companies
may be more focused on power sources and

01:58:32.590 --> 01:58:32.600
may be more focused on power sources and
 

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.229
may be more focused on power sources and
uses is that a reasoning that you're not

01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239
uses is that a reasoning that you're not
 

01:58:35.239 --> 01:58:37.209
uses is that a reasoning that you're not
focusing on any talk yeah you know

01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:37.219
focusing on any talk yeah you know
 

01:58:37.219 --> 01:58:39.130
focusing on any talk yeah you know
buildings is big so it's something we

01:58:39.130 --> 01:58:39.140
buildings is big so it's something we
 

01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:41.170
buildings is big so it's something we
care a lot about and I you know you can

01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:41.180
care a lot about and I you know you can
 

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.459
care a lot about and I you know you can
only talk about so many things one talk

01:58:42.459 --> 01:58:42.469
only talk about so many things one talk
 

01:58:42.469 --> 01:58:44.800
only talk about so many things one talk
so I have a slide on buildings but it

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:44.810
so I have a slide on buildings but it
 

01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:46.750
so I have a slide on buildings but it
didn't present it today I'd say one of

01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760
didn't present it today I'd say one of
 

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:48.280
didn't present it today I'd say one of
the areas were most interested in

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:48.290
the areas were most interested in
 

01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:52.200
the areas were most interested in
buildings is in zero greenhouse gas

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:52.210
buildings is in zero greenhouse gas
 

01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:57.190
buildings is in zero greenhouse gas
associated heating and cooling that's a

01:58:57.190 --> 01:58:57.200
associated heating and cooling that's a
 

01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.590
associated heating and cooling that's a
huge portion of all of the energy we use

01:58:59.590 --> 01:58:59.600
huge portion of all of the energy we use
 

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.069
huge portion of all of the energy we use
in buildings

01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079
in buildings
 

01:59:01.079 --> 01:59:02.720
in buildings
my personal opinion is that lighting

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:02.730
my personal opinion is that lighting
 

01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:05.390
my personal opinion is that lighting
with the advent of LEDs and the rapid

01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400
with the advent of LEDs and the rapid
 

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.810
with the advent of LEDs and the rapid
penetration is maybe less of an

01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820
penetration is maybe less of an
 

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.490
penetration is maybe less of an
important area for us to focus but I

01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500
important area for us to focus but I
 

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.649
important area for us to focus but I
don't think we have a similar innovation

01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:12.659
don't think we have a similar innovation
 

01:59:12.659 --> 01:59:14.950
don't think we have a similar innovation
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space

01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space
 

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.180
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space
we've also been looking at you know kind

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:17.190
we've also been looking at you know kind
 

01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:19.339
we've also been looking at you know kind
of creative things around the embedded

01:59:19.339 --> 01:59:19.349
of creative things around the embedded
 

01:59:19.349 --> 01:59:21.950
of creative things around the embedded
footprint of buildings that looks back

01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960
footprint of buildings that looks back
 

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.430
footprint of buildings that looks back
at materials and so one of my colleagues

01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440
at materials and so one of my colleagues
 

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.439
at materials and so one of my colleagues
is looking very seriously at how do you

01:59:27.439 --> 01:59:27.449
is looking very seriously at how do you
 

01:59:27.449 --> 01:59:28.669
is looking very seriously at how do you
expand the envelope of wood based

01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679
expand the envelope of wood based
 

01:59:28.679 --> 01:59:30.770
expand the envelope of wood based
construction where you know you're

01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780
construction where you know you're
 

01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.589
construction where you know you're
actually you get a two-bagger where

01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599
actually you get a two-bagger where
 

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.660
actually you get a two-bagger where
you're you're you're displacing steel

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:35.670
you're you're you're displacing steel
 

01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:38.919
you're you're you're displacing steel
and concrete and you're also

01:59:38.919 --> 01:59:38.929
and concrete and you're also
 

01:59:38.929 --> 01:59:41.240
and concrete and you're also
sequestering carbon there through

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:41.250
sequestering carbon there through
 

01:59:41.250 --> 01:59:45.589
sequestering carbon there through
biomass and so I'd say that there are a

01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599
biomass and so I'd say that there are a
 

01:59:45.599 --> 01:59:46.430
biomass and so I'd say that there are a
number of areas that were very

01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440
number of areas that were very
 

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.600
number of areas that were very
interested in buildings but I think

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:47.610
interested in buildings but I think
 

01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:49.399
interested in buildings but I think
buildings are tough and I ran the

01:59:49.399 --> 01:59:49.409
buildings are tough and I ran the
 

01:59:49.409 --> 01:59:50.959
buildings are tough and I ran the
buildings program at DOA it's a tough

01:59:50.959 --> 01:59:50.969
buildings program at DOA it's a tough
 

01:59:50.969 --> 01:59:52.939
buildings program at DOA it's a tough
space and so you know we're definitely

01:59:52.939 --> 01:59:52.949
space and so you know we're definitely
 

01:59:52.949 --> 01:59:54.020
space and so you know we're definitely
going to be in there but I think we're

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:54.030
going to be in there but I think we're
 

01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:55.640
going to be in there but I think we're
gonna have to do some creative things to

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:55.650
gonna have to do some creative things to
 

01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:57.439
gonna have to do some creative things to
make a real difference there all right

01:59:57.439 --> 01:59:57.449
make a real difference there all right
 

01:59:57.449 --> 01:59:59.660
make a real difference there all right
so last question this is a riff on one

01:59:59.660 --> 01:59:59.670
so last question this is a riff on one
 

01:59:59.670 --> 02:00:00.890
so last question this is a riff on one
that that someone submitted that I'll

02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900
that that someone submitted that I'll
 

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:03.049
that that someone submitted that I'll
add a bit too having fought the fight

02:00:03.049 --> 02:00:03.059
add a bit too having fought the fight
 

02:00:03.059 --> 02:00:04.669
add a bit too having fought the fight
personally or not personally but the

02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679
personally or not personally but the
 

02:00:04.679 --> 02:00:06.740
personally or not personally but the
company that I founded along with a

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:06.750
company that I founded along with a
 

02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:09.260
company that I founded along with a
bunch of other people Okwe on we went up

02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:09.270
bunch of other people Okwe on we went up
 

02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:10.729
bunch of other people Okwe on we went up
against multinationals in the battery

02:00:10.729 --> 02:00:10.739
against multinationals in the battery
 

02:00:10.739 --> 02:00:12.649
against multinationals in the battery
storage space and eventually had a

02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659
storage space and eventually had a
 

02:00:12.659 --> 02:00:15.080
storage space and eventually had a
difficult and acquired at a great loss

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:15.090
difficult and acquired at a great loss
 

02:00:15.090 --> 02:00:17.330
difficult and acquired at a great loss
so bad the company continues but none of

02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:17.340
so bad the company continues but none of
 

02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:19.299
so bad the company continues but none of
the initial investors are in the game

02:00:19.299 --> 02:00:19.309
the initial investors are in the game
 

02:00:19.309 --> 02:00:21.830
the initial investors are in the game
and one of the things that we thought of

02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840
and one of the things that we thought of
 

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.750
and one of the things that we thought of
or you know towards the end was wow we

02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760
or you know towards the end was wow we
 

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.799
or you know towards the end was wow we
really should have aligned ourselves

02:00:24.799 --> 02:00:24.809
really should have aligned ourselves
 

02:00:24.809 --> 02:00:27.530
really should have aligned ourselves
with the multinational early on to

02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540
with the multinational early on to
 

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.270
with the multinational early on to
co-develop and make sure that our

02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280
co-develop and make sure that our
 

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.919
co-develop and make sure that our
particular manufacturing and our

02:00:30.919 --> 02:00:30.929
particular manufacturing and our
 

02:00:30.929 --> 02:00:33.410
particular manufacturing and our
approach was amenable to what was

02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420
approach was amenable to what was
 

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.479
approach was amenable to what was
happening globally with these huge

02:00:35.479 --> 02:00:35.489
happening globally with these huge
 

02:00:35.489 --> 02:00:36.950
happening globally with these huge
companies that have were bankable and

02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960
companies that have were bankable and
 

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.560
companies that have were bankable and
had a lot more cash are you guys looking

02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:39.570
had a lot more cash are you guys looking
 

02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:41.089
had a lot more cash are you guys looking
to encourage this kind of collaboration

02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099
to encourage this kind of collaboration
 

02:00:41.099 --> 02:00:43.209
to encourage this kind of collaboration
early on with these new new companies

02:00:43.209 --> 02:00:43.219
early on with these new new companies
 

02:00:43.219 --> 02:00:45.560
early on with these new new companies
yeah a double meeting of that I mean

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:45.570
yeah a double meeting of that I mean
 

02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:47.450
yeah a double meeting of that I mean
this is a situation because at some

02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460
this is a situation because at some
 

02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.549
this is a situation because at some
point if it's a real thing in this

02:00:49.549 --> 02:00:49.559
point if it's a real thing in this
 

02:00:49.559 --> 02:00:51.229
point if it's a real thing in this
competition it's difficult to keep your

02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239
competition it's difficult to keep your
 

02:00:51.239 --> 02:00:53.660
competition it's difficult to keep your
company afloat no I'm I agree with you

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:53.670
company afloat no I'm I agree with you
 

02:00:53.670 --> 02:00:57.290
company afloat no I'm I agree with you
wholeheartedly the you know

02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300
wholeheartedly the you know
 

02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.450
wholeheartedly the you know
interestingly so we chose not to have

02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460
interestingly so we chose not to have
 

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.520
interestingly so we chose not to have
