My name is Davar Ardalan and I'm the
founder and storyteller in chief of IVOW

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.870
And IVOW stands for "voices of wisdom," a vow to make sure that the future of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.080
storytelling with artificial intelligence is culturally conscious.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.090
Many of the stories that you might see
in newspapers or in digital stories in

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.369
the future might be generated by
machines and not journalists. This summer

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.880
it was the first time that parts of
Wimbledon were actually reported by

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
machines. Across six courts in Wimbledon it was actually a machine that captured

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.260
the highlight videos so the machine was
trained to understand the sound

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.820
that the audiences were making and the
reaction of the athletes and the data

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.250
around the players, and they were able to generate within 50 minutes

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.579
video packages from six different courts
at Wimbledon and share that with the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
Wimbledon fan. This is an example of how machine learning is generating new

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.659
content. I was a production assistant at
NPR News in 1994 and that's what I would

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
have been doing. Logging tape and
listening for those highlight reels. But

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.110
the idea is that journalists are behind
the creation of them. So the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.170
understanding of the ethics and the journalism craft that goes into

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.180
creating the storytelling templates and
also creating the infrastructure around

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.070
how to automate news. What we're doing is we're tagging data around culture

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.030
tradition and heritage and bringing
together the power of artificial

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.970
intelligence to create stories that
really anchor the public in the stories

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.350
of their traditions and cultures in new
ways. The Washington Post, New York Times,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.570
and Reuters are all veterans at this by
this point in the last couple years and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.030
their focus is on politics and business
and entertainment and sports. It's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.410
exciting for us to get into this field
as people who come from a public media

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.310
background to think about also how do we capture data around culture and heritage

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.680
for communities around the world.
