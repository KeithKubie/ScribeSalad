00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.390
Now what makes stochastic games more interesting, perhaps, than repeated

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.480
games, is the idea that the actions that the players take

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.320
impact not just the rewards, but also future states. Right? And,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.760
so this is the same issue that comes up when we're

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.200
talking about mark off decision processes and the way we

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
dealt with it in that setting was by defining a value

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.970
function. So, it seems pretty reasonable to try to go after

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.270
that same idea again. So what I've got here is actually

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.770
the Belmont Equation And let's look at this together and let's

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.030
see if we can fix it because it's not quite right.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.759
&gt;&gt; For dealing with the idea of zero sum in a stochastic

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
game. Okay so you remember the Belmen equation? We've got Q I star.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.923
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:41.900
&gt;&gt; So there was no I before, but Q star is the state. Is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.550
to find over state actions, so here

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.600
we're going to define it over action, joint actions

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.925
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:50.560
&gt;&gt; For the two players, action pairs. The immediate reward to player

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.160
i for take, for that joint action in that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.350
state plus the discounted expected value of the next state.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.260
So we need to factor in the transition probabilities So

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.180
the transition of actually going to some next state s

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.310
prime is s, sorry t of s, AB as

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.370
prime. Right? So now, we're imagining what happens when we

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.680
land in S prime. So what I've written here says,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.850
well, we're going to basically look a the Q values

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.880
in the state that we landed in, and kind

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.100
of summarize them, summarize that value back up so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.170
that we can use it to define the, the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.570
value of the state that we left. You with me?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.980
&gt;&gt; I am with you.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.620
&gt;&gt; Alright so if we put this in if, if we say the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.870
way we're going to summarize the value for the new state that we land

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.520
in. Is we think of it as actually a matrix game. That there's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.920
payoffs for each action choices of A prime and B prime. And over all

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.180
of those, we need to kind of summarize well which of those actions in this table

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.350
of values that we get for s prime.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.200
Which of those values are we going to propagate forward

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.880
and call the value of that state? So what we did in regular MDPs is that we

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.680
said we'll take a max over all the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.580
actions or in this case all the joint actions.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.930
&gt;&gt; Uhun. So what do you think that translates to?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.490
&gt;&gt; Well you wrote down max but that doesn't make sense,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.460
that doesn't, that can't be right.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.190
&gt;&gt; Well it translates, it means something. It

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.710
just doesn't mean what we mean it to mean.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.620
&gt;&gt; That's true, that's fair.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.670
&gt;&gt; So what does it mean and then, and then, how can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.310
we fix it? So let's start off with what does it mean.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.780
&gt;&gt; It means that you kind of always assume

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770
that the joint actions that are going to be taken

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.150
Will benefit you the most. So, everyone, everyone is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.080
trying to make you happy so, this makes you optimistic?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.500
&gt;&gt; yeah, sort of optimistic

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.320
to the point of, of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.850
&gt;&gt; Delusion?

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, very good. Right, it just basically says that whenever we're in a

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.640
state, the whole world is going to choose

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.420
their actions to benefit me, and this is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.460
not what we get a say a zero sum stacastic game, but a zero

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.420
sum stacastic game, we should be you know. Like fighting it out at this point.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.080
&gt;&gt; So that would work out if everybody's rewards were the same,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320
or everybody's rewards were the sum

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.100
of everyone's rewards, or something like that.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.080
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.890
If it was some kind of team based game.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.960
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.570
&gt;&gt; Or if everybody was, you know, going to sacrifice their

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.780
own happiness for the benefit of Qi, or i I mean.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.050
&gt;&gt; Hm. So it's not reasonable to assume that. In

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.190
fact, what was it that we were assuming when we

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.700
had a zero sum game that was just a single

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.130
stage? Right? Just a single game and then we were done.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, that people were doing minimax.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.010
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.660
&gt;&gt; And maximin.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.980
&gt;&gt; So what if we changed the equation to look like that?

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.235
So, what I mean by this, is when, when we

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:30.330
we evaluate the value of a state. We actually solve the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.020
zero sum game in the Q values and take that value

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.010
and use it in the, in the context of this equation.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.680
&gt;&gt; That seems closer to right.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it's not an unreasonable

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.710
thing to do. It's just to say, I'm going to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.810
summarize the future by imagining that we're going to play

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.310
that game that represents, you know, all the future.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.750
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.830
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to act in such a way to,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.480
to try to Maximize that assuming you're trying to minimize

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.104
it, which makes perfect sense if it's a zero-sum game.

00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:54.720
&gt;&gt; Right. I was, yeah, and we're still, we're

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.280
still acting as if there are only two people here.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's right. It turns out

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.510
that when you're talking about zero-sum it really

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.400
implies that there's only two players. Because if

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.860
you have a zero-sum three player game, it

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.940
really is just a general sum game. You can imagine that the third player is just

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.640
an extra factor that's just messing with the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.390
numbers to make things sum up to zero.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.410
So, yeah, so zero sum really does kind of focus on this two player setting.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.579
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.390
&gt;&gt; So we got this modified kelvin equation

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.480
and we can even translate it into a form

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.050
that's like Q learning. So the analog of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.480
the kelvin equation and the Q learning update in

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.210
this setting would be that we. If we're

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.350
in some state, there's some joint action that's taken,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.850
there's some pair of rewards that comes and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.590
some next state that's visited that the Q value

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.030
for that state, joint action pair, is going to be updated to be closer

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.880
to, the reward for player i plus the discounted expected value, or sorry, the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.110
discounted Summarized value or v value of the new states as prime, and we'll

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.450
again, we'll use mini-max to summarize what the values are in that new state.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.120
&gt;&gt; I like it.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.820
&gt;&gt; And that equation is sometimes referred

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.840
to as mini-max Q, because it's like

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.920
the Q learning update but just with the mini-max operator instead of a max.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.940
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.
