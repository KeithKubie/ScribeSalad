00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.380
Here's what it should look like. Note that instead of the 25 we use the

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.531
constant. Same for the 255 here and now when you look at the whole thing it

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.560
reads pretty nicely doesn't it? We take the smaller of the original red plus

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.474
the added red and the maximum. No more magic is involved. You always want to do

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:21.964
that in your programs when you find yourself using numbers. whose meaning is

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:24.964
not totally clear, just make them into constants.
