(bright music)

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.810
- Welcome to A Conversation With History.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.280
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.450
Our guest today is Philip Pettit

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.450
who is the LS Rockefeller
University Professor of Politics

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.700
and Human Values at Princeton

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.620
and distinguished Professor of Philosophy

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.580
at the Australian National University.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.370
He works in moral and political theory

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.020
and on issues in philosophy
of the mind and metaphysics.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.870
His most recent book is,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.020
Just Freedom: A Moral
Compass for a Complex World.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.560
He is giving the Tanner
Lectures on Human Values

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.523
at Berkeley in 2015.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.490
Professor Pettit, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.323
- Thank you.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.611
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.940
- A small town of the
west of Ireland, Ballygar,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.363
it's County Galway directly
across from Dublin.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.410
- And looking back,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.270
how do you see your parents
shaping your perspective

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.103
on the world?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.300
- I was raised in quite
a religious family,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.810
not sectarian I must say, Catholic,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.000
but very, very encompassing,
very ecumenical in attitude

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.900
and I think it was through
probably religious themes

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.360
that I came to philosophy, an
interest in the big questions

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.710
which were obviously always put before you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.470
about free will, about good and evil,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.400
about the existence of
God, about an afterlife.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.730
And these issues clearly for anyone

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.900
at that background are going
to be very, very prominent.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.390
I went through standard schooling

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.510
where actually my interest
were mainly mathematics

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170
and classics and went
to university intending

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.730
to do one or the other.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.280
And in university
discovered the possibility

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.670
of doing philosophy which I
must say really excited me.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.850
I thought the idea of being
able to spend time thinking

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.880
about these big questions

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.210
on which I had, after all,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.000
just received religious instruction

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.990
so to speak for thinking for myself.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.040
I found that really heady almost.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.180
I remember the excitement
when I was 18 you know

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.040
that I could transfer to the subject.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.897
So I did.

00:02:57.897 --> 00:03:02.310
- And was the the leap

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.070
from viewing this as religious topics

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.630
to really viewing them in a secular way,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.380
was that difficult for you?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.400
Or it just flowed naturally?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.320
- I think it really, in my own case,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.090
it occurred mainly because
of reading Satre's.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.000
I became very enthusiastic about his work.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.440
I didn't for a moment believe it.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.120
I mean coming in my background, after all,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.860
here was someone, you
know, there was no God,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.760
there was certainly freewill,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.250
that it was a very extraordinary sort,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.490
very different from the sort, for example,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.430
that Aquinas would have articulated

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.420
that I would have learned.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.560
But it was so exciting reading Sartre

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.160
'cause here was somebody who
dealt with the big questions,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.770
who had different views from me

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.780
that I've been raised in
on almost every question,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.560
who developed them this
wonderfully systematic way

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.240
and who also gave literary
expression to them

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.580
in both his plays

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.690
which I think are still
extraordinarily good

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.600
and his novels which are
maybe not so good as novels.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.410
But they still give it
vividness to these themes.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.810
For me that was probably

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.180
the most exciting intellectual
event in university

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.127
that I discovered Sartre

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:13.260
and I actually wrote an
undergraduate senior thesis

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.630
on Sartre.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.300
I was completely converted
to philosophy from then on.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.080
- In either before university
or during university,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.283
were you engaged in politics at all?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.390
- No, not immediate,
not as an undergraduate.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.670
But I am, I'd rather unusual background.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.650
At the same time when
I went to university,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.350
I was also in seminary,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.280
training with the idea of
becoming a Catholic priest.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.500
So reading Sartre, for example,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.670
I had to actually get the
permission of my bishop

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.470
to read Sartre because Sartre was

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.560
on the index of forbidden books
within the Catholic Church.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.560
But I left the priesthood,
I mean I left that strand

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.530
and about three years in.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.790
I then did a master's
degree which was rather

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.560
different from the Sartre work

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.490
and on basically the early
Bertrand Russell and G. Moore

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.223
and their thought.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.250
I then, amazingly, this was 1968,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.560
there were jobs aplenty
especially in Ireland and England

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.173
because all these new
universities had been created.

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:24.890
And so I think my MA examiners,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.220
both my external examiner's
offered me a post

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.220
so I was teaching at 20, 21
I think I started teaching.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.600
So I was junior faculty

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.230
when they the big revolts
happened in university,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.100
in Berkeley of course but also in Europe,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.200
including in Ireland.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.440
So I was teaching at
University College in Dublin

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.440
in 1969, March '69 when
the student unrest began

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.042
and I did actually get
quite involved in that

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:57.110
as a sort of junior
faculty and in the end,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.570
I mean I was one of the faculty

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.020
who was you know pro students

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.870
as you'd expect at that age and time

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.520
and I suppose given my own inclinations.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.530
But the first book I actually published,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.950
I think it's the only book

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.550
that's ever been in a
bestseller list actually,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.840
was a collection of pieces

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.840
by quote, people described as
radical faculty and students

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.500
which I edited in 1969 in Ireland.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.050
It was published under the title,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.020
somewhat embarrassing now
as, The Gentle Revolution.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.990
But it was sort of an Irish version

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.462
of Paris (speaking in foreign language)

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:36.270
and of what was happening
in Berkeley at the time.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.550
Probably a more modulated moderate version

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.840
than what was happening elsewhere.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.300
- We're gonna talk about
your book on freedom shortly

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.300
but I'm curious to what
extent did the experience

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.420
in the Catholic Church on the one hand

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.360
and the student activism on the other,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.310
did they point you in the direction

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.793
of this focus on freedom.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.050
- I think probably the exposure

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.896
to Sartre very early on put the theme

00:07:06.896 --> 00:07:10.780
of freedom very, very
prominently in my mind.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.430
I mean Sartre was focused of course

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.450
and I've always been in
interested in that too,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.220
on what we would call free will

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.100
or on the freedom of an agent

00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:22.890
to go with his or her judgment

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.543
rather than desires and so on.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.030
But problem for him

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.610
and it comes out in his
work as it develops,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.330
is how to translate that into
a political ideal of freedom

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.520
and that always concerned me.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.860
So that team was there very
early on that was some,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.990
I mean it was probably
15 or 20 years later

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.430
before I began writing very explicitly

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.723
about the political ideal of freedom.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.360
- I like to ask my guests about
the skills and temperaments

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.228
that they think are prerequisites

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:03.220
or helpful in the career
that they've chosen.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.220
So what do you see as important
skills for a philosopher?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.930
- Obsession.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.660
I think the capacity to
become completely obsessed

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.850
with the problem or with an idea

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.870
so that you don't just read about it,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.070
you don't just write about it

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.860
but you think about it.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.700
It's the first thing

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.460
that comes to mind when
you have a spare moment,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.920
in the doctor surgery or
on the bed in the morning

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.283
or whatever it might be.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.170
Just to be able to return to the thought

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.500
or the idea or the problem
and think it quietly through

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.780
and keep your mind focused on it.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.500
See I think that's it's really
a sort of obsession I think.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.790
I'd have to say that it's
like riding the tiger

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.730
in Mao's phrase, you
know, I think you've got

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.250
to have that obsession
and and live with it too.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.560
At least that's what I found
that works in my own case

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.480
in dealing with a problem.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.780
It's always that obsession

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.350
that's pushed me towards
publishing something,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.070
writing something that I may,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.860
of course be more or less happy with

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.391
but that's certainly I
think a driving force.

00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:12.391
- And it must also be the ability

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.890
to transcend frustration

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.040
'cause it must be very frustrating

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.513
when you're alone trying
to grapple with a problem.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.483
- Right, well I think
you probably have to,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.810
yeah in order to concentrate

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.640
in the I'm talking
about I guess, you know,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.910
if it's in the doctor surgery
or on the bus or whatever,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.540
it might be you have to be
able to put other things

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.940
that are on your mind aside.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.700
You know not to be distracted,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.000
you certainly have to have that capacity.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.040
I think that when you
talk about frustration,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.000
it's true that philosophical problems,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.960
any problems really if
you think through them,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.240
are often very, very
frustrating you know ,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.040
when you stuck with the problem,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.290
you can't see your way out,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.810
you've tried this, you've tried that,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.643
you've tried the other,

00:09:57.643 --> 00:09:59.610
you've read the background literature,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.470
you find yourself just staring
at a blank page of paper,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.140
you know when you're trying to
set down your ideas about it.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.190
I found that actually, I do
find that very frustrating

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.283
and if I think I've hit a blank
wall it really bothers me.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.870
I guess everybody experiences this,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.720
that you've just got to live with it.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.290
- In your work, especially
the book on freedom,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.313
which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:10:27.264 --> 00:10:30.397
there also seems in
your work to be a sense

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.290
of the history of the problem

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.290
and how it has evolved over
time in the work of philosophers

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.800
that have preceded you.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.280
Talk a little about that

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.730
because the history of
philosophical thought seems

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.980
to be very important.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.670
- Mm, well if I can
just do that by talking

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.500
about my own history in a way.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.510
After University College Dublin,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.240
at least after three or four years there,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.810
I was lucky enough to
get a research fellowship

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.080
at a college in Cambridge,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.240
Trinity Hall in Cambridge, England.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.240
And there I came to be
very close to people

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.120
who work in the history of
ideas such as Quentin Skinner

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.850
and Richard Tuck.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.084
Through them, I must say,

00:11:15.084 --> 00:11:20.084
I became intrigued with
the history of this subject

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.480
and they concentrate,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.113
it was often called the
Cambridge Contextual School,

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:28.040
on the context of historical ideas.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.210
I became quite fascinated with that.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.640
But on the other hand I sort
of felt this wasn't for me

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.890
that I really wasn't cut out
to be a historian of that kind

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.060
that I thought that I'd find
it impossible to get interested

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.170
in reading not just the greats

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.870
but the less great people
that the greats had read

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.930
and even less great
people that they had read

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.650
to know the full context.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.107
So my response actually
was to go more theoretical

00:11:55.107 --> 00:11:58.300
and in my philosophical thinking

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:02.790
and it really was only
10 or 15 years later

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.110
that I think I rediscovered the enthusiasm

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.410
for connecting with the history.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.170
But that had laid the foundation

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.100
and I think I did so because of realizing

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.560
that with new technologies,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.770
you could now access the historical texts.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.400
For example you could take
a word and do a search

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.840
through the digital library
of some one like Hobbs

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.300
or any thinker and and immediately be able

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.920
to get these sources and
see how you describe,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.670
so you in other words, you
are now getting for cheap,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.410
skills that 20 years previously
would have required months

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.800
and years of work.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.410
I think when that happened
my historical interest

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.170
sort of came back to
life and began to connect

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.130
with the philosophical thought.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.100
- Before we talk about freedom,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.950
I have one other question for you

00:12:50.155 --> 00:12:54.470
and that is your sense
of theory and practice.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.160
You've said in an interview

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.650
that you thought it was a two-way street.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.030
I know that you were
part of an experiment,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.150
which we'll talk about later,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.780
on freedom but talk a
little about that interface

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.820
what in your background
made you sensitive to that.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.012
Was it the student movement

00:13:14.012 --> 00:13:16.720
that you were discussing earlier?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.160
- Honestly I don't know really.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.310
I think what is true that I've always felt

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.990
in particular with political philosophy

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.870
and to good extent in
other areas perhaps too

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.230
but in political philosophy
that if you are really trying

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.340
to think through both the
nature of our institutions,

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.140
how we should think about them

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.950
and the values that are
inherent in them sometimes,

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.570
they've ways in which
they fail those values,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.020
the ways in which they might be improved,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.990
that there's something, I
don't know, irresponsible,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.180
I mean that's too harsh a word.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.770
That there's something that
I don't find to my taste

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.480
in sort of then going away

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.570
and thinking about so to speak utopia

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.410
thinking about an abstract ideal world

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.560
rather than thinking
about where we can get to

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.570
from where we are in
our actual institutions.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.230
Now of course in order to do that,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.490
I think it's very, very
useful to have a sense

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.420
of how those institutions work and before,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.180
I know you want to talk about Spain,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.360
and my involvement there
which I'll happily do

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.100
but long before that I
had actually been asked

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.210
to do a review of the
Australian Capital Territory.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.368
I worked full-time at the
Australian National University

00:14:31.368 --> 00:14:33.320
at the time it was 1997

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.810
and there was a review of
self-government in that area.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.130
The Australian Capital Territory,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.140
it's like D.C., Australia's D.C.,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.727
self-government had brought
in 10 years previously in 1987

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.310
and I was asked to
review how it had worked.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.240
It was out of the blue.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.400
It's just due to the fact

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.110
that some politicians
had known me personally

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.560
and knew about my interests.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.460
And I took six months or
something off academic work

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.570
and I chaired this very small committee

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.190
with two really quite
outstanding public servants,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.300
amazingly knowledgeable public servants

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.540
and I spent that six months really apart

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.260
from the time spent writing and thinking

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.690
and so on and reading,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.870
I spent a lot of it just
in around the corridors

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.510
of a very small political unit.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.800
But the interesting
thing is political units,

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.910
they work very similarly
even at different scales.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.400
I felt that was for me a revelation.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.900
I felt I really now had a sense
of how government can work

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.879
in the different
branches, the interactions

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:36.810
and the constraints and the
ideals that are important

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.410
to keep in place and the ways
in which they're likely always

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.420
to go off track with the
system becoming distorted

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.700
or even corrupted in various ways.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.480
So that I think made a real
connection with practice

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.490
and no doubt my student days may

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.160
or at least my days of young faculty

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.267
in University College Dublin may have been

00:15:56.267 --> 00:15:59.130
because I was involved in
wider politics in Ireland.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.410
So that may also have
contributed to that interest.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.370
- Interestingly what was the platform

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.710
on which you did this work?

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.800
By that I mean,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.120
you clearly weren't examining
these government units

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.890
for their economic efficiency.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.870
I mean you didn't come
there as an economist.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.807
Did you come there as
somebody with a set of values

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.970
who had thought about values

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.190
and were looking at these units

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.160
from that perspective?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.170
- Actually I came with a fairly open mind

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.840
because the remit I was
given was a very open remit

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.870
to after all the this
territory had been run

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.870
by the federal government

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.350
by a branch of the federal government

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.350
over you know the previous 60, 70 years

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.460
and this was really quite novel

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.220
that you had an electoral system,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.700
you had a parliament,
you had an executive.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.130
So what I found myself doing was looking

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.470
at the structure of Parliament
and of the executive,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.360
how they're related to one
another, how the electoral,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.600
the members of the legislature are related

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.900
to their constituencies,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.310
how the constituencies were drawn.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.900
One thing that really came

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.610
to my mind strongly was the relationship

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.190
between this system and
the Westminster system,

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.023
on the one hand,

00:17:15.023 --> 00:17:18.000
which is the dominant paradigm
in Australia of course

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.210
and the Washington system on the other.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.010
Because it turned out that in this area,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.020
in Canberra basically, the
Australian Capital Territory,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.840
it turns out that the the
government is really very rarely

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.070
at least then was rarely
controlled by a single party.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.160
So in order to get government
in order for those elected

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.740
to the legislature to elect in turn

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.090
a functioning, reliable, stable executive,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.520
they had to take people
from different parties

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.060
and independents and so on

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.430
and now that looks much
more Washington like

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.590
than it does you know the
single party type government

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.650
that you get in typically in Westminster.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.440
I found that quite fascinating

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.010
and I found the talking to
people about the tensions

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.240
that they experienced in office

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.310
between satisfying their constituents

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.190
and satisfying the press gallery

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.560
and satisfying their colleagues
in caucus in the party

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.810
and in government.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.530
I found that extraordinarily interesting.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.650
I mean it was, it gave me an insight into,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.330
at least I think it gave me an insight,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.840
into how government works even though

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.300
at a very small scale

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.130
that I found really drove me,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.363
stimulating you know.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.050
- So your book is called

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.920
Just Freedom: A Moral
Compass for a Complex World.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.863
I'll show that.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.563
And so let's talk about that book

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.870
and what led you to undertake it

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.850
first of all and how long
did it take you to write it?

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.593
- Well if I could say the book,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.320
the book rep is an expression
of a way of thinking

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.620
about politics which people
sometimes call Civic Republican

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.290
that sometimes nowadays Neo-republican

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.540
and I had really chanced
upon this tradition

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.870
and connected with it in
articulating my own ideas back

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.250
in the 1990s so I'd
published a book called,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.883
Republicanism in 1997.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.510
Probably not the best title
given an American audience

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.660
because it suggests that
it was a republicanism

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.020
in the GOP sense

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.230
where it's not really
a Civic Republicanism,

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.660
much more traditional
sort of way of thinking

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.030
and come to that in a moment.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.630
And over the years between 1997

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.600
and when this was published in 2014

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.170
I'd obviously been involved
in various enterprises related

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.290
to this Republican tradition of thinking

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.080
and I know you want to bring me back

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.498
to one such enterprise in particular.

00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:51.830
This book basically was intended as a book

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.170
that would make the approach accessible

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.514
to a wider audience than just scholars

00:19:59.514 --> 00:20:02.570
or even university students.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.123
So how I came to it.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.780
That was back in the 90s that I,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.490
so to speak came to the idea,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.240
this way of thinking about freedom.

00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.550
Two roads really to the
idea in my own case.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.100
One I was thinking quite
abstractly or theoretically

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.100
about how we should conceive
of freedom politically.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.960
If we grant that it's impossible

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.620
that we should ever
live in a solitary world

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.990
that we are essentially a social species

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.960
we live, clearly there's no
possibility for anyone of us

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.470
of living independently of others.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.040
Now the tradition in some ways

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.430
of thinking about freedom
suggested you'd be perfectly free

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.300
if you lived in a solitary universe,

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.730
you know, you lived in the
state of nature all alone,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.313
no one to get in your way,
you were perfectly free.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.510
I think that's, when I say the tradition,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.120
that's a way of thinking about freedom

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.380
that's certainly in the literature
and has long been there.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.610
I was thinking about, well look,

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.250
suppose the solitary condition
isn't even a possibility

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.910
and you want to think about
what does freedom mean

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.820
if it's got to be something
that you can enjoy

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.770
in the presence of other people,

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.510
including other people who are bound

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.780
to get in your way in various ways.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.680
And I'd begun to think that well,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.180
perhaps we should think
of it as a sort of status

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.770
that we have vis-a-vis others

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.810
that we're free when we're given a space

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.830
where we can act according
to our own wishes

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.740
and where other people are not entitled

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.480
to interfere in that space

00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:48.570
and it's not just

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.910
that they don't actually
interfere in that space

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.670
but they're blocked from
interfering in that space.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.630
So it's not just, for example,
that I can act as I wish,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.370
say, for example, in
reading whatever I wish

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.890
because you, who could stop me,

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.540
really rather likes the idea
of my reading whatever I wish

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.470
but should you turn against
me you would stop me.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.200
I wouldn't enjoy freedom
in that status sense

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.950
if I depended on your permission

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.800
for being able to read what I wished.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.580
I need to have that,
so to speak, protected

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.700
and secured against the
good will of others.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.810
So I was thinking in that broad way

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.620
and then somebody said to me,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.870
actually somebody who
did his PhD in Berkeley,

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.400
in history of ideas,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.450
said to me that I should
perhaps look at some work

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.390
of Quentin Skinner's my
friend from Cambridge days.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.660
Which I did and he led me
to read the long tradition

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.180
of so often called Republican thought

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.790
from Rome, through the Middle
Ages, through the Renaissance,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.930
through the Dutch Republic,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.170
the English Republic in the 17th century

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.700
and of course the American
and French republics

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.280
in the 18th century in particular.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.900
And I found in these texts a
way of thinking about freedom.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.821
I felt that it was exactly the one

00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:11.450
that I was nudging or finding
my way loosely towards.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.720
So on that way of thinking about freedom

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.040
in order to be free in
relation to other people it has

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.150
to be the case not just that
they don't get in your way

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.360
but that they're stopped.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.090
They're not able to get in your way.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.620
So in an image that I use in Just Freedom,

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.830
this particular book
to illustrate the idea,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.560
I ask people to think
about the relationship

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.840
between Torvald and Nora,

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.530
the two protagonists of A Doll's
House Ibsen's famous play,

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.070
where Torvald, the husband,
a young banker has of course

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.447
all the legal and social and
cultural rights and powers

00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:52.240
vis-a-vis Nora his young wife.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.060
But he totally dotes on her,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.280
worships the ground she walks on

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.020
and gives her as you
might say carte blanche

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.990
so she can act exactly as she wishes.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.090
So the question I ask
is should we regard Nora

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:09.290
as enjoying freedom in
relation to Torvald.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.880
Well now the very striking thing is that

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.620
in terms of the Roman and the Neo-Roman,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.970
the long Republican way
of thinking about freedom,

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.030
the way of thinking about
freedom that the founders

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.280
in America certainly celebrated,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.700
you could not say that
Nora enjoyed freedom.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.100
Because while Nora did whatever she wished

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.870
within a certain range she
always did it implicitly

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.800
by permission of Torvald.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.290
She depended on his goodwill.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.170
So even though he didn't interfere,

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.830
even though she had carte blanche,

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.360
she had freedom as non-interference.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.770
She still had a Dominus in the Roman term,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.450
a lord or a master in her life.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.980
So she enjoyed non-interference

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.530
but she did not enjoy non-domination.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.070
Torvald was a master although
a sweet master, a kind master,

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.960
you know in the old
term but still a master.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.960
And that's really the
core idea in this Civic

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.170
or older Republican way
of thinking about freedom

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.623
that you've got to not be
subject to the mastery of others.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.660
- As you talk about this in your book,

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.050
it's very clear that this
is a structural theory

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.450
and often when you're
looking at structures,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:31.450
the insight is not visible to the person

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.850
who's not really thinking
through the issue.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.290
So Nora does appear to be free

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.790
but it's only by analyzing the structure

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.080
of the situation and you
do that throughout the work

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.860
that the true power relationship
is revealed is that fair?

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.310
- That is absolutely fair.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.870
Because as you say freedom on this way

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.500
of conceiving of things
is a function not just

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.370
of the actions of other
people but of the powers

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.660
at the disposal of other people.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.110
So if you exist as someone
who is relatively powerless

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.200
in relation to others,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.095
where others have a power of interfering

00:26:09.095 --> 00:26:11.660
even if they don't actually interfere.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.860
The very fact of their having those powers

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.730
and you're not having any
sort of countervailing power

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.100
any anti-power as you might call it.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.100
Means that you always live
really at their mercy,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.530
you're exposed to their interference,

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.480
should they wish to interfere.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.820
Of course you're going to know
this in general in most cases

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.790
and so that's also going
to put in place a motive

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:44.440
to defer, to keep the
powerful free to bend the knee

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.090
in the old terms you know,

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.920
to tug the forelock if you have one

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.040
or tip the cap, to kowtow.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.220
These are all words in this tradition,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.440
to fawn and to toady.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.900
This is what you're going
to be motivated to do

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.560
in relation to others if you exist

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.320
as you say, within that
structural sort of scenario

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.130
where the others have got the
power and you don't have it.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.893
- You make an important
distinction in American culture.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:20.610
It sounds like you're
close to libertarianism

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.850
but you're making the point,

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:27.640
no that's not the case
because your insight is

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.060
in a way more powerful
about where freedom lies.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.460
So what is it about libertarianism

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.233
that you disagree with?

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.030
- Well at the basic level

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.860
in the conception of freedom itself

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.360
the purely abstract level.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.130
So on the libertarian
understanding of freedom

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.040
you're a free so long as you're not in,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.340
you're free in a given choice.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.840
Take a particular choice
like what to read,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.010
where to travel, what job to take up.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.180
You're free in so far as no one
actually interferes with you

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.440
on the libertarian conception.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.140
On the older Republican
conception in order to be free

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.070
it has to be the case
that you are protected

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.600
against those sorts of,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.035
secure against those
sorts of interferences.

00:28:14.035 --> 00:28:17.800
I mentioned earlier that I
believe there's a real rupture

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.930
in the history of freedom

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.090
and it occurs ironically about the time

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.800
of the American Revolution.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.100
The heroes of the American Revolution

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.030
and they're, for example,
supporters in England

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.270
such as Joseph Priestley the chemist

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.970
or Richard Price the mathematician

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.570
who are voluble supporters
of the Americans.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.610
They all use the notion of
freedom I've been talking about.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.640
So for example, Price says at one point

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.060
and he says that someone who's subject

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.370
to a master in a matter are
kindly a master is not free,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.410
insofar as he still depends of
the good will of that master

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.150
and he says the same
is true of a community

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.780
and he suggests that that's what's true

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.910
about the American colonists.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.460
The white American colonists of course

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.963
in relation to Westminster.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.370
Again Joseph Priestley says what is it

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.680
that the Americans complain of

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.610
and he says it's not that the British

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:17.280
or the Westminster
Parliament are taking their,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.940
are taking very much from them in tax.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.750
They're only taking one penny he suggests

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.040
but it's that Westminster
Parliament claims the power

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.260
to take their last penny.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.870
So what they're doing is they're
imagining the relationship

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.170
between London and the
American colonies of the time

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.600
as the relationship between
a master and a servant

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.750
and they're saying we're not free

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.840
because London is claiming
the position of a master.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.490
Remember in 1766 when
London, the Parliament,

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.920
had lifted the the Stamp Act,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.110
had withdrawn that particular tax,

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.410
had been very nice about it so to speak,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.700
had been a really kindly master.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.740
They added the Declaratory Act

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.840
that said of course we
insist that we have the power

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.200
and the right should we wish
to impose this sort of text,

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.400
this sort of tax.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.220
So what they're claiming is precisely

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.800
that they have the powers

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.342
and the Americans immediately
react by saying we're not free

00:30:18.342 --> 00:30:20.710
if these people claim their powers

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.690
and they're using the very idea of freedom

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.710
that had been popular in England
in the European tradition.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.210
It goes right back to the Romans,

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.640
the idea that you're not free

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.800
if you're subject to
somebody else's good will.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.460
They as a community are not free

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:39.220
'cause they're subject to the
good will now of Westminster

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.300
which has claimed that it has this power,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.600
should you wish to
impose any tax or any law

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.600
that it wants to impose on the Americans.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.410
So what happens in
England at this point is

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.490
that the defenders of
the English cause begin

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.210
to introduce a new way of thinking

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.950
about freedom and it becomes very visible

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.990
in particular in a
pamphlet published in 1776

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.220
by someone called John Lind.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.710
And it's called Three
Letters to Dr. Price.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.510
Dr. Price is Richard Price,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.790
the one who had supported the Americans,

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.200
running the gentle master theme.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.020
And in that document Lind,
it's a pamphlet really,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.250
in support of the British government

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.540
in that document he says what is freedom

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.780
and he amazingly breaks
with a long tradition

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.610
and he says well to be free is just

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.010
to be not constrained or restrained.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.427
So if you're not restrained
or restrained you're free

00:31:33.427 --> 00:31:35.260
and if you are you're not free.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.980
And then he says well that means

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.870
that the law always makes you unfree

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.320
to the extent to which are
subject to law your unfree.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.690
That was very different
from the older view

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.600
which said law was the
protection against others

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.860
that actually made you free.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.750
So even John Locke was
part of that tradition.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.530
To be free was to enjoy
the protection of the law.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.070
So you got your area where
you could act according

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.740
to your own will regardless
of what you wanted to do

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.260
and regardless of what
others wanted you to do.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.570
Now what he's saying is law is
actually the enemy of freedom

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.680
and he then goes on to say,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.430
well what's the complaint of the Americans

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.843
'cause we in England live
under a law that restrains us

00:32:16.843 --> 00:32:20.370
and you in America live under
a law that restrains you

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.040
but what's the difference between us.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.490
And why do you say you're not free

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.070
and we are free in England?

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.770
It's a very clever argument.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.280
He has a footnote in that book

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.200
in which he says this way
of thinking about freedom

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.820
I derive from a very good friend.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.730
A worthy and ingenious friend,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.140
he describes him but doesn't name him.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.810
Turns out the friend
had actually complained

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.150
to Lind about the fact

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.314
that he was using this way
of thinking about freedom

00:32:45.314 --> 00:32:47.970
which he'd, the friend,
claimed to have invented.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.540
He said it came to me
as a kind of invention

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.800
some six months hence.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.390
That friend was Jeremy Bentham.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.660
Really extraordinary sort of coincidence

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.530
because Bentham becomes, of course,

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.317
becomes the great theorist of
law in the English tradition

00:33:04.317 --> 00:33:06.430
and is amazingly influential.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.240
The great utilitarian
of course and a reformer

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.520
but he introduces this new
way of thinking about freedom

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.020
whereby it just requires
that you not interfered with.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.220
It doesn't matter about
the power or the structure

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.700
as you were saying and that
then becomes the centerpiece

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.010
of the new classical
liberal views that appear

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.200
in the early 19th century the early 1800s.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.200
- These examples of the
American Revolution point

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.333
to the fact that if you're gonna come up

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:41.640
with a powerful definition
of freedom you have

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.370
to articulate it with regard

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.070
to several domains which you do.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.887
So it's freedom is that state

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.360
where you're free of domination,

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.880
where there's no domination

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.290
but it has to apply with
your relationship to others,

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.700
with other people situated as you are,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.060
it has to apply in the relationship

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.960
of people to the government

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.960
and also the relationship between states.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.980
So the examples you just
showed from the American

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.570
that was the germination of this idea

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.330
that it couldn't just be in one domain.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:27.330
- Yes, I think of political
philosophy, political theory

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.390
as having really three domains of concern

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:32.320
and this notion of freedom
we're talking about,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.960
has implications in each of those domains.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.380
So just the three you mentioned,

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.530
let's think about the
first as the social domain.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.930
The domain in which people relate

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:45.370
to their fellow citizens, I
suppose, within a given country.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.363
Think of that as the social domain.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.990
The second domain is you might think of it

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.020
as the political domain

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.930
which is not the relationship

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.180
between citizens and one another

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.910
but the relationship between
the citizenry as a whole

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.300
and their government.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.680
And then of course the third
domain is the relationship

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.610
between different
societies mediated usually

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.590
in the relationships
between the governments

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.410
of the different societies.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.530
Now I think that the
Civic Republican ideal

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.420
of freedom as non-domination
was traditionally used

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.570
in all of these domains actually

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.640
and that there is much to be said

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.290
for rethinking our ways of doing politics

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.490
and our policies and so on

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.410
by looking at the
ramifications or implications

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.810
of this ideal in those three domains.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.620
You might think of the first
as a domain of social justice,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.820
you know establishing a relationship

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.840
between citizens in social life such that

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.880
each of them can enjoy freedom

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.243
in relation to other citizens.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.660
The second domain of
citizenry to government,

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.860
you think of as the domain
of political justice

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.910
that you want the citizenry as a whole

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.040
each considered as equal of course

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.390
to enjoy a relationship
with their government

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:05.510
such that they are not
dominated by their government

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.920
and in that sense they
enjoy political justice.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.940
And then in relationship
between different societies,

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.800
I think the ideal of freedom

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.280
as non-domination gives
us a very nice line

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.300
into thinking about
international relations

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.360
and about the ways in which
societies should relate

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.630
to one another in the international forum,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.510
ideally enabling each society
or at least each society

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.660
that is itself self-governing
and democratic,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.730
there isn't an oppressive government

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.280
not to be dominated by other societies

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.700
and not of course to be dominated

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.750
by other international bodies

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.550
like multinational corporations

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.520
or for that matter churches are

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.200
of course international agencies.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.200
- You have a brief phrase
to sum up the realization

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.030
of freedom in each of those
domain for social justice.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.590
It's the eyeball test.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.082
- The eyeball test, yes.
- Explain that.

00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:08.082
- So in order to make vivid
in this book, in Just Freedom,

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.860
the ramifications of the notion

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.500
of freedom in each of these areas,

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:17.500
I suggest a sort of a rough-and-ready test

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.370
for determining whether
people are enjoying freedom

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.113
in any of these three domains
and in the social domain.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.440
But this is not my invention,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.790
actually you find this
in the 17th century.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.430
In the social domain a good test

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.627
of whether people really
enjoy freedom in relation

00:37:34.627 --> 00:37:38.280
to one another under the
organization of the state

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.700
and the economy and the law and so on is

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.240
whether people are able to
look one another in the eye

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.570
without reason for fear or deference.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.490
They can in the old language
stand on their own two feet

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.930
and stand equal on a par with others.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.370
Now I think we all know, you know,

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.200
that's why I say it's
a rough-and-ready test

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.950
but it's an applicable test.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.890
We know when we live in a situation

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.170
where you're really not able
to look others in the eye.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.497
So for example I don't mean
to be too contentious here

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.750
but I believe that if you've
got a working situation

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.760
where one person employs many others

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.470
and where that person has
a right to fire at will

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.920
without any negotiation
with a tribunal body

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.900
or a union for that matter

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.310
without any legal hurdles to cross,

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.140
is just able to fire at will

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.940
in a world where there's high unemployment

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.013
and being fired is a very
serious sort of loss to anybody.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.520
When that person, the employer,
has that sort of power

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.930
in relation to an employee
then I think that's a case

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.250
where the employee is
really not going to be able

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.850
to look the employer in
the eye without reason

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.200
for fear or deference.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.570
In fact being aware of that situation,

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.250
the employee in such a case
is going to have every reason

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.350
in the world, every motive in the world,

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.650
in the old 17th century
language to fawn and toady,

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.220
you know to kowtow and tip the
cap or whatever it might be.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.960
I think that that's not a good way

00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:11.667
of organizing our employment,

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:13.830
our workplace relations, for example.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.370
If it induces that failure
of the eyeball test

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.280
in the workplace.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.650
But of course there are many places

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.640
in social life apart from the workplace.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.590
There's the public place,
there's the family place,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.720
of course the home and
in all of these areas

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.700
I think it's important that
there be protections in place,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.120
many of them legal and
many of them cultural

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.220
such that everyone really
has got his or her own space

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.350
and is able to look
others equally in the eye.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.960
- In the realm of government and freedom

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.710
from the domination of the government

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.990
the test is tough luck.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.020
- The tough luck test.
- Yeah, explain that.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.240
- Yes, I'm not sure that
this is quite as intuitive

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.170
as the eyeball test.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.653
But myself, I actually
find it fairly persuasive.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.700
So it goes like this.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.380
If I live in a society
where there are, say,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.890
we've all got a vote and so on,

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.820
we're all able to contest what happens,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.870
we're all able to write to
our Member of Parliament,

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.190
we're all able to join some NGO to protest

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.060
on one or another front against
what government is doing,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.530
to have some influence,

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.670
we're all able to join a
demonstration whatever it is.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.700
If we live in a society
where, first of all,

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.600
we have those personal powers shared

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.330
with our fellow citizens

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.030
and again we live in a
society where what happens

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.990
in the higher echelon, so to
speak, the corridors of power,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.400
the various bureau and so on
and the various courtrooms

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.780
for that matter and tribunals are subject

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.700
to what we think of as
an impartial sort of rule

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.670
where no one's interests, not
the interests of the wealthy,

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.030
not the interests of a
particular religion or whatever,

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.500
no one's special interests
have particular force,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.070
everyone is more or less well represented,

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.420
interests in general are well represented.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.200
Then you'll be in the
following situation that

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.540
when the government or the
legislature passes a law

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.260
and of course this is the
legislature you help elect

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.350
and it's responsive to you and
to fellow citizens equally.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:22.350
When they pass a law and you
really believe with this system

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.430
that you are equally represented
with others in this system

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.900
and that those in your neck of the woods,

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.530
your corner of society are
not particularly suppressed

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.270
or whatever not particularly
second-rate citizens

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.360
then what you're going to believe

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.440
about a piece of legislation
even when it goes against you,

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.440
so perhaps the government
introduces a measure in taxation

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.710
that doesn't particularly
go down well with you

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:52.530
or those in your particular area

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.910
in the economy, for example,

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.150
you should be able to think of the fact

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.640
that this legislation goes

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.240
against your particular interests.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.860
You should be able to think that,

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.360
well you know I believe in our system,

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.510
I think I'm equally represented
with others in that system

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.390
so I can think about this
as it's hard, it's tough,

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.500
but it's just tough luck.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.780
It's not that somebody
has got it in for me.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.710
It's not that there's
a power in government

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.490
that is representing other sectors

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.950
of society more strongly than mine.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.410
So that really what's
happening to me is a result

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.000
of the fact that government
is in the control

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.810
of another section of the community,

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.770
no rather government is responsive

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.460
to all the sides of the community.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.030
And so I'm able to think
about what government does

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.530
even when it acts in a way
that's not welcome to me

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.170
as that's just tough luck.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.470
Now I think if we had a
society where you could think

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.910
about legislation that even
ran against your wishes

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.500
that it was just tough luck

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.800
that's a good sign that
you're living in a society

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.750
where the government, the source
of law and order and so on,

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.590
in this society is a government
that's responsive to you

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:03.790
equally with others so that
no one of you is dominated

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:07.270
by that government as by
an independent agency.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.190
It's an agency that is responsive

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.140
to each of you equally with others,

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.190
you've got to live with others

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.670
that's part of the human condition

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.990
and so you're not dominated in so far

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.180
as that government has that
sort of responsiveness to all.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.600
- And with regard to global justice.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.590
What is the catchphrase there?

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.903
- The catchphrase there
is straight-talking.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.440
Imagine the relationship

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.410
between the the Ukrainian government

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.000
and the Russian government as of now

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.270
where, for example, the
Russian government clearly

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.502
you've got troops on the border

00:43:46.502 --> 00:43:48.460
or in the precincts of the border

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.270
and clearly you have a deep
influence over the the people

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.410
in eastern Ukraine and are able

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.210
to turn off the gas at any point.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.860
The relationship between
those two governments is

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.450
clearly one of domination.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.780
I mean the Ukrainian government is

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.950
in a situation where they really,

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:12.090
other forces absent would
have to kowtow and toady

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.680
and fawn and so on,
would really not be free

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.840
in relation to that other government.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.560
Now of course it's very unstable

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.780
and an unhappy situation the
fact that the European Union

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.660
and that the United States is

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.420
to good extent backing the Ukrainians,

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.270
can give them a certain sort of boost

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.170
and maybe restore some degree of equality

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.320
in that relationship.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.350
But it's obviously very,
it's still very problematic.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.120
Now I think in relationships
general between states,

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.560
we have to think, first of all,

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.460
let's imagine we're talking about states

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.748
that are if not perfect democracies

00:44:48.748 --> 00:44:51.200
and I actually believe very few states

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.980
are anything near perfect in terms

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.080
of the ideal of political justice, right?

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.540
In almost every country
government is often subject

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.440
to the special influence
of particular groups

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.900
who control government.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.270
So people really don't
enjoy full political freedom

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.330
in relation to the government.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.820
But imagine for a moment
that we have got states

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.610
where we're not complaining
about them domestically,

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.700
they're politically okay.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.230
So what would it be to establish relations

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:20.810
between these states

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:25.080
such that no one society
would be dominated by others,

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.390
are dominated by multi-national agencies.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.430
Now this is a really big challenge.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.950
I mean your own area of interest
is international relations,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.100
so you will be very sensitive to this

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.340
because of course states
differ enormously in power,

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.500
in military power, in economic power,

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.110
in cultural power, in diplomatic clout,

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:48.100
they differ in enormous respects.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.000
So it's a real challenge there.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.050
Now I think that it is very important

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.490
from the point of view of countries

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.740
that they're not dominated

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.930
because if they are by another country

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.300
that impacts in turn on the residents,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.720
the citizens of that country.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.598
They become sort of second-rate citizens

00:46:02.598 --> 00:46:04.610
in the global order.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.040
So I think we really should
work towards this sort of ideal.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.000
It's another question
about how we can begin

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.290
to achieve anything like that ideal.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.490
Now I think international
agencies like the United Nations

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.580
and the various bodies
of the United Nations,

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.240
they are really absolutely crucial

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.840
and one of the very sad things

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.900
that I see happening nowadays
is a sort of withdrawal

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.110
of trust from these international
organizations and bodies

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.307
on the grounds that they're
suffering a Democratic deficit

00:46:32.307 --> 00:46:34.580
as it's often put.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.930
I think that's way overstated.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.170
These bodies after all are subject

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.080
to the control of the governments

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.060
who appoint the officials and so on

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.140
and those officials and international law,

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.520
international regulations,
international standards

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.840
which are, you know,
hammered out over tables

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.673
where countries are represented.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.150
I think that that's the only hope

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.470
of establishing an international order

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.380
where when the leaders of
countries talk to one another,

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.060
they can talk straight
you know they don't have

00:47:04.737 --> 00:47:06.310
to mealy-mouthed on the one hand

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.170
or speak with the tones
of a master on the other.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:13.840
- It strikes me that your
definition of freedom

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.840
through its simplicity and it
application across domains,

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:26.980
helps save freedom

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.980
as a virtue, as a value
for progressive ideals

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.300
in the sense that you're not saying

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.380
that the state should do nothing

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.270
because you're also saying
I can't be equal with you

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:48.270
unless my position, their
programs or policies

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.580
if I'm in poverty that
elevate me to be your equal

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.410
if you're not in a similar situation.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.170
So the virtue of what you're saying

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:06.600
and its distinction from
libertarianism on the one hand

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.593
and its emphasis on
structure on the other,

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:16.430
allows freedom to have a new
constituency shall we say

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.450
in terms of the divisions
that occur in our country.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:24.917
- Absolutely I mean I think the tradition

00:48:24.917 --> 00:48:28.750
and the ideas are of interest
on all sides of politics

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:32.650
but my own thinking about what's required

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.380
for giving substance and life
to this ideal of freedom,

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.010
a freedom that's non-domination

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.830
in these three different areas leads me

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.890
to support very progressive policies

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:45.300
and I think they are quite different

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.970
from the policies in general

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.030
that libertarians would support.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.440
So I'll give you an example.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.860
Take the workplace example.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.560
I mean libertarians will always insist

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.440
on the right to fire at will.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.080
It's one of the basics
or libertarian demands.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.320
But you give the right to fire at will

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.500
to an employer and you
immediately create an asymmetry

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.130
between employer and employee.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:12.130
Its standard libertarian line
to decry unions for example.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:16.750
Well, I must say, I deeply
regret the loss of union power

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.750
because while corporations,
unions have never been angels,

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.980
I mean they've always had
their their own problems,

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.680
the same is true of corporations.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.370
And what's happening with
the decline of unions is

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.550
that you don't have a countervailing power

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:35.111
against the power of corporations
in dealing with employees.

00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:37.630
Which means in turn of
course that the employees,

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.800
more and more get into a
position where they are dominated

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.180
or take a situation of, for example,

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.480
I think it's very important

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.080
that welfare legislation be in place,

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.800
including national health

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.770
or some form of national
health, public health system

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.440
so that people aren't put in the position

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.933
of having to depend on
the grace and goodwill

00:49:59.933 --> 00:50:02.600
of their betters and the wealthier.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.640
Now libertarian doctrine will
always tell you philanthropy

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.860
that's what we want more
and more philanthropy.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.720
Now I believe philanthropy
is a great thing

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.597
and well organized it can
be force for unalloyed good

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.610
but the idea that someone should depend

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.690
on the pro bono favor of doctors,

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.600
family they happen to know or whatever,

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.140
in order to get proper medical treatment.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.270
I mean I know that doesn't happen

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.350
but just take that as a commonly

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:33.290
but that is really anathema
to the idea of freedom

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.400
that we're talking about

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.090
'cause it means that the
person who's ill has got

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:41.020
to depend on the grace and
favor of the local doctor

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.460
who's not going to charge
a fee or whatever it is.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.720
You've got to have an
infrastructure of protection

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.980
in society in order to
ensure that people are going

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.330
to enjoy the capacity
that will enable them

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.580
to pass the eyeball test.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.320
And I think one thing
that's worth saying here,

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.790
if I can add Harry, is that
in libertarian thought,

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:05.200
it's often suggested that
we have a natural order

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.280
which is an order of
ownership and the market

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.740
but that's not a natural order.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.040
That's created by law.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.280
Property only exists in virtue of a law.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.180
If I were in a state of nature

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.247
and I hold on to this I
can possess it you know

00:51:19.247 --> 00:51:21.290
and you can take it from me.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.450
But it doesn't exist as property

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:26.240
unless we have a law that basically says

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.420
that the forces of the
community are going to rally

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.010
behind me if you try to take it from me.

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:32.660
They're going to support my claim.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.500
Law creates property, law equally creates

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.320
and of course facilitates markets

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.370
and that's a great thing,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.470
I mean I'm a great believer in markets.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.980
This is by no means some sort

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.903
of neo-Marxist view or anything.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.020
But just as law creates
property and ownership

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.920
and the market, it's perfectly
fine that law should be there

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.600
to enable and facilitate people

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.600
to enjoy the basic requirements of life

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.610
as in welfare legislation
to enjoy, for example,

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.860
assurance of legal representation

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.900
if they are brought before the courts

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.460
whether privately or by the
government in criminal charge,

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.130
to enjoy an assurance about their medical,

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:20.130
recourse to medical help in the
case of necessity and so on.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.990
All of these are essential infrastructure

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.700
if you're going to have freedom
as non-domination enjoyed

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.230
in the social sphere
within a given society.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:32.200
- You were part of an
extraordinary experiment,

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.760
shall we say, in which a
new Spanish Prime Minister

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.760
about a decade ago had read
your book, an earlier book,

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.950
on Civic Republicanism,

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.940
invited you to be part of a process

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.810
of the implementation of new policies

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.610
and if I can summarize briefly

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.160
because of the time you
address the Parliament

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.490
with laying out the
ideals of republicanism

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:04.100
and then after the government existed

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.050
and was implementing these policies,

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:10.310
you actually did a report
card for the government

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.480
on how the policies were being implemented

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.130
in the different provinces.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:21.240
I guess the tire really
hit the road, (laughing)

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.900
very interfaced with practice.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.100
What did you see in that whole process?

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.970
What did you learn that
informed your understanding

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:37.970
of Civic Republicanism at that time?

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.110
- Well the story, just
to fill in a little bit,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:44.200
was that Mr. Zapatero
when he became leader

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.200
of the Socialist Party
in Spain was looking

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.270
for a philosophy.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:52.603
He had this view that as a government,

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.730
as he hoped to become the
government, of course,

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:59.100
he would have a general
philosophy of government

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.099
what it was about, what law was about,

00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:02.830
what policy making was about.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.760
And he came upon my book.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.050
He read widely apparently

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.330
and he decided that this
was where he wanted to go.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.220
And I had known in the early 2000s,

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.060
I heard from friends in Spain
about my name being used

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.080
and the book being used and so on

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.730
and then in 2004 he was elected

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:23.740
and he at that stage invited
me to give a lecture in Madrid

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.880
in a very large forum actually
with a lot of politicians

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.420
and ministers and so on and government,

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.685
there by invitation,

00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:35.157
to talk about this Republican philosophy

00:54:35.157 --> 00:54:38.690
which he had espoused and
espoused the book so to speak.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.313
As he said as his vade mecum, you know,

00:54:40.313 --> 00:54:42.130
that he brought with him.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.130
And I gave that lecture
and he was to respond to it

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.300
but in the course of the
lecture I turned to him

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.170
in a slightly jokey way
and I said, well look,

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.990
he'd been just three months in power

00:54:55.990 --> 00:55:00.990
but one thing he had done which
I supported in the book was

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.520
to make the National Broadcaster
independent of government.

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.810
Up to that point the National Broadcaster,

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.710
apparently a minister who could say I want

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:12.480
to be on the six o'clock
news or I want to be there

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.280
when I'm opening the supermarket
you know I want a report

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.210
and the broadcaster did the favor.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:23.100
He made the broadcaster into like a BBC,

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.470
independent of government

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:26.080
and I thought this was a terrific idea.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.270
I think it's really important

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:29.320
that you have an independent broadcaster.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.950
Maybe not necessarily of that kind

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.650
but certainly like your
public broadcasting and so on.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.313
I turned him and I said
now you've done this

00:55:39.313 --> 00:55:40.780
and I think this is wonderful but I said,

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.710
it's very easy be a philosopher like me

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.210
but you're going to you lead
one of the largest economies

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.337
in the world, the ninth
largest economy in the world.

00:55:47.337 --> 00:55:50.180
And I said you're going
to find, for example,

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.920
the National Broadcaster is
going to be your worst critic

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.960
on some fronts and you're going
to find it really hard not

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.990
to pick up that phone and remind them

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.030
about how much they are in your debt

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.700
and try to sort of influence them

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.040
that will be a real temptation.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.790
I don't have that temptation
you're going to have that.

00:56:08.649 --> 00:56:09.482
And I explained that

00:56:09.482 --> 00:56:11.850
as I thought it would be
very, very hard to live up

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:14.570
to the principles of this way of thinking,

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:16.330
this narrow Republican way of thinking

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:18.430
and in his response to me,

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:22.840
he basically gave up the
comments he was going

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.840
to make I think and he
invited me publicly,

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.140
he insisted he was absolutely
committed to running

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.050
with this program in these
policies, these ideas

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:36.430
and he invited me to do a
report on his government

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:41.430
which I would publicize six
months before the next election

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.670
which is due four years later.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.803
And someone in the audience
immediately stood up

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:49.500
who was the head of a
foundation in Spain and said

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.330
that this foundation will
support Professor Pettit's work

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.730
and bring him back and
so on to give the report.

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.733
Actually it wasn't at all
the sort of thing I had

00:56:58.733 --> 00:57:03.050
as an ambition to do or even
an inclination really to do.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.100
I could see straightaway the hard work

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.920
that was going to be involved
in reading what was happening

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.590
and so on but I agreed to do it.

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.950
And sometimes people say that
I advised that government.

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:15.300
I didn't advise the government.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.750
They very nicely asked if I would give,

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:19.370
I said there's be a conflict of interest,

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:21.030
of course if I'm doing a report.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.950
But over that four years they
brought in various policies

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:27.860
and I talked on a number
of occasions with Zapatero.

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.890
I had one particularly
long interview with him

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:33.930
where he sought to persuade
me that these policies were

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:36.330
in fact motivated by the principles

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.880
of this near Republican way of thinking

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.520
and then I presented the report in,

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.960
about four months before
the election in 2007.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.190
- Well on that note,

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.340
there's a limit with our time constraints

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.173
that we can cover

00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:55.030
but let me recommend
your book to our audience

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:57.310
'cause it's beautifully written

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:02.310
and it's an opportunity to
explore this idea of freedom

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.820
that is kind of different
from what we normally hear

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.340
at least in the United States.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.030
Thank you very much Professor Pettit

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.157
for coming here today.
- Thank you.

00:58:11.157 --> 00:58:13.490
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.995
for this Conversation With History.

00:58:15.995 --> 00:58:18.662
(gentle music)
