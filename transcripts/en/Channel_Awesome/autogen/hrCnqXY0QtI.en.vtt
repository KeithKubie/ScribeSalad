00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
comparing it to Supergirl and I think I
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
comparing it to Supergirl and I think I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
think DC's legends of tomorrow is
 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
think DC's legends of tomorrow is
overall<00:02:50.740><c> a</c><00:02:50.770><c> little</c><00:02:51.250><c> bit</c><00:02:51.400><c> better</c><00:02:51.550><c> than</c><00:02:51.760><c> the</c>

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 align:start position:0%
overall a little bit better than the
 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
overall a little bit better than the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 align:start position:0%
first season of Supergirl but I think
 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.830 align:start position:0%
first season of Supergirl but I think
Supergirl<00:02:54.040><c> hit</c><00:02:54.280><c> higher</c><00:02:54.490><c> highs</c><00:02:54.790><c> and</c><00:02:54.820><c> sunk</c><00:02:55.720><c> to</c>

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
Supergirl hit higher highs and sunk to
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
Supergirl hit higher highs and sunk to
lower<00:02:55.990><c> lobes</c><00:02:56.320><c> so</c><00:02:57.660><c> you</c><00:02:58.660><c> know</c><00:02:58.780><c> take</c><00:02:58.960><c> that</c><00:02:58.990><c> how</c>

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 align:start position:0%
lower lobes so you know take that how
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
lower lobes so you know take that how
you<00:02:59.290><c> will</c><00:02:59.500><c> but</c><00:02:59.740><c> I</c><00:02:59.770><c> still</c><00:03:00.100><c> I'd</c><00:03:01.000><c> still</c><00:03:01.360><c> enticed</c>

along I thought they would adjust and
they<00:03:10.990><c> didn't</c><00:03:11.290><c> but</c><00:03:11.830><c> season</c><00:03:12.670><c> two</c><00:03:12.850><c> looks</c>

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 align:start position:0%
they didn't but season two looks

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
problem I have it with it though is like
the<00:10:39.890><c> time-travel</c><00:10:40.490><c> stuff</c><00:10:40.700><c> is</c><00:10:41.000><c> very</c><00:10:42.010><c> nuanced</c>

and rare and stuff in the flash series I
 

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.190 align:start position:0%
and rare and stuff in the flash series I

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of a big deal when
 

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.780 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of a big deal when
somebody<00:10:48.500><c> time</c><00:10:48.710><c> travels</c><00:10:49.100><c> in</c><00:10:49.190><c> the</c><00:10:49.250><c> flash</c><00:10:49.460><c> and</c>

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790 align:start position:0%
somebody time travels in the flash and
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
somebody time travels in the flash and
they<00:10:50.360><c> made</c><00:10:50.600><c> kind</c><00:10:51.440><c> of</c><00:10:51.560><c> just</c><00:10:51.740><c> undercut</c><00:10:52.130><c> that</c><00:10:52.340><c> a</c>

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.370 align:start position:0%
they made kind of just undercut that a
 

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
they made kind of just undercut that a
little<00:10:52.640><c> bit</c><00:10:52.760><c> I</c><00:10:52.790><c> think</c><00:10:52.910><c> with</c><00:10:53.270><c> the</c><00:10:53.360><c> show</c><00:10:53.510><c> because</c>

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:53.810 align:start position:0%
little bit I think with the show because
 

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.420 align:start position:0%
little bit I think with the show because
now<00:10:53.840><c> you</c><00:10:53.990><c> make</c><00:10:54.170><c> an</c><00:10:54.260><c> entire</c><00:10:54.590><c> show</c><00:10:54.920><c> just</c><00:10:55.250><c> about</c>

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
now you make an entire show just about
 

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.260 align:start position:0%
now you make an entire show just about
time<00:10:55.700><c> travel</c>

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.270 align:start position:0%

00:10:59.800 --> 00:10:59.810 align:start position:0%
storytelling device it like you know
 

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.980 align:start position:0%
