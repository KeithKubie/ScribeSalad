00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:03.245
- [Voiceover] Today we
are going to be talking

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:05.001
about the Reaction Quotient, Q.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.897
In this video, I'm going to go over,

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.147
how you calculate Q and how you use it.

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:12.912
We're gonna start with
and example reaction

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.300
between sulfur dioxide,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.133
S02 gas,

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:21.244
which will react with oxygen gas,

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.198
and this is a reversible reaction

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:25.031
that makes

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.426
sulfur trioxide

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.259
or SO3.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.303
We should make sure this
is a balanced reaction.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:36.268
We have two sulfur dioxdes
reacting with one O2

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.209
to give

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:38.042
2S03.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.990
At equilibrium we can calculate

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.407
the equilibrium constant, Kc.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:47.695
So, at equilibrium

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.908
we know the concentrations

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.193
should be constant because the rate of the

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:56.720
forward and backward
reactions are the same.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.167
And if we plug those concentrations in

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.461
to this expression, we will get Kc.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.402
So,

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:04.235
Kc is

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.508
the product concentration raised

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:11.733
to the second power so that's from

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.017
this stoichiometric coefficient.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:17.092
And then our reactant concentrations,

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:18.519
so S02

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:19.352
squared

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:23.290
and the concentration of O2.

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.010
So we know at some temperature,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.731
if you plug in the
equilibrium concentrations,

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.314
Kc is equal to 4.3.

00:01:32.513 --> 00:01:34.597
But what if we're interested in looking

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:36.082
at the reaction and it's not

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:38.607
at equilibrium yet or
maybe we just don't know

00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:39.954
if it's at equilibrium.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:41.037
In that case,

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:43.472
when you're not sure it's

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:46.207
at equilibrium or really at any point

00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:48.732
in your reaction or any time,

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:51.716
we can calculate the Reaction Quotient, Q.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:52.549
So Qc

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:54.305
is equal to

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.213
the concentration of our product

00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.521
squared,

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.469
so the concentration of the product

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.685
raised to

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.745
the stoichiometric coefficient

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:08.224
times the reactant concentrations,

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:11.431
also raised to their
stoichiometric coefficients.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.803
So S02 squared

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:13.636
and O2.

00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:17.303
So you may be wondering at this point,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.596
what's the difference?

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.434
The equation for Qc and Kc will

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.466
always look exactly the same

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.723
and the main difference
is when you use them.

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:28.607
The equilibrium constant K you calculate

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:32.024
only with the equilibrium concentrations.

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:35.091
So the c means everything

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.341
is in terms of the molar concentration.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:41.196
And for the reaction quotient, Q,

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:43.197
again everything is in terms of molar

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:45.235
concentration but we can calculate it

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:47.319
with any concentrations and we don't

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.486
have to be at equilibrium.

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:54.235
Molar concentration...

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:55.482
So let's calculate this

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:58.479
for a set of example concentrations.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.722
At some point in our reaction we have

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.418
the following concentrations.

00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:04.256
We have 0.10

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:05.245
molar

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:06.488
S02,

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:07.321
0.30

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.069
molar

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:10.968
O2,

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:11.801
and 3.5

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.731
molar of our product.

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:16.717
So if we plug these numbers into

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:18.681
our expression for Qc,

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.811
we get

00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.644
3.5 molar

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.264
squared

00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:24.712
in the numerator

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:26.045
and 0.10 squared

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:28.507
times 0.3

00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:33.030
in the denominator.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.730
So if I plug this into my calculator,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.251
I get that Qc

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.242
with this set of concentrations

00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:40.075
is 4,083.

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.159
So now we know how to calculate Qc.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.073
So next we're going to talk about

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:49.742
what it tells you.

00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:52.909
So there are three possible scenarios.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.036
So when Q

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.203
is equal to K,

00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:02.175
that tells us we're at equilibrium.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.812
So, if at any point you're not sure

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.140
if your concentrations are the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.759
equilibrium concentrations,

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.927
you can calculate Q

00:04:10.927 --> 00:04:12.697
and check if it's equal to K.

00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:14.686
And in this case, it's not.

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:16.548
So the other two possibilities are

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.228
that Q is greater than K,

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:20.744
which is the case here.

00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:22.744
Or Q can be less than K.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.557
So let's go through both
of those possibilities.

00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:32.605
We can draw all of the
possible values of Q

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.146
on a number line

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:35.146
or a Q line.

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.305
So Q can have values anywhere

00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:39.745
from zero

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:40.967
to infinity.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.234
When you have no product

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.236
your numerator is zero

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:46.713
and Q is equal to zero.

00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:47.736
So that tells us

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:48.764
Q equals zero

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:50.874
when you have all reactants

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.207
and no products.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.730
And then if you have no reactants left

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.710
and all products,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.298
we have zero in the denominator

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:05.034
and that gives us a Q value of infinity.

00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:07.213
So that means at Q equals infinity,

00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:08.963
we have all products.

00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:14.764
Then we have a bunch of values in between.

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:17.479
And I'm gonna just write
some intermediate values

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.312
in here

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.305
but the actual intermediate values here

00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:22.742
aren't super important.

00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:25.340
We're mostly gonna wanna
compare the relative

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.235
values of our Q and K.

00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:29.568
So Q here is equal to 4,083,

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.882
which I will place

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:35.195
right around here.

00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:36.962
So that's Qc

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.093
and our K

00:05:38.093 --> 00:05:39.232
in yellow

00:05:39.232 --> 00:05:40.725
is 4.3.

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:44.509
So we'll place that right around here.

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.041
So we can see that

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:47.874
our Q is larger than K

00:05:48.972 --> 00:05:52.254
and it's closer to having all products.

00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:55.464
At the concentrations we have up here,

00:05:55.464 --> 00:05:57.874
we have way more products than we should

00:05:57.874 --> 00:05:59.471
at equilibrium.

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:01.451
So our reaction is gonna try to adjust

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:03.736
the concentrations to get to equilibrium.

00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:06.370
And what that means in
terms of our number line

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.501
is that our concentrations are gonna shift

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.001
so that Q can get closer to K.

00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:16.024
Since our shift is to the right,

00:06:16.024 --> 00:06:18.971
and it's moving towards all reactants,

00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:21.113
our reaction is going to favor reactants

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.235
to get to equilibrium.

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:25.780
So when Q is greater than K, like here,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.447
we're going to favor

00:06:28.682 --> 00:06:29.682
reactants...

00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:35.208
reactants.

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:38.518
And then the last scenario
when Q is less than K

00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:40.596
our reaction will

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:41.846
favor products.

00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:47.707
And we can show that
also on our number line.

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:52.251
If we had a different
set of concentrations,

00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.251
where Q was less than K,

00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:57.014
which I will show

00:06:57.014 --> 00:06:58.847
using this color here.

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:03.539
If we had, say, a Q value around here

00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:07.921
then our shift would be

00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:09.720
to the right

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.484
towards making more products

00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:16.400
and therefore that would mean our reaction

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.012
is gonna try to reach equilibrium

00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:21.261
by favoring the forward reaction.

00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.905
So that's how you calculate
Q and how you use it

00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:26.050
to see how the reaction concentrations

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.737
will shift to get to equilibrium.

00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:29.476
In our next video, we'll go over

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.617
an example problem using Q and trying

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.073
to figure out how the
reactant concentrations

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:35.873
will shift for another reaction.
