please and in my original review I
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.049
please and in my original review I
mentioned there's an emotional thing

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
mentioned there's an emotional thing
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.109
mentioned there's an emotional thing
that kind of happens near the beginning

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119
that kind of happens near the beginning
 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.210
that kind of happens near the beginning
that I thought detracted from the depth

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
that I thought detracted from the depth
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310
that I thought detracted from the depth
of the film dramatically and what that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
of the film dramatically and what that
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990
of the film dramatically and what that
was I couldn't say it in my review as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
was I couldn't say it in my review as
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670
was I couldn't say it in my review as
Bryan Cranston dies because I thought

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
Bryan Cranston dies because I thought
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.740
Bryan Cranston dies because I thought
that he added so much to that first act

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
that he added so much to that first act
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140
that he added so much to that first act
and he was such a cool character much

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
and he was such a cool character much
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.580
and he was such a cool character much
more of an interesting character that I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
more of an interesting character that I
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.690
more of an interesting character that I
thought than Aaron taylor-johnson

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
thought than Aaron taylor-johnson
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969
thought than Aaron taylor-johnson
character and so I kind of wanted him to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
character and so I kind of wanted him to
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550
character and so I kind of wanted him to
stay alive and actually maybe have the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
stay alive and actually maybe have the
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740
stay alive and actually maybe have the
movie be a father-son bonding experience

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
movie be a father-son bonding experience
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300
movie be a father-son bonding experience
I think that might actually have made

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
I think that might actually have made
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.590
I think that might actually have made
for a better movie I think if they would

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
for a better movie I think if they would
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330
for a better movie I think if they would
have just done that with Bryan Cranston

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
have just done that with Bryan Cranston
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859
have just done that with Bryan Cranston
had that be the story of the film a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
had that be the story of the film a
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.960
had that be the story of the film a
father-son bonding experience and then

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
father-son bonding experience and then
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550
father-son bonding experience and then
shown a little more of the Hawaii

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
shown a little more of the Hawaii
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859
shown a little more of the Hawaii
Honolulu fight that we don't get to see

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
Honolulu fight that we don't get to see
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780
Honolulu fight that we don't get to see
then I would have given this film an A+

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
then I would have given this film an A+
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850
then I would have given this film an A+
I stand by my a minus grade though and I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
I stand by my a minus grade though and I
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530
I stand by my a minus grade though and I
saw this film a second time I actually

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
saw this film a second time I actually
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389
saw this film a second time I actually
enjoyed it a little bit more the second

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
enjoyed it a little bit more the second
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.830
enjoyed it a little bit more the second
time which is very rare for me I think

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
time which is very rare for me I think
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.179

the reason I did enjoy it a little bit
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469
the reason I did enjoy it a little bit
more because I went into it knowing
