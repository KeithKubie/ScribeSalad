00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's see. How do we solve this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, I know that the potential energy over here is going to be equal to the kinetic energy

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it has when it passes through the equilibrium.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember at the the equilibrium point, there's no potential energy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All of that energy must have been converted into kinetic energy.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay, so let's do the math. Potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Use the appropriate equations and when I solve for V--that should be a max

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I'm solving for the Vmax as well.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I get this for an answer and plugging in the appropriate values--I get an answer of 4.5 m/s.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now something that's interesting here is that this could've been positive number

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or a negative number--a positive number would have corresponded to when the mass

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is moving this way and negative would have corresponded to when the mass is moving that way.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In fact, there's a lot we can learn about simple harmonic motion by just calculating velocity,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
keeping track of sign and plotting it on a diagram versus position.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What do I mean by that? Well, I'll show you.
