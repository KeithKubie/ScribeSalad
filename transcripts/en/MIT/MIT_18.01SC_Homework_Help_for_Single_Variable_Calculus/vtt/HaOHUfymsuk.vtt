PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.300
In this video what
we'd like to do

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.500
is to solve a certain
differential equation.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.660
And I'm not even giving
you initial condition.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.840
So we just want to find a
y, such that x times dy/dx

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.969
is equal to x squared plus
x times y squared plus 1.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.760
So I'll give you a
minute to think about it

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.676
and then I'll be back.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.450
Welcome back.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm going to use the technique
of separation of variables

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.512
to solve this differential
equation problem.

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:42.470
Hopefully you thought
about doing that as well.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.090
Because it's really
set up nicely

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.930
for separation of variables.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.622
So let me let me first
get all of the values,

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:53.450
or terms that involve y
on the left-hand side.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.420
And then I'm going to move
the dx to the right-hand side

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.730
and get all the
terms that involve

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.390
x to the right-hand side.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.130
So I'm going to
write dy divided by y

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.920
squared plus 1 is equal to-- so
I'm going to multiply through

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.800
by dx divided by x.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.200
So I'm going to get x
squared plus x over x dx.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.624
Now if x is 0, I
have a little problem

00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:20.540
but we're going to ignore
that for the moment.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.420
So I can rewrite
this as x plus 1 dx.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.040
And now I'm totally set
up with my next step

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
in separation of variables and
so I can integrate both sides.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.710
So let's see what happens when
I integrate the left-hand side.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370
OK?

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.020
What is an antiderivative
to 1 over y squared plus 1?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.580
Well that's arctangent,
that's arctangent of y.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.510
So the derivative
of arctangent of y

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.640
is 1 over y squared plus 1.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.110
And so on the left-hand
side I get arctan y.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.680
If you wrote tangent
to the minus 1 y,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.820
that's the same thing,
the inverse tangent of y,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.570
that's the same thing.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.570
And on the right-hand
side what do I get?

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.360
Well this is a nice
easy thing to integrate.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960
When I integrate x, I
get x squared over 2.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.320
And here I just get an x.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.610
And then I should
add in my constants.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.780
So x squared over 2
plus x plus a constant.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.390
So this is, so far I'm
doing everything OK.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.600
Now I need to figure out
how to isolate the y.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.870
Well arctan y is the inverse
of the tangent function.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.390
So if I want to isolate
y I have to take

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.950
the tangent of both sides.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.200
So when I take tangent of
arctangent of y I just get y.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.056
Then over here, I get tangent of
x squared over 2 plus x plus C.

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.430
And now because I didn't give
you any initial conditions,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.160
we can't say anything
about C. But if I gave you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.510
some initial conditions then we
could evaluate and solve for C.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.030
Now how do I go about checking
to make sure that this works?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.330
Well, what I do is actually
take the derivative.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.020
So you may want to
take the derivative

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.410
of the right-hand
side, take dy/dx.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.630
Evaluate what that
is when you have y

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.300
equals tangent of x squared
over 2 plus x plus C

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.900
and see if you in fact get
the relationship you're

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.220
supposed to get.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.437
But I'll stop there.
