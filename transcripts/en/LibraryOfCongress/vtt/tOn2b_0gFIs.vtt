00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.840
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.740
I'm Grant Harris, I'm head
of the European Reading Room

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.780
in this European division.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.640
And we're very pleased to have
today Igor Fedyukin speaking to us

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.470
about the Schools that Peter
the Great Built, Projectors

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.080
and the State in Early
Modern Russia.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:51.480
And Professor Fedyukin works at
the National Research University,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.260
the Higher School of
Economics in Moscow.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.030
He's an associate professor
of history there.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.710
But he's been here since
September in Washington,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.410
DC as a Woodrow Wilson
scholar and he only has

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.900
about two more weeks left and
then he goes back to Moscow.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.000
So this is for us kind
of a high point.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.080
We get to hear from him some

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.060
of what he's been researching
while he's been here.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.270
And part of that topic is the
Schools that Peter the Great Built,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.300
that's just part of a larger
book that he's working on.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.670
There is this conception that
Peter the Great pretty much he was

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.620
so great he did everything.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.660
He created schools, he
created all these institutions.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.930
But in fact, he did not
do this single-handedly

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.030
and what Professor
Fedyukin will be talking

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.270
about today is the
greater role played

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.000
by the administrative entrepreneurs

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.160
or they use this word
projecteur [phonetic] also.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.360
So I assume they take
that from the French.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.960
&gt;&gt; Very much.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.410
And it was they who pursued their
own career goals and pet ideas

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.240
and competed for status
and resources

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.060
that when they were heading

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.980
or administrating these
various institutions.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.240 position:56%
So Professor Fedyukin, thank you for
being here today and I'll turn it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.480 position:56%
over to you and please help me
welcome Mr. Fedyukin for being here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Thank you so much.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.360
It's great to be here and
it is certainly a high point

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.850
of my stay here in order
to be able to talk here.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.790
I'm really grateful to a number
of wonderful institutions

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.410
which made this talk possible.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.790
First and foremost of course,
the Library of Congress

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.620
and the European Division
that was [inaudible].

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.680
I'm very, I mean it's a huge honor.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.810
Also of course, the Woodward
Wilson Center for Scholars,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.250
which enabled me to spend a
wonderful year here working

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.550
at the library.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.400
As you might know or might not the
Woodward Wilson Center actually has

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.120
a program where they let you
do sort of inter library loan,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.330
actually sort of requesting
books from the library

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.010
to be brought to your office.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.450
And I just sort of didn't do that
preferring instead to come here.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.620
Well because I'm very sort
of conscientious whatever.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.920
&gt;&gt; Conscientious.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.570
&gt;&gt; Conscientious yeah and care
about the books a lot and just kind

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.030
of really bothered me a lot to
make book trail kind of all the way

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.410
from here or like over
here, you know,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.170
like to the Wilson Center and back.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.680
But also because it's
just nice to be here,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.440
it's such a wonderful library,
it's such a wonderful reading room

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.360
and just great to be here.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.650
And it's my particular pleasure
to present here my book project,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.360
which is finished by now.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.170
It's under review at one
of the major publishers,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.580
hopefully it will be showing

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.760
up in your catalogue,
you know, at some point.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.620
Maybe next year or year after.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.450
And indeed it's about schools.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.460
Now when we talk about schools
in Russia, education in Russia --

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.790
modern education in Russia
of course we think that,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.320
I mean the first thing
that comes to our mind is

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.720
that well it's the
state run schools right.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.010
It's a state whatever it means
that administers them, creates the,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.180
staffs them, funds them,
determines, you know,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.710
the direction of their development.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.620
But what does the state mean?

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.430
I mean today it's easy right,
I mean there's the Ministry

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.870
of Education signs
for bad to worse right

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.710
which that's what it does right.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.580
Appoints directors, creates
institutions, merges them,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.480
closes them down, funds them.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.050
Well in the 18th century
[inaudible] 18th century in Russia

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.540
and elsewhere those normally there
was no Ministry of Education signs.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:28.730
So how did it work and indeed
it's very easy because of course,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.140
we have Peter the Great who single
handedly was creating everything,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.410
you know, designing
all the institutions,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.420
all the wonderful new ideas,
projects, innovations.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.050
All of them are traceable
to his insights,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.220
his energy, and his just vision.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.670
And of course, he did all of that

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.920
because he was creating a new
regular army and so it was natural

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.320
in the Navy, in engineering
and fortresses whatever right.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.880
So it was natural for
him to establish schools.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.890
Modern secular technical schools.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:15.730
Now Peter the Great was a great
ruler no question about that.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.150
So my purpose today is not
to undermine, you know,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.280
his claims for greatness
and, you know, for vision.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.110
And he certainly was a very active
ruler no question about that.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:33.430
I mean if we go into archives we'll
find piles upon piles of documents

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.640
which he personally edited.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.960
You know, he would really spend
like days or weeks personally

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.180
in his own hand, kind of
edit and successive drafts

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.410 position:56%
of whatever regulations or documents
or for, you know, his navy.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.100
I mean whatever documents
he considered important.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.430
Can write entire sections sort
of from scratch in his own hand.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.750
So no question about that.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:12.480 position:56%
The problem is that the schools
were not one of those sort of topics

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.840
that he really wrote much about.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.920
I mean we know Peter as this great
sort of educator of Russia right

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.440
of course and create new
schools, teaching his subjects,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.710
instructing them in the new
secular or technical sciences.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.170
It's one of the trademarks
of his reign right.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:43.720
Well the problem is there's
not much of a paper trail.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.600
What we really have from
human schools are, you know,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.160
just sort of like one-liners,
teach young guys arithmetic.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.180
Well that's very important

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.680
that he sends this message
right and we appreciate that.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.300
But any of us who have
ever had anything to do

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.910
with administering things, you
know, we realize that, you know,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.210
there is a huge gap between
this sort of, you know,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.530
let it be kind of you know thing.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:25.730 position:56%
And actual institutions somebody has
to actually determine teach where,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.900
teach whom, teach how, who
should be doing the teaching,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.890
how those people should be funded.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.530
And I mean I don't want
to sound as if, you know,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:44.490
I'm trying to retroactively impose
our modern kind of standards

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.150
of administrative kind
of deficiency,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.350
administrative clarity upon, you
know, like 18th century people.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.040
No, I mean if we look
at his contemporaries,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.370
his officials they do firmly I mean
this is problem that, you know,

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.180
it's just kind of too vague.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.610
I mean one of his most
famous decrees on education

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:11.620
and school his 1714 decree
on so-called cipher schools.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:19.150
A decree which set up a network of
cipher schools all over the empire.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.030
Like two teachers was supposed to
be dispatched to every province

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.200
to teach young guys arithmetic.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:36.620 position:56%
And that's what -- here's what one
Andre Belikov [assumed spelling] has

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.910
to say about that and Mr. Belikov
he was an experienced official,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:47.760 position:56%
I mean he spent his entire career in
the sort of administrative agencies.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.720
And he was also like reactionary
or conservative, you know,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.020
who is like a [inaudible].

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.990
I mean he was actually
a close associate

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.160
of this one person who's
name is Leonty Magnitsky

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.070
who was most prominent
teacher of mathematics

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.160
at the time, he was his patron.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.990
He was very closely involved

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:12.150
with managing so-called
navigation school sort

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.440
of a very important school period.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.690 position:56%
So he was empathetic towards
schooling and learning and studying.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.110
But here's what he has to
say, I mean and he writes

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.170
to his immediate superior
at [inaudible] referring

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:32.540
to this February 1714
decree on cipher schools.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.260
This decree is obscure
[inaudible] and without many

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.110
of the conditions which
should be there.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.820 position:56%
If you order us to implement it more
specific chapters ought to be sent

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.690 position:56%
to us and without them this business

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.720
of cipher schools can be neither
extend nor even established.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.260
And so he lists, you know,
specific questions which has

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.630
to be answered before he
could actually proceed

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.250 position:56%
with implementing decrees like, you
know, who should be his counterparts

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.630
in the provinces, how many
teachers should be sent like,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.110
you know, and so on and so forth.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:15.650
In 1720, Peter orders that 100
apprentice pilots be thought

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:21.110
and again, among the [inaudible]
malpractice papers there is a copy

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:27.080
of this decree and the anonymous
official [inaudible] margins.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.970
And what they have to be taught
and how they have to be maintained

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.150
in said teaching there is
no exact resolution on that.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.230
So there is this gap.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:47.760
Now I don't want to be too
harsh on Peter in a sense that,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.710
I mean how exactly should he kind
of modern secular technical school

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.330
for officers, for sailors,
for [inaudible].

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.220
How exactly should [inaudible]
period was not immediately clear.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.320
In a sense I mean that
if we go into sort

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.610
of western Europe [inaudible]
century those kind

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.560
of schools are only beginning
to emerge there as well.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.280
I mean the British Navy, the
Royal Navy didn't have any school

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.450
for training, you know,
naval officers until well

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.130
into pretty much the
end of the 19th century.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.280
I mean they were training aboard
ships and [inaudible] would,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.710
I mean would get some
basic education, you know,

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.540
like whatever schools
were there on land.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.840
But then, you know, as for

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.210
like actual navigation they would
actually would go on board ships

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.380
and like learn as apprentices,
learn kind of by doing.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.200
You know, they would be
involved in practical tasks.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.680
And, you know, perhaps the
captain will spend, you know,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.600
a few hours a day or a week, you
know, kind of instructing them

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.350
and do mathematics, but that's all.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.510
And actually when Peter himself,
well I mean of course, you know,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.920
all the education here
he got himself was kind

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.540
of personal tutorship
right as all other kings,

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.380
you know, of that age would right.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.760
But I mean when he famously
went to Western Europe

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.090
to learn ship building,
you know, the Dutch

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.700
or the English what could they
could offer him, you know.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:26.000
I mean he had to learn by doing it
again, you know, the work you know

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.630
through this apprentice
sort of non-formalized,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.340
non-institutionalized
kind of apprenticeship.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.560
So those things were
only being invented.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.090
And my question is how
exactly they were invented.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:44.220
And here I want to talk about the
specific school it's called the

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.590
Naval Academy.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:51.070
It was establish in 1715 in Saint
Petersburg, an important school,

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.570
sort of one of the first schools
of the kind in Europe actually.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.570 position:56%
Trained scores of admirals and naval
officers and of course, you know,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.150
lots of graduates, you know,
went elsewhere, you know,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.130
sort of pursued careers
in government

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.330
or other technical branches.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.540
Now how exactly it was created.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.610
How exactly it was created, I
mean we know that Peter created it

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:28.470
in 1715 and we know that its
founder was this guy called baron

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.490
de Saint-Hilaire.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.650
A Frenchman not much
is known about him

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.430
until of course yours
truly came along.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.970
But it was generally assumed that
he was probably a French, you know,

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.110
admiral, a naval expert
who was, you know,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.140 position:56%
hired by Peter to set up the school.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.730 position:56%
I mean it was also known that he
was fired pretty soon after a couple

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.320
of years and it was known that
he had like all sorts of tensions

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.940
with his Russian colleagues.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.060
So it was assumed that
he has this sort

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.350
of very troublesome
kind of personality.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:15.400
And now what -- how
did it actually work?

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.490
I mean this baron de Saint-Hilaire
he was born in Southern France

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:29.720
in Bordeaux I think in the merchant
family, in the [inaudible] family

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.420
and his name was Hilaire
[inaudible].

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:42.860
He was involved in trade
for a while, got imprisoned

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:49.780
for insurance fraud, sentenced
for galleys and escaped.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:55.710
Escaped across the border to
Spain where the war was going on,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:02.030
the war of Spain succession
between the Franco Spanish army

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:07.360
on the one hand and the Anglo
Portuguese army on the other hand.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.020
So he somehow gets in touch
with this French commander

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:18.160
and he's employed for a while as a
messenger between the French camp

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.570
and Lisbon trying to arrange

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.580
for separate peace
negotiations with the Portuguese.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.390
After a few months
of doing that he goes

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.060 position:56%
over to the English with the papers.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.110
Thereby sabotaging, you know,
the separate peace negotiations.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:44.200
He's taken over to
London, he gets 500 pounds.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:51.440
The English at that point know
him as Joseph Haller, a merchant.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.370
So he gets 500 pounds, he wants
more, begins kind of scheming

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.500
and intriguing and
gets into English jail.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:15.470
In May 1712, he is extradited,
they dump him on the Dutch coast.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:23.510
In September 1712, the same
year in Vienna there is a decree

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:30.630
which is signed by the emperor
which appoints a Flemish nobleman,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.490
baron de Saint-Hilaire or
[inaudible] de Saint-Hilaire

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.420
as the Capitan del mar e Guerra.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.910
Sorry my Spanish pronunciation.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.890
Captain of war and
then sea in Naples.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.960
It's the same person.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.600
He claimed later on that when he
got to the Hague he got in touch

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.900
with Duke of Marlborough
who was kind of appalled

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.310
by the shabby treatment of
the distinguished, you know,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.080
kind of agent that, you know, that
he got so little for his services

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.150
to the English crown and Spain.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.800
So he introduces him
to Prince Eugene,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:20.980
but of course in fact Duke
Marlborough he arrived to Hague

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.370
that year only in December so they
couldn't have met in Netherlands.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:32.220
Anyhow, he starts new career
as baron de Saint-Hilaire

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.520
in the service of the [inaudible].

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.370
There are like also conspiracies,

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:43.850
he attempts to burn the
French navy in [inaudible].

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.230
He is imprisoned in Genoa, no
in Milan I think for an affair

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.080
with the general's lady, released.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:02.690
Then the Imperials imprison him
again in Naples, he escapes again.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:13.730
So one way or another by January
1715 he's in Saint Petersburg.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.380
Allegedly, he has been
invited to join us in service.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.700
[Inaudible] story not clear,
it's neither confirmed nor denied

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.110
by the Russians who
allegedly invited him.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.400
Anyhow, when he gets to Saint
Petersburg he does two things.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.690
First, he gets introduced to
the court of Princess Charlotte

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.410
who is the wife of
[inaudible], the son

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:43.110 position:56%
and the heir to throne, Peter's son.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.340
And a month later he's engaged to
her favorite lady in the waiting

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.270
who by the time was 38 years old.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.220
So for the period of
course, that was you know.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.520
&gt;&gt; Old.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.820
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Quite yeah.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.380
So I mean that might be the
explanation why she kind of jumped

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:07.370
from the start, you know,
he was dashing or whatever.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.920
He should have been
dashing, you know, Frenchman.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.850
But suddenly she provides him with
a channel for access to the court,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.610
to the princess, you know, he
gets like all sorts of letters

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.440
of introduction from her
to Russian officials.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.520 position:56%
Actually to the English court again.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.260
But he also gets to meet Peter
and a few weeks later he produces,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.320
you know, this number of
projects and we're going to talk

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.100
about projectors or projecteurs.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:45.050
A number of projects
of very different kind.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.990
There is a project established
in the commission for producing,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.510
you know, naval regulations.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.890
There's a project for
building little [inaudible].

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:03.960
So he promised to go there
because there's the cheap lumber

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.810
and cheap sort of artisans
and sailors there.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.770
So all he need is a
letter of credit.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:21.050
And he also writes the proposal
for setting up a naval academy

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.010
in Russia and that Peter approves.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:36.660 position:56%
Now what does it mean, what exactly
does it mean that Peter approves it?

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.530
How exactly does it work and
what kind of project tis that?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.980
I mean first of all, the very
project is a verbatim translation

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:56.200
of a French 1689 I think regulation
sort of took verbatim two sections

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.650
from the French regulation and
just kind of translated them.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:07.440
Now Peter certainly was
interested in training his subjects

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.210
in things naval right,
I mean even before that.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:18.290
No question about that, I
mean he was very much involved

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.880
in sending the young Russian nobles
to train with the European navies.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.450
He was very much interested
in just sort

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:30.120
of overall pushing the Russian
nobles to study, you know,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.940
in couple of years before
that he kind of begins to sort

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.440
of [inaudible] systematically kind
of force like young nobles to kind

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.280
of to come to Saint
Petersburg to sort

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.500
of where he views them
personally, assigns some of them

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:53.240
into the service and
some of them to study.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.130
So this overall framework,
this overall interest right

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.840
on Peter's part is sort of there.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.860
What's not there is the specific
idea to have a naval academy right,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.360
to have a sort of an
institutionalized school.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.170
And also certainly Peter was
familiar with this regulation,

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.790
with the French regulation
which Saint-Hilaire used.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.650
Actually and before meeting
Saint-Hilaire Peter orders a

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.010
translation of this
regulation right.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.970
But Saint-Hilaire actually
didn't use it

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.390
and he did his own translation.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.520
So it's like certainly Peter was
predisposed towards like, you know,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.060
teaching his nobles, instructing
them in naval regulations.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.360
But the specific idea, the specific
institutional form was produced

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.550
by this guy.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:50.680
Peter approved it in a sense that
we, I mean we have no evidence

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.920
of Peter actually specifically
reacting to this document right.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.960
No corrections, no changes, no
paper trail of him like giving sort

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.380
of like any -- providing any input.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.070
So was it like, you know, okay
[inaudible] here's the project.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.060
Yeah fine okay great,
you know, like do it.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.450
I mean how did it work, I
mean did Peter actually buy --

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.960
how much Peter actually bought into
this idea, how much he actually,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.240
you know, was involved in talking

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:30.490
about specific details,
I mean we don't know.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.070
There is no, I mean we don't --

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.650
at least we neither me nor my
predecessors were actually able

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.400
to find a copy of the project
actually signed by Peter.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.730
But we do know that so this
guy comes to Saint Petersburg

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.640
in January, in February
he submits the proposal.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:56.350
In the spring he marries this girl
in the presence of [inaudible],

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.490 position:56%
in the presence of the court so
it's kind of she's the favorite late

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.590
in waiting to the crown princes,
so it's a kind of court event.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.780
Peter is present, his wife,
his you know like his family.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:18.440
And as a part of the
celebration, as a part of the --

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.130
well as when gift almost like, you
know, it's announced publicly that,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.830
you know, the thing that the
school is going to be created,

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.870
this guy is going to be
appointed director with a title

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.990
of general and admiral both.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:37.280
You know, he will get a good salary
and the school will get a building

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.990
where of course, the
newlyweds would also reside.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:52.790
So in summer of the same year the
thing is sort of set in motion.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:26:03.070
Students come, you know, the
school is actually being set up.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.940
Now how much is Peter
involved with it later on?

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.920
I mean there is one episode

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.070
when he actually does write
things regarding school.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:19.060
In October 1715 he approves
instruction to this naval academy.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.460
This instruction is
actually again written

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.850
by this guy Saint-Hilaire himself.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:34.020
It does have sort of sections added
on by Peter with his own hand.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.440
But they added again
[inaudible] from this guy.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.760
So what he does, you know, he
writes like rules for the school

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.000
and he actually explicitly refers
people to assign, you know,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.490
to establish some punishments
for violating those rules right.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.120
So that's what Peter does
he scribbles in, you know,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.260
like for this for violating
this rule, you know,

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.480
they should be beaten
or whatever right.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.500
So that's his contribution.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.740
He does visit the school
twice in the fall

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.900
of that year, in the fall of 1715.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.640
Then he departs to Europe
again for a year and a half.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:20.140 position:56%
And the next recorded instance of
him visiting the school is 1724 kind

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.440
of right before his dead.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.740 position:56%
And that's also interesting because,
you know, there's wonderful source

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.120
of so-called campaign journals,
basically journals which Peter

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.130
or his staff kept where
they recorded, you know,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.450
like what he had been doing.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.790
I mean those journals of
course are not complete right,

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.180
but they are pretty detailed.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.050
I mean so for many weeks or days
we know okay, where he went to eat,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:50.510
where he let's say [inaudible]
like he went to church, you know,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.940
he stayed overnight there,
he planted apple trees,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:01.170
he went to the hospital to inspect,
you know, sick soldiers whatever.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.810
Not a single mention of him
ever visiting this old modern

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.350
secular school.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.410
At the same time there
are like numerous records

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:17.450
of him being personally involved

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:23.480
with training what he called
Gaza [phonetic] marine, you know,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.680 position:56%
so naval guards, sort of midget men.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.390
Basically a sort of scheme to
train naval offices as apprentices.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:42.390
So many graduates of this naval
academy they will join this company

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.290
of Gaza marine.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:54.500
And with that Peter was very much
like hands-on kind of involved,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:02.870
you know, he would actually make
sure they will get their salaries,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.720
their stipends are paid, you know,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.870
they will be like transferred
assign.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.640
He would like oh, you know, like
you know those guys are assigned

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.970
for raining in Venice, you
know, but now Venice is at peace

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.870
with the [inaudible] so there
is not much stuff going on.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:21.730
So like transfer them to
Spain instead, you know, like.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.460
So that's his project right, that's
his understanding of training.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.430
That's what he is kind of very
much personally involved with.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.610
As for the school, this
formal institution,

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:38.550
it's just not his kind of thing.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:46.620
So to the extent Peter
created the school right?

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:51.070
To the extent I could say
that he defined this sort

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.630
of institutional outlook.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:03.130
I would argue that in this case
as in many, many other cases yes,

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.040
he set the -- or other rulers.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.810
He set the overall framework
right, he set this sort of --

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.020
he indicated the overall
direction kind of.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.330
He indicated what sorts of
projects would be supported

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.060
or would be more likely
to be supported.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.620
Sort of set the boundaries of
what's possible what's not.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.870
But otherwise, you know, sort
of the specific trajectories,

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:37.320
the specific institutional
shapes that was very much defined

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.810
in [inaudible] by yes,
administrative entrepreneurs.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:47.560
By people who are hoping to make
career by selling expertise,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.220 position:56%
by selling projects hoping to invent
jobs for themselves who are hoping

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.920
to invent jobs for their clients.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:06.350
But of course, they also needed
clients to set up institutions,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.310
so that's the kind of sort
of process who are hoping

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:15.360
to impress the sovereign
by being effective.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.490
So if you do a project right you
also make sure that you present,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:27.020
you know, your achievements that
are like parades or presentations

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.600
of the best students so that your
star pupils are sort of taken

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.750
to the court and there they,
you know, like recite poems

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.340
or parade or, you know, perform.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.880
There were tricks to
presenting the best light.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:48.300
So if you're an important official
you try to do many projects,

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.680
you might be acting
as a broker right sort

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.130
of kind of all sorts of experts.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:57.480
They're real experts and of
course, not [inaudible] you know

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.410
between the real expertise
and imposter.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.730
What's really kind of tricky I
mean this guy I mean if he --

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.720 position:56%
well I mean the thing he wasn't
really kicked out because, you know,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.620
sort of somebody was
unhappy with it.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.690
Oh that's a [inaudible]
model school, you know,

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.560
it's poorly run whatever.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:24.230
I mean he was kicked out because
he got into this ego sort of thing

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:30.300
with the Russian aristocrats sort
of assigned to supervise him.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.700
The Frenchman thought
that, you know,

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.530
like he should have no supervision.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.820
And if he managed to get along

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.000 position:56%
with the Russian government he might
have well, you know, like be listed

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.760
in the history books as this,
you know, wonderful, you know,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.820
expert who we know Peter so
wisely invited, you know,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.510
to join the Russian service.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:33:01.010
So basically what with I do in my
book I look at the key episodes

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:05.010
of institutional [inaudible] like
that beginning from sort of kind

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.730
of late 17th century and
up to Catherine the Second.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:15.620 position:56%
And I stop on the eve of Catherine's
reign for a variety of reasons.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:23.270 position:56%
One of them being that because
Catherine is such a big topic since,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:27.700
you know, should be kind of so
much stuff going on that, you know,

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.610
like that could be a book, you
know, sort of a separate book.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.190
And basically I look
at the key episodes

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.570
of institutional innovations in
that period in education kind

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.360
of new schools being
created or reformed.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.210
And try to look at them not from
the point of view of this kind

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:47.110
of progressive [inaudible]
kind of sort of oh, you know,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.460
things were developing, you know,
like becoming more sort of secular,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.960
formal, institutionalized
because they had to right.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.740
But rather show how this sort of
institutionalized and the creation

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.250
of new schools, new institutions
their evolution how it reflects the

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.530
[inaudible] of different
types of entrepreneurs.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.510
Thank you.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:17.450

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.780
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Thank you,
very entertaining [inaudible].

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.780
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Thank you.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.450
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Are
there questions?

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:28.820
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:34.010
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Well
it's a very good question.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.660
Well I mean for that
period of course,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.290
most of those guys they
didn't know German French,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.760
so it had to be Russian.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:54.760
Sometimes they would involve
translators, but what they would do

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.980
of course -- well I mean
most teachers were actually

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.860
Russians right.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:14.140
So there were few foreigners who
kind of would take a few Russians

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.480
who already knew kind
of the math for example.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.910
I mean math, I mean for those
technical schools of course,

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.720
math was a key thing right because
you needed math for engineering,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.630
you needed math for navigation.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:33.790
So those teachers would arrive
and they would really kind of work

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.420
with a few kind of advanced
pupils right, kind of elder people

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.870 position:56%
who already know the math, you know,
who learns the math in [inaudible]

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.550
and who also knows
all four languages.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.370
So they will be instructing
those Russians in sort

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.420
of advanced math while
those, you know,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.030
kind of apprentices right would
in turn be instructing, you know,

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.900
sort of the beginners right.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.550 position:56%
So yeah, so that was mostly Russian.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.710
&gt;&gt; I have kind of a
similar situation.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:10.420
I understand [inaudible] that Peter
everywhere he went they knew him.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.720
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.370
&gt;&gt; In which ever area
he [inaudible].

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.670
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.270
&gt;&gt; He took up so many
different things [inaudible].

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.640
He would pick experts.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.940
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.240
&gt;&gt; In that particular field

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.350
and he would send them
or take them to Russia.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.800
So he also had this
huge [inaudible].

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.170
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right,
absolutely yeah.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.320
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.940
&gt;&gt; And so what he would do --
so these people [inaudible].

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.240
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.510
&gt;&gt; And I would have assumed

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.860
that they would have
instructors [inaudible].

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.160
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.490
&gt;&gt; Whereas there was a whole
group of foreigners [inaudible]

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.120
in Saint Petersburgh [inaudible].

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.420
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.130
&gt;&gt; And there I would
have assumed that some

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.460
of these people would training the.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.760
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.060
&gt;&gt; The people from the [inaudible].

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.360
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.400
&gt;&gt; So I [inaudible] and then
you have the other side.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.700
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.890
&gt;&gt; Where Peter was very much

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.830
against all the [inaudible]
of tradition and.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.130
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right yeah.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:24.520
&gt;&gt; And he wanted people in
general to kind of shed that.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.820
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.120
&gt;&gt; And kind of move
into the modern world.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.560
So I was kind of looking to
hearing a little bit not just

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:41.180
about the [inaudible] I was kind
of hoping to hear a little bit more

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.290
if there were any way that
education [inaudible].

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.590

right, right.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:55.540
&gt;&gt; But I knew he had certain
interests and those he focused on.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.840
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.550
&gt;&gt; But was there [inaudible]
by the rest of the [inaudible].

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.820
Do you see what I'm getting?

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.120
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: No.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, the Russians in general.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.680
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Well, I mean --
well I mean movement you mean like,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.480
you know, kind of sort
from below kind of right.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.090
&gt;&gt; No, not just from
below from him to say

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:20.530
to his people I have been abroad.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.830
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.130
&gt;&gt; I have seen how this function,

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.810
let's see what we can
do here and [inaudible].

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.510
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right, yeah

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:31.820
but I mean I guess that's
you're absolutely right

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.510
and I guess that's exactly
what I'm saying right.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.950
In a sense that, you know,
that he sets his direction

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:43.180 position:56%
and then there are people who want
to exploit this sort of all kind of,

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:49.820
you know, message to
make careers or to.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.040
&gt;&gt; Any results from any efforts?

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.240
How far did he move Russia
from before he was there

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.230
in general terms of education?

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:03.110
Educating the Russians
in particular areas or?

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.410
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:05.710
&gt;&gt; In general [inaudible]?

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.150
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Well, I mean
I'm afraid it's impossible to say,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.550
you know, sort of like how far
kind of move or didn't move.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.670
I mean that's, I mean what
does really kind of movement.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.180
What do you mean like
[inaudible] of literacy or?

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.350
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:27.090
Well that's impossible to
say, that's impossible to say.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:33.430
But certainly [inaudible] there
were both sort of Russians

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:39.290
who went abroad and who came back
and who tried to make careers

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:45.880
by kind of selling their, I mean
whatever skills they have acquired.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.450
But also foreigners can be invited.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:57.940 position:56%
But I mean here again, I mean there
is [inaudible] most important called

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:03.870
the [inaudible], a Scotsman.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.480
So I mean Peter personally
hires him while in London

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.140
at the end of the 17th century.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.310
He personally hires him,
invites him to come to Russia.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.900
He does that with two
sort of assistants.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.510
But what happens then is that he
sort of he [inaudible] in Moscow

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.050
like for two years, you know,
there are like no evidence

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:30.770 position:56%
of Peter actually sort of, you know,
kind have been involved and kind

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.130
of setting up a school whatever.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.480
And I mean I get it, you know,
Peter was pretty busy, you know,

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.890
doing like all those wars
and diplomacy and rebellions.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:44.860
But sort of when the thing
actually kind of moved ahead is

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:51.110
when this guy projector sort of
profiteer whatever you call him,

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.800
sort of inventor of
new things comes along.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.110
This guy sort of who
promotes himself by sort

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.370
of submitting all sorts
of projects to Peter,

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.840
by advising Peter on
all sort of things.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.000
And one of the things, you know,
he takes over those teachers.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.390
Requests Peter to appoint him to
be in charge of the school sort of.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:21.790
Finds a way to actually redirect
funding from a different source

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.500
because he's also official
elsewhere.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.820
So he's official at the armory,

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.020
so he requested those teachers
be transferred to the armory

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.830
so then now he could use,
you know, the armory funding

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.300
to actually to fund the thing.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.290
He also uses, you know,
this new school.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.930
He gets Peter to sign decree
like setting up a school,

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:50.780
but then he uses to school to
employ his kind of own friends.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.790
Which I mean it doesn't mean that,
you know, that it's like terrible,

00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:00.230
I mean his friends are
actually educated and, you know,

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.130
turn out to be pretty
good teachers and sort

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.170
of important cultural initiative.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.010
He uses the school to
promote himself later on.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.050
I mean immediately
when they do this sort

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.850
of when they start the school
they write a textbook of their own

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.900
and they prepare this, you know,
very sort of luxurious edition,

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.860
you know, sort of very nicely kind
of done on expensive paper and sort

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.790
of present it to Peter saying
like look at us we've done that.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:32.730 position:56%
I mean we're your faithful servants,
we need to be rewarded by the way.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:39.110
So and just to finish up and
actually what happens is that yes,

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.030
I mean Peter sends an overall
message, but then, you know,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:49.930
they're all like really lots of
kind of well private teachers

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:55.550
or private initiatives to
instruct, you know, [inaudible].

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.120
Foreign teachers coming to
kind of practice, you know,

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.090
either trying to get
support from Peter or just

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.920
like privately kind of
practicing teachers.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.380 position:56%
Peter is at war trying to earn money
by, you know, by teaching the Swedes

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:16.070
or also the Russians kind of trying
to earn extra money, you know,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.450
like by just teaching
basic literacy.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:23.500
So I mean you really kind
of find this movement.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:29.270 position:56%
As I say, [inaudible] interaction to
Peter's kind of sort of vague push,

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.510
you know, kind of [inaudible] so.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:52.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.340
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Well,

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.930
I mean disorganized is a
tricky thing because, you know,

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:56.230
well I mean in the
sense that you know

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.820
like when you want to
kind of to do reform.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.670
When you only want to
sell yourself [inaudible],

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.270
I mean that's what you say oh
they're so disorganized, you know,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.390
I must appoint a [inaudible]
straighten them up.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:14.010
So it's kind of tricky,
but you're right yeah.

I mean that's [inaudible] help
and, you know, there are all those

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:33.480
and of course, there are articles
and now that so many books are,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.540
especially older books
are available, you know,

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.060

[Inaudible] yeah, absolutely
it's a really great resource

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.760
for like older books
where you could,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.640
you know, sort of download things.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.830
Yeah, I mean going beyond
the Library of Congress

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.840
of course the one sort
of real amazing thing

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.380
which the French have is
this thing called Gallica

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:26.870 position:56%
where you could actually do -- I
know with those old books, you know,

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.660
sort of scanned copies
could actually do kind of,

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.640
you know, like a keyword search.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.240
You know, they have sort of like,
you know, word recognition software

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.090
which allows you to
search, you know,

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.670
through like 17th century
books kind of.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.080
That's like really amazing
and helpful kind of.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.510

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.120
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: I'd ask you to
speak up [inaudible] so we can.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.330
&gt;&gt; Well you focused on the
naval academy I'm interested

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.220
about other schools and how popular
they were and what the [inaudible].

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.520
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right okay.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.820
Yeah.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.320
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: If you
could repeat the question.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.620
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Right yeah.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:16.640
So the overall -- sort of other
schools and like, you know,

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.340
how the population react.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.240
Well I think it actually
reacted pretty positively.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.170
In the sense that I
know there was this myth

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:32.280
that oh they're all
like against learning.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.840
I don't think we actually have,
you know, direct evidence for that.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.600
What they were against actually
they were against, you know,

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.850
like being forced to do things
which did not correspond to their,

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.780
you know, life and
career strategies.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.550
And that was really important
and that changes, you know,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.810
kind of throughout the period.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.430
Because I mean what
happened initially, you know,

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:05.470
say around the year 1700, say
this navigation school is created,

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:09.990
everybody's invited, they
pay this small stipend.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:11.290
So they actually have
like, you know,

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.620
lots of people coming
to study there.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.150 position:56%
Of course, that's [inaudible] right,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:22.520
it's like usually [inaudible]
ability, some of the soldiers

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:26.110
or for instance, you know, all
those kind of like poor boys

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.120
who really kind of
want to get, you know,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.010
the small stipend of
whom it's important.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.190
You know, they come
making hundreds you know.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:38.050
So they hire [inaudible], lots of
them, you know, like go ahead and,

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:43.270
you know, enroll in schools too.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.160
But of course, they prefer
to enroll into other schools.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.430
You know, for example there
is this like private school

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.980
around by this German
pastor who provides --

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.590
well he presents as
a gymnasium right.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.780
So he presents it as sort
of more like, you know,

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:09.570
kind of more refined education
kind of, which more fits, you know,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:14.380
their self-perception as a part
of European [inaudible] right.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:22.140 position:56%
So there you would have like fencing
and, you know, sort of horse riding

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.320
in terms of more of sort

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.210
of [inaudible] academy
kind of type of education.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.260
And they go there too on their own.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:42.130
When it does change is when
around 1715 he actually tries

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:50.260
to push them all into schools
where he wants them to be not

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.460
where they want to be right.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.360
For example, he bans all
the sort of like no nobles

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.100
from entering this navigation
school and naval academy

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.620
and instead forces, you
know, [inaudible] to be able

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.350
to go into naval academy.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:14.030
Which doesn't fit their,
you know, life strategies

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.330
which is really expensive.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:19.600
And actually one of the reasons why
they want to force the [inaudible]

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.390
in the naval academy because
it's in Saint Petersburg.

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.680
It's real expensive to live
there because it's far away

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.810
from the major kind
of population center,

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.470 position:56%
so it's like really all the
supplies are really expensive there.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.970
And by that time the war
has been going on for

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.910
like 20 years they really
don't have the money.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.880
So they basically want them to
kind of to live on their own,

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.130
to use their own kind of money.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.880
And people kind of like are
really unhappy about that.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:50:00.390
And there is like no clear sort
of argument for promoting them.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:05.390
So like earlier in this navigation
school like lower in ability,

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:09.220
sons of soldiers, I mean they were
happy just to get their salary

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.610
and to get, you know, like
entry-level job [inaudible] scribes

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.760
or technicians or money counters.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.060
And now you have those princes,
you know, who spend like, you know,

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.340
like whatever number of years at
this naval academy have to pay

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.940
for that and [inaudible]
prospects, you know, because I mean

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:31.190
after graduation they get
to them sort of Gaza marine.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:38.790
The great northern war ends,
so there's like, you know,

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.700
demand for naval offices,
you know, like is lower.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.430
You know, like promotion
is much lower

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.850
because people not being killed,
you know, like every year right.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.640
So like no openings and
they're like stuck there

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.440
like for 10 years without
any promotions.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:59.540
Yeah of course, they resist that,
of course they tried to evade that.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.480
So what happens in 1730
is that they actually --

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.590
all the nobles still have to
serve and still have to study,

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:12.860
but what they do they actually
give them freedom of choice.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.480
They let them themselves choose,
you know, between sort of going

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:22.600
to school or going straight into
regiments as private soldiers

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.550
and making their career there.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:28.770
And they give them a choice of --
give them a sort of right to choose

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.470
between different schools.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.440
Actually when young nobles come to
this place called the [inaudible],

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.360
the special office which
registers young nobles for service

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.910
and then kind of supervises
their careers sort of kind

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:48.050
of human resources kind of office,
you know, the imperial scale.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.360
And they actually ask them, you
know, where they want to serve and,

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.770
you know, they record
their preferences.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:59.370
And I've actually looked into
that and sort of an article came

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:03.370
out in the Journal of Social
History just [inaudible].

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:09.410 position:56%
But in about two thirds of cases
they actually appoint them according

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.750
to their preferences right.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:18.350
And that works much, much better
in the sense that, you know,

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.850
they're actually people for who --

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.990
for whatever reasons because
of family connections,

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:26.940
family preferences, you
know, who opt for schools.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.110
And then there are other
people who opt for, you know,

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.810
just joining the service as
private soldiers and it works.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:39.800
So freedom is important,
freedom of choice yeah.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.600
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.930
What happened to this
fellow Hilaire after?

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.230
&gt;&gt; Igor Fedyukin: Yeah.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.530
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:48.830
He is kicked out.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:56.710
I mean the last, so the
latest we hear from him is --

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:01.540
I mean he hangs out in Saint
Petersburg for like about a year

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.760
and a half kind of
tries to sort of --

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:10.230
tries to get his salary kind of due
to him plus gets new appointment.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:19.460
And then in 1720 he goes over
to the Swedes and the last kind

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.970
of thing I was able to find
about him is his letter

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.820
to the Swedish admiral
kind of advising him of how

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:35.800
to attack the Russian
held [inaudible].

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:43.510
So it's a long and
winding road yeah.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:48.770
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:54.510
Well, you know, I mean it's.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.330
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:03.870
Right well, I mean of course
education is always [inaudible].

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:11.990
Yeah, no well that's
a good question.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:17.300 position:56%
Certainly, I wouldn't say that right
now that Peter is the most popular

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.770
of the rulers, I mean in sort
of, you know, official discourse.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:25.050
In the sense that this idea of kind
of learning from Europeans kind

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:30.640
of sounds a little bit
kind of questionable.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.290
Also there is a large
difference in the sense that --

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:39.990
there is a huge difference in the
sense that yes, I mean there are

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:43.600 position:56%
like all sorts of reform initiatives
in the Russian education kind

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.260
of that's been going on for the
past like 10 years or whatever.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:50.800
But at the same time certainly
I'll say that for President Putin,

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:55.340
you know, education sense
it's not his thing right.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.640
I mean he doesn't have this --

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.100
I mean there are like areas
where he sort of once again,

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.170 position:56%
he's kind of passionate about right.

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.230
And sort of and education
is not one of them.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:10.170
So it's much more again,
you know, about project,

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.990
about you know important
dignitaries, important ministers,

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:17.290
you know, battling various
visions, various projects.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.730
President Putin kind of like
saying yeah like whatever.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:27.210
And then, you know, it's like,
you know, it's like kind of driven

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.670
by career, by ambitions,
by grant seeking,

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:39.010
by sort of individual
administrative entrepreneurs.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:46.510

is some -- that's how.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.270
Well actually I'm trying
to make an argument

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.340
that states actually
from the [inaudible].

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.450
That's what I've been
trying to say again yeah.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:10.250
Well, I mean yeah it's much kind
of -- much less kind of top down,

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.430
much less kind of directed from
the very top, much more sort of,

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:20.740
you know, growing up from below,
from you know, okay maybe not

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.150
from below, but from the middle
[inaudible] kind of yeah.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:24.450
&gt;&gt; That's interesting.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:29.340

we'll have to stop there.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.640
Thank you all for coming.

thank you that was really.
