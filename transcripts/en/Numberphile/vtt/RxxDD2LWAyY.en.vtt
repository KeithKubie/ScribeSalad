00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.109
RIA SYMONDS: Number 31 is a
Mersenne prime, but we're not

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.450
going to talk about why
it's Mersenne today.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.830
We're going to look at why it's
a truly lucky number.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm going to start off with a
whole bunch of numbers to

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.200
begin with.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.530
I've listed the numbers
1 just up to 58.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.590
OK, now I'm going to use an
algorithm that sieves out my

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.570
numbers to ensure that I
only get lucky numbers.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.290
So to begin with, I'm going to
eliminate every other number

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.170
from my list.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.640
So I start with number 1, and
we're going to get rid of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940
every other one from there on.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.340
So 2's gone, 4's gone.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.160
So all of my even numbers,
you can see, are going.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.570
These are unlucky in terms of
my mathematical algorithm.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450
Now I'm going to start
eliminating more numbers by

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.260
going on to the next step
of my algorithm.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.060
Now, a second iteration, so I
look at the second number in

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.550
the terms that I've got left.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.520
So my second number is 3.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.780
Because it's 3, I'm now going
to start eliminating every

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.170
third number.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.860
So that's my first number, 1.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.420
3 is my second number.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460
5 would be the third number,
so we get rid of 5.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.420
1, 2, 3.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.940
W get rid of 11.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.350
OK, so at the moment, 1
and 3 are both safe.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990
They're lucky numbers.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.510
We carry on with
the algorithm.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.260
The next number I need to
look at is number 7.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.740
So now number 7 tells me how
many numbers I need to get rid

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.380
of, eliminate.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.470
I would eliminate every
7th number.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.030
So we start from
the beginning.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.994
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:46.120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.560
We move on to our
next number, 9.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.620
So I now start eliminating
every 9th number.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.490
So our first lots of lucky
numbers are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.920
unlucky for some.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.470
15, 21, 25, and 31, our
special number.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.200
BRADY HARAN: Tell me something
else about 31, can you?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.620
RIA SYMONDS: I can.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.690
31 is a pentagonal number.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.320
Do you know what that means?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.514
I have 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:28.190
So on the fourth iteration, we
get our pentagonal number, 31.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.090
BRADY HARAN: I've realized why
your pentagon's so bad.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.480
It's because I'm making you
draw it from the side.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.970
RIA SYMONDS: Yeah.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.434
From my perspective, it
looks kind of OK.

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:36.370
BRADY HARAN: Darling,
tip it towards me.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.080
RIA SYMONDS: If I slightly turn
this board around, is it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.980
looking any better?

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.870
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.040
I can see why you've
done it now.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.170
Ah.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.420
RIA SYMONDS: The beauty
of maths.
