00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.655
Let's now think
about Type 2 regions.

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.155
And you'll see that they're
kind of very similar definitions

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:07.075
and it's really a
question of orientation.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.950
Type 2 region is a
region-- I'll call it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.400
R2-- that's the set of all
x, y's, and z's in three

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.310
dimensions such
that-- and now instead

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.917
of thinking of our domain
in terms of xy-coordinates,

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:32.250
we're going to think of them
in terms of yz coordinates,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.920
such that our yz pairs are
a member of some domain.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.260
I'll call it D2 since we're
talking about Type 2 regions.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.740
And x is bounded below
by some function of yz.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:58.160
So I'll call it g1 of yz is
less than or equal to x, which

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.200
is less than or equal to some
other function of yz, g2 of yz.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.890
And so you'll immediately see
a very similar way of thinking

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.750
about it, but instead of
having z vary between two

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.670
functions of x and y as
we had in a Type 1 region,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.412
we now have x varying between
two functions of y and z.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.620
Now let's think about some
of the shapes we explored.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.590
We saw that these
two right up here,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.550
this sphere and the cylinder,
were Type 1 regions,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.080
but this dumbbell, the way
that I oriented it here,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.810
was not a Type 1 region.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.220
Let's think about which of
these are Type 2 regions

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.600
and what might not
be a Type 2 region.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.280
So first let's think
about the sphere.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.780
So I have my axes
right over here.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.350
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.500
So I got my axes.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.610
And so over here, our
domain, we could still

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.470
construct our sphere,
but our domain

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.250
is now going to be
in the yz plane.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.960
So yz plane is this
business right over here.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.000
So this will be our domain.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.740
I want to make it more
spherical than that.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.650
So our domain is this right
over here in the yz plane.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.666
That is our D2.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.040
And now the lower
bound, in order

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.510
to construct the solid region
of the sphere or the globe

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.310
or whatever you want to call
it, the lower bound on x

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.850
would be kind of the back half
of the sphere, the one that's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.760
away from us right over here.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.710
So the lower bound--
so let me see

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.670
how well I can wire
frame it at first.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240
I can do a better job than that.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.780
So with my ghost do
something like that,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.490
then do something like that.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.120
But this is if the domain
right over here is transparent.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.100
But all we might catch-- we'll
just catch a glimpse of it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.960
in the back right over here.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.980
So it's the side of the sphere
that's facing away from us.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.420
And then the upper
bound on x would

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.660
be the side of the
sphere that's facing us.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.340
So if I were to
do some contours,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.690
it might look
something like this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.940
and then look
something like this.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.770
And then we would color in this
entire region right over here.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.520
And x can take on all of the
values above that magenta

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.486
surface and below
this green surface.

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:17.860
And essentially,
it would fill up

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.020
the globe for every yz
point in our domain.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.295
So a sphere is both a Type
1 and a Type 2 region.

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:27.670
Actually, we're
going to see it's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.180
going to be a Type
3 region as well.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.110
What about this cylinder
right over here?

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.360
Can we construct it or
think about it in a way

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.330
that it would actually
be a Type 2 region?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.000
So let's try to do that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.360
So let me paste it.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560
So what if we had
a domain-- what

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.550
if our domain was
something like this?

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.380
It was a rectangle
in the yz plane.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.310
So this is our domain, a
rectangle in the yz plane.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.630
So that would be my D2.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.280
And what if the
lower bound was kind

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.870
of the back side
of the cylinder?

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.030
So the backside of
the cylinder, try

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.930
to draw it as good as I can.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.710
And so if we just saw
the outside of it,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.130
it would look
something like that.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.060
It's facing away from
us so we barely see it.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.220
If we could see
through the cylinder

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.850
or see through the little
flat cut of the cylinder,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.780
it would look
something like that.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.490
So that over there
would be our g1.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.020
And then our g2 would be the
front side of the cylinder.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.160
The g2 could be the front
side of the cylinder.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.590
So let me color it
in as best as I can.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.700
So the g2 would be the
front side of cylinder.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.260
And x can vary above
g1 and below g2,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.400
and it would fill up
this entire cylinder.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.170
So we see that this same
cylinder that we also saw

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.810
was a Type 1 region can
also be a Type 2 region.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.430
Now what about this
hourglass thing that we saw

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.010
could not be a Type 1 region?

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.290
Can this be a Type 2 region?

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.370
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.770
I'll do it the same way.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.910
We can construct a domain.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.684
So maybe our domain,
it's in the y-- well,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.100
it should be in the yz plane
if we're talking about Type 2

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.910
regions or if we want to think
of it as a Type 2 region.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.030
So our domain could be this kind
of flat hourglass shape that's

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.670
in the yz plane.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.090
So our domain could be a
region that looks something

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.170
like this in the yz plane.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.300
So this is kind
of flattened out.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.860
So this is our domain
right over there.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.110
And then the lower
bound on x, g1,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.230
could be a surface,
the function of y and z

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.700
that is kind of the
backside of our hourglass.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.990
The backside of our
hourglass you could see.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.020
I'll try to show the
contours from the underside

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.728
right over there.

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:51.481
So that could be our g1.

00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.855
And then our g2 could be the
front side of the hourglass.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.860
So my best attempt to draw the
front side of the hourglass.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.200
And I could color it in.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.370
And so the way I somewhat
confusingly drew it just now,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.740
you see that this hourglass
oriented the way it is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.640
would actually be
a Type 2 region.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.510
Now if we were to rotate
it like this-- so let

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.070
me draw it like this.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.050
Edit.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.760
So if we were to
make it like this so

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.760
that the top of my
hourglass is facing

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.650
us-- try my best to draw it.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.990
So let's say the top intersects
the x-axis right over there.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.370
This is the bottom of my
hourglass right over there.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.680
And then it bends in and then
comes back out like that.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.180
For the same reasons that
this was not a Type 1 region,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.360
this now would not
be a Type 2 region.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.450
For any zy, you can see there
could be multiple x points that

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.320
are associated with
the different points

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.350
of this hourglass.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.330
You can't just have a
simple lower and upper round

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.530
functions right over here.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:13.450
So this right over here
is not a Type 2 region.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.810
You could show a
rationale or this

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.450
is going to be a Type 1 region.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.680
You could create a region
over here in the xy plane

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.380
and have an upper and lower
bound functions for z.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.680
So you could be Type 1, but
this will not be Type 2.
