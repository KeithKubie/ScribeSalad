MATIAS DUARTE: Get the
welcome slide.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.460
There we go.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.890
All right.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.540
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.150
Hi.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.420
My name's Matias Duarte.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.390
I run the design team
here at Android.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.520
And I am super, super excited to
welcome you all here today.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.290
This is the first Google I/O
where we can have an entire

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.800
day of Android design
sessions.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.910
We're gonna have an entire
day of design sessions

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.610
here in this room.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:24.940
MATIAS DUARTE: That's crazy.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.940
Is this really Google I/O?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.870
Google I/O with a day
of design sessions?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.600
Yeah.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.990
No, that's really awesome.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.900
So obviously you're here because
you care about design.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.800
Whether you're big team with
an established track record

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700
and lots of published apps or
just a one man shop who's just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.620
getting started,
design matters.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.710
Design is going to make your
app, take it from great to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.960
insanely great.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.560
In January we launched the
Android Design Guide.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.650
It's a bunch of tools to
help you make your

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.530
app beautifully designed.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.120
I like to think of it as kind of
like an open source library

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.110
for design.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.070
It's a bunch of patterns and
solutions that you don't have

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.790
to think about.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.750
You don't have to reinvent
the wheel.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410
If you're not sure how to make
it easy for users to navigate

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.240
between screens, that's OK.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.430
We got a solution for you.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.230
You don't have to spend
time testing or

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.590
experimenting with that.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.490
If you're not sure how to
make something legible

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.830
or clear, it's OK.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.160
We've got a solution for you.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.130
You don't have to figure out the
basic metrics or grids or

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.720
contrasts or colors.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.790
But there's a lot more
to design than just

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.700
what's in the guide.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.390
And that's what today's sessions
are all about.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.790
This morning we start with
Design for Success, which is

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.150
an awesome overview of the
entire design process.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.370
How to slot the design
guide into the

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.230
entire development process.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.770
And we're going to show
you some examples

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.420
of how to do that.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.850
Next, we have So You've Read the
Design Guide, Now What?,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.000
which is a very practical
session which is going to show

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.280
you how to take all the
principles that you learned in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190
Design Guide and turn
them into perfect

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.060
pixels on your screen.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.479
One of my favorite sessions and
the one I'm most excited

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.790
about is Navigation.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.120
Because navigation is the
essential backbone of any

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.570
well-designed experience.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.290
It's what makes everything
make sense.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.340
It's what gives people
a sense of place

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.850
and keeps them grounded.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.920
So I hope I'll see you there.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.340
And then finally we have a
two-hour workshop, which I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.810
forget what we called it.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.580
Playing with Patterns.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.740
Playing with Patterns is also a
really exciting because here

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.380
you're going to see other
developers who've actually

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.590
taken the style guide and used
it, used it to leverage their

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.590
design and expand
their design.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.230
Design Guide is not
a constraint.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.330
It's not a shackle.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.480
It's a tool.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.380
It's an accelerator.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.480
It's a way to boost your
experience even further.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.200
And these guys have done it and
they're going to show you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.090
how they did it and hopefully
give you some

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.200
good tips on that.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.400
I hope you'll attend
all of them.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.490
Even if you can't, the day's
not over then because after

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.390
the day of design sessions, the
design team will be at the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.920
W Hotel bar later in
the afternoon.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.530
And if you have any questions
or you just want to hang out

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.520
with the design team and have
some design pixie dust rub off

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.420
on you, I hope you guys will
come by and make friends.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.630
So with that, I would like to
introduce Jens Nagel, Rachel

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.340
Garb, and Nate Streu from the
design team who are going to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.120
teach you all about Design
for Success.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.460
So give them a round of
applause, please.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.690
JENS NAGEL: Thanks, Matias.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.820
So let's get started.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.000
Where does it all begin?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.750
It usually begins
with an idea.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.890
So you have an idea
for an app.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.130
The thing is that,
coincidentally, thousands of

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.620
other app developers
have one too.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.440
And some of those ideas
might actually be

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.310
pretty close to yours.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.330
So it's really time to
differentiate yourself.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.310
And we want to help you
do it through design.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.655
One important way, as I said,
to differentiate yourself is

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:15.265
through design.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.269
And organizations
realize that.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.610
And they usual verbalize
it as look and feel.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.790
So look is an easy enough to
grasp concept as it speaks to

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.270
the visual properties
of an app.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.770
But feel is a little bit more
nebulous and less clearly

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.440
articulated.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.300
To clear this up, where the feel
is, and what goes into a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.290
design team we want to look at
the basic functions of a

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.860
design team.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.980
For example, our team-- the
Android User Experience Team.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.950
And, yes.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.175
That is our logo.

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:48.425
Nice.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.930
So first up in the run down of
subteams in our team is user

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.380
experience research.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.870
So UX research shapes sort
of the product and design

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.320
direction by bringing
in insights about

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.710
users to the team.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.220
I'll introduce them in a little
bit more detail in a

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.120
bit, so let's go to
the next one.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.910
NATE STREU: All right.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.300
So visual design.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.560
This is next up.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.620
And this can go by a lot
of different names.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.350
And you can call it
what you will.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.230
It's imperative to the
success of your app.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.730
Visual design can span a wide
breadth of disciplines from

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.460
typography, iconography,
animation, art direction, and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.723
design production.

00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:33.650
RACHEL GARB: OK.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.020
So next up, interaction
design.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.805
Interaction designers
define the structure

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.540
and behavior of apps.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.390
So we organize functionality
in the screens.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.440
We map out how the users will
navigate between the screens.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.610
And then we identify all of the
information and actions

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.430
that need to appear
on each screen.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.310
Now although we do more line
drawings then pixel perfect

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.970
mocks, our work is highly
detail-oriented.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.930
And just like programmers, we
need to make sure that every

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.964
use case or condition
is accounted for.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:06.630
JENS NAGEL: Next up is a
really exciting team.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.100
It's the prototyping team.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.640
And they make complex new
interaction ideas tangible.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.180
So they create functional
prototypes that allow us to

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.910
experience a novel design
firsthand and evaluate it.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.110
RACHEL GARB: And this is our
technical writer, Shawn.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.250
He plays a dual role
on our team.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.440
First, he creates help
for Android.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.460
This can take a variety of forms
like printed materials,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.220
web-based help centers, and help
that you see in the app.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.300
Second, he shapes the
voice of Android.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.410
And he does this with his
responsibility for our UI

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.550
writing guidelines and working
across the teams to make sure

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.440
that terminology is used
consistently in our apps and

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.391
our system.

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:56.330
JENS NAGEL: And then last but
not least is what I would like

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.590
to call the glue.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.180
So these are the people that
work across functions.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.800
And Matias is one of them.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.730
He's the one that provides
design direction to the team.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.380
But then we also have
project management.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.590
And generally people that are
there to make the design

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.030
machine run.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.070
So that is a fairly big
team as far as design

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.440
teams go, on average.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.080
I guess.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.930
Maybe not for the scale of
Android, but in your

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.570
organization you have access
to a crack design team all

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.490
dressed in black like the
guys on the left.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.680
That's great.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.950
Let them do their thing.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.580
But you might be in the
situation where you're on a

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.350
smaller team.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.350
Or maybe your even this app
army of one, one person

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.010
playing multiple different
instruments.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.880
Even in that situation where
you have your hands people

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.690
with all sorts of things,
designers is always doable.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.240
And today we want to show
you how you can do that.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.980
So where should you start
with the design process?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.795
A clue can actually come here
from motivational psychology,

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:05.440
of all things.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.850
Some of you might be familiar
with Maslow's

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.590
Hierarchy of Needs.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.450
Basically postulates that all
human behavior is geared

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.900
towards sort of fulfilling basic
needs first before you

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.710
progress to the higher levels,
the higher needs.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.630
So for example, before I take
care of the safety of my

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.450
employment, I probably want to
breathe, eat, and sleep.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.039
So these so the more
basic needs here.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.669
So you might ask now,
what does that have

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.980
to do with app design?

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.929
And that's a good question.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.970
But it is the principle
of how you should

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.280
approach app design.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.830
App designers really should
address their apps' design

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.745
needs by progressing through a
similar Hierarchy of Needs.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:56.120
The contents here, of course,
are a little bit different.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.890
So you should address the
design foundations first

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.040
before striving to address
higher level needs.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.770
In this pyramid, if you just
cover the first three levels

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.150
of the pyramid, you already have
a really competitive app

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.380
that measures up against
the competition well.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.720
And it will be also an app that
is sort of a good citizen

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.960
on the Android platform in that
it sort of follows the

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.100
rules and regulations
of the UI.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.890
The Android Design Guide, which
you hear about more in a

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.010
second, sort of gets you
to that third level.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.080
It mainly deals with the second
and the third tier of

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.530
this pyramid.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:47.240
So as a takeaway, make sure
that you cover your bases.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.970
So before you do this--

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.510
and that might an instinct.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.150
Everybody wants the pretty app
that does exciting things like

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.600
nice transitions
and everything.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.450
But before you do this, really
make sure that you do that.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.340
The base of the pyramid.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.930
Because if you don't do that,
that often equals the

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.150
proverbial lipstick on a pig.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.740
So to give you a little bit more
context about the Design

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.936
Guide, Rachel will give
you whirlwind tour.

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:16.760
RACHEL GARB: OK.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.130
Thanks.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.034
So--

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.960
whoops.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.680
Show of hands.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.754
How many of you have
visited this site?

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:27.520
JENS NAGEL: Wow.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.260
RACHEL GARB: OK.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.360
And that looks like at least
3/4 of the room.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.060
Terrific.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.210
JENS NAGEL: Awesome.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.230
RACHEL GARB: So for those who
haven't yet seen this, this is

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.870
the Android Design Guide.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.420
And we launched it earlier
this year.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.510
And we're updating
it regularly.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.640
It's for anyone who needs
to make design

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.490
decisions, big and small.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.470
Whether you're a professional
designer or you wouldn't be

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.250
caught dead wearing all black.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.260
If you're designing an
Android app, you

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.860
should go check it out.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.580
Now I'm not going to give you
a full tour, because that

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.960
would take way too much time.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.470
But I want to point out a few
pages that I think you'll find

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.540
particularly helpful.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.445
So the first is application
structure.

00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:06.740
Which Jens has up.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.210
A lot of what we're talking
about today

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.670
is introduced here.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.430
And you can think of it as sort
of a one-page Cliff's

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.010
Notes to designing
Android apps.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.880
It provides overview of things
like hierarchical, structure,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.680
navigation, layout, identity.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.580
It's a quick and easy read.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.170
The next thing I want to show
you is the action bar.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.470
Please read this and
refer to it often.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.770
The action bar is the most
important structural element

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.090
of your app.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.730
Why is that?

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.850
Because in a very compact space,
it does a lot of heavy

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.540
lifting for you.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.110
It's where you can present
actions, whether they're

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.020
primary, like these, or whether
they are not so

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.620
important and can go in
an overflow menu.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.040
It's where you give your
app an identity.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.770
And if your app has hierarchical
structure,

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.040
there's a way built in to
navigate up to the top.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.600
If you want to provide different
views on the

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.600
information without the user
leaving the screen, you have a

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.980
way that they can switch
the views.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.150
Now the action bar pattern isn't
just important because

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.370
of all it does.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.220
It's also important because
this will help your users

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.100
learn your app more quickly.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.005
This has become a familiar and
expected pattern in Android

00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:25.070
and all of the Android's
core apps use it.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.080
The next section I
want to point you

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.620
to is building blocks.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.010
This is where you'll find all
of the information about the

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.790
elements that you'll use to
create apps like list, menus,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.330
buttons, tabs, and so on.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.400
You can see there's a lot of
illustrations and examples.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.690
And this covers both interaction
and visual design.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.600
And finally, design patterns.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.290
Which you'll find under
get started.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.490
But we're not going to read
through it right now.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.370
I think this is best
read on your own.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.450
But I would like to take a
moment to give you a little

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.740
background on the design
principles.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.600
So if you could switch
to the slide.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.884
And--

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.134
there.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.140
So if your users could talk,
here are some of the things

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.070
that they'd be saying.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.760
Now how do we know this?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.740
We did extensive
user research.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.620
We went out and observed
and talked with a

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.770
lot of Android owners.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.430
We saw some clear trends and
themes, both things they loved

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.040
and things they didn't
like so much.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.270
And for Ice Cream Sandwich we
wanted to do more of the

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.280
lovable stuff.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.760
And, of course, we wanted to
stop doing the things that

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.090
users found annoying,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.860
frustrating, and simply unlovable.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.230
So we took our user insights and
we transformed them into

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.120
short, memorable catch phrases
that our team could work with

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.500
and share with our teams and
use on day-to-day basis.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.300
We made sure that they were
phrased in actionable ways.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.400
And we found that they've been
really helpful, both at the

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.920
start of a project when we're
just figuring out broad

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.550
directions to take, as well as
when we're in the thick of it

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.850
working on granular design
details and prioritizing bugs.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.670
So we invite you to
use them too.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.760
They're very general, and they
apply to any and all apps.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.206
Now I'm going to turn
it back to the Jens.

00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:21.160
JENS NAGEL: Thank you, Rachel.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.250
So today we want to give you an
applied overview of sort of

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.280
how you can find your way up the
design pyramid and build

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.550
an app that does what your users
need it to do that is

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.190
structurally sound and
also adheres to the

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.720
Android Design Guide.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.640
Our example app for today is
the Google I/O app that you

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.680
hopefully all had a chance to
download onto your shiny new

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.380
Nexus 7 tablets.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.360
If you don't have it or if you
follow along from home, you

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.840
can actually download it
from the Play Store.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.770
And so that the code for this
will also be open sourced the

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.260
week after the conference.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.680
So if you're a developer and you
want to take a closer peek

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.380
at how it was built,
you can do that.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.240
Full disclosure.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.620
Today is a little bit of a
smoke and mirrors session

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.390
because we actually didn't
design this app.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.910
It was Roman Nurik.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.688
You want to stand up?

00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:17.644
All right.

00:15:17.644 --> 00:15:22.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:22.424 --> 00:15:25.300
JENS NAGEL: Some of you might
know him through his work at

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.570
Android Developer Relations.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.890
But we picked it for this
session because, yeah, a, it's

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.200
a great app.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.790
b, it uses mostly framework
elements.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.240
So all stuff that you
will find in the

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.830
Android Design Guide.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.490
And it's a good example of
what you can achieve by

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.420
applying the style guide and
getting your app to that third

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.140
level that we've been
talking about.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.870
Because we're really not
playing much in the app

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.770
Nirvana in the top of the
pyramid with this app.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.660
So let's get started at the
bottom floor of our pyramid

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.785
with utility and purpose.

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:04.620
So as you begin your design
project, it pays off to heed

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.920
the advice of the mad man.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.430
And that is, "of each thing,
ask; what is it in, and of

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.200
itself." So the fundamental
question, what is your app in

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.280
and of itself?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.490
So what is the purpose
of your app?

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.900
What are the technical goals
that serve that purpose?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.520
And what are the things
that are most

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.590
important to your users?

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.600
So why should we think
about purpose?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.380
Because app design, just like
building design, is or should

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.320
be purpose-driven.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.180
The purpose of the building,
for example, has a profound

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.970
impact on how it is built.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.810
Let's look at an example of a
purpose-built building, like

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.490
an airport for example.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.870
Think about an airport from the
travelers' point of view.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.690
The mere fact that it is an
airport already sort of shapes

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.250
expectations of what places are
there, what the functional

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.800
elements, what processes
are in that building.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.589
So if I say airport,
you can probably

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.619
conjure up a lot of things.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.410
And if we all wrote them down
in the room, they would

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.500
probably match a lot.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.380
You would see a lot of check
in, dropping off bags.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.730
So the process, for example, of
getting onto an airplane is

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.560
very similar everywhere.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.280
So you arrive.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.440
Then you drop off
your luggage.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.530
You go through security.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.570
Maybe before you leave
you want to grab a

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.190
bite to eat or drink.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.990
And then finally, you get to
the gate and get on the

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.580
aircraft and leave.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.990
So regardless of the
architectural style,

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.440
regardless of what the airport
looks like, airports are

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.090
really geared towards
that common purpose.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.580
And by doing that, they're very
consistent places and

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.175
users really expect them
to be just that.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.030
Apps, in a sense, are no
different in that the purpose

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.330
of an app also establishes
expectations of functional

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.900
places such as a screen with
information on it.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.130
That's sort of a functional
place akin the

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.340
check in at an airport.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.430
Then there are also actions
associated with those

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.390
functional places, such
as here, actions

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.640
on an action bar.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.240
And there's also navigation,
of course, between those

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.920
functional places.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.330
So they are very similar,
really, to how a building is

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.700
constructed due to a purpose.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.086
So back to our I/O app.

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:40.870
Now that we know that the
purpose of app really drives

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.130
its design, let's get started by
formulating the high level

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.720
mission statement.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.220
And that could be our first high
level mission statement

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.470
here, conference guide that aids
people while planning,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.310
exploring, and attending
Google I/O.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.450
This is sort of your
elevator speech.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.330
So if you have an
app, you should

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.710
have an elevator speech.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.230
You should be able to sort of
communicate with just a

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.090
sentence what your
app is about.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.480
And that is probably then pretty
close to its purpose.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.660
So now that we have that, we
now need to establish the

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.780
technical goals that
serve the purpose.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.240
And also a sense of the
functional places, actions,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.460
and navigations for our app.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.750
So to do that, we need to
collect information obviously,

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.730
because we might not just be
subject matter experts about

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.510
the app that we're building.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.520
So we essentially need
to become just that--

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.500
subject matter experts at
what people's needs

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.700
at conferences are.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.210
So we need to ask questions
just like these.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.550
What do people do before,
during, and after a

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.220
conference?

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.160
What tools do they use?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.220
Maybe we know some
of them, maybe we

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.480
don't know all of them.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.850
What are their rituals?

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.520
What currently works at
conferences and where there

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.620
might be friction points?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.130
Where are there opportunities
where we can fix friction

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.510
points with our app?

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.980
So how would we go about this?

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.270
So at Android, we're happy to
have Helena and her User

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.760
Experience Research Team, which
we already talked about

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.450
when we introduced the team.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.290
They're sort of what you would
call expert gatherers,

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.470
analyzers, interpreters, and
distributors of information.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.350
They will actually go out to
conference, interview people,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.200
observe people.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.260
Maybe shadow them for a while
to see what they're really

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.500
doing, how they interact with
other conference goers, what

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.156
is important to them, what
is not important to them.

00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:50.160
And actually what Helena
probably will do is she will

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.250
most likely ask to designer, the
engineer and the product

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.240
manager that works on
that particular

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
project, to come along.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.260
Case in point, here's a picture
of a user study that

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.940
we did a while ago where we
visited actual users to find

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.130
out how phones and tablets,
other electronic devices, sort

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.270
of fit into their daily lives.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.390
The interesting thing here is
that this guy in the picture

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.490
is actually a software
engineer.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.850
So he essentially changed his
job description for the few

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.750
weeks and helped gather
information on how users

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.490
interact with devices.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.370
And he did that particularly
on things that he would be

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.950
coding a few weeks after.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.310
So he really had the user's
perspective of what was

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.470
important, what was
not important.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.560
So if you do that, if you have
a team and you do information

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.400
collection, do bring product
managers and software

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.270
developers along.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.160
Because it really helps to focus
your entire team on user

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.410
wants and needs.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.270
If on the other hand you're the
app army of one that we

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.210
already talked about, gathering

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.030
information is still possible.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.120
And it will pay off
handsomely.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.050
And anybody can really do it.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.680
So for the price basically of a
coffee at Starbucks, you'll

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.850
find people that will just love
to sit down with you and

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.460
talk a little bit about what
they like and don't like about

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:28.020
an app or a particular
electronic device.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.950
If you do the information
collection, let's say for

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.070
example you do a note-taking
app.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.595
If you do a note-taking app, it
really pays off to go out

00:22:38.595 --> 00:22:42.260
to a couple of users, 10, 20,
maybe, and ask them, how do

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.260
you manage notes in real life?

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.800
And sort of latch.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.360
Learn more about that.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.120
And have your app really latch
onto those processes.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.710
Bottom line is that it's a good
idea to make information

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.560
gathering an integral part
of your workflow.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.300
And in the end, you'll be glad
you did because it also will

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.550
serve your development time
because you have a much better

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.290
initial quality of
your product.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.620
So back to our example here.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.180
So now Helena and I, who went to
the conference, do a little

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.320
bit of research.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.420
We came back and we brought home
a bunch of interesting

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.800
things to look at, such as
printed materials, the

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.090
proceedings, and maps, and
whatever you get when you sign

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.910
into a conference.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.870
Then we would do some
interviews, possibly some

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.290
questionnaires.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.980
And then we would take pictures,
make observations,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.430
and see what people are
actually doing at a

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.290
conference.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.330
All this material, so it can
help you to get context and

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.820
get a better understanding
of what

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.090
conference goers needs are.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.230
So when we come back, we would
take all that information,

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.400
probably lock ourselves into
a room for a while.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.740
And then analyze, see what we
got up and see where the

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.580
morsels are that we can
use for our apps.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.440
So let's look at some
other things in

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.920
detail, such as here.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.440
The schedule master plan.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.020
Everybody has probably
seen one.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.580
So this gives you
an at a glance

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.640
overview of the sessions.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.870
And Helena actually also here
brought back a copy of a

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.590
schedule that a conference
goer has marked up.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.530
So the fact that they carry it
with them at all times and

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.570
refer to it often already
tells us that this is an

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.670
important item.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.890
So this is an individualized
item.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.070
Then we brought back a map.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.290
Which is, of course, helpful to
find your way around at a

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.435
conference, find restrooms,
exhibitions.

00:24:41.435 --> 00:24:44.010
And of course the session rooms
of the talks that you're

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.620
interested in.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.110
And I made an observation here
that sort of puts the maps in

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.890
context with the schedule
because users try

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.530
to keep them close.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.670
So those little clues can be
really important if you

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.060
construct an app.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.240
Next up, the detailed
daily schedule.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.610
This is basically, it gives
you more the detailed

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.960
information about a
particular talk.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.300
Who's speaking.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.920
What it's about.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.790
And Helena here explains how the
session details really fit

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.570
into the user's workflow for

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.250
establishing a personal schedule.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.740
People at conferences need
to share information.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.430
Of course, communication sharing
won't quite look like

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.770
this on an electronic device,
but we can basically register

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:35.530
the user need.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.320
People like to talk to
each other, exchange

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.210
information, share.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.460
So that is something that
we want to support

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.440
in the app as well.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.950
And then the questionnaire here
crystallizes our social

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.410
and organizational goal.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.960
Another good clue for supporting
some sort of

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.610
sharing in our app to allow
people to tell other people

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.980
what sessions they're
going to.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.580
Now interviews and general
observations are great because

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.980
they basically allow you to make
accidental discoveries.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.360
Things you maybe you haven't
even planned for.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.560
Sometimes you think, well,
we're going to collect

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.090
information about this
topic and that topic.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.090
But if you talk to people, if
you observe them, you make

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.320
those really nice accidental
observations.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.240
And in this case, it seems like
users need a helping hand

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:31.130
to be reminded of some of the
schedules and stay organized.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.150
So with all of that information
in hand, we're

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.070
pretty well-equipped to sort
of formulate the tactical

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.420
goals that serve our
app's purpose.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.290
Since our research uncovered a
lot of communication sharing

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.100
topics, we're sort of extending
the goal a little

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.070
bit to say a socially connected
conference guide.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.220
So that is now part of
our elevator speech.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.170
To organize the goals a little
bit, we divide them up into

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.520
different buckets-- before,
during, and after.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.230
Before is mostly
planning goals.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.370
Some of those goals will carry
over into the during phase.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.470
But the during phase is mostly
about personal organization

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.670
and communication.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:19.230
We want to always also service
the after-conference aspect a

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.960
little bit by allowing you to
see a session recap so that

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.040
you don't have to bring home
the fat proceedings.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.206
And also sort of share what you
felt I/O was like for you.

00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:35.900
But clearly the need for a
conference guide is the before

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.410
and during phase.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.660
So in our airport analogy we
said that a building's purpose

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.120
drives the user's expectation
of functional places.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.730
And translated to our app, that
really means that our

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.040
app's purpose as a conference
guide shapes a user's

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.690
expectation of certain familiar

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.050
things to be available.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.410
And we just collected some of
those familiar things that

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:04.380
people will like to see in an
app and feel familiar when

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.300
they see it.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.970
So let's see how the real world
artifacts we collected

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.290
match up to our goals.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.290
So the schedule master plan,
that's the individual plan.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.200
Conference, explore the program,
find interesting

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.390
sessions, and stay organized.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.870
So all of those organizational
things.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.270
The map allows me to find my
way around the conference.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.810
The session details let
me read about the

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.540
detail of the sessions.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:39.150
And the bulletin board is sort
of the collection item, if you

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.930
so want, for all the
communication needs that

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.230
people have at conferences.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.950
So we said that real life
objects can be indicative of

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.260
expected places for users.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.010
And those objects that we just
talked about, they have proven

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.540
valuable many times over
at conferences.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.160
And reusing them in some shape
or form in our app will make

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.826
users feel like they're looking
at something familiar.

00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:08.680
But how should those
important places be

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.510
represented on an app?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.560
How should the UI for the
bulletin board, for example,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.332
look like on an app?

00:29:18.332 --> 00:29:22.130
Would that be the best idea?

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.760
If you think about it, physical
objects were really

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.950
designed for the physical world
and therefore play by

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.600
slightly different rules than
objects on your phone.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.480
Applying real world object to
the virtual world can give you

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.070
a lot of headaches if you're
approaching it too literally.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.820
Simply doing a one-on-one port
of our bulletin board UI to

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.580
the phone where the only things
you can do is sort of

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.840
add and remove little snippets
of information within a

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.500
restrictive place, would
obviously simply

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.530
not be a good idea.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.560
Because the content is hard
to scan on the phone.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.250
You probably would have to zoom
in and out all the time.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.310
You never know when new stuff,
for example, pops up.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.910
You have a really inflexible,
finite layout.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.240
And you probably-- because of
that-- you probably have

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.520
multiple layers and content
might overlap.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.790
So doing a literal translation
here would simply not work.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.160
So you should really spend some
time if you have those

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.910
real life artifacts that you've
collected in the real

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.840
world and translate them
into the virtual world.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.360
Think about, of course, for
example, how you want your

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.770
objects to be recognizable
but you want them to be

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.730
supercharged versions of
the real life objects.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.450
Let's look at some examples of
how you can convert real life

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.996
objects to virtual ones for
the purpose of our app.

00:30:53.996 --> 00:30:58.190
So for example, if you look at
the schedule master plan that

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.170
already visited, visitors mainly
use it for exploring

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.560
what sessions are available.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.700
So sort of a mini database
for the conference.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.570
But they also use it for

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.880
establishing a personal schedule.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.160
The personal schedule out of the
multitude of events, that

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.050
is very similar to what the
agenda is doing on the phone

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.970
or in the Android calendar,
for example.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.050
You're going to have an at a
glance view of your day.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.010
You can add and remove things.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.680
So that sounds really a
model that works for a

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.620
personalized schedule.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.460
Then translating the master
schedule to an agenda and a

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.260
separate program object really
matches well with our goals.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:48.470
It allows us to have a
personalized schedule and to

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:54.040
program of the database that
we want to access while we

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.480
search for things by time, by
place, or by [? trek. ?]

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.010
Then the conference map, of
course, has a strong analogy

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.800
to something like the Google
Maps app on Android.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.395
So we basically know what
the interactions

00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:08.900
here should look like.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.470
So you can pinch to zoom.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.400
You can explore the content in
certain significant places by

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.230
clicking on the pins
and so forth.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:21.070
And since we already have an
agenda and sort of a session

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.580
browse object, the only thing
that we're missing is a place

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.190
where users can learn
about the details.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.280
So that is sort of the same
as the details schedule.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.650
So this is also a good place
to address two of our

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:40.950
remaining goals, that is of
sharing and viewing the

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.900
session recap.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.260
So that's also useful object.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.210
Of course for communication
the modern analogy of a

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.270
bulletin board is sort of a
feed or stream where users

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:01.740
that know about the name
of a feed can post to

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.200
it, replied to it.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.780
You can get to know people that
way, add them to your

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.410
phone book and so forth.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:15.050
So now that we have all those
objects defined and we know

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.740
that they're going to be useful
in some shape or form,

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.830
it makes sense to get an
overview of what the

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.110
functional relationships
between those are.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.730
So what you can do is you can,
for example, write down the

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.180
objects that you collected, that
you transferred into the

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.740
virtual world.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.750
And--

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.280
oops.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.950
There we go.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:43.020
And add what the content of
those objects will be like.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.730
For example, agenda here
consists of a timeline--

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.950
sessions and other events.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:55.590
So that already gives you an
approximation of what the

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.170
content of that screen
will be.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.640
Second off, you can
add actions.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.670
And these are now actions that
you can invoke on the object

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.860
but that don't take you
away from the object.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.409
And as a third step, you can
add a navigation path.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:16.389
So basically functions that take
you from one object to

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:20.960
another object and the name of
the function that basically

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.780
collects the two.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.750
So this can be a really useful
exercise for you to sort of

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.420
get a first overview at how
complex your app is going to

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.360
be and how everything
hangs together.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.310
So now let's get to
the next step.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:42.780
We spent about half an hour
of the talk already.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.710
And I haven't drawn
a single screen.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:49.239
And that goes to show that the
design, the foundation of the

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.739
design often isn't about
drawing screens.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.110
It's about collecting
information.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.710
But now we're at a point
where we want to start

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.810
drawing some screens.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.940
And with that, I hand
it over to Rachel.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.990
RACHEL GARB: Thanks, Jens.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.330
OK.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.530
So let's design some screens.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.120
We usually recommend starting
with the top level screen.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.220
Now why?

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.440
It's where users' first
impressions are formed.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.170
It orients users to what
the app can do and

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.380
how they get around.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.990
And in many apps it's going to
be the place where users spend

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.750
the most time.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.860
So this really is a make
or break screen.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.250
So let's continue to use the
I/O app as an example, and

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.760
we'll take a stab at designing
the top level screen.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.460
I want to start by pondering
this question.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.310
What should be the hero
of the screen?

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.460
And what I mean by that, what
will help users accomplish

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.220
their most important tasks in
the shortest amount of time?

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.970
What will make them conquer
the challenges

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:44.855
of attending I/O?

00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:46.860
What will save the day?

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.630
If you're not into the hero
analogy, there are other ways

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.880
to phrase this question.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.540
Want to throw out some ideas?

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.696
NATE STREU: Top dog.

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:56.055
JENS NAGEL: The big cheese.

00:35:56.055 --> 00:35:56.850
RACHEL GARB: Yeah.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.640
Cool.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.770
So all of the research and
thinking that Jens walked us

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.050
through so far is going
to help us figure out

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.410
what the hero is.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.380
Now as we learned, normally at
conferences like this people

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.260
get a program and they go
through it page by page and

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.420
they circle things that
look interesting.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.810
And then if they get a master
schedule, they then transfer

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.220
those circles to the master
schedule and they carry it

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.860
with them wherever they go.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.130
So that's pretty powerful
right there.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.950
This is their personal agenda.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:30.060
And it aids them in planning and
attending the conference.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.660
It's very time-critical
information and it needs to be

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.650
at the surface.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:40.390
So let's make the agenda the
hero of our top level screen.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.640
Now let's sketch out very
roughly how that could look on

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.950
a phone and a tablet.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.600
I like to start with
the action bar.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.810
It's already in place
there, as you see.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.720
Let's put in some branding.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.040
And plan for an action
overflow.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.840
This is a place where we can
have a menu for secondary

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.780
actions that are not used so
often, like settings and help.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.710
And, of course, our
hero-- tada--

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.810
the agenda.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.250
But at the beginning, the agenda
will be mostly empty.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.960
So it's important that our top
level screen also provides a

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.340
way for users to find things
to fill up the agenda.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.100
There are two key ways
that conference

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.830
goers approach this.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.640
First, they would start with a
track like Android and see

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.300
what sessions are available.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.280
And then pick a few that
are interesting to

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.800
add to their agenda.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.930
Another way that they would do
it is to choose a time slot,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.460
see what sessions are available,
and pick one.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.790
Let's make sure that our top
level screen supports both.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.760
On a tablet, we have room to
add a menu of the various

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.610
tracks in a second column.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.180
On the phone, we don't
have that luxury.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.900
So let's have tabs.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.650
We can have one for the
agenda and another

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.370
for the tracks menu.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:01.050
Now when you are using tabs,
it's important that you think

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.380
of them as being the same
part of one screen.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.400
That's not two screens.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:05.920
It's one.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.820
So this is all still part of our
top level screen as far as

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.610
we're concerned.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.710
Now users can touch the track
that they want to get a list

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.770
of sessions.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:22.510
And, of course we know that
users also like to touch a

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.140
time slot to get a list
of offerings.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.590
So let's offer that too.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.710
Now if that's all we offer in
the top level screen, it'd be

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.880
way better than the old
paper method, right?

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.650
But we can do even better.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.750
After all, this is an

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.790
interactive conference program.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.320
So let's add some things here.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.420
How about search?

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.480
We could let users search the
program for a particular

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.050
keyword in sessions.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.110
This seems important enough
to put in the top level.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.040
Or in the action bar of
the top level menu.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.210
We could also give them one
touch access to a map of the

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.660
conference screen.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.910
One way we could do that is to
have another button in the

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.150
action bar.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:07.200
Or another way we could do it
is to have a button in the

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.980
explore menu, which is what
you see in the final app.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.860
And since conference have become
popular venues for

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.780
heavy social networking
activity, why don't we give

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.170
that some prominence on the
top level screen too?

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.380
Now I could go on, but I
think you get the idea.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.700
You start with the most basic
goal and place the objects and

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.540
actions that relate to it.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.220
Next you figure out what other
objects and actions might be

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.010
nice to have on the screen.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.750
Or at least accessible
from it.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.220
And you work those in too.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:42.500
OK.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.490
Next, let's talk a little bit
about lower level screens.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.190
They serve various purposes.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.790
And here are a few examples
of the role that they can

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.090
play in your app.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.290
One thing they can let you do
is drill deeper into data.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:01.800
For example, browsing a photo
album in the gallery.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.220
Another thing they can't let you
do is edit data, like when

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.310
you're composing a
message in Gmail.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.820
And another thing they can let
you do is consume data.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.000
For example, reading a book.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.150
Let's work on a lower level
screen in the I/O app.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.310
In this case, let's work on the
screen that appears when

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.800
you touch a time slot.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.170
This is an example of drilling
deeper into data.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:34.090
So I like to start by giving the
screen a title so that it

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.390
conveys a purpose and
a sense of place.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:41.270
The user is going to get here
by touching a time slot in

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:45.390
main level or the top level
screen and then arrive here

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.170
and expect to see a
list of sessions.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.960
So it kind of makes sense that
the date and time would be a

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.240
good title.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.110
But it's not just a time slot.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.170
It's a time slot at the
I/O conference.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.020
Carry your brand name
throughout your app.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.340
It's another way that you can
establish a sense of place.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.200
Now did you notice that we're
using a smaller logo here than

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.950
we did on the top
level screen?

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.890
We're doing that because we
have a longer label and we

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.440
have other actions that
we're eventually

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.510
going to want to place.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.070
This will give us more
room for that.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.830
Next, let's bring in the hero
of the screen, which is the

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.080
list of sessions in
the time slot.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.430
Users will be able to touch one
to get session details.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.100
Now you can imagine that users
will probably alternate a lot

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.860
between viewing the list
of sessions and

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.760
reading session details.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.210
I call this pogo sticking.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.100
And on the tablet, because we
have more space, we may be

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.680
able to cut down on that
pogo sticking.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.770
So let's see if we can make use
of the space by having two

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.870
panes where the user selects a
time slot on the left and sees

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.570
details on the right.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:59.400
In the actual app, Roman did a
twist on the two pane layout

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.700
where you see a portion of the
details pane just kind of

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.340
peeking out until you
select a session.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.980
And then the details
takes over.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.240
Now either of these approaches
are great for combining two

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.870
levels of hierarchy on
larger screen sizes.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.730
But the phone doesn't have space
for a second column.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.675
So we'll eventually need to
design a separate screen for

00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:22.060
session details.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.340
So at this point, the tablet
lets users see what sessions

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.990
are available and
details for the

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.740
currently selected session.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.710
But we also need to let them add
a session to their agenda.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.600
So let's add a way to do
that on the tablet.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.920
One way we could do it is to
have a button as part of the

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.230
session info.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.770
Another way we could do it would
be to have an icon in

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.466
the action bar, like you
see in the actual app.

00:42:44.466 --> 00:42:48.060
So now the screen fulfills
its entire goal.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.580
But there's one more important
thing left to do.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.770
Because this is a lower level
screen, include an up arrow.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:00.060
It's the standard way in Android
to enable navigating

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.440
up the hierarchy.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.650
Now this is different than
the system back key.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.980
That's for historical
navigation.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.820
As Matias mentioned, a few of
our colleagues will be digging

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.440
deeper into the topic of
navigation and Android in this

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.590
room today at 11:30, and
we hope you'll attend.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:16.850
OK.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.010
Now the screen fulfills
its goal.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.100
It uses a standard convention
for navigating up.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.370
The next step is to decide if
we want anything else, to

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.600
offer any other objects or
actions on the screen.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.630
For example, it would be nice
to bring up a map to the

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.690
location of your session or
share details of the session

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.960
with your favorite network.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.390
So that's an example of
a lower level screen.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.940
And you can repeat this process
for all the screens in

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.870
your app to build up your
full set of sketches.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.910
Now the sketches you just saw,
which we call wire frames,

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.250
they didn't require any special
artistic ability or

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.800
design training to create.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.370
It's really all about drawing
shapes and text and arranging

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.420
them into defined areas.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.415
And you don't need any
specialized tools.

00:44:04.415 --> 00:44:06.350
The Android designers
all have different

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.750
ways of wire framing.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.110
I use a tool called OmniGraffle
for the Mac.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:13.050
And Jens uses Adobe
Illustrator.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.680
And other folks on the team
prefer paper and pencil, like

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.070
Nate over here.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.410
NATE STREU: All right.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.820
That's a lot of stuff.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.520
And great, great information.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.430
So what's the next thing
we can do here?

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:31.040
And I think one of those things
is bringing these wire

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:31.930
frames to life.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.540
And one of the easiest ways to
get started, whether you're

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.530
one of those app army of one or
you're a dedicated visual

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:43.440
designer on a larger team, is
to spend time on the Android

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.290
design site because it's rich
in tools that help you get

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:51.440
started and will continue to
update as we go along.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.640
Rachel mentioned earlier one
of the most important

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.350
resources to be considering is
the building blocks section.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.460
And as we mentioned, it's made
up of Android's ready to use

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.950
system and framework elements
like tabs or

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.400
buttons or text fields.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.870
And I can't stress enough the
importance of getting familiar

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.600
with these pieces as you
begin to craft your

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.650
scenes in higher fidelity.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.340
Fortunately, we've made it a
little easier to them to

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.120
practical use when applying
visual designs.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.800
The Android design site now
has downloadable building

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.690
block stencils and source files
for a variety of common

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.790
different software
applications.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.700
And the stencils will allow you
to quickly visualize your

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.620
app using real Android UI.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.720
And I'm going to go
into a little

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.330
detail about that later.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.640
The great thing is these things
are vector-based.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.360
So it's easy to scale for
multiple resolutions or

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.510
customize things like colors and
fonts should you choose.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.220
And anyone with a working
knowledge of Photoshop or

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.280
Illustrator or Fireworks will
find it a breeze to put these

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.020
stencils to good use.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:01.030
I also want to note that the
download section also includes

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.230
common system icons, color
swatches, and stunning Roboto

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.730
typeface that's used
throughout Android.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.620
I'd recommend you download
all of these tools.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.180
So next up, you're going to want
to target some specific

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.990
form factors for your hero
screen visual designs.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.380
As you all know, Android powers
millions of phones and

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:27.580
tablets, many with different
screen sizes and resolutions.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.070
And you'll want to support
as many of

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.200
those as you have time.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.180
And Rachael showed us how she
kept the phone and tablet

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.210
layouts in mind when
constructing the wire frames.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:40.590
You'll need to do the same when
applying visual design.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.590
And don't forget about
orientation.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.160
You want to make sure your
designs support both landscape

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.210
and portrait.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.940
But for the purpose of this
demo, let's keep it simple.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.790
We'll pick one.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.370
We'll go with the Galaxy Nexus
in a portrait orientation.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.380
OK.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:04.630
So at this point it's really
valuable to identify the key

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.880
screens and components that
you're going to need to mock

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.580
up in visual design.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.860
And while complex wire frames
may include a lot of screens,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.300
it's usually not necessary to
create pixel perfects for

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.640
every version.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.230
You want to pick the hero
screens that showcase the

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.860
app's core functionality.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.020
Usually it's a mix of top level
and lower level screens

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.306
in a variety of different
resolutions and orientations.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.850
So for our purposes, let's
focus on the top

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.440
level agenda view.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.650
Now here's a quick look at the
Photoshop stencils that are

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.560
available on the download.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.420
You should notice that they're
available for both

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.620
light and dark UIs.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.490
And this is done to support
system theming.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:53.120
And themes are Android's way
of applying a consistent

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.390
visual style across an
app or activity.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:00.140
Getting comfortable with these
themes will go a long way in

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.450
helping you build apps that
complement the general visual

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.700
language of Android.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:11.980
So you can choose from three
system themes when you're

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.490
starting to build your apps.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:17.185
Holo light, as you can see
here, leveraged in Gmail.

00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:20.120
And a variation, Holo light
with dark action bars.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.300
That's shown here in Talk.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.690
This is really good for when you
want a little more visual

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.970
differentiation between
the action bar

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.080
and the page content.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.930
And here's Holo dark,
which you can see in

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.580
the settings screen.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.030
So you want to make sure you
choose a theme that matches

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.140
the needs and design aesthetics
you're looking for.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.860
It's also worth mentioning
that if you want a more

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.040
distinct look, using one of
these themes as a starting

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.740
point for personal customization
is a great idea.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.360
In the case of the I/O app,
however, let's use the Holo

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.520
light variation with the
dark action bar.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.410
So we've identified
a key screen.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.720
We've picked a theme.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.290
Let's start laying out some of
the core building blocks of

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.360
the I/O app.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.740
I'm going to refer to Rachel's
wire frames as a guide to the

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:08.170
objects and actions that should
be included here.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.910
So I'm going to start with
mocking our hero agenda by

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:14.090
using the building blocks
from the stencil kit.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.320
I'm going to start with a blank
canvas, which happens to

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.720
be the default Holo
light background.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.270
And next I'm going to add some
global system elements that

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:25.390
frame your app such as
the status bar and

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.740
the navigation bar.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.790
And next, as Rachel mentioned,
the action bar is a huge part

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:32.920
of the Android UI.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:37.750
So let's add that to our canvas
from our stencil kit.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:41.280
So you want to notice that the
stencil kit comes pre-loaded

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:47.015
with the up indicator as well
as the action overflow.

00:49:47.015 --> 00:49:49.930
And these are very, very useful
since most of Android's

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:54.640
UI will leverage these
functions.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.390
And now with the action bar in
place, we've gotten not only

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.610
the most important structural
element to your app, but also

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.200
a great opportunity, as Rachel
mentioned, to brand

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.260
or title your page.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.150
So let's do that by adding
the I/O launcher

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.230
icon and page title.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.320
Because this is a top level
screen, I've removed the up

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.490
icon used in the lower
level screens.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.090
And while we're here, I want
to pay special attention to

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.810
talk a little more about the
importance of the launcher

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.565
icon within your app.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.110
So the launcher icon is usually
the first impression

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:32.970
the user will have with
your product.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.980
So it's important to have the
character of this icon reflect

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.800
the brand or the character that
you're hoping to achieve.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.060
It's used all over the place.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.060
It's used in the Play Store,
it's used on Android's

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.770
customizable home screen, and
also within your app.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.780
So it's really, really important
that your icon is

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.610
clearly legible on all
types of backgrounds.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.850
You're also going to want to
keep the metaphors simple when

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.640
doing your launcher icon.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.610
Overly complex icons look
great on really high

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:05.100
resolution, but they can really
scale poorly, resulting

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.450
in a loss of detail
and clarity.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:12.150
And not everybody is a visual
designer or a pixel

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:13.260
perfectionist.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.940
But a lot of users are going
to notice a poorly executed

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.270
launcher icon.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.200
And when they do, chances are
they think your app is too.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.970
So really pay attention
to this one.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:27.730
So next we're going to address
the most important actions

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.490
people take.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.720
And we saw this in Rachel's
wire frames.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.080
In this case, we're going to add
search and refresh to the

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.400
action bar in addition
to the overflow menu.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.150
If there's not enough room, as
Rachel mentioned earlier,

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:42.180
additional actions could also be
surfaced in a split action

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:46.640
bar or within that
action overflow.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.430
So as I mentioned earlier, the
design site provides downloads

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:55.610
for the common pre-defined icons
that you can use to mock

00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.410
up your UIs in both Holo light
and Holo dark themes.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.570
And it also includes some handy
implementation notes.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:06.160
We highly recommend you take
advantage of these.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.380
It's not only less work for you
guys, but it's also going

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.400
to have better continuity
with the system.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.160
And if these pre-canned icons
don't meet your needs, the

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.000
design guide also has detailed
specs for creating your own

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.870
under iconography in
the style section.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:24.110
All right.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.110
So back to our I/O app.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.440
Next I'm going to throw in some
tabs from the stencils

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.590
for navigation between
our top level views.

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:36.450
And because the agenda view is
really, really similar to a

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.590
standard framework list
view, we'll grab

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:39.840
that from the stencil.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.780
In this case, I'm using a
two-line Holo light list.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.860
Note that the templates also
include common list elements

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.870
such as section dividers--

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.330
which will be perfect
for breaking our

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.390
agenda up into days--

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:58.930
list action icons, and default
contact avatars.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:02.110
So for our purposes, I'm going
to remove the last couple of

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.170
bits, though that avatar could
come handy if we were mocking

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:06.420
up the social stream.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.440
And like that, in a few quick
steps you can bring your

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.170
sketches and wire
frames to life.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:17.630
It's really that easy.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.900
And by following our design
guide and using the resource

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.090
we've put at your fingertips,
you can quickly visualize a UI

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:29.170
that not only meets its
functional purposes, but also

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.480
begins to approach
app Nirvana.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.570
So why stop here?

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.250
Let's look at some of the ways
customizing the building

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.770
blocks can apply to our I/O app
and help take it to that

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.360
next level.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.100
Great place to start with
the actual bar again.

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.650
So I've gone a little
darker and applied a

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.680
subtle pattern to it.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.080
And I've also injected a little
color what the tabs.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.530
You'll notice a difference the
addition of color adds to the

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:00.250
dynamic of the page and visual
hierarchy in the objects on

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.510
the screen.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.750
The action bar recedes while
the top level tabs come

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.480
forward, giving you a clear
indication of where you are

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.270
and where you can go.

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:13.150
It also reinforces the
brand color used in

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.400
our launcher icon.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.420
So it would also help if our
agenda view not only had a

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.440
daily breakdown, but an
hourly break down.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.540
So using the stencil kit and
referencing the metrics and

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.250
grid section of the design
guide, it's simple to

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:34.330
visualize this customization
of a standard list view.

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:34.960
And there we have it.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.700
Something that resembles very,
very closely what the final

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.800
product looked like.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.560
So with just a few small
tweaks to our stencils,

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.080
referencing our wire frames,
we've succeeded in quickly

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.820
visualizing a functional and
differentiated app experience

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.140
very, very simply.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.080
It's also super easy to
visualize alternate approaches

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.640
by using these building
blocks.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.470
When doing custom work, pay
special attention to type and

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.210
iconography contrast
when you're

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.070
adjusting these UI elements.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.230
It's really important
that these

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.060
things are still legible.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.790
Now hopefully most of you guys
are staying in the room for

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.600
the next talk, which Matias
alluded to earlier called So

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.240
You've Read the Design
Guide, Now What?

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.830
This session is going to dive
a little deeper into some of

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.390
the things we discussed today
and give you more practical

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.980
strategies for applying fit
and finish to your app.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.700
We highly recommend
you check it out.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.260
And with that, I'm going to hand
it back over to Rachel.

00:55:39.662 --> 00:55:40.580
RACHEL GARB: OK.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.450
So we're at the end
of our talk now.

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:46.850
And if there's one message that
we want you to take away

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:48.880
today, it's this.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.660
When it comes to creating
Android apps,

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.870
design is always doable.

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.690
So the key is to start at the
bottom of the pyramid and work

00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:58.690
your way up.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.810
Your target users, your purpose,
and the Android

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.060
design guide will help
you along the way.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.890
Good luck and thank you.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:14.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:14.322 --> 00:56:17.810
RACHEL GARB: And now we'd like
to invite Matias and Roman to

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:20.030
come up on the stage
and help us answer

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:21.280
some of your questions.

00:56:24.134 --> 00:56:25.601
MATIAS DUARTE: Come on
out in front, guys.

00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:26.580
RACHEL GARB: Yep.

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.230
MATIAS DUARTE: Thank
you, thank you.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:31.100
So we have a few minutes
for a few questions.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.210
We've got some mics in the
center if folks want to ask.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:35.690
Or you could raise your hand.

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:37.890
Or we could just stand
here and look pretty.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.459
One question in the front.

00:56:39.459 --> 00:56:42.882
AUDIENCE: Do you guys have a
download pack [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:42.882 --> 00:56:45.327
I don't know if it's changed
yet, but all of the

00:56:45.327 --> 00:56:46.577
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:50.706 --> 00:56:51.920
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh,
the asset names.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.230
OK, so the question was about
the naming of the assets in

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.720
the download pack of icons.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.810
And what's the answer to that?

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:04.130
NATE STREU: The answer should
be that we will update those

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.590
so it's easier for
you to do that.

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:09.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.006
NATE STREU: We'll
see about that.

00:57:11.006 --> 00:57:12.434
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:12.434 --> 00:57:14.550
MATIAS DUARTE: OK, thank you.

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:14.810
Yes?

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:15.883
Next question.

00:57:15.883 --> 00:57:19.022
AUDIENCE: When can we expect to
see anything on the design

00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:20.713
site fly in menu?

00:57:20.713 --> 00:57:21.860
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh,
fly in menu.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.675
You mean the pattern that you
see in the Google+ app?

00:57:24.675 --> 00:57:25.397
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:25.397 --> 00:57:26.331
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:26.331 --> 00:57:28.900
MATIAS DUARTE: Well, just like
our products we don't like to

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.200
pre-announce anything
for the style guide.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.010
But, yes.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.940
Just for you I will answer that
we are working on updates

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.875
for the style guide for
that pattern as well.

00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:40.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:41.946
MATIAS DUARTE: All right.

00:57:44.778 --> 00:57:45.722
NATE STREU: We got a--

00:57:45.722 --> 00:57:46.580
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh, OK.

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.340
Audience question.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.610
AUDIENCE: Most of the times as
developers, we try to follow

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.800
the design guidelines
that you've given.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.640
But when we are working for
somebody else and a customer

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.150
asks us to create rich
application.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:03.330
And when we show this design
guideline, they say, we want

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.600
to follow another device and
we want to mimic the same

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.670
experience on both devices.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.770
So how to answer that?

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:11.660
MATIAS DUARTE: Right.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.910
So that's an excellent
question.

00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.880
As a brand or as a company you
want to build a consistent

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.030
identity across all the
platforms that you build on.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.450
But at the same time, you want
users to be delighted and

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.830
successful in the platform
that they're on.

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:30.040
We actually have a specific
section in design guide that

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.710
shows how to translate some
of those elements.

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:35.690
And so if you're dealing with
a customer or a manager who

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:38.270
doesn't understand that, that's
a good place to start.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.310
The biggest principle to keep
in mind is the design

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:42.380
guide is just that.

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.150
It's a guide.

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:46.440
It's actually intended to be
very flexible with regards to

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.580
your branding.

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.920
In fact, I'd invite you to
come to the Playing with

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.510
Patterns session at the end
of the day to see very

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.300
practically how people adapt
the design guideline while

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:59.320
still maintain the integrity
of their own app.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.000
The reason why you want to
follow the design guide for

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.960
all of the important principles
is that you may

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.830
feel really good about having
consistency across all these

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.540
different platforms,
but a user is

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.970
only using one platform.

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:12.640
Maybe two.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.910
The desktop and their device.

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:15.780
And the desktop experience and
their device are going to be

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.910
completely different.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.440
If the experience on the device
is different than what

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.840
they expect, they're actually
going to have a worse time.

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.650
That's a competitive
disadvantage.

00:59:23.650 --> 00:59:26.290
If you have a competitor that
is actually hewing closer to

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.790
the design guide in terms of
metrics, contrast, even simple

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:33.140
expected things like are our
tabs at the top or the bottom,

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.840
your competitor all of a sudden
has an advantage.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.792
And that's really the key
point I would stress.

00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:40.470
AUDIENCE: And one
more question.

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:41.350
MATIAS DUARTE: OK.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:44.550
AUDIENCE: With few of the
latest apps, you started

00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:48.600
introducing navigation elements
on the bottom.

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.540
That never used to be a
standard in earlier--

00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:55.170
like now you have a search bar
and you have more navigation

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.470
elements right above the--

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.410
MATIAS DUARTE: With Ice Cream
Sandwich we introduced the

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:02.010
split action bar that allows
you to put actions from the

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:05.990
action bar at the bottom of the
screen to basically enable

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.920
us to do things like small phone
layouts where you still

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.590
want to have a lot of contextual
header information

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:14.050
at the top, still have important
actions at your

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.190
fingertips, without creating
this layer cake stack at the

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.840
top of your app.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.820
That's not actually used
for navigations.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.070
Those are really used for
actions themselves.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:23.925
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:23.925 --> 01:00:24.630
Thank you.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:26.270
MATIAS DUARTE: Sure.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.320
All right, we've got
a line here.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.340
So let's see how many of them
we can get through.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.185
AUDIENCE: Based on the look and
feel of the UI elements of

01:00:34.185 --> 01:00:36.810
these design guidelines, it
appears to me that these are

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.660
specifically for native apps.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.320
How do these design guidelines
apply to mobile web apps and

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.530
hybrid apps?

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:48.200
MATIAS DUARTE: Well, they are
the Android design guidelines.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.646
Do you want talk to?

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.095
NATE STREU: Go ahead.

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:51.615
MATIAS DUARTE: OK.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:51.740
I'll take it.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:51.830
All right.

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:52.620
I'm taking this one.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:58.500
So I think web apps obviously
have the incredible power of

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.100
being deployed on multiple
platforms.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.790
But just like any app that is
trying to be deployed on

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.850
multiple platforms, it wants
to be quite as native as

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:09.620
possible for the exact same
reason of the last question.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.650
I think those you have to be
a little bit more careful.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:16.080
But things like using basic
metrics and using enough of

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.660
the contrast and typography
conventions are going to make

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.390
your web apps fit into
the rest of the

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:22.275
Android native app world.

01:01:22.275 --> 01:01:23.594
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:23.594 --> 01:01:24.420
MATIAS DUARTE: All right.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.760
It looks like we have time for
one last question and then

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.102
we'll sign off.

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.670
AUDIENCE: That's me, probably.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:30.477
MATIAS DUARTE: That's you.

01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:30.770
Go ahead.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.250
I don't see any other hands.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:36.080
AUDIENCE: My question for you,
how much time do you spend on

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.900
the design part?

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.170
What's the ratio between
design and development?

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.830
And at what time did Roman came
in doing the development?

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.540
MATIAS DUARTE: I feel like I
need to have other people

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.005
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:51.005 --> 01:01:51.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:53.540
ROMAN NURIK: So the funny thing
about Google I/O is that

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.020
it's a three-day conference.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.180
So you can't really spend
a long, long, long time

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.140
designing and developing
something for a three-day

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.260
conference.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.190
So actually, the design
and development took

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.330
about two or so months.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.890
And it was an integrated
effort.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:09.910
A lot of people were involved.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.260
So it wasn't really designed
and then developed.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:16.720
It was really an iteration cycle
over about a few months.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.030
MATIAS DUARTE: I'd like
to say one last

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:18.970
thing to close on that.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.460
First off, that's a great
example about how design is

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.680
always doable, even
if you have a

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.610
very, very short timeline.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.240
And also a great example about
how using the standard Android

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.390
framework elements and the
design guide can make your app

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.460
development much faster.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.200
Because you're not reinventing
the wheel.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.570
But the other point that Roman
made is also critical.

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.530
Design and development is
not a waterfall process.

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:39.720
It's iterative.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.900
You want to get broad
strokes sketched in.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.190
Think of design like progressive
JPEG decoding.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.320
You want get the light and the
dark parts really blurry

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.220
first, make sure you're not
making any critical mistakes,

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.976
and then keep refining
quickly.

01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:54.832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:56.365
MATIAS DUARTE: I think we're
cutting you off.

01:02:56.365 --> 01:02:57.446
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:57.446 --> 01:03:00.230
MATIAS DUARTE: Come join
us for drinks later.

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.710
All right, well thank you
very much everybody.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.900
And thank you to
the presenters.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.450
[APPLAUSE]
