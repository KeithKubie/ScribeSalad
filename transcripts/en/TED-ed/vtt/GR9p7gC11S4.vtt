00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.219
I'm going to take you on a journey

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.380
into some hidden worlds inside your own body

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.092
using the scanning electron microscope.

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:25.833
These microscopes use a beam of electrons

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:28.495
to illuminate things that are too small

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:32.179
to be seen by the photons of visible light.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.138
And to put this in context,

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:37.125
if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.141
into a thousand parts,

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.786
each one of those parts is a micrometer,

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.632
or micron for short.

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:45.387
If you then divide one micron

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:47.385
into another thousand parts,

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.762
each one of those is a nanometer.

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.496
And it's nanometers and microns

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:52.848
that are the domain

00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:56.008
of the scanning electron microscope.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.861
So, let's start with something on the body

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:03.196
that we can measure at about 100 microns wide,

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.863
and that would be a human hair,

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:08.999
which now you can see is covered with scales,

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:10.545
just like all of our hairs,

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:15.306
and in fact, just like all mammal hairs.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.591
We're going to plunge into the body now,

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.220
and we've landed in the thyroid gland.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.656
Here we're looking at proteins

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.723
that are being secreted into a storage chamber

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:28.397
where they are going to develop

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:30.891
into the mature thyroid hormones

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.106
before being released into the body.

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:34.885
And at this point you might be wondering

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.405
if these colors are real.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:37.878
The answer is no.

00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:41.109
Electron images only happen in black and white.

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.212
I often colorize my images for various reasons,

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:46.395
but I don't change the structures,

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.480
so the strucutres that you're seeing

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.714
are all exactly as they were

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:53.989
when I photographed them in the microscope.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.330
We're going to take a detour

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.691
and zoom in on the heart muscle now.

00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.489
And the heart muscle has this curious structure

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.092
that's kind of like corrugated cardboard.

00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:07.957
That's what allows the heart to expand and contract as it's beating.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.398
Let's go look at a lung with pneumonia.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.972
Here we've got a white blood cell

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:15.834
poking around in an air sac,

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.036
looking for something to clean out

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:19.890
like a little vacuum cleaner.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.324
This is your immune systems at work.

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:24.699
So what are the kinds of things

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.873
that we don't want to be breathing,

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:29.791
besides bacteria and viruses?

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.729
Well, we all know to stay away from asbestos

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.217
and now we can see why.

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:36.900
This is a close-up view of the mineral

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.059
that asbestos is made from,

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.847
and now you can see that it's composed of

00:02:41.847 --> 00:02:43.863
many tiny, fine little needles.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.943
Each one of those needles is a single crystal.

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:49.830
And in this picture, they're begininng to pry apart

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.050
and tangle up into a spiky mess,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.288
not for breathing.

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.355
What else might we want to avoid breathing?

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:01.555
Well, how about diesel fuel?

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:05.818
We're looking here at the particles of diesel soot,

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:08.459
and these are extraordinarily tiny.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.525
In fact, each one of these little particles

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.695
is only about 50 nanometers wide.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.776
We'll go and look at some blood now.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:21.553
We've got a collection

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:25.928
of nice, fat, happy, healthy red blood cells,

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.238
but they're all tangled up in a network of fibers.

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:31.983
This is how the body makes a blood clot.

00:03:31.983 --> 00:03:36.505
And so, it surrounds a group of red blood cells

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.303
and other cells, and traps them

00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:41.136
so the blood can't flow.

00:03:42.582 --> 00:03:44.647
We've got two more blood cells here,

00:03:44.647 --> 00:03:46.048
but they're not normal

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:48.599
like the ones in the blood clot image.

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.159
These are distorted.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.320
You can see that they're curling up

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.944
and beginning to grow what's going to become spikes.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.329
These are sickle cells

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.777
and these are what cause the condition

00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:03.445
of sickle cell amenia.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:05.890
We've gone into the mouth now

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.555
and we've landed on dental plague,

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:12.299
which you can see is covered with bacteria,

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.236
and in fact dental plague is host

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:18.476
to about 1,000 different species of bacteria.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:20.426
Lovely to think about.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.338
And now we are on to other teeth.

00:04:24.338 --> 00:04:25.798
We're on the surfaces of the,

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:28.541
or the internal surfaces of the teeth themselves.

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:33.323
The smaller one is a baby tooth

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:35.456
that had just fallen out of the mouth

00:04:35.456 --> 00:04:37.147
of a young friend of mine,

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.815
and I want to call your attention to the little holes.

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.905
Those little holes are the tops

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:45.136
of a whole network of tiny little tubes

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:49.051
that circulate nourishing fluids inside your teeth.

00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:50.097
And we can see those tubes

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:52.349
a little better in the larger picture

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.193
because some of them are in cross-section.

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:58.852
But in fact, this larger picture is showing you

00:04:58.852 --> 00:05:02.311
a portion of a tusk, which you may know

00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:04.629
is simply a great big, elongated tooth,

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.908
so you would expect to see the same features

00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:10.427
between your teeth and a tusk.

00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:14.782
But that larger tusk picture is also rough

00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:17.121
by comparison to the young baby tooth.

00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:20.438
That's because it's many, many thousands of years old.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:22.691
It's also partly fossilized.

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.608
And, between these two pictures,

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:27.350
now you can see how your teeth relate

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.532
to the tusk of an Ice Age mammoth.

00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:34.697
We're shooting up north now into the brain,

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:40.339
and we can see these pink cells down at the bottom.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.958
Those are the neurons of memory.

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.982
And I'm going to leave you with this picture

00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:47.449
because I know you're going to take

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.050
a lot of happy memories away

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.089
from your exciting day at TED

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.398
and now you can visualize where those memories

00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:55.972
are being stored in your own brain.

00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:56.760
Thank you.
