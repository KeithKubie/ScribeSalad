00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.920
HOW DO YOU EVEN BEGIN TO ENGINEER A VOYAGE
AT SEA THAT COULD LAST FOR 7 MONTHS OR MORE?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.380
THE CREW ABOARD SEEKER NEEDED FUEL, SPECIALIZED BATTERY STORAGE,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.500
ALONG WITH ENOUGH FOOD AND FRESH WATER

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.880
FOR NINE PEOPLE 
AND ONE LONG-DISTANCE SWIMMER.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.079
THE CREW WORKED WITH CHIEF ENGINEER RASMUS
GORDON, WHO TOOK CHARGE OF EVERYTHING FROM

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.919
GENERATING WATER AND POWER, 
TO FUELING THE SHIP.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.020
Ras: When the ship was originally built, it
was built as a racing yacht, but that also

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.051
means they don’t go to sea for more than
a month at a time.

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.269
So we have extra fuel bladders added to the
ship to double the fuel capacity.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.239
We’re still depending on not having to use
the main engine a lot because that takes up

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.129
five times the amount of fuel as the generator.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.531
BUT WHEN STRONG WINDS AND CURRENTS PUSH THE
BOAT OFF-COURSE, SOMETIMES THE CREW HAS NO

00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:01.350
CHOICE BUT TO RELY ON THE MAIN ENGINE TO GET
BACK ON BEN’S LAST GPS COORDINATES.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.260
FOR ELECTRICITY ON THE BOAT, RASMUS RIGGED
A DUAL POWER SYSTEM.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.800
THE MAIN BATTERY BANK, POWERED BY SOLAR PANELS AND WIND GENERATORS, IS USED FOR

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.620
LIGHTING AND NON-ESSENTIAL ITEMS.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.460
A SMALLER BANK SUPPORTS THE NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT— A SAFETY PRECAUTION

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.880
IN CASE THE MAIN BANK SHOULD EVER FAIL.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.060
THESE BANKS ARE COMPOSED OF “AGM” BATTERIES,
WHERE THE ELECTROLYTE, THE CONDUCTIVE

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.500
MIXTURE OF WATER AND SULPHURIC ACID INSIDE, IS ABSORBED IN GLASS FIBER.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
THIS MEANS THESE BATTERIES ARE RESISTANT TO
CORROSION, SPILL PROOF, AND DON’T REQUIRE

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.440
VENTILATION—SO THEY ARE PERFECT FOR THE
ROUGH CONDITIONS ON SEEKER.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.060
ANOTHER MAJOR ENGINEERING CHALLENGE OF A LONG-TERM SEA VOYAGE

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.220
IS THE ABILITY TO MAKE FRESH WATER.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.040
Ras: We have two water makers so we always
have one backup if the other one fails, and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.530
we have a lot of spares for the water makers,
because that is our most important equipment.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.060
WHILE THE BOAT IS MOVING, THE WATER MAKERS
RUN SEA WATER THROUGH TWO FILTERS, REMOVING

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.560
ANY DEBRIS AND MICROPLASTICS.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.125
THE LIQUID THEN RUNS PARALLEL TO A REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANE,

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.360
CREATING FRESHWATER, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.800
FOR MORE THAN JUST DRINKING.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.480
Ras: The thing that really determines how
long we can be at sea is our fuel and food capacity.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.200
The fresh water is important because we need
it for the cooking,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.640
a lot of the cooking is gonna be freeze-dried food.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.920
When Ben finishes swimming he needs to have a fresh water shower to rinse all the salt off his body

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.980
to prevent any damages to his skin.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.700
PLANNING FOR THE FOOD ON BOARD WAS A WHOLE
OTHER STORY.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.360
Ty: We bought a lot of this fresh food stuff

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.520
but it gets really hot down below and together with the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.480
dampness and the heat is not good for preserving
the fresh food.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.210
Maks: Whoa whoa whoa!!

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.430
What is that?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.459
Ty: I don’t know, honestly I don’t know
but it’s coming out of these potatoes

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.880
Ty: We can all agree a potato doesn’t usually
look like that when you eat it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.840
Maria: Yeah, of course.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.940
Ty: But we’re going to eat it.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.310
We waste nothing.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.720
THOUGH THE CREW WERE ABLE TO HAVE FRESH VEGETABLES FOR THE FIRST MONTH AT SEA,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.980
THE BULK OF THEIR MEAL PLAN CENTERS ON USING CANNED AND

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.460
FREEZE-DRIED FOODS — COMBINED WITH BASES, LIKE

00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.310
PASTA AND RICE.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.510
AND IF THE CREW IS LUCKY, THEY ALSO MIGHT
HAVE THE OPTION OF FRESH FISH.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.160
Paul: Zero fish in 47 days, and 3 fish in
15 minutes.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.380
Maks: We measure and weigh the fish, for one
of the research protocols we're doing, and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.450
then we cut open the stomach, see if there's
any plastic inside the stomach.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.140
UNFORTUNATELY, THE CREW DID HAVE TO REMOVE
PLASTIC FROM THIS FISH.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.330
IT'S A PRIME EXAMPLE THAT UNDERSCORES JUST
HOW IMPORTANT RAISING AWARENESS FOR OCEAN

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.380
HEALTH IS, AND THAT ALL THIS CAREFUL PLANNING
IS WORTH IT.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.900
Maks: People always think ‘oh man you’re
going to be spending 7 months on a sailing boat?'

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.500
'That must be ****ing boring.’

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.409
Well it it sometimes repetitive, but there's so
much to do so it's never boring.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.800
I haven't been bored so far.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.840
AND WITH GOOD REASON — BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE
CREW CAN FEEL AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE, THERE

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.940
ARE CERTAINLY UNPREDICTABLE
CHALLENGES AHEAD.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.100
Maks: “The other night a storm caught us
by surprise, some of us got a little bit seasick.”

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.580
Ben: “I want the motion to just stop.”

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.819
“Ben there’s a shark!”
Ty: “Right there!

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.860
F me, see it?”

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
Paul: “So much drama!”
