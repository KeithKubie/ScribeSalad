00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.270
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're going to think about

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.530
marginal revenue and marginal cost

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.840
for a firm in an imperfectly
competitive market.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.160
But before we do that, I just
want to be able to review

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.080
and compare to what we already know

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.850
about a firm in a perfectly
competitive market.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.150
So right over here, we're
analyzing the firm's economics.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.780
This shows the marginal cost
as a function of quantity,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.530
and we've talked about this before.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.760
Oftentimes, it will trend down initially,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.640
as you have better specialization
and some efficiencies,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.340
and then it might start trending up,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.820
as there are just coordination costs

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.310
or other costs that make
the marginal cost go up.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.560
And we have talked about this notion that,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.560
in a perfectly competitive market,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.460
the firm is a price-taker.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.660
There's going to be some market price,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.530
let's call this P sub m,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.850
some price in the market

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.490
for the good that they are producing,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.310
and there's many producers
who are producing this good.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.310
And they're undifferentiated,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.890
and there's no barriers to entry.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.630
And so they just have to
be price-takers there.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.870
No matter how many units they produce,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.680
they're just going to be able
to get that same market price.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.320
So a firm in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.550
that market price defines
their marginal revenue curve.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.990
Their marginal revenue
curve will essentially

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.130
just be a horizontal line like this,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.310
and we've already studied
this in previous videos.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.380
And we talked about that here,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.450
if this firm was trying
to maximize its profit

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.590
and if it was rational, it
would produce the quantity

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520
where marginal cost is
equal to marginal revenue.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.200
So it would produce this
quantity right over here.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.650
But now let's think about how
things are a bit different

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.620
for a firm in an imperfectly
competitive market.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.670
In a previous video, we talked about how,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.250
in an imperfectly competitive market,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.850
there's some differentiation

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.620
amongst the various
players who are competing,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.260
and so their market price
is a function of quantity.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.150
If they just produce a
bunch of their product,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.050
the price that they get in the
market is likely to go down.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.030
So they will have their own
firm-specific demand curve.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.870
Maybe it looks something like this.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.310
So that is their demand curve.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.090
And we also saw in that
video that that demand curve,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510
essentially the price that
they could get at any quantity,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.900
that that's not going to be the same

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.180
as the marginal revenue curve.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.600
If the demand curve is
downward-sloping like that,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.810
the marginal revenue curve is likely

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.130
to be even more downward-sloping.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.450
So it's going to look something like this.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.560
That would be the marginal revenue curve.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.490
Now in this situation,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.100
what would be rational for the firm to do?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.900
Well, once again, it would
want to produce the quantity

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.600
where the marginal cost is
equal to the marginal revenue.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.650
So they would want to produce
this quantity right over here.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.660
But you see something interesting here.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.570
If they produce at this quantity,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.360
notice the price that
they can get in the market

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.050
is much higher than that.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.660
The price that they get in the market

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.880
is higher than the marginal cost

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.820
and the marginal revenue at that point.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.520
And because we see a situation

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.420
where price is greater
than your marginal cost,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.470
versus in a perfectly competitive market

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.060
where you see that price
is equal to marginal cost,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.670
that that is the optimal quantity,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.710
but because you have this gap,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.280
that people are willing to pay
more than that marginal cost.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.180
But you still aren't going to
be able to produce any more

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.500
because it doesn't make sense

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.340
from a marginal revenue point of view.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.280
This gap,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.810
the difference between the
price and the marginal cost

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.930
at this rational quantity for this firm

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.510
in an imperfectly competitive
market to produce,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.560
economists would refer to
this as an inefficiency,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.310
inefficiency.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.510
Folks are willing to pay
more than that marginal cost,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.140
but you still have no
motivation to produce more.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.350
Because if you produce more,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.720
even though the price is
higher than the marginal cost,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.140
your marginal revenue is going

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.890
to be below the marginal cost,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.670
and so you would be taking a hit

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.873
in aggregate on those extra units.
