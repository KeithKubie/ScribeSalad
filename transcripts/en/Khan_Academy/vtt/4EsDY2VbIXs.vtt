00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:02.424
- [Voiceover] Grammarians,
I would like to tell you

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.118
a tale of two elephants.

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:06.247
In order to get at the idea

00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:08.039
of this thing called the article.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.464
We'll explain what that
is after I tell you about

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:15.412
the elephant and an elephant.

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:22.378
Now articles are words
like "a" or "an" or "the".

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.965
Articles are a kind of adjective,

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.858
some people would call them a determiner,

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:32.449
that help you figure out
how important something is.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.724
Or how specific something is.

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:37.325
So, articles.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.735
What articles do is they tell you whether

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:42.510
or not something is specific.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.256
Are you thinking about any old elephant

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.650
when you talk about an elephant,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.424
or are you thinking about
one elephant in particular?

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:54.364
The elephant.

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:56.702
And this is the difference.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:58.385
When we're talking about the elephant

00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:00.483
we're talking about a specific elephant.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.597
We have particular one in mind.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:05.221
This what's called the definite.

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:09.052
Because it defines what
we're talking about.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:15.175
You know, this elephant could
be the queen of the elephants.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.511
Sometimes, when we make sentences

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:18.427
we want to aim for that kind of precision.

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:20.516
We want to be precise.

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:22.896
We want to know exactly what we're talking

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:25.172
and who we're talking about and why.

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:28.383
That's a case where you
would use the word "the".

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.109
Now if you're not being specific.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.092
If you're talking about any old elephant.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.322
An elephant that you're not
especially familiar with.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:39.993
An elephant you haven't introduced before.

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:43.486
You would say "an" elephant,

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.343
because it's not specific...

00:01:48.903 --> 00:01:50.999
and it's undefined.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.807
So, grammarians call that
an indefinite article.

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:02.156
When you know who and
what you are talking about

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.764
for sure you say "the".

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:07.555
And when you're not sure,
you say "a" or "an".

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:11.542
So if you knew you were talking
about a specific elephant.

00:02:12.512 --> 00:02:15.786
Say for example the
queen of the elephants.

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.806
The queen.

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:25.148
As indicated by her royal
crown, you would say "the".

00:02:25.148 --> 00:02:28.070
And if you were talking
about any old elephant?

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.070
You'd say "an". You'd use
the indefinite article.

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:35.442
We'll cover this more later.

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.149
I just wanted to give you an introduction

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.494
to the idea of what an article is.

00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:44.352
So "the" for specific, "a"
or "an" for nonspecific.

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:46.634
You can learn anything, David out.
