00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's say I'm hanging out with
my buddies one night and we

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.060
realize that there's a
huge opportunity in

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.435
selling socks online.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.210
And so we decide to
start a company.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.710
So the first thing we
would do is we would

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.160
write a business plan.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.590
And say, you know what?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.530
In this business plan writing
process, this is all we've all

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.400
contributed to it
individually.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.230
So we'll all be equal
shareholders.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.220
Let's say there's five
of us friends.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.570
So the first thing we want to
do is we want to start a--

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.080
well you know, you could do in
different orders, you could

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.920
just write up a business plan,
or you can start the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.620
corporation.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.800
But we'll just assume we
start a corporation.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.360
And I'm going to indicate the
corporation by creating a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.420
balance sheet right
from the get-go.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.370
So, what are the assets of the
corporation, and what are the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.720
debt-- and what are the
liabilities-- and we could

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.900
talk a little bit about what
a corporation even is.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.860
So it's asset to begin with.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.350
It's essentially just an idea.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.050
I mean, you could say it takes
physical form to some degree

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.040
in the business plan, but it's
just an idea first. And then,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.770
there are no immediate
liabilities, it doesn't owe

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.890
anybody any money.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.480
And we learned in the balance
sheet videos-- and you might

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.180
want to watch the balance sheet
videos as a prerequisite

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.050
to this one-- but in general,
assets are equal to

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.030
liabilities plus equity.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450
So this is assets.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.300
The only asset we have right
now is our idea.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.040
Maybe you want to add the
potential talent that we have,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.780
maybe unique skills.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.370
They are very intangible
at this point.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.680
These are the assets that our
five buddies have together.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.670
And we have no liabilities.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.490
It doesn't sound like we
borrowed money or anything.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.860
So everything we have-- so the
assets are equal to our

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.960
equity-- and I'll do that in a
brown color-- so there's no

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.520
liabilities and we
just have equity.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.390
And equity is essentially what
the owners of the company have

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.620
the rights to.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.250
For example, if-- I haven't
assigned any numbers here and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.360
I did that for a reason-- but if
the assets were $10 million

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.760
and liability was $5 million,
if we had owed $5 million to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.860
someone else, then you
would have $5 million

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.630
left for the equity.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.370
And that's what the owners of
the company would have.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.510
Me and my five buddies, or I
guess my four buddies, we

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.220
decide we're the owners of the
company, so we'll be equal

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.780
shareholders.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.130
So we would split the equity
between us five ways.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.300
So we just pick an
arbitrary number.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.220
Let's say to begin with we have
a million shares, so each

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.870
of us have 200,000 shares
in the company.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.340
And that's a bit of an
arbitrary notion.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.300
And you normally do assign some
value to those shares

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.450
initially, it's some pennies
per share, but I won't get

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.200
into the technicalities
of that.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.980
Just fair enough to say that we
each have 200,000 shares in

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.560
this company.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.000
And some of them go to me and
then the rest of them go to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.220
buddy one, buddy two, buddy
three, and buddy four.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.750
This is the equity right here.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.000
And there's a total of one
million shares outstanding.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.770
Good enough.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.740
Well, just an idea and some
paper and some well

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.020
intentioned individuals
alone isn't

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.300
enough to start a company.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.950
We're going to have to create
some type of an online

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.340
presence, and do some
programming, and maybe have a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.940
warehouse, and do
some marketing.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.900
So we're going to have to-- and
really we're going to have

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.250
to quit our jobs so that we can
work on this full time.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.500
So we're going to have
to raise some money.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.230
Money to hire some engineers, so
that we can quit our jobs.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.560
To hire some marketing people,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.120
So where do we get
our money from?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.530
So this is where the whole
venture capital world comes

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.140
into the picture.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.110
You've heard the word before.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.610
I think you have some
sense of what it is.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.230
And the venture capital world,
it's kind of separated into

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.505
different people who invest
in different stages.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.150
So you'll have people, they're
called angel investors.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.720
And sometimes these people won't
even call themselves

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.620
venture-- angel investors.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.540
And these are the guys that
are kind of these, I don't

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.480
want to stereotype it, but
they'll be kind of like the

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.250
old guys who made it big in
the `80s and now they're

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.140
sitting on billions
of dollars.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.550
And they want to participate
in the neat, fun ideas that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.880
young guys like me and
my friends think of.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.760
And so they're kind of like your
rich uncle who says, oh

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.560
that's a great idea, I'll throw
some money behind that.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.850
They usually invest at
a very early stage.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.090
So those are probably
the people

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.290
we would go to initially.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.840
And then we'll talk to the
people after that, the other

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.100
types of venture capitalists.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.080
But in general, venture
capital can

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.650
meet a lot of things.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.940
But it means someone who's
going to give you money.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.090
They're going to take a stake in
your company and hope that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.380
your-- they give you enough
money to kind of get your

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.170
venture going.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.240
To kind of start
your business.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.010
So let's say we go to an angel
investor, and we say hey,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.840
angel investor, don't you think
this is a great idea?

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.040
We're going to sell
socks online.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.630
You know, socks are something
people run out of every week,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.170
we can even do subscriptions
for socks.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.640
You get 10 pairs of month,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.550
You can give them as gifts.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.920
All of these lovely things.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.650
And the first nine guys slam
their doors on our face.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.570
They think our business
is stupid.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.960
But the tenth guy says, hey you
know, that's interesting.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.630
So we enter into negotiations.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.740
And he's like, you know what?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.850
I'm going to invest. But we have
to figure out what I'm

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.330
going to get in exchange for
investing in your company.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.480
How much of your company
I'm going to get.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.300
And so this leads to a
process of valuation.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.050
So let's say we say need $5
million from the angel

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.250
investor to get started.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.410
We need $5 million-- let me
write that down-- that's what

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.410
we say we need.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.680
And that's what the angel
investor says that he's

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.180
willing to give us,
because he agrees.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.960
$5 million, that's enough for us
to quit our jobs, and then

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.300
we could all take salaries
for some time.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.880
We could hire a bunch
of people.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.060
We can rent office spaces.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.710
Do everything you need to
do to start a company.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.320
And $5 million will support
that for, I don't

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.230
know, a year or two.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.760
I don't know, depending on how
many expenses we have.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.140
But the question is, what does
he get for that $5 million.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.830
So in order to come to that
conclusion, you have to

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.860
determine what is what we had
before he came to the picture

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.500
worth, right?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.980
Notice, when I did this balance
sheet I didn't even

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.250
write what these assets
are worth.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.050
What is this worth?

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.560
And this value, this is called
a-- well in general, whenever

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.345
you're valuing anything, it's
called a valuation.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.540
And since we want to know what
this is worth-- this is before

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.830
we got any kind of money from
investors-- this would be

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.260
called a pre-money valuation.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.120
And I'll show you why that
matters in a second.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.170
Because, if us and this angel
investor agree that this-- our

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.410
assets before we go to them--
are worth $5 million.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.180
So if we agree that they're
worth $5 million-- let me draw

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.020
that so, what color was
I doing that in?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.680
It was in yellow-- so if we
agree-- let me draw it a

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.820
little bit smaller-- essentially
it's just an idea,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.150
and then we have the shares,
a million shares.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.090
Of that million,
I have 200,000.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.460
The other 800,000 are
with my friends.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.990
These are one million shares
total, or shares outstanding.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.440
So if this idea-- we agree with
the angel investor-- if

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.470
we agree this is worth
$5 million.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.080
So everything we have today
is worth $5 million.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.720
Then when he gives us
another $5 million,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.600
that's an asset, right?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.890
We'll have $5 million in cash.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.850
So he'll give us another
$5 million.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.020
He'll essentially get
50% of the company.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.900
He'll get all of these
shares up here.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.850
Now how does that work out?

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.340
Well if you think about it,
this is the post-money

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.600
company, right?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.730
So let's think about
it a couple ways.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.060
This is $5 million.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.250
That's the idea.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.890
What is the $5 million worth?

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.110
That's not a trick question.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.020
That's worth $5 million,
right?

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.320
It's worth $5 million.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.365
So what is the post-money
valuation?

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:29.760
When we talk about valuation
we're talking about the value

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.250
of the assets, especially
because we're not dealing with

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.530
any debt right now.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.260
Everything on the right-hand
side is equity,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.190
so this is all equity.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.510
Let me write that, no
liabilities yet.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.580
And in general, when you're
doing a startup company, if I

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.310
want to start socksonline.com,
and I go into my local bank

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.070
and say, hey give me a
loan, they're just

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.910
going to turn me away.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.920
Because if you have a venture
that really doesn't exist yet

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.500
and has no cash flow, they know
that you're not going to

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.380
pay the interest on the debt, so
you're not going to even be

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.250
able to raise debt until you
are a more mature company.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.980
Or until you-- maybe you could
post some collateral.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.070
And I'll talk more about that.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.710
Maybe you could say hey,
I'll use my house.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.790
If I don't pay the debt, you
can take my house, or

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.280
something like that.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.580
But for the most part we
don't want to do that.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.430
So the only way to raise money
at this early stage is by

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.560
issuing equity.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.670
So going back to what we were
talking about, what is the

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.310
post-money valuation?

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.210
We said before any of this stuff
on the top existed, the

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:30.000
pre-money valuation of just
our idea was $5 million.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.680
Now, the angel investor, if we
value this at $5 million,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.350
he'll give us $5 million more.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.240
What is the total value of
all of the assets now?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.530
Well if we said this was $5
million, that's just something

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.860
we agreed with.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.760
This is worth $5 million.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.210
So the combined assets, if you
believe that this is worth $5

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.660
million, is now $10
million, right?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.410
And this would be the post-money
valuation.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.780
And if you think about it, if
you think about the company in

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.820
this form right now, we-- me
and my buddies-- we've

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.800
contributed half of the
value of the company.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.640
And this rich guy, he's
contributed the other half of

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.050
the company.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.200
So it makes sense that he
has 50% of the company.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.760
So how is that going to work?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.100
Well, I don't give away any of
my shares, and neither are any

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.070
of my friends.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.780
They're all going to
keep their shares.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.030
So we had five chunks of
$200,000 that went-- 200,000

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.930
shares that went
to each of us.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.780
All right, that was buddy
one, two, three, four.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.250
So what we'll do is, we'll
actually issue another million

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.920
shares and give it to
this rich dude.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.780
So this is another one
million shares.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.670
So as the company board, you
can actually authorize to

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.050
create shares.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.260
And that's what we did, and we
essentially sold those shares

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.500
for $5 million.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.730
So now instead of having one
million shares, you have two

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.160
million shares.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.150
So something interesting here,
and some people often talk

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.540
about the notion of
dilution, right?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.680
Because before, I had 200,000
out of a million shares.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.750
So before, I had 20%
of the company.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.330
And now what do I have?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.820
Well we've essentially doubled
the share count, so now I only

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.190
have 10% of the company.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.390
So some people say, oh you know
what, my share of the

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.950
company got diluted.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.000
But it really isn't the case,
because the company has gotten

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.020
all this cash.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.810
I now own 10% of something
that's twice as valuable, as

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.230
opposed to 20% of something
that's half as valuable.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.200
If you really believe
that, then this

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.480
was no change, right?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.250
I now own 10% of ten million,
which in theory should be

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.330
worth a million dollars.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.190
Before I owned 20% of five
million, which was also worth

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.380
a million dollars.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.910
So if you believe these
valuations, I

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.990
probably-- I'm neutral.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.890
And we're going to put this
$5 million to work.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.470
And actually let me take a
step-- actually no, I just

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.530
realized I'm out of time.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.360
Let me continue this
in the next video.
