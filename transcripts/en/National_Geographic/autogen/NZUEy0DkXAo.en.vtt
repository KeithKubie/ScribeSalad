the Cambridge University study conducted
 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.249
the Cambridge University study conducted
by dr. Joseph Tennant it was searching

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259
by dr. Joseph Tennant it was searching
 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.800
by dr. Joseph Tennant it was searching
for a connection between epilepsy and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810
for a connection between epilepsy and
 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.740
for a connection between epilepsy and
mystical experiences

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

that's the scan of the tumour that was

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579
that's the scan of the tumour that was

that's the scan of the tumour that was
the cause of the seizures I was having

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560
the cause of the seizures I was having
 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230
the cause of the seizures I was having
so I mean as you can see in this game

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
so I mean as you can see in this game
 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.940
so I mean as you can see in this game
the growth from the skull with the left

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
the growth from the skull with the left
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.620
the growth from the skull with the left
temporal lobe and so this is pushing up

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
temporal lobe and so this is pushing up
 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.240
temporal lobe and so this is pushing up
against the ins brain and so they had to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250
against the ins brain and so they had to
 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.160
against the ins brain and so they had to
cut all that section away but obviously

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
cut all that section away but obviously
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.359
cut all that section away but obviously
when you do that you lead a bit of

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369
when you do that you lead a bit of
 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.309
when you do that you lead a bit of
scarring on the left temporal lobe so it

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319
scarring on the left temporal lobe so it
 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.289
scarring on the left temporal lobe so it
seems something about the temporal lobe

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299
seems something about the temporal lobe
 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.050
seems something about the temporal lobe

spiritual experiences you have not come
to any sort of conclusions yet on it

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789
to any sort of conclusions yet on it

to any sort of conclusions yet on it
we can't induce a seizure on someone of

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099
we can't induce a seizure on someone of
 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.339
we can't induce a seizure on someone of
a mystical nature and hope that we can

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
a mystical nature and hope that we can
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.259
a mystical nature and hope that we can
get a good scan of it under an MRI we

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269
get a good scan of it under an MRI we
 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.160
get a good scan of it under an MRI we
don't know when the seizures are

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
don't know when the seizures are
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500
don't know when the seizures are
happening to come to some sort of

you think that there is a possibility

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
you think that there is a possibility
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.410
you think that there is a possibility
that they experienced this sort of

it is possible so there was a

it is possible so there was a
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080
it is possible so there was a
neurological paper that speculated that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
neurological paper that speculated that

Paul's vision on the road to Damascus

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010
Paul's vision on the road to Damascus
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.370
Paul's vision on the road to Damascus
was epilepsy but I mean so what

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
was epilepsy but I mean so what
 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.349
was epilepsy but I mean so what
because the thing that occurred

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359
because the thing that occurred
 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.030
because the thing that occurred
afterwards was Paul was moved to go

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
afterwards was Paul was moved to go

scientist I can't tell you whether these
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.210
scientist I can't tell you whether these
are metaphysical or not the thing we can

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
are metaphysical or not the thing we can
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.160
are metaphysical or not the thing we can
look at is to say that something in the

look at is to say that something in the
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.800
look at is to say that something in the
brain is capable of producing religious

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810
brain is capable of producing religious
 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.500
brain is capable of producing religious
experience and can do so even when it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
experience and can do so even when it's

$64 question how has it changed you well
 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.870
$64 question how has it changed you well
I think you know it did remove any sense

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880
I think you know it did remove any sense
 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.580
I think you know it did remove any sense
of that I had that the universe is a

of that I had that the universe is a
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.430
of that I had that the universe is a
meaningless cold place I think it gave a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440
meaningless cold place I think it gave a
 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.610
meaningless cold place I think it gave a
kind of foundation of meaning for me and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
kind of foundation of meaning for me and
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.650
kind of foundation of meaning for me and
I think if the idea of was it a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
I think if the idea of was it a
 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.020
I think if the idea of was it a
revelation or was it just a an

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030
revelation or was it just a an
 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.910
revelation or was it just a an
aberration in the brain I've come to the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
aberration in the brain I've come to the
 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.960
aberration in the brain I've come to the
conclusion it doesn't really matter

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
conclusion it doesn't really matter
 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.460
conclusion it doesn't really matter
because the thing that really sticks

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470
because the thing that really sticks

because the thing that really sticks
with me

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460
with me

with me
is that feeling of endless unconditional

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550
is that feeling of endless unconditional
 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.400
is that feeling of endless unconditional
love and I don't think that really

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410
love and I don't think that really
 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.840
love and I don't think that really
