thinking no I can imagine I won't ask
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.880
thinking no I can imagine I won't ask
whether it's a surprise because of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
whether it's a surprise because of
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.280
whether it's a surprise because of
course a couple of years ago and why you

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290
course a couple of years ago and why you
 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.600
course a couple of years ago and why you
released a press release saying you'd

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
released a press release saying you'd
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.040
released a press release saying you'd
have been awarded the prize by the state

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050
have been awarded the prize by the state
 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.069
have been awarded the prize by the state
I just mention that yeah but

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079
I just mention that yeah but
 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.840
I just mention that yeah but
unfortunately this is something that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
unfortunately this is something that
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.630
unfortunately this is something that
universities tend to prepare for and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
universities tend to prepare for and

I've sort of been through this trial

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
I've sort of been through this trial
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100
I've sort of been through this trial
including this this release it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
including this this release it's
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689
including this this release it's
actually not the first time that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
actually not the first time that
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490
actually not the first time that
happened there was an email that went

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
happened there was an email that went
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.060
happened there was an email that went
out when I was at Stanford but um anyway

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
out when I was at Stanford but um anyway
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460

I've got some experience with with this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
I've got some experience with with this
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.510
I've got some experience with with this
um nobody I think nobody prepared a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
um nobody I think nobody prepared a
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
press release that I mean you notice at
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.700
press release that I mean you notice at
this time and I was sound asleep so it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
this time and I was sound asleep so it
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070
this time and I was sound asleep so it
caught me off guard well never mind they

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
caught me off guard well never mind they
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.570
caught me off guard well never mind they
can dig out the other ones here though

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
can dig out the other ones here though
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.649
analyzing the relationship between
innovation and the economy and we all

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
innovation and the economy and we all
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.960

know that innovation drives growth in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
know that innovation drives growth in
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.399

GDP but what do you think is the most

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
GDP but what do you think is the most
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.780
GDP but what do you think is the most
important thing that you'll work teaches

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
important thing that you'll work teaches
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.539
important thing that you'll work teaches
us what happens with technology is under

us what happens with technology is under
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.770
us what happens with technology is under
our control if we collectively set our

our control if we collectively set our
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.219

minds to improving technology as a
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.300
minds to improving technology as a
particular type we can do that and it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
particular type we can do that and it
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.050
particular type we can do that and it
takes some collective actions and

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
takes some collective actions and
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.700

everyone

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
everyone
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.480
everyone
but if we set our minds to improving the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
but if we set our minds to improving the
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.210
but if we set our minds to improving the
technology we can improve it in the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
technology we can improve it in the
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.370
technology we can improve it in the
direction that seems important to us and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
direction that seems important to us and
 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.930
direction that seems important to us and
even at a faster rate so instead of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940
even at a faster rate so instead of
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.760
even at a faster rate so instead of
treating it as something that just

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770
treating it as something that just
 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.130
treating it as something that just
happens to us like the weather we should

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
happens to us like the weather we should
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050
happens to us like the weather we should
treat it as something we can treat it to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
treat it as something we can treat it to
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.770
treat it as something we can treat it to
something but we we control and this

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
something but we we control and this
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.630

fostering research and development

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
fostering research and development
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.790
fostering research and development
enough or do you need more to make it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800
enough or do you need more to make it
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.940
enough or do you need more to make it
one well one other thing I should say is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
one well one other thing I should say is
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610
one well one other thing I should say is
that if you look at the very long sweep

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
that if you look at the very long sweep
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.390
that if you look at the very long sweep
of history

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
of history
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880
of history
what you see is that the rate of growth

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
what you see is that the rate of growth
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100
what you see is that the rate of growth
has been speeding up the rate of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
has been speeding up the rate of
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.290
has been speeding up the rate of
progress and that's because there's more

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300
progress and that's because there's more
 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.870
progress and that's because there's more
and more people who we're all engaged in

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880
and more people who we're all engaged in
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.110
and more people who we're all engaged in
this process of discovery and then once

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
this process of discovery and then once
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970
this process of discovery and then once
everyone discovers something they can

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
everyone discovers something they can
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.750
everyone discovers something they can
they can share it so a very important

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
they can share it so a very important
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.090
they can share it so a very important
part of supporting this kind of research

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
part of supporting this kind of research
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.290
part of supporting this kind of research
is making it possible for as many people

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
is making it possible for as many people
 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.710
is making it possible for as many people
as possible to know what we've already

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
as possible to know what we've already
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.080
as possible to know what we've already
discovered to communicate what they've

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
discovered to communicate what they've
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.790
discovered to communicate what they've
discovered and to sure this process of

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800
discovered and to sure this process of
 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.610
discovered and to sure this process of
learning what we know and then going out

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
learning what we know and then going out
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.449
learning what we know and then going out
and making making new discoveries so it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
and making making new discoveries so it
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.090
and making making new discoveries so it
isn't just a question as what any one

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
isn't just a question as what any one
 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.910
isn't just a question as what any one
nation does but it's also a question of

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
nation does but it's also a question of
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.120
nation does but it's also a question of
how effectively we connect with

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130
how effectively we connect with
 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.020
how effectively we connect with
everybody anywhere in the world and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
everybody anywhere in the world and
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.970
everybody anywhere in the world and
share all of the insights that are

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980
share all of the insights that are
 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190
share all of the insights that are
discovered anywhere what I think of that

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200
discovered anywhere what I think of that
 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280
discovered anywhere what I think of that
say a pharmaceutical that might now keep

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290
say a pharmaceutical that might now keep
 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.870
say a pharmaceutical that might now keep
my mind sharp in 20 years or 30 years I

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
my mind sharp in 20 years or 30 years I
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.400
my mind sharp in 20 years or 30 years I
don't care if it's discovered in the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
don't care if it's discovered in the
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.009
don't care if it's discovered in the
United States or someplace else in the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
United States or someplace else in the
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.050
United States or someplace else in the
world I just care that somebody

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060
world I just care that somebody
 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.670
world I just care that somebody
discovers it and if there are a lot more

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
discovers it and if there are a lot more
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.759
discovers it and if there are a lot more
people all over the world working on

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769
people all over the world working on
 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.430
people all over the world working on
things then it's much more likely that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440
things then it's much more likely that
 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.190
things then it's much more likely that
we'll discover indeed and and there

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
we'll discover indeed and and there
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.750
we'll discover indeed and and there
seems to be a race among nations to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
seems to be a race among nations to
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.219
seems to be a race among nations to
become the technological leaders of

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229
become the technological leaders of
 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.780
become the technological leaders of
course but then one also has to think

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790
course but then one also has to think
 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.250
course but then one also has to think
about the nations that are left behind

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
about the nations that are left behind
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.020
about the nations that are left behind
perhaps no notion about this possibility

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030
perhaps no notion about this possibility
 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.640
perhaps no notion about this possibility
of sharing

development is figuring out what are the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820
development is figuring out what are the
 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.620
development is figuring out what are the
impediments that prevent that flow of

impediments that prevent that flow of
 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.230
impediments that prevent that flow of
knowledge to those countries and what

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.719
can policymakers do to remove those
impediments and then take advantage of

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
impediments and then take advantage of
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.650
