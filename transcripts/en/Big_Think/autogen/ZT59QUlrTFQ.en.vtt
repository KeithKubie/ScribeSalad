00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:14.139
So I think it’s one of the more remarkable
properties of life actually, but just taking

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:22.710
mammals: that the largest mammal, the whale,
is—in terms of measurable quantities of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.810
its physiology and its life history—is actually
a scaled up version of the smallest mammal

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.710
which is actually the shrew, but a mouse is
very close to that.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.239
And everything in between, that they are scaled
version of one another and in a systematic

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.559
predictable way to sort of 80 percent or 90
percent level.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.670
So the kinds of things that you might measure
might be as mundane as the length of the aorta,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.420
which is the first tube coming out of your
heart, or it could be something as sophisticated

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.030
and complex as how long each one of these
mammals, for example, is going to live or

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.200
how long it takes to mature.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.790
So all of these things scale in a very predictable
way and they scale in a way that’s nonlinear.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.900
So even though it’s simple it’s highly
nonlinear, and that can be expressed in the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.900
following way.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.040
So perhaps the most well known of these is
the scaling of metabolic rate.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.290
And metabolic rate is maybe the most fundamental
quantity of life because metabolic rate simply

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.369
means how much energy or just how much food
does an animal need to eat each day in order

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.509
to stay alive.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.649
And everybody’s used to that and is familiar
with that.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.869
It’s sort of roughly 2,000 food calories
a day for a human being.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.400
So you can ask “what is that for different
mammals?” and what you find is that they’re

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.910
related to one another in a very simple way
despite the fact that metabolism is maybe

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.769
the most complex physical chemical process
in the universe.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.540
It’s phenomenal because metabolism is taking
essentially almost inorganic, something that’s

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.910
inorganic an making it into life.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.440
And so here’s this extraordinary complex
process and yet it scales in a very simple

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440
way.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.510
And you can express it in English, it can
be expressed quite precisely in a very simple

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.630
mathematical equation but in English it’s—roughly
speaking—that every time you double the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.690
size of an organism from say two grams to
four grams or from 20 grams to 40 grams or

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.530
20 kilograms to 40 kilograms or whatever and
just doubling anywhere.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.910
Instead of what you might naively expect—double
the size, you double the number of cells roughly

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.090
speaking; therefore, you would expect to double
the amount of energy, the amount of metabolic

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.840
energy you need to keep that organism alive
because you have twice as many cells—Quite

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.810
the contrary you don’t need twice as much.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.850
Systematically you only need roughly speaking
75 percent as much.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.660
So there’s this kind of systematic 25 percent,
one-quarter “savings.”

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:53.060
And it turns out that anything else you measure
as I mentioned a moment ago scales in a similar

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.790
way with this sort of 25 percent role occurring
in some interesting way.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.540
So, for example, if you take mammals: we have
beating hearts, we have a circulatory system

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.000
with a beating heart.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.150
So every time you double the size there’s
a systematic decrease in heartrate as most

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.299
people are familiar with.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:26.670
An elephant’s heart beats much slower than
ours and ours beats much slower than a dog’s

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.440
or a mouse’s, for example.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.980
And that also obeys this kind of quarter-power
scaling, so in a very systematic way we see

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.010
this repetitive nature.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.090
And what is amazing about that is that each
animal, each one of these animals—and by

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.700
the way it’s not just true for animals,
it’s also true of plants and trees—but

00:04:49.700 --> 00:05:00.360
each one of these organisms has evolved by
natural selection, each subsystem has evolved

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.470
evolutionary by natural selection, each cell
type, each genome that comprises of the organism

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.220
has its own unique history that ended up being
this particular organism.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.720
So you might have expected, in fact, you would
sort of think of that (and often colloquially

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.980
we think of it) as some kind of random process,
natural selection.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.170
And that you would therefore have expected,
if you look at something like metabolic rate

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:42.960
or length of aortas or whatever it is, lifespan—They
would sort of be randomly distributed because

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.210
they would simply represent or reflect the
evolutionary history of that organism, or

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.010
of the components of that organism.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.530
And quite the contrary, as I say, it’s not
that.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:05.020
Somehow natural selection has been constrained
by some underlying principles.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.090
And what I have spent quite a lot of time
thinking about and developing a theoretical

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:19.350
structure based on underlying principles and
put into a mathematical framework for understanding

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.850
where that regulatory comes from, and why
it should be this number one-quarter.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.690
Where does that magic number fall—so to
speak, arise?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:38.220
And the work that I did with some marvelous
biology colleagues, Jim Brown and Brian Enquist,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:49.620
we developed this what I consider very elegant
theory: that what these scaling laws are reflecting

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:59.490
are, in fact, the generic universal mathematical
physical properties of the multiple networks

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:07.700
that make an organism viable and allow it
to develop and grow and so on.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.020
And the ones we’re all familiar with, many
of them like our circulatory system and our

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.620
respiratory system.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.600
But our neural system is like that, it transmits
information.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:25.139
But these are networks that have evolved to
distribute energy from something macroscopic

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:33.430
like a heart or a pool of blood down to deliver
oxygen to the cells by going through a hierarchy

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:42.250
called network delivering as I say oxygen,
resources, metabolic energy to the cells.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:50.520
And it is the universal properties, the universal
mathematical properties of those networks

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.330
that transcend the evolved design.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.880
So the same mathematical – now this is extremely
important.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.060
It’s the same mathematical and physical
principles applied to a mammal which has a

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.340
beating heart as applied to a tree.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.340
And a mammal, you know, our circulatory system
is a bunch of tubes like in your house the

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.430
plumbing and the building that we’re sitting
in.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.470
That’s our circulatory system.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.080
But a tree and a plant, they’re not like
that.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.880
They’re a bunch of fiber bundles kind of
joined together like electrical cables that

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.300
spray out, and that’s what you see when
you see a tree.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:39.669
In each branch there’s actually just these
fibers transmitting, transporting fluid to

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.520
the leaves and so on.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.020
And they don’t have beating hearts as we
well know.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:54.700
And yet they satisfy the same mathematical
principles, and those mathematical principles

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.270
give rise to this quarter-power scaling in
mammals but also in plants and trees.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.850
But also in fish and birds and crustacea (in
principle) and insects and so on.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.850
That’s the idea.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.850
So one of the nice things about this theory
is that if you like it’s kind of a unified

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.850
theory because it brings – since metabolism
underlies, you know, pretty much the way we

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.850
live, the way any organism lives because it
is the way energy and resources are being

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.856
supplied to cells and so forth.
