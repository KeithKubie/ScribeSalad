brain and bingo we are karate masters

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790

can we do that now or maybe in the near

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
can we do that now or maybe in the near
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860
can we do that now or maybe in the near
future and the answer is probably not

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
future and the answer is probably not
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080
future and the answer is probably not
because the brain is not really a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
because the brain is not really a
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.390
because the brain is not really a
computer it doesn't process digital

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
computer it doesn't process digital

information our brain is a learning

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
information our brain is a learning
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.750
information our brain is a learning
machine it learns by itself to correct

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
machine it learns by itself to correct
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720

its previous mistakes while your laptop

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
its previous mistakes while your laptop
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.420
its previous mistakes while your laptop
today is just as stupid today as it was

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
today is just as stupid today as it was
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.180

yesterday your laptop doesn't learn our

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
yesterday your laptop doesn't learn our
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760

brain has no windows it has no software

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
brain has no windows it has no software
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860
brain has no windows it has no software
it has no programming but it simply

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
it has no programming but it simply
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959
it has no programming but it simply
learns tasks as it goes along

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
learns tasks as it goes along
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180
learns tasks as it goes along
therefore the interface between digital

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
therefore the interface between digital
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639
therefore the interface between digital
information and memory is quite

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
information and memory is quite
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400
information and memory is quite
complicated these are in some sense two

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
complicated these are in some sense two
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610
complicated these are in some sense two
operating systems so eventually we may

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
operating systems so eventually we may
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.720
operating systems so eventually we may
master that ability but we have to

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730
master that ability but we have to
 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.400
master that ability but we have to
reverse-engineer the brain and that's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
reverse-engineer the brain and that's
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.319
reverse-engineer the brain and that's
going to take many decades so don't

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
going to take many decades so don't
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.959
going to take many decades so don't
expect to become a karate master anytime

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
expect to become a karate master anytime
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.070
