CHRISTOPHER BROADFOOT: Hello.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.090
Welcome to this week's Google
Maps Developer Shortcuts.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.730
I'm coming to you from the
Sydney studio, where we have

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.370
new couches and I have a little
more facial hair after

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.010
Google I/O. Speaking of I/O, if
you haven't already watched

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.490
my talk, I strongly
suggest you do.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.340
It's called When Android Meets
Maps, and it gives you a run

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.230
down of the Google Maps Android
API and some of the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.710
cool things you can
do with it.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.140
So speaking of cool things, I
talked a little bit about this

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.880
utility library at I/O, and
today, I've extended it a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.010
little bit more.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.490
So it's called the
android-maps-utils library.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.510
It has a poly util, a spherical
util, and as of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.500
today, a Bubble Icon Factory.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.460
So let's talk about poly
util just very quickly.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.770
At the moment, it has
one function.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.870
It's decode.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.750
It will take an encoded
poly line or

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540
polygon, which is a string.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.952
You might get this from the
Google Directions API, and it

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:06.350
will give you back a list of
latitude and longitude points.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.770
Spherical util is great if you
need to do things like compute

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.700
distances between points, areas,
headings between two

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.660
points, or simply interpolate.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.210
Perhaps you want to
animate a marker

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.930
between Sydney and France.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.120
You can cycle through that
third value to get a nice

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.930
smooth line between
Sydney and France.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.940
There's many more functions.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.320
These are just a
small sampling.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.070
So let's talk about Bubble
Icon Factory.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.650
Essentially, it just
lets you generate

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.700
marker images like this.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
These sort of look like info
windows, but each marker is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.950
always showing.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.810
So this is great for showing
small snippets of information

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.540
such as house prices,
as you can see here.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.420
It's really simple.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.680
You just create a new Bubble
Icon Factory, and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.345
you call Make Icon.

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:59.940
And you pass out a string, and
that string will be shown

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.870
within that marker icon.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.720
You get back a Bitmap, which
you can pass through to the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.450
Bitmap descriptor factory.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.300
And you just add that
to your marker

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
through the icon option.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.860
Of course, you can use setIcon
to change that marker later.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.350
So you can change
the color it it.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.310
Here you can see that
we've got white

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.470
markers and green markers.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.690
So you can just call Set Style
on the factory and just say

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.710
that you want a green style.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.510
You can change these styles at
any time, so you can, for

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.270
example, set a whole bunch of
styles on the factory or maybe

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.890
create separate factories
for two

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.220
different types of markers.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.370
It's really up to you.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.770
So the other neat thing
about this is that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.910
you can rotate markers.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.230
Here you can see that we've
got markers that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.270
are pointing downwards.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.900
So this is great for a small
snippet of information once

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.770
again, like house prices, where
you don't really want to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.160
interfere with the
map too much.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.830
So we've gone a little bit
crazy with colors here.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.010
You might want to stick to one
or two different colors.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.420
But the library ships with a lot
of different styles that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.130
might suit your application.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.660
It's just the orange, red,
purple, blue and green.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.880
So as I said, you can set the
rotation of the marker.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.030
You can rotate the marker
itself or just the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.560
content within it.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.350
So with these markers where
the text is just pointing

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.280
down, we just set the content
rotation to 90 degrees.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.140
Now, you could have markers
that are sticking outwards

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.200
like a little tag as well.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.870
That's all quite possible.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.300
You can also change the content
view completely.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.670
For instance, if you'd like to
display an image within that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.640
little bubble, you
can do that too.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.440
You just call Set
Content View.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.140
Perhaps you want to pass an
image view down to that.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.000
And instead of calling Make Icon
with a string, you just

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.960
call Make Icon, and you
get back that Bitmap.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.240
So a little tip--

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.070
these can be run off the main
thread, off the UI thread, so

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.140
you could go and generate all of
these in parallel or in the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.500
background, perhaps
in an async task.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.350
And once it's generated back on
the UI thread, go on, put

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.830
that marker onto the map.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.390
So go and check it out.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.329
It's on github.com/googlemaps.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.510
It's distributed as an Android
library project, much like

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.700
Action Bar Sherlock or
something like that.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.670
You're probably familiar
with it.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.160
Actually, in fact, you're
already familiar with it if

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.900
you're using the Maps API,
because the Google Play

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.450
services client is distributed
as a library project.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.980
So just go ahead and drop that
into your project, and you can

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.630
start using this poly util,
spherical util, and the Bubble

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.850
Icon Factory.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.600
Well, I hope that helps, and
I'll see you around next time.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.880
Thank you.
