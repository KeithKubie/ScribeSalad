00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Thank
you for being here.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.160
I'm Joel Achenbach with the
Washington Post with Joseph Mazur,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.130
the author of this fabulous book
"Fluke", the subtitle is "The Math

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.230
and Myth of Coincidence".

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.590
And we're going to talk
about coincidences and flukes

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.170
and serendipity and
things like that.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.560
And we're just going
to shoot the breeze

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.460
and then we'll go up to questions.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.700 position:56%
Please ask whatever is on your mind.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.040
I promise you that if you read the
book, you'll be better at Vegas,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.080
you're going to win the lottery.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.380
I mean--

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.680
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Now, wait a
second, I don't promise that.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.910
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: This is-- you'll
know about the magic numbers, OK.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.010
No, actually the other
way around but, so.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.230
So, Dr. Mazur who has a PhD in
Mathematics from MIT is a professor

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.590
at Marlboro College in
Vermont, professor emeritus.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.300 position:56%
He's written a whole bunch of books.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.830
One is called "What's
Luck Got to Do with It"

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.590
which is actually about gambling.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.430
He's written "The Motion Paradox",

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.500
subtitle is "The 2,500-Year-Old
Puzzle Behind the Mysteries

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.060
of Time and Space".

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960
OK. So he's got that figured out.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.260
OK. All right.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.380
He's very smart, very
smart guy, time and space.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.570
I think he can answer any question.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.870
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Uh-oh,
be careful what--

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.320
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: He's
written a book called "Euclid

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.410
in the Rainforest: Discovering
Universal Truth in Logic and Math"

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.130
and a book called,
"Enlightening Symbols".

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.940
So, he is a-- Joe, you're--
can I call you Joe, Dr. Mazur?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.320
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yes,
please, please, please.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.620
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.400
You'd call me Mr. Achenbach.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.880
He's a popularizer of mathematics.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
He's written these books so that--
so people could understand math

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.720
and probabilities and I
guess, you know, risk analysis

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.340
and just how the world
works a little bit better.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.820
Let's talk about this book
"Fluke" and you have a whole bunch

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.800
of stories in here that are
about amazing coincidences

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.830 position:56%
and you explained how it's
possible for these things to happen.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.680
Let's talk about the Anthony Hop--

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.880
the famous Anthony Hopkins
coincidence where he came

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.730
across the-- it was the
book, The Girl from--

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.030
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Petrovka.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.330
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Petrovka, OK.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.630
Tell that story.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.930
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah, OK.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.230
The story goes like
this and this is partly

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.430
from Anthony Hopkins' version.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.940
The story is that back in 1976

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.370
when Anthony Hopkins was not very
well-known, a fledgling actor,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.080
and he got the part in a movie
called "The Girl from Petrovka".

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.610
And he wanted to get the novel.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.850
He had the script, he wanted
the novel and reads the novel.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.690
Now the novel was an
American edition of the novel

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.140
but it had not come out in
Britain at the time and he lived

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.590
in Britain and near London.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.210
He decided to go one day to search
for the-- for a copy of the novel.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.050
Now, this is 1976,
there's no Amazon.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.380
You know, you have to-- you can
call bookstores but you really have

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.700
to do some leg work to
find books at that point.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.620
So, he spends a day searching
hundreds of bookstores according

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.470
to him and finds no book that
satisfies him and he comes home.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.300
Oh, he comes back to the tube stop

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.920
that he generally uses
to get back home.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.890
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Tube is what
they call the subway over there.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.190
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: The subway, yeah.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: It's just train--

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.790
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: The underground,
they call it underground.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.090
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.930
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I'm not sure of
the reason for that, but anyhow.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.980
They-- He sits on a bench
and for a few minutes,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.170
he's sitting on the
bench and he just happens

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.190
to notice some other
things on the bench

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.210
and among the other things
is a book and he moves

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.950
over to search what this book is
and the book is the exact book,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.580
"The Girl from Petrovka", that
he'd been looking for all day.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.910 position:56%
Now, that is essentially his version
but there is another version,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.430
slightly different version,
and I heard the actual story

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.120
from George Feifer
who is the novelist.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.350
So, that is one story about a book.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.450
And what I do in the book is
to take all coincidence stories

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.760 position:56%
that I've ever heard of and classify
them into 10 different classes

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.990
and then take a good representative
of each of the classes.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.800
So you have 10 stories now
instead of hundreds of stories.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.100
You now have 10.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.020
This is what mathematicians
do, by the way.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.020
You know, they classify things.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.330
I mean, if I were really worried
about dealing with, let's say,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.070
the whole numbers,
all those numbers,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.640
I might not be interested
in all the numbers.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.920
I can't visualize all the numbers
really, but I can visualize,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.480
let's say, the numbers that
are multiples of three.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.250
And what do I do when I
have multiples of three?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.920
I only think of three and
then I might think of 3N.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.110
And so, I have all of
the multiples of three.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.400
There are an infinite number of
them since I can't visualize them,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.740
but that's exactly what
I do in the stories.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.690
So, I'm actually taking the
10 stories as representatives

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.590
of 10 classes of stories.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.190
Now there's another
story also about a book.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK, so wasn't
the book he found the book

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.730
that belongs to the author?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.210
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's
part-- that's right.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.650
Two years later.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.430
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Incredibly unlikely, right?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.080
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Incredibly
unlikely.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.080
Two years later, two years
later, he's on the movie set

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.260
and George Feifer is there
and Anthony Hopkins comes

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.630
up to George Feifer and he said,
you know, I found a book, you know,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.560
he tells him the story and George
said did the book have red markings

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.680
on all of the British
words that were--

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.630 position:56%
all the American words that could be
translated into British spellings?

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.860
And Hopkins said yes.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.570
And it turns out to
be George's book.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.570
So there's the-- it's
a kind of a second part

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.660
of that particular story.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.350
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And what
class of coincidence is that?

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.600
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It's a whole
class of coincidences that are

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.640
of searching for things
and then not--

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.450
and then finding them in
very unexpected places

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.780
and that's a whole
class of stories that--

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.750
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And then
there's the Anne Parrish story.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.230
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: There's
an Anne Parrish story.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.290
Anne Parrish was a children's
book writer in the 19th--

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.910
well, early 20th Century.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:29.350
She and her husband, Charles
Corliss, were vacationing in Paris.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.520
She lives in Philadelphia or she
lived in Philadelphia at that time.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.970
She was born in Colorado.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.990
She's in Paris.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:46.190
The two of them were sipping wine
in Deux Magots and she wanders,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.810
while her husband is still
sitting sipping wine,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.720 position:56%
she wanders over to the Seine, about
eight minutes walk, and she rummages

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.740
through the bookstalls, finds
a book called "Jack Frost

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.460
and Other Stories" and she's
so delighted with this.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.240
She buys it for a franc,
runs to her husband

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.690
and says this was my favorite
book when I was a child.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.030
And he opens the book and sees
in the-- on the first few pages,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.700
a scribbling of a child's
handwriting

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.630
and it's the address of Anne.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.480
Whenever I tell the story by
the way, my spine tingles.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.430
I have to tell you that it
really is spine-tingling

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.400
because it is another one
of those really rare things

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.060
that happen but it does happen.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.580
Now--

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.010
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: What are the--
so what are the odds of that?

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.950
So when something really,
really unlikely happens--

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.250
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yes,
it is unlikely.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.850
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- how
should we interpret that?

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.150
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: OK.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.590
There are two ways
of interpreting it.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:55.590
One is if I'm thinking in
retrospect that it is this person,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:02.030
Anne Parrish, and I'm going to
label a person who is going to--

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.340
that a particular coincidence
is going to happen to, you--

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.620
and then figure out the odds,
you get a very unlikely odds.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.630
In other words, the odds are
extremely against it happening.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.160
It's extraordinarily
against it happening.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.820
But what if you ask in a
slightly different way?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.310
What if you say, what are the
odds of somebody coming to Paris

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:38.230
from America and finding in a
bookstore a book that belonged

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.970
to that person as a child?

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.590 position:56%
You get a different sort of odds now
because now you have to say, well,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.150
there are a lot of
people who are traveling,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.790
a lot of people have books, a
lot of people have, you know,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.760
find books from their childhood.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.040
And I think it happens
very often in fact.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.030 position:56%
There are many of these coincidences

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.200 position:56%
that once you drop the retrospective
idea, that is you're taking it

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.620
in as a big global world of
people and events that happen.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.170
So, you know, we have 7
billion people in this world

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.750
and so much time is passing by
and so many events are colliding.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.290
It's bound to happen.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.700
I'm suggesting that in fact, we--

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.970
these things are happening
all the time,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.820
we just don't hear the stories.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.110
But once we hear the stories
they become magnificent.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.870
So the stories are really
what I want to focus on.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.960
But it is-- the odds
are different for--

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.800
it depends on how you
ask the question.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So, as a
mathematician, do you have to take

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.430
into account, so Anne Parrish goes
to the bookstalls, she finds a book

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.350 position:56%
that has-- she doesn't realize until
she takes it back to her husband.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.460 position:56%
It has her name and her home address

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.970
from when she was a little
girl in Colorado, right?

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.270
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.570
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So do you--

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.820
can you mathematically represent
all the other people who shopped

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.750
in those bookstalls who didn't
find a book from their childhood?

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.050
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's the point.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.380
I think that's part of the point.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.680
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And I
mean there's a famous--

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.770
is it Richard Feynman who
said you're never going

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.820
to believe what happened
to me this morning?

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.700
What? He goes absolutely
nothing, you know.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.790
And it is-- and so the-- we don't--
we focus on the anomalies and,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.770
of course, we don't calculate
every other thing that happened

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.690 position:56%
in this world with 7 billion people.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.940
So, a lot of it is there's 7
billion people all doing stuff--

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.240
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.090
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- that you
would expect close to a certainty

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.480
that on any given day
something unbelievably bizarre

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.770
and coincidental would
happen, is that right?

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.070
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's correct.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.120
That's absolutely correct
and it's all in the noticing.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.420
That's the point.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.020
But now if you look at these
stories and you really want

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.170
to know why they happened,
whenever you're told a story,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.880
you're only told the
shell of the story,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.100
you're really told the shell of it.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.650 position:56%
The storyteller does not really tell
you the ingredients that are going

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.050
to give you the connections
that will happen in order

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.770
to make that story come true.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.100
So for example, you know, I always
think of these things when I start

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.800
to analyze one of the stories
and believe me, I've got over 450

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.930
of these stories and
emails and all sorts

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.610
of things that are coming at me.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:42.660 position:56%
I'm the repository of coincidence
stories and I get them everyday now.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.760
And what I have-- what
people are asking me

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.360
to do is what you just asked
me to do is to analyze them.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.010
Well, here is what you
have to think about.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:13:01.360
The story is in a shell, I think
of it as in a Russian troika doll

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.750
and you have to open the first
doll to see the next doll.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.480
The problem with this
is that this is--

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.760
usually in Russian troika dolls,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.630
there are only a finite
number of nested dolls.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:22.400 position:56%
In many of these stories, especially
the fabulous coincidence stories,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.160
the number is infinite.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.370
I mean, it just-- you don't know

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.920
when you've gotten to
the last troika doll.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.040
And what I mean by that is
I can take, for example,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:42.910
I can take the Anne Parrish
story and try to break that down.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:48.190 position:56%
If you think about-- I did mention
that Charles Corliss was her husband

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.530
and you'd think when the
storyteller first tells you that,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.830
well, what does that mean?

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.130
Does that mean anything?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.430
Charles Corliss?

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.730
It turns out that it does.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.080
It really does.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.900
And what it means is that
if you look and try to find

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.310
out who Charles Corliss
is, he's a very rich man

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.250
and he has to be a real rich man.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.810
How many people in 1927
could just take off--

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.170
remember, there's no
air flights to Paris.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.860
You can't fly to Paris.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.210
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Well, Lindbergh did.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.760
Didn't he?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.230
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: No
commercial flights before 1939.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.530
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: That's right.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.830
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: None.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.500
And so, you had to go by boat.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.490
That's the only way, or a balloon
maybe but that would take longer.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.790
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.870
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: So,
you had to go by boat.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.670
Now you'd think what does that
have to do with the story?

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:41.200
Well, what it does have to do is--
the question is how did they get

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.440
to Paris and what would
it be like for somebody

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.590
in her economic position
to go to Paris?

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.250
She's going for a vacation.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.340
She's actually-- She's going to
have to spend at least a month,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.870
possibly two months in traveling.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.890
That's different than
the way we travel.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.920
So she's there for a long time.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.680
That may not have been the
first time she was rummaging

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.580
through the stalls and she's going

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.620
through a lot of different
sequences.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.340
It turns out that she's
gone every other year.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.860
I looked this up in ship manifests.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.560
She's on-- She and her husband
went every other year to Paris.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.670
That's what people in that class
of-- in that economic class did.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.750
You could go to Greece,
you could go to Paris.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.050 position:56%
They didn't go to many other places.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.350
So, if her book was--

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.140
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: It changes
the denominator, right?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.260
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It changes the
denominator but there's more--

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.560
there are more ingredients.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.860
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.680
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: So for
example, when you start

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.880
to take the next doll out,
you find that her mother,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.630
whose name was also Anne,
happened to be a painter who is

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.920
in school with Mary Cassatt.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.090
Mary Cassatt is a very
well-known impressionist painter.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.520
She was young at the time
when she went to school

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.560
in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.060
And they were very close
friends at the time.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.220
So, there's another little
ingredient, two close friends, OK.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.210
Well, Mary spends the
rest of her life

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.590
at a very young age
in her 20s in Paris.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.100
She comes back and forth
because she's also very wealthy.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.400
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.700
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: These
are wealthy people.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.000
And she comes back and forth.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.300
She's very close to her mother.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:40.310
She dies in 1927, two years before
Anne Parrish finds the book.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.930
I suspect that the book seemed
to travel within the family line.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.440
It went from her mother to Anne--
to Mary Cassatt and Mary Cassatt,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.760
when she died, her
estate was just, you know,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.930
people just didn't know
what to do with books.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.530
You give it to a Paris bookstall
or Shakespeare and Company,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.840
the only two bookstores in Paris

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.030
that had any English
speaking-- English books.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.330
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.950
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: So, you know,
you start to unravel these things.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.840
You find they are really--
you connect the dots.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.470
You're connecting the
dots all along.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.980 position:56%
And when you start to connect the
dots, each of those dots has an odd,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.910
in other words, you can attach a
probability to each of those dots.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.500
And once you do, all you have

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.620
to do is multiply all those
probabilities together.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.790
You can get some kind of an odds as
to how likely a story would happen.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.090
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.990
So, but still not inevitable
that it was going to happen

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.480
but not as insanely unlikely.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.020
So, we'll talk about, if you
would, the story of Joan Ginther

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.160
who won the lottery four times.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.480
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.820
OK. I'm going to go out and--

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.120
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.420
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: --
I'm going to tell you.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.760
I'm going to tell you that I
believe there are many people

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.110
who win the lottery four times.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.410
How's that?

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.710
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Really?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.010
OK.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.760
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I'm not
surprised and I'll tell you why.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.250
Now, before I tell you why, I
have to-- I have to sort of say,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.520
you know, don't get me wrong.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.740
I don't want to kill
all these stories.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.730
These stories are wonderful,
they're beautiful stories.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.140
And so, I hate putting
numbers on stories

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.200
and that's not the point here.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.370
The point is, you know, when
you're talking about coincidences,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.950
you have to think about the
definition of coincidence,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.770
what is the definition
of coincidence?

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:45.710
Definition is, for me, it's
events colliding in space and time

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.780
that have a surprise
but no apparent cause.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.470
So that's very, you know,
that makes it clear.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.770
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Is it the same thing

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.070
as a fluke or is that different?

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.370
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It's a
little different than a fluke.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.970
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: A fluke, the cause
is a little bit more apparent.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.930
I mean they-- it just
happen and then you find it

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.860
and you'll see what is
that apparent cause.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.580
You can analyze that cause.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.120
But here, once you know the cause,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.760
it's no longer a coincidence
because it's causal.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.060
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.960
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: But when I
say apparent cause, I really--

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.430
that word apparent is
kind of a little vague

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.140
because you have to
say apparent to whom?

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.320
I mean it's-- I mean some
scientists might know the cause

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.610
but you don't see the cause.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.830
So, you have to think
of it that way.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:39.410
Now, when you're talking about Joan
Ginther winning the lottery four

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.050
times, then you can
actually put the odds to it.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.200
I mean you know how-- you know what
the odds of winning the lottery is.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.150
That's, you know, the--

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.300
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Did she
buy a lot of lottery tickets?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.610
Did she buy a, I mean like
a million lottery tickets?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: We don't know that.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.210
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.980
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: But we
do know that, you know,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.780
she was a mathematician
from Stanford.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.760
That might help but
I'm not sure it does.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.130
There are ways of cheating
the lottery.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.150
There are a few.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.500
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Can you tell us now?

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.840 position:56%
We want to hear that actually, yeah.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.220
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well,
I'll tell you in a minute.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.520
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.080
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I'll
tell you one way, anyhow.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.650
The first time she won the
lottery, she won $5 million.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.180
Now, anybody winning
the lottery $5 million

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.620
and I've studied this actually for
one of my other books on gambling.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.930
When you win $5 million,
that's house money.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.160
When it's house money, you feel
free to use it the way you want.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.600
What are you going to do?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.280
You want to win again.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.580
That's a high.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.460
Winning $5 million is such
a high for some people.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.020
You win $5 million.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.050
She's going to bet like crazy.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.990
She is going to spend a
couple of years, you know,

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.440
dumping her cash this way and that.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.110
And I'm sure she put
possibly a million,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.080
possible 2 million
back into the lottery.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.380
So, she wins again.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.870 position:56%
Now her odds are terrific to get it.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.970
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Did she quit
her job as a mathematics professor?

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.270
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I don't know.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.570
I tried to interview her.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.870
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.170
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: She
is very reclusive.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.470
I cannot, yeah.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.840
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So she
goes back in, she reloads

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.330
and then she wins three more times.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.630
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Three more times.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.160
Second time I think
it was $2 million

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.450
and next time it was $3 million

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.240
and then the fourth
time was $10 million.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.540
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Wow.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.840
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.580
Now, the last three, I have
to say, were scratch-offs.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.550
So now, there's a little difference

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:43.080
because with the scratch-off
there are some techniques.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.890
You wait. There's a
certain waiting technique.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:50.560
You wait until you know
that somebody has not win--

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.350
won a certain number
in a certain area

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.050 position:56%
because these scratch-offs are not--

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.830
there are little cards that
have been printed in advance

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.470
and they're being handed out
not quite randomly, because,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.220
you know, that's another topic.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.470
There's nothing random
in the world really.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.770
So--

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.070
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I think
that's the point of the book.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.400
Actually, it did.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.700
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It is.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.000
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.300
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It is.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.600
That's right.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.900
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Well,
everything is random.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.200
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Nothing's random.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.500
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And
there's no true luck.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.800
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: There's no true--

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.100
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: There's
no force of luck in--

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.400
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well,
now you're getting

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.120
into something that's much tougher
for me when you talk about luck.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.960
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Are
some people just lucky?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.700
What? I interrupted you.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.140
You keep going on the lottery.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.850
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You
want to talk about luck?

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.150
That's fine.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.510
I could talk about luck.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:44.290
Luck is a different
kind of position.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.310
Most people think of luck as
something that is an object.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.270
You know, you take a rabbit's foot.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.570
That's an object.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.790
It's a symbol of luck and it's
kind of a representative of luck,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.440
you know, as you're
representing luckiness.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.140
If you fail with your, you
know, you fail to be lucky

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.490
with your rabbit's foot, you
know, there's a lot of blame to go

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.890
around because, you know, a
rabbit's foot to really truly--

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:20.280
truly lucky with a rabbit's
foot, it has to be from a rabbit

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.450
that was caught in a
cemetery and it has

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.830
to be the left foot of the rabbit.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:32.420
People may not know
this but that is true.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.720
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Who knew that?

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.190
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Why the left foot?

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.600
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: No
one, no one knew that.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.900
No, yeah.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.200
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well,
left foot because--

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.500
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.900
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: -- sinistra,
the Latin or the Italian word

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.120
for leftness which of course
is also our word for sinister.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.940
So, there's this leftness
that is in the equation.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.130
And the reason it's in the equation
is because if for some reason

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.530
that rabbit's foot didn't
work to give you that luck,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.860
you blame it on the cemetery.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.050 position:56%
Oh, it wasn't found in the cemetery.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.180
Oh, you know, I better get
a different rabbit's foot.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.020
So that's built in
to the whole thing.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.320
It's beautifully built in.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.620
I think it's great.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.920
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
So, may I ask you,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.680
so in our lives we're constantly
calculating the odds of things.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.410
We do risk analysis
all the time, you know.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.010
Is it safe to get on that airplane?

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.670 position:56%
You know, should I worry about, you
know, an asteroid hitting the earth?

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.020
Should I, you know, how do I think
about, you know, global warming

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.830
or the risk, I mean I hate to
bring this up, a risk of, you know,

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.910
a mad person, you know, charging
into a workplace, whatever.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:48.330
How does mathematics help
us make sense of the world?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.510
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It's, you
know, risk is primordial.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.420
I mean, it's a question
of do I leave the cave?

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.440
And because, you know,
do I leave it now?

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.730
I don't know if there's
some saber-toothed tiger

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.800
around the corner that's going
to just attack me for lunch.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.000
And so, there is that riskiness
of just leaving the cave.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.310
So it's within us.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:16.190
We just have been like that
for, you know, millennia,

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.240
for many, many thousands of years.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.660
We have developed that feeling
of being cautious about things

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.650
and we know that we-- the
risk is all around us.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.950
We feel that.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.700
But to answer your question
about the mathematics, yes,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.940 position:56%
the mathematics comes from about
the 17th Century mathematics already

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.330
risk analysis.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.270
So that's there, I
mean we can actually--

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.000
we can have some kind of a
connection between what is real

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.790
in the world, what's happening
really in the world, and what is--

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:53.340
what we can actually do as
mathematically modeling that.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.640
And there is this connection.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.940
It's not exact by the way.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.640
I mean you can predict
things totally by mathematics

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.580
but you can get a handle on it.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.990
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Why didn't evolution

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.090
and natural selection
make us better at math?

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:14.260
And I mean, like we're good at a
lot of things, but you've been--

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.080
I don't think you have
an equation in this book

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.480
for about 50 pages almost because
you know it will scare the readers.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.780
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.080
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right?

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.380
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.680
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So, I mean
we're not instinctively great

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.400
at math, why is that?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.760
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You're asking
the wrong person to answer that.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.090
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You spend
your life making this--

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.780
trying to make it better, right?

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.140
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
sure, I understand the question.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.930
I don't understand the answer.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.460
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.880
All right.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.610
Well, we're going to go to
questions here in a few minutes.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.570 position:56%
Let's talk about another one of your
stories which is many people here--

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.970
another one about Abraham Lincoln.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.660
This is actually in the movie,
the recent movie by Spielberg.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.960
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: It's true.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.260
It's a true story.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.320
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: That Abraham
Lincoln had this dream shortly

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.430
before he's assassinated where
he, I guess, walks in a hall

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.390
and he sees everyone in
mourning and there's a,

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.340
I guess, a coffin or something--

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.640
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: OK, yeah.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- and they said
the president has been assassinated.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.370
He had that dream shortly
before it actually happen.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.670
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.970
Yeah.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.270
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
So talk to us sort

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.570
of from a mathematician standpoint.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.240
Was he being clairvoyant or
is this something that is--

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.900
that has a high level
of probability?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.010
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: We all have dreams
that-- and we have many of them.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.430
We have a lifetime of dreams.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.740
Many of them we don't remember,
many of them we don't wake up

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.600
and we don't think we've dreamt.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.730
But there are so many dreams that
we've had as a collection of people

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:51.000
and you have to think about
the whole idea of how many

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.430
of those dreams actually come
true to us and how many do not.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.090
Now, that's a significant one.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.390
He's a president.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.690
He was a president.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.880
He had this dream of
his own assassination.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.280
It's a wonderful story, by the way.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.490
You know, it's been
documented many times.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:14.590
But I suspect-- I'm just going to
go out on a limb here but I suspect

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.780
that almost every president
has a dream like that.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.150
I suspect there is a fear
of being assassinated.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.550
There's got to be.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.850
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.450
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: And so
I'm just going to suspect

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:30.180
that every president has a
dream, every important person

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.520
who has some kind of
a risk, you know,

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.340 position:56%
some risk that is happening is going

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.100
to have a dream and
it doesn't happen.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.120
But sometimes, it does happen.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.320
So there is what you--
that's the equation.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.960
That's where you have to look at.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.190
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And we have
sort of a hindsight bias of locking

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.320
on to the ones where
there's an apparent causality

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.620
or clairvoyance and we--

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.920
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.220
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: --
ignore the other ones.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.520
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That's right.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.820
I mean, we know it because
he was assassinated.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.120
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.420
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: And
now we can retrofit it

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.900
to the mathematics if you want.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.490
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: This is really
a crazy out there question but,

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.500
you know, I mean I'm not being
paid for this so I'm going

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.800
to go, you know, I'm just--

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.100
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Neither am I.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.400
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You
know, we're not being paid,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.670
so we're just going
to weigh I think.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.420
So, what are the odds
that we're here?

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.320
OK. What I mean by that is, you
know, that intelligence was one

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.500 position:56%
of these adaptive traits that
emerged from evolution which emerged

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.570
from 3.5, 4 billion years
of evolution on earth.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.990
I mean, have you ever kind of
looked at that like the odds of--

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: The odds of being
here right now is one minus the odds

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.510
of our not being here.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:49.040
[ Laughter ]

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.340
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.640
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Is that all right?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.940
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.240
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: That would do.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.540
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Does anyone--
everybody understand that?

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.130
OK.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.940
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I mean I'm serious
about this because, you know,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.390
once you do that, when you're
asked what are the odds

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.830
of this happening you have

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.240
to also ask what are the
odds of it not happening?

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.540
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.000
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I actually
got this question from somebody

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.580
when I was doing a reading and
he said, you know, you're talking

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.850
about coincidences and
you're talking about the odds

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:23.740
of coincidence happening
but isn't the thing

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.760
that doesn't happen
also a coincidence?

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.980
So that was, you know,
and it struck me that,

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.290
you know, this guy is right.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.290
It is. It's coincidence.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.590
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: All right.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.580
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Because if I
don't know the apparent cause

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.300
of the coincidence, because
that's what the definition

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.020
of the coincidence is, then surely
I don't know the apparent cause

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.000
of the coincidence not happening.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.140
Because if I did know
the apparent cause

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.170
of a coincidence not happening,
then I would know the cause

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.180
of the coincidence and then there
wouldn't be any coincidence.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.160
So that's the logic of it.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.460
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.340
OK, but isn't like almost anything
totally unlikely at some level?

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.290
I mean like the fact that
we're even here, I mean,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.480
that seems really improbable
to me, increasingly so actually

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.780
with each passing minute.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.590
But what-- how did we wind up here?

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.040
Like mathematically
how did that happen?

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.580
It's still the one
minus not happening?

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You're not
serious about the question, are you?

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.730
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.030
Let me ask you.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.570
No, there's a big debate,
there's a big debate

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.830
in the field of paleobiology--

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.130
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yup.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.430
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- where
Stephen Jay Gould said

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.550
that if you rewound the
tape of evolution, you know,

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.210
going back 600 million years

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.670
and then run it forward again
you would not wind up with us --

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.970
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: The same, yup.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.920
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- because
so many improbable things had

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.450
to happen for us to be here.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.900
I mean, do you agree with that?

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.340
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I
think Stephen was not

00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:01.510
around when the ultimate universe
theories came about really

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.870
and seriously it came about.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.970
So, we can talk about ultimate
universes in the same light.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.820
And then we're talking
about, you know,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.460
we're talking some
serious physics there.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.760
But--

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.060
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You mean
like quantum mechanics?

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.360
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.660
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So
tell us about that.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.960
So there's that Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.660
I mean, from a mathematician
standpoint,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.630
does that tell us that we--

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.080
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well, James
Gleick just gave a lecture

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.630
on the time machine, right,
or going back in time.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.960
I wasn't at the lecture
because I couldn't get

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.680
in when I tried to get in, but--

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.980
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.840
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You know, maybe
if I go back to his lecture

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:45.990
that happened two hours ago, maybe
I'll get in again but anyhow.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:51.300
Yeah, I mean it's a
question of interfering with,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:56.930
you know, with the event itself.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.570
So you're interfering
with the event.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.010
The Heisenberg question that
you're asking is, you know,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.710
you want to look at
something and you--

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.010
the fact that you're looking

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.520
at something actually
deserves that something.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:14.760 position:56%
So, how do you-- how do you actually
examine something in a real detail?

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.600
You're interfering with
something that's already happening

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.520
and something that exists.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:25.180
So, there's something, you know,
could I undo a coincidence,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.560
for example, which is I
think what you're asking.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.810
Can I undo any coincidence
by the fact that we are here

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:35.280
and we're existing and we're
all together in this room?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.270
Can I actually reduplicate
that if I went back in time

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.330
and just rewound the thing?

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:49.610 position:56%
And I mean Stephen King's
wonderful novel was the "11/22/63"--

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.910
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.210
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: --
is fabulous for that.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.890
I mean there's-- he has the answer,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.270
if you've ever read
Stephen King's book.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.590
It's just amazing to
think that, you know,

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.020
he does seem to know
the answer to that.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.820
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Well, I think
we should take some questions.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.380
They should be as mind-blowing
as possible, clearly.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.760
All right.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.060
And please phrase them in
a form of an-- of equation.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.380
So, how do you want to do this?

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.380
Should I just-- should I just, OK.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.390
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You have
people with microphones or--

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:25.690
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Come
to microphones, yeah.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.990
It's a little blinding
so it's hard to see.

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.290
Yeah, go ahead.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.590
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.080
So, I have a-- I think it's a
bit silly question but it's you

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.600
as a scientist, what do
you think about all those

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.200
like pop psychology books
that like secret that tell us

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.530
that if we'll actually believe

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.690
in something somehow we
will like make it happen.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.550
So, can we like provoke those
flukes like make those--

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.390
I don't know like by
focusing on something like--

00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:53.120 position:56%
do you think it's totally ridiculous

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.330
or is there actually some
maybe like matter to it?

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.630
Thank you.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.930
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.230
That's a really good
question, actually.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.230
And the book talks a little
bit about that, in fact.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:12.430
The question, the way I interpret
it is, you know, there is--

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.260
you can think something
is going to happen

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.750
and you're forcing it
to happen in some way.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:25.420
But imagine it's possible that
your thinking is connected

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.230
to something about noticing.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:34.690
So, a lot of coincidences that
happen to us just seem to happen

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.520 position:56%
because we notice these things more.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.830
Many of us don't seem
to find coincidence--

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.280
that coincidences don't
happen to us, let's say.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.920
But if we actually notice,

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.980
we'll find that they
actually do happen to us.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:55.090
So, just forcing yourself
to think, well, that's--

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:02.850 position:56%
I think, I think is exactly the
same as just turning up the dial to,

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:07.330
your noticing dial, making it
a little bit more perceptive

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.630
and sharp.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.660
So you're actually being much
sharper when you're noticing.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.990
And I think these things
will happen.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.660
&gt;&gt; How does the-- How does Satan,

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.290
God or maybe Zeus affect one's
perception of coincidence?

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.070
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: How
is that-- what, sorry?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.330
&gt;&gt; How does Satan, God
or maybe Zeus comes

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.280
into the experience of coincidence?

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.580
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.770
I wish I could answer that.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.260
If I could, I'd be a
famous author I think.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:49.540 position:56%
But I think that's something I toyed
with getting into and I realized

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.470
that that's something that's
kind of dangerous to get in to

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.910
and I didn't want to
move in that direction.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.310
But I think that you, you know,

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:05.370
there is something
to that with that.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.630
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for coming.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.990
I had a question.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.640
You said earlier that
you'd categorize events

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.140
into 10 categories.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.770
And I'm interested to knowing
what some of the 10 categories are

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.390
and how you did that
characterization

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.250
of putting the events
into these 10 events?

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.550
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.920
Thank you for that question.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.730
Well, the Joan Ginther
story is one of them.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.030
That's about gambling.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:41.700
So, all the coincidences of
gambling are in that category.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:47.360
The lost book of-- the
book that was retrieved

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.710 position:56%
by Anne Parrish is another category.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:56.340
It's things that somehow
appear from a distant past.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:01.390
The Anthony Hopkins story
is another category.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:05.380
They don't totally intersect, those
stories, although they're both

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.540
about books and they're both--
there are some similarities.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.100
Many of these categories do
intersect a little bit and I--

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.840
what I found is after I
wrote the book and I have

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.070
so many people coming to
me and writing me stories.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.290
It is what happened.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:34.280
Actually, the BBC interviewed me
for my British edition of the book

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:41.710
and the producer said we'd
like to put on our website

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:52.000
and Twitter feed the question to
you or question for our friends,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.250
could you analyze the stories
that they will send us?

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.550
And I said sure.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.830
Now, I didn't realize
this is the BBC.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.090
So, the producer came
back with 10,000 stories.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:15.440
I said look, I could do--
I'll do four of them.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.380
And I was flooded with stories.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.660
I was just-- it was just--
it was terrific to have them.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:30.270
But-- And what I found was that
the new stories were trying

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:35.360
to be outside the 10 classes
that I've already decided

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.180
where the extremes of
all classes of stories.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.300
And, you know, I think there
are maybe 11 or 12 classes now

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.800
of which I didn't think of.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:51.280
I mean, I just got one
yesterday or the day before.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.720
A guy lost a wallet on the
Staten Island Ferry just

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.020
over the overboard.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.420
I don't know how you lose a
wallet overboard in Staten.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:08.250
And he said a fisherman friend
of his six months later in--

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.230
on Cape Cod found his wallet.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:16.230
Now, that is a category
all by itself.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.760
But, you know, once you get
all these stories you have

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.510
to be very careful about putting
it into a non-fiction book.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.450
So I have to vet those stories.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.370
They really-- I mean, I
didn't know this person.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.110
How do I make sure that's true?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.570
It's such a wonderful story.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.900
It's such almost impossible
story but yet, you know,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.300
you have to vet these because
this is non-fiction book.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.520
So, it's a-- there
are other categories

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.190
that I had not even thought about.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.490
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Before
we go to the next question,

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.940
a question that's been rattling
around my head for a while is,

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.390
so we're coming to this
age of self-driving cars

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.000
which statistically we are
told will be much safer.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.480
But I'd like to have my
hands on the wheel, you know.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.930
I mean I like to be driving myself.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.810
So, although I know
rationally that it's better

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.330
if the car drives itself, you know,

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.530
do I trust those algorithms
in there?

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.400
And I mean, you know,
isn't it human nature not

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.850
to really trust the math entirely
because it's different for me?

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.040
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.680
Does that make sense?

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.980
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah,
but let's say this.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:30.030
If you were being-- to be asked to
be an astronaut to go to the moon,

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:35.350
would you trust the thrusters
of that rocket ship that's going

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.040
to bring you to the moon?

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.890
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I'd
question the management at NASA.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.870
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah, you might
but you'd have to have that trust.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.170
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.470
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Because
you're not driving that thing.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.770
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: No, that's true.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.070
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.370
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
But that-- would you--

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.670
now you're being rational again.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.970
All right, let's go ahead, OK.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.230
&gt;&gt; I don't mean to make this
the religious question line

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.970
but when you're talking
about probability,

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:04.380
chance and as you brought
up here, we're here,

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.780
you have all these
probabilities, how is it possible.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.580
You said you had gotten to points
where you thought about God

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.990
or spiritual influence and I was
curious about how far you went

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.450
with that considering the last
maybe 150 years there's a drought

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.310
of religion and science?

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.800
So, yeah, that was my question.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.100
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yeah.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.780
It's something I have
thought about and I confess

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.010
that there are things
that we just don't know.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.210
I mean, there are a lot of
things that we do not know.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.340
I mean, if you think of
what the future has for us,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.200
it's very hard to predict
the future.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.680
I mean, 50 years ago,
would we have thought

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.530
that we could just all have
cellphones anywhere we go?

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.090
I mean, that's, you know, that
kind of thing is just so foreign

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:56.990
and we just wouldn't know that
there is actually some kind of a,

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:01.010
you know, an action at a
distance that gives everybody

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.990
in this room a telephone number

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.470
and they can all have
cellphones in their pockets.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.840
I mean that's something
that's so extraordinary.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.140
Why is it extraordinary?

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.670
Well, because I don't see any
attachments to these things.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.000 position:56%
I mean, I don't see the connections.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.970
But how do we know that our
heads aren't really doing

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.630
something together?

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:26.950
It's possible and I wouldn't,
you know, I'm not saying this is,

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.340
you know, with any
conviction here but I am saying

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:34.440 position:56%
that we do have electromagnet fields
go running around in our heads

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.740
or just the top of my head.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.510
I mean, I can't feel it but I think

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.370
that there is an electromagnetic
field.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.890
I mean, we are chemical
electric in circuitry.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.190
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I can feel it.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.490
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: You can feel?

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.790
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I can feel it.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.090
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well,
but he has hair.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.190
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: But this close
to him, I mean it's as radiant.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.050
I think we'll have to
wrap this up in a second.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.350
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yup.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.650
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You know,

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:57.950
you already did your
book signing, right?

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.250
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I'm going
to do a book signing, yes.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.550
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: What
time is the book signing?

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.850
&gt;&gt; Six-thirty.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.150
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Six-thirty.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.450
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Six-thirty?

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.750
OK. He's doing a book signing.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.050
I think we have time
for one last question

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.350
and then we'll play the linger
around and Joe will talk to--

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.650
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Yup.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.950
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: -- people
afterwards for a few minutes.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.250
Last question.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.870
&gt;&gt; If I may comment about why
people may not be better at math

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.410
or risk analysis in particular is

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.340
that obviously humans
are risk takers

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.660
and that has obvious advantages.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.140
If Lindbergh knew the real odds of
his surviving the flight to Paris,

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.440
he wouldn't have done it.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.740
All right.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.120
But my real question has to do
with the scratch-off tickets.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.250
And what is it about the printing
and things that allows you to win?

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.530
OK. You've never told us.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.510
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Well, it is a bit
complicated and I really can't.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:44.300
[ Laughter ]

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.760
There are schemes.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.340
All I can say is there are
schemes where you adjust your--

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.460 position:56%
the timing of your buying the ticket
to the place of buying the ticket

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.530
because you would know how many of
those tickets were already bought

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:04.890
and how many people
have not won so far.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.610
And what-- And those people who
have won, you know what they won

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.140
because there is-- there are
gradations in the winnings.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.080
So there's-- there are
techniques and algorithms,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.890 position:56%
they're not really algorithms,
they're just sort of rational smarts

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:25.800
that you have to figure out when
to buy the ticket, for scratch-off

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.180
that is, and where
to buy the ticket.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.960
But that's a lot of work to be
done because you have to do a lot

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.670
of analysis of where
all those, you know,

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.890
7-11s are that you can
buy those tickets from.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:46.480
And this doesn't only go
from one little locale.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.650
It has to be in different places
in a state and different states.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.400
So, it's a very broad thing
to do but it's a lot of work.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.700
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Do
you play the lottery?

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.000
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I do not.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.300
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: OK.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.600
That's the last question.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.900
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: I do
not play the lottery.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.200
I bought one ticket in my
whole life, only one ticket,

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.380
and the reason was when I
wrote the book on gambling,

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.280
I wanted to know what
a ticket look like.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.870
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: All right.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.210
The book is "Fluke".

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.510
Thank you very much.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.810
&gt;&gt; Joseph Mazur: Thank you.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.110
Thank you, Joel.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.410
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Thank you for coming.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:19.710
Very good.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.010
Thank you, thank you.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.120

of the Library of Congress.
