00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.770
[Rhythmic office sounds]

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:04.871
Look at these people.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.773 align:start size:94% position:6%
Is everyone at this company
clinically depressed?

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.307 align:start size:97% position:3%
Everyone here is hanging by a
thread.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.776
They could snap at any moment.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.643
[Gunshot sound] Bam!

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.677
[Screams]

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.313 align:start position:0%
We want to use you as our tools
in this situation.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:15.782 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes. Think of yourself as
tools.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.883
You guys are tools.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.786 align:start position:0%
The well being of our employees
is at an all time low.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.322 align:start size:97% position:3%
These were all children once.
Happy, innocent children.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.491
And now look at them.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.193
<i> Think of yourself as tools.</i>

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:28.294
[Grunts]

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:29.428 align:start size:97% position:3%
-We're all just trying to fill
the void. -The void?

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.498 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, the emptiness that
exists inside all of us.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.599 align:start size:94% position:6%
Where are you getting all of
that cake from?

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.667
<i> You guys are tools.</i>

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start position:0%
Question - why do you think it's
OK to come into work

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:37.904
with your shirt untucked?

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.806 align:start position:0%
Because life is meaningless and
nothing we do matters.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.808
<i> Think of yourself as tools.</i>

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.709
Hey, Matt!

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.811 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thought you were dead, but
turns out

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start size:94% position:6%
you're just sleeping on the
toilet.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.346
Just stay back.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.815
I'm going to kill myself.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.817 align:start size:94% position:6%
Richard, we all want to kill
ourselves.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
They're finally letting you guys
fire someone?

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:53.820
You're fired.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.821
Congratulations!

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.355
The only way to beat the system

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:59.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
is to turn the system against
itself.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.127
Are you PowerPoint proficient?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.361
I'm more than proficient.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.398 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
I listed it as a special skill
on my résumé.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.070
We all know there's no God.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:18.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
But there is a ton of money to
be made in his name.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.118 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
I feel like we're experiencing
something really special.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:27.286
What?

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.655
Got him!
