KEVIN VLK: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.030
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.730
I'm Kevin Vlk.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.090
And today we have the
director, writer, and producer

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.549
of "No Escape," John
and Drew Dowdle.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.590
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Hello.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.380
Thanks for having us.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.588
DREW DOWDLE: Good to be here.

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:16.620
Thank you.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.600
KEVIN VLK: So
phenomenal film, guys.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.150
Can you guys just go ahead
and just set it up for us

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.270
what the movie is about?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.500
And just kind of go through
just the story a little.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.920
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Sure.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.250
You want to do it?

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.550
DREW DOWDLE: Sure.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.050
Yeah.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.080
It's about an
American family who

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.420
goes to Southeast Asia
for the father's job.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.790
And the day they get there
a violent coup erupts.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.877
And they're caught in the
crossfire between a civil war

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:38.460
on the ground.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.640
And they need to escape
the country not knowing

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.730
anyone there or the language.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.910
And that's really it.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.370
KEVIN VLK: What was crazy
I think about the movie,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.100
what was really,
really awesome was

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.082
how it's like this
classic action thriller

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.790
movie, which has just
been really missing

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.623
from today's market.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:53.640
But you know there's
that scene where

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.141
you have Owen Wilson tossing
his daughters over to Lake Bell

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.515
on the other side
of the building

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.592
and there's that scene.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.050
I remember seeing
the trailer and I

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.091
was like, K, that's going
to be an intense scene.

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:04.049
But there's literally
like a dozen of those.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.590
And so can you talk
about the balance

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.630
of moving the story
along, but inserting

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.510
a lot of those kind
of oh my god moments,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.860
are they going to survive?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.568
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, I mean we really

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:15.900
wanted to in this film keep
the audience off balance.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.300
Where over and over
it's something breaks.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.120
One way and you think it's going
to be good, but then it's bad.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.900
And to try to throw
in irregular patterns

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.419
to things, where you never
quite know which way it's going.

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:32.960
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah,
and to try to find

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.400
as many moments of quiet
tension as we could.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.200
As you've seen it's got
a lot of big set pieces

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.250
and a lot of really big
action, but we really

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.620
like the idea of really
tense, quiet action as well.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.390
So calibrating that kind of
intensity over a long movie

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.960
is kind of tricky
to do sometimes.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.200
KEVIN VLK: No.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.700
For sure.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.910
And there's a ton of that
in the movie, actually.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.451
I think that's what's
great about it.

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.170
And you directed "Devil."

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.629
And what was great
about that movie

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.878
was that it basically took
place right in an elevator.

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.330
And that was very, very small.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.825
And this is kind of a
small movie as well.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.450
There's not really
too many set pieces.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.699
You're kind of in the hotel.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.350
And then you're on the
streets and a river.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.197
And so there's a lot
of that, so can you

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.030
talk about that in terms
of the scope of it.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.738
And trying to keep it
small and intimate,

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:19.380
but still knowing that
there's this huge event going

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.120
on the outside.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.369
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah,
well one thing we really love

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.860
is playing with subjectivity.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.610
And in "Devil" we
actually did a lot.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.530
Like for every scene
in the elevator,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.500
we focus on one character.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.337
And then see what
they're seeing.

00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:33.670
So we're seeing their reactions.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.280
And then sort of what
they're looking at.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.170
In that movie it really
rooted you in every scene

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.542
in one character's world.

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.750
And in this, we really wanted
to stay with the family

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.374
the whole time.

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:49.250
So it's this like big,
catastrophic event told

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.110
from a very finite
point of view, where

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.860
we're with them the whole time.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.130
And you learn about
things as they learn it.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.990
If they're hearing something
we can't understand,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.610
we don't subtitle the language,
if they can't understand.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.700
We're rooted with them.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.040
And I believe that gives you
a much more visceral and kind

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.350
of intense experience.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.810
It puts you more into
the like empathetic state

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.260
with your main characters.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.010
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.810
We like the idea
too of in a crisis

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.660
just the confusion that ensues
over the first hours or days.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.470
You know thinking about just
like 9/11 here in America.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.260
Like that whole first day is
like no one's cellphone worked,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.440
at least in New York.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.050
You couldn't get
a hold of anyone.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.966
You're really dependent
on the information you

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.950
could gather on the streets.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.960
And a lot of that
was misinformation.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.750
And so we like
that subjectivity.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.930
We never cut away to a God's eye
view of the city, or to anyone

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.500
back in Washington, DC looking
at the news, or anything.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.060
It's very rooted in
their perspective.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.390
And that was also
very helpful for us,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.974
given that we didn't have a
huge budget to make this movie.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:01.390
That subjective
perspective really

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.444
helped us keep the set
pieces more minimal.

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:07.110
KEVIN VLK: Yeah.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.820
No, I thought that
was incredible.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.700
I actually took note of that.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.020
That was actually one
of my questions was,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.970
with no subtitles.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000
I love that because
as an audience member,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.750
a lot of people do put
that in, especially

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.610
in like TV and stuff.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.730
And you're following along.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.510
But I'm sitting there.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.305
I'm like, oh my god,
what are they saying?

00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.690
Just listen.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.460
It's really, really crazy.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.740
So that was phenomenal.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.335
And I love what you were talking
about with just keeping it

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.120
with the family.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.080
It was very true right?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.960
Like, that was a thing.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.770
You were completely,
always focused on them.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.530
And always moving around,
always with one of them.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.822
It never cut away to another
character, another family,

00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:37.321
whatever.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.720
They were always interacting
with Lake Bell, Owen Wilson,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.303
and the girls.

00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:44.060
And so I kind of want to talk
about your guys' partnership

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.280
that you guys have with working
with each other and the balance

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.434
between directing, and
writing, and producing.

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:52.850
And so what that balance has
been for the two of you guys?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.347
And the different styles.

00:04:54.347 --> 00:04:56.680
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah, well
it's a pretty blurry line.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.580
But you know it sort of breaks
down to- I write and direct,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.975
Drew writes and produces.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.670
It's basically we
talk about everything.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.550
When we're shooting we're
both at the monitors together.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.200
And we're talking about this
isn't working and that isn't.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.940
And often I'll go and
talk to the actors,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.690
and Drew'll you will talk to a
crew, or studio, or anyone else

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.250
on set.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.710
And then we'll meet back at
the monitors and keep going.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.210
DREW DOWDLE: The relationship
between director and producers

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.806
always a lot of the activity
bleeds from one to the other.

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:34.180
And the fact that
we're brothers,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.940
I think there's even more bleed.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.920
And I think with each
movie we make together,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.570
it becomes a little
bit more and more.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.956
John's very much the director.

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.080
I'm very much the producer.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.450
But there's so much of
the producorial elements

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.390
that John handles.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.110
And it gets more and more
blurry with every movie I think.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.810
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: And Drew
is sort of like a hybrid.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.860
There's not many producers
who would sit through

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.470
like every day of editorial.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.940
And frankly not many
producers that like directors

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.655
would enjoy being
there everyday.

00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:07.984
DREW DOWDLE: Would
let me there everyday.

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:10.150
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: It's
like through editorial, it's

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.700
like Drew, and me, and
Elliott, our editor,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.990
like everyday we're
like three grumpy dudes.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.940
You're like all right this
doesn't work, yes it does.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.516
Between the three of us,
we cover a lot of ground.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.390
DREW DOWDLE: It's good
we have an odd number.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.700
It breaks a lot of ties.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.250
KEVIN VLK: So, who gets final
cut, or who gets final edit,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.370
final say over stuff.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.570
DREW DOWDLE: We never really
get to that, honestly.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.830
I think we're always able
to convince one another.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.725
Or if there's something
that we disagree on

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.433
and we put it up in
front of an audience,

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:45.620
usually it's the audience that
informs us if it's working

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.120
or not.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.050
And we put a lot of stock in
those first several screenings.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.982
We have family and
friends, or friends

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:52.940
of friends that are a
little bit more objective

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.080
than our personal friends.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.136
So you get a sense in the room.

00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:57.760
You don't really see
the movie clearly,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.907
until you see it with
a crowded room I think.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.865
KEVIN VLK: I mean it was
insane last night when

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:04.480
we saw it with a full theater.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.106
And people went crazy for it.

00:07:06.106 --> 00:07:07.480
And it blew my
expectations cause

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.180
I knew it was going to be
this great action thriller.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.340
I was telling you guys
earlier that it reminded me

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.679
of those classic like '80s '90s
movies that was just intense.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.720
But this is more intense
than any action thriller

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.400
that I've probably seen.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.375
Like I'm telling you there--

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:18.680
DREW DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.810
KEVIN VLK: --are so many
scenes in this for the people

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.300
who have not seen it yet.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.560
It is batshit.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.890
Like the person next to me
and I were sitting there.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.520
And the whole time I'm just
like, oh my god, oh my god, oh

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.720
my god.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.440
Like you're pulling
back from the scene.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.065
And even though it's
not real, you just

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:35.357
feel completely engulfed in it.

00:07:35.357 --> 00:07:36.315
DREW DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:37.960
KEVIN VLK: It's
absolutely intense.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.850
And I kind of want to talk
about the genesis of the story,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.230
just kind of where
this came from.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.820
Cause I knew this a
while to get produced.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.090
Right?

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.360
DREW DOWDLE: It did.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.090
KEVIN VLK: It was about
seven, eight years.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.260
And what was the
struggles there and kind

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.810
of where'd this idea come?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.510
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Well,
the genesis, my father and I

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.290
went to Thailand in 2006.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.010
And like right before we got
there a coup actually happened.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.360
And the generals had
taken over the country

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.940
and kicked out the
prime minister.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.850
And so we showed up in
the immediate aftermath.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.390
And there's just a tension.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.260
It was impossible to be there
and not be thinking about that.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.010
There was armed guards
all over the place.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.390
As our car was pulling
into the hotel,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.848
they were researching
it for bombs.

00:08:16.848 --> 00:08:21.190
And there's just this
like tension of like,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.390
could this go badly?

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.210
And I started thinking, what
if I had little kids with me?

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.990
Like how would that play out?

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.800
And we had previously
been to Thailand.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.220
We're the two
oldest of six kids.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.789
And on a previous
trip to Thailand

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.150
we had our two little sisters
with us, Lindsay and the Beeze.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.700
And so we sort of wrote these
girls after our little sisters.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.104
And they're very similar
in personality and stuff

00:08:46.104 --> 00:08:47.020
to our little sisters.

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:52.960
You know, considering we were
like 10 years older than them,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.830
so we always had this
like protective streak.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.140
And we traveled a
bunch as a family too.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.690
So we took a lot of details
from our own personal family

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.350
travels.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.665
And I mean, obviously,
it never went this bad.

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:09.540
KEVIN VLK: Thank god.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.998
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, thank god.

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:14.840
DREW DOWDLE: But I can talk
a little bit about just how

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.912
challenging it was to get made.

00:09:16.912 --> 00:09:18.870
It was very close to
getting made several times

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.581
before this time.

00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:23.580
People loved the script.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.955
All the financiers and the
studios would read the script.

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:29.300
And we heard so many times that
they sat down to read 10 pages

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.937
and they'd end up reading whole
script at midnight in bed.

00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:34.520
And like we kept
getting that comment.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.802
But we'd come in with
our pitch and say we

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:38.010
want to shoot it in Thailand.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.580
And the kids are seven and nine.

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.010
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: And we
want to cast Owen Wilson, who

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.566
is not known for action.

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:48.440
DREW DOWDLE: And we want
Owen Wilson and yes.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.710
I mean there was multiple
levels of risk when

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.880
it comes to financing
that these guys are just

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.420
wired to mitigate risk.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.742
And they saw a lot
of execution risk.

00:09:58.742 --> 00:10:00.450
Will audiences accept
Owen in this movie?

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.050
Will the kids be good enough?

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.710
Or will their
performances be sub par?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.880
And will the whole movie
really suffer as a result?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.290
Will you be able to
actually get the action

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.910
that you have on the page for
this kind of small budget?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.110
Is that even possible?

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.670
So there's a lot
of those things.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.100
It was an easy one to say no to.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.670
And the ones that
did say yes, we'd

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.920
get all the way down the road.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.290
And then, for one
reason or another,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.240
they'd just yank it
at the last minute.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.430
In the previous iteration, right
before the one that we actually

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.980
made it with, Bold Films,
but the previous iteration,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.840
we were actually the night
before flights to Thailand

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.714
to go make the movie.

00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:36.650
And deals were done
with the actors.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.030
And the locations were all set.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.530
We had been there
to location scout.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.630
And our Thai crew
was waiting for us.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.630
And it imploded the
night before we left.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.375
It was really heartbreaking.

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:48.750
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: It was like
right before Thanksgiving.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.280
I remember we weren't supposed
to be there for Thanksgiving.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.210
And then suddenly we're
there for Thanksgiving, super

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.030
depressed and broke.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.216
And like ugh.

00:10:57.216 --> 00:10:58.340
DREW DOWDLE: Totally broke.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.960
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Totally broke.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.690
DREW DOWDLE: It's like we were
living in a flat in Thailand

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.450
and like cashed a big check too.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.320
KEVIN VLK: Oh no.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:03.880
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
It's like suddenly

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.500
the next year's worth of income
just evaporated, like ugh.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.060
DREW DOWDLE: And we
had nothing on deck.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.710
We had a couple
loose opportunities,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.900
but it was a really
devastating moment.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.780
I got the call.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.060
And then the call I
had to make to John

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.050
was really one I dreaded
more than any other call

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.240
I've ever made.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.510
And then I remember
John saying, OK

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.950
emotionally, I have to just
back away a little bit.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.810
And just, if we can
rebuild it, great.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.490
But I can't keep doing this.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.657
And I totally understood.

00:11:36.657 --> 00:11:38.240
And just kind of
quietly on the sides,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.527
I was carving more
money out of the budget

00:11:40.527 --> 00:11:42.110
and going back out
to some financiers.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.190
And trying to put
it back together.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.560
Thankfully Owen Wilson, we
called him right away too,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.780
and he said, guys you find
the money, and I'm there.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.655
You just let me know.

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:54.290
And so he was incredibly cool.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.680
And it's so easy for an actor
to bail on a project that

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.410
feels troubled.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.560
And he never did.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.510
He just really liked it.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.530
Over the course of the
next six or eight months

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.410
we found a new financier.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.160
They were serious.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.070
And as soon as they locked in,
everything went really well.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.250
And the kids were great.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:17.215
And all those risks, just one
by one, kind of fell away.

00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:19.380
What was a totally cursed
project for so many years

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.150
suddenly became this
really blessed project

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.200
where the stars just aligned.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.980
KEVIN VLK: What was so
great was the casting.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.060
And that's was what
surprised me so much.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.830
I remember seeing the trailer.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.880
Initially I was
like, Owen Wilson?

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.659
Like that's a weird
casting choice, right?

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:37.700
And I see Pierce Brosnan.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.010
I was like I'm into
this, you know.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.801
But then you start
watching more trailers,

00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:44.300
you start reading more about
it, and then you see the movie.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.250
And it's crazy because he
really hasn't done anything

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.210
like crazy action, since like
"Black Hawk Down" kind of.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.912
And it's amazing from
the first scene with him,

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:54.620
which is him right on
the plane, with him

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.570
on the plane with his family.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.360
You buy into it.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.080
I'm like, oh, he's a family guy.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.663
Oh I get that.

00:12:57.663 --> 00:13:00.110
Like, he's so playful with
kids and so relatable.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.700
And then you go into him
being an action star.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.920
But you ease into it.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.590
And he slowly kind of
starts finding his way.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.280
He accidentally becomes
like this guy just fighting

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.970
for his family.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.990
And what was so crazy is,
I don't have kids or a wife

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.448
right now, but I
have a girlfriend.

00:13:13.448 --> 00:13:15.770
And I'm like, I'm putting
myself in that place.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.400
It was like I would
actually try to do that.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.130
I would try to fight for that.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.810
And so that's how it was for me.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.020
So can you talk about the
casting of Owen Wilson?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.560
Was there a lot challenges with
that with studios being like,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.310
we don't want him.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.990
We want someone like a
Chris Pratt or Tom Cruise

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.700
kind of in this.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.320
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.730
I mean it's part of the reason
we did this independently.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.060
For a lot of studios, they
can't really lead trends often.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.130
They have to sort of follow
things most of the time.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.440
We kept getting no, it has
to be, someone we know,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.590
like a Jason Statham
or a Bruce Willis.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.680
That's more the direction
we were getting pushed.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.140
I like them fine.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.820
But for this movie,
we really wanted

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.690
somebody who felt
like someone, we

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.660
like to joke like, without
a special set of skills.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.990
Somebody who seems like a
friend of yours or like him.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.185
How would he survive this?

00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:16.810
Or how would I?

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.580
Like not somebody
who I've seen be like

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.460
a Navy SEAL or
something like that.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.320
And so we wanted something
that felt very real.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.830
And I remember
when we first cast

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.666
Owen, people kept asking like,
are you to give him a crew cut,

00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:30.540
make him super butch.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.498
And we're like, no, no.

00:14:31.498 --> 00:14:36.730
We want the "Marley and Me"
Owen Wilson in this situation.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.790
And we stuck to that.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.740
People were worried like, will
audiences accept him in this?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.720
We were like the first time you
see him yell at one of his kids

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.260
like, just do it!

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.760
You see him do that
once, and you're

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.926
like OK, I've never seen
Owen do this kind of stuff,

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.455
like anything like this.

00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:56.080
KEVIN VLK: That was
it in the trailers,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.663
like as soon as you
start seeing them,

00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.790
like you just buy
into it so quickly.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.730
And he's so good.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.480
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
He's so good, Isn't he?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.438
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah, to
your point too, we always

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:07.490
knew it was going to be kind
of a show me the situation.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.537
We had to show material
of it for people

00:15:09.537 --> 00:15:11.620
to really-- Because when
you talk about this movie

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.911
and what it's about, and the
fact that Owen's the lead,

00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:16.964
People are like, OK, let's see.

00:15:16.964 --> 00:15:19.130
I remember the first time
we seriously discussed it.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.171
We were actually right
here in this neighborhood.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.160
We were on Lucas road
driving to Skywalker.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.500
And we just thought OK, but
when you see that trailer,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.407
like what effect do you have?

00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:29.240
We knew we could do.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.520
We knew he'd be great.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.860
But when you see
that trailer, is it

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.240
at that point are you resistant?

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.960
Or are you really intrigued?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.800
We kind put ourselves in
the audience's shoes to say,

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.014
oh I see that trailer, and
I have to see that movie.

00:15:41.014 --> 00:15:43.430
KEVIN VLK: You have to see
when throws a kid off the roof.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.845
It's like, you threw a
kid off the roof, what

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:48.260
happens to that kid?

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.241
That was insane and
that scene was insane.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.740
But you also have
some great casting

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.460
with Lake Bell, who is just
this wonderful chameleon in how

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.872
she plays these goofy
characters, like in "Wet Hot

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:57.580
American Summer."

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.246
And then she plays
something so serious.

00:15:59.246 --> 00:16:02.020
But she's a very, very
strong female character.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.600
And she really holds her own.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.100
She asks her husband
a lot of times.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.270
But a lot times, she's actually
saving Owen Wilson's character

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.710
a lot of times.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.710
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.170
KEVIN VLK: Which was phenomenal.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.510
And she's really
protecting her kids.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.120
And she's thinking for
herself because sometimes they

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.756
are separated.

00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:16.130
That's not a
spoiler or anything.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.324
But they are separated
for some periods of time.

00:16:18.324 --> 00:16:20.490
And she's taken the initiative
to do a lot of stuff.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.720
So can you talk
about the development

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.380
of her character and not making
her this damsel in distress?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.130
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, that's well said.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:31.700
We kept saying we don't
want a damsel in distress.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.940
It's sort of a two-hander.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.610
It's two parents
protecting their children.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.030
And she's so strong.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.190
One of the great
things about her too

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.950
is she makes you like
Owen's character more the.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.950
Fact that he married her
makes him substantial.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.440
If she was like some
blonde hair, blue eyed,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.620
like super actressy, you
wouldn't like him as much.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.540
But there's something
about their chemistry.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.000
And they're funny together.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.576
And you can see at a
glance why they fell

00:17:06.576 --> 00:17:07.700
in love in the first place.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.030
They have a similar
sense of humor.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.444
And boy, you know, she
really went for it.

00:17:14.444 --> 00:17:15.069
It was fun too.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.839
She was like, in
every movie they're

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.961
like, oh not so intense with
the eyes, like cool it down.

00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:24.460
She's like it's so nice that
you guys are never saying that.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.310
Just go for it.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.609
Do it.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.930
KEVIN VLK: Yeah, cause
she can be really intense.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.875
DREW DOWDLE: Just her action
shots are so powerful.

00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.615
In editorial we
had just all these

00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:34.990
different options
and each moment

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.156
was really hard to decide
because she just gives you

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.710
a ton, even in the moments
where she's not speaking.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.170
And were really lucky to
have actors that smart too.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.680
I mean, Owen Wilson's an
Oscar nominated writer.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.030
And Lake Bell is a Spirit
Award nominated writer.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.380
And to have actors
that are talented

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.670
with dialogue and with
just a sense of script

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.960
is really a blessing for us.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.040
That helped a lot.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.110
KEVIN VLK: And then you
bring back Pierce Brosnan

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.630
in this great role.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.060
Where you first meet him and
he's completely against type.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.971
And I love that.

00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:09.720
And we were talking
about this before too.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.420
He's just instantly
likable, even

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.820
if he's not this like
perfect, suave guy and stuff.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.811
He's very, very
like, oh I buy that.

00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:18.310
You know.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.090
And I want to watch more
of Pierce Brosnan doing

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.560
that stuff.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.476
So, you could talk a
little bit about him too.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.910
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, Pierce is amazing.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.590
He's such a good
character actor.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.960
Like he can really
do character stuff.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.300
And he sort of came up
in theater in London

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.490
doing that kind of thing.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.620
And then he came to
America and apparently

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.240
his v very first audition
was for Remington Steele.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.920
He booked a series and
then it was off from there.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.370
And so everyone thinks of
him as like the handsome guy.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.540
But I mean he can
really do some stuff.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.870
DREW DOWDLE: It is challenging
to unhandsome Pierce Brosnan.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.360
You can't beat it
out of that guy.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.790
We really wanted to go rough
and bearded, and red and ruddy,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.890
and alcoholic looking.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.850
And it's still
like Jesus Christ.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:03.920
KEVIN VLK: Still gorgeous.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.489
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Still gorgeous.

00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:05.988
Yeah.

00:19:05.988 --> 00:19:07.320
KEVIN VLK: The bastard.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.390
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: It's true.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.890
KEVIN VLK: He cannot
be unappealing.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.848
DREW DOWDLE: It's true.

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:13.309
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: It's true.

00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:14.850
DREW DOWDLE: It's
funny we were there

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.790
shooting for I think six
weeks before Pierce got there.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.910
Or five weeks or so.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.180
But we were towards the
end of the schedule.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.500
Everyone in Thailand,
it took 'em a minute

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.270
to know who Owen was.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.080
And they didn't have
any idea who Lake was.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.360
But it took 'em a minute.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.450
But after we'd been
there for a while,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.825
they knew they were
the stars of the movie,

00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:33.670
so they had some
attention around town.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.210
But then Pierce got there.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.890
Oh my god.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.700
He showed up at the airport
in Chiang Mai to greet Pierce

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.150
and it was like, you'd think it
was the Beatles or something.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.070
He is a full blown international
movie star, no doubt.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.570
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
And he's so nice.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.810
Like he would literally take
1,000 photos with people.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.012
And he's like the nicest guy.

00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:54.470
DREW DOWDLE: He
will take the time.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.053
We were waiting for
him on set one day

00:19:56.053 --> 00:19:59.597
and Thai kindergarten class
had come to set to visit.

00:19:59.597 --> 00:20:00.430
And we were waiting.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.220
And we were kind of in a hurry.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.000
And he was signing autographs
for this kindergarten class.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.500
And we're like,
Pierce, we gotta go.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.276
He was like, no.

00:20:06.276 --> 00:20:08.151
I'm gonna sign every
one of these autographs.

00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:10.947
We're like, OK, you know,
it's for a good reason.

00:20:10.947 --> 00:20:12.530
KEVIN VLK: You have
a great James Bond

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.790
joke that I won't ruin,
but it's phenomenal.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.800
It's a very subtle
hint, but I love it.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.595
And the theater went
nuts for that as well.

00:20:19.595 --> 00:20:20.220
That was great.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.970
But can you talk about
just with the kids.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.360
I mean what was so great about
that was you have this action

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.530
thriller with the family.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.734
And the kids are an
important part about it.

00:20:29.734 --> 00:20:31.650
And they always have to
pay attention to them.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.417
Like they sometimes
are, you stay here,

00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:35.750
and I'll go and stuff like that.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.480
But sometimes they have to leave
the kids like, OK, now you're

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.521
in charge of your sister.

00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:39.440
You are in charge.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.634
And can you talk a little
bit about just that?

00:20:41.634 --> 00:20:44.050
That was so incredible because
you don't see a lot of that

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:44.300
either.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.758
You see these action thrillers
with like Liam Neeson trying

00:20:46.758 --> 00:20:49.280
to get his daughter
and stuff like that.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.914
But these are small
kids and they're

00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:52.080
throwing them off buildings.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.640
And they're hiding
them in bushes

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.459
and underneath
stairwells and stuff.

00:20:55.459 --> 00:20:57.500
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: I mean
it was important for us

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.650
to keep the family
together as a unit.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.789
Really in most movies
like this, step one

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:06.080
is you hide the kids under
a thing and leave 'em there.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.420
And then step two is
you have your movie.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.240
And we really wanted to have
them there the whole time.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.100
It's a two front war
for Owen's character.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:26.490
He's got this adversity
to deal with in the world.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.300
But then he's also
got to convince

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.410
his kids to do what he says.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.500
I mean there's moments as a
parent, like I'm in a rush.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.684
I got to get to work.

00:21:35.684 --> 00:21:36.850
My kid won't get in the car.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.600
It's like what do you
do at that moment?

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.250
Do you just push 'em down into
the seat and strap 'em in?

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.020
And then the neighbors
think you're crazy.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.520
There are those moments.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.020
No.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.900
I mean for real.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.920
And we wanted to capture
that in a bigger setting.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.801
Going into the movie that
was frankly my biggest,

00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:59.050
from a directing standpoint,
that was my biggest fear.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.508
It's like if these kids don't
work, the movie doesn't work.

00:22:01.508 --> 00:22:03.640
Because there's some
really heavy lifting

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.590
they have to do to stay in
the movie that whole time.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.270
They really have to hit
some emotional places.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.720
DREW DOWDLE: A lot of dialogue.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.310
And if they weren't
as good as they were,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.510
we'd end up really
trimming their performances

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.151
and editorial just
out of necessity.

00:22:21.151 --> 00:22:22.150
And that was a big fear.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.819
Because if they get
cut down, they're

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:26.860
going to feel like props.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.530
They're going to
feel like we're just

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.870
using them for an emotional
resonance that's not totally

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.370
working.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.930
But if their performances really
work, the whole movie works.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.819
So we knew Owen,
Lake, and Pierce

00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:37.860
were going to be amazing.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.150
But the kids it's just a--

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.020
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: --crapshoot.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.970
So we approached it
like, let's treat them

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.340
just like we treat the stars.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.370
There's moments where
we'd say like, I don't

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.300
know what it's like to be nine.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.130
I don't remember that well.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.050
I need you to be the expert.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.490
And what would you
do at this moment?

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.740
And a lot of the moments in
the movie that I love the most

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.410
are things they just did.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.170
There's a moment
where one of the girls

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.770
just turns and hugs her
sister cause she's scared.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:08.900
And that was her doing it.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.030
That wasn't written.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.730
That wasn't something
we asked her to do.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.760
Like they just knew they
could be themselves and be

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.130
real in those moments.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.629
And no one was going to
be like that was wrong.

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:21.420
What are you doing?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.110
You just blew a take.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.610
They had free rein.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.900
Along those lines, we
never set marks for them.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.699
The cinematographer
we asked to like we

00:23:33.699 --> 00:23:35.240
never want to set
marks for the kids.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.531
We never want them to have
to stand in a certain light.

00:23:37.531 --> 00:23:39.617
Like we want them
to have free rein.

00:23:39.617 --> 00:23:41.450
If they want to change
it from take to take,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.840
it's their performance.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.650
KEVIN VLK: Well,
that's a great point

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.150
too was just the
real human moments.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.697
When you said the
hug thing, there

00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:51.280
was so many natural
moments like that.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.030
And so many moments
where I think

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.029
get skimmed over in TV
and film all the time.

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:56.820
And you guys had so
many of those in there.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.694
Where you see like
Kiefer Sutherland in "24"

00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:01.860
and people are like when
does he go to the bathroom?

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:02.420
When does he eat?

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.440
And you never see that
cause it's boring, right?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.100
Literally, the kids
are like, I'm hungry.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.840
And it was like, we now.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.090
Or I have to use the bathroom.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.320
That was a gut-wrenching moment.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.410
It's like I had to use
the bathroom, right?

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.910
It was like, you guys
wrote that in there.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.070
And you spent time on it.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.480
That was like a
two minute scene,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.360
where it's just gut-wrenching.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.402
And you know it's that.

00:24:19.402 --> 00:24:21.110
And then there's a
scene between one girl

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.950
and I won't ruin it with her
and Owen later in the movie.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.430
But it's really,
really well done

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.670
with bringing those kids
into the moments and stuff.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.530
But I want to talk
about the insane

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.680
moment of throwing the
kids off the building

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.160
because that scene was bananas.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.420
It was so crazy because
you see in the trailers,

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.837
but the way that
it unfolds there.

00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:46.336
Like you were talking about how
you get your kid in the car,

00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:46.950
right?

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.320
Owen Wilson, what isn't
really shown too much

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.550
in the trailers, what's
shown in the movie

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.200
is, he has to convince
his kids to actually agree

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.366
to be thrown off a building.

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:56.287
And he does an insane, crazy
job with making that happen.

00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.370
So can you talk about the
evolution of that scene?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.450
Because that had to be
hard to shoot in general.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.890
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah, it was.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.080
It was our biggest set piece,
obviously, in the entire movie.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.925
And I think we spend a good
four or five days on that alone.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.730
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
When writing we

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.770
try not to write just
things we know how to do.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.130
And this is one like we wrote.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.730
We're like I don't know how
we're ever going to do this,

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.690
but let's find a way.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:34.542
And it was funny we originally
found some stunt girls, who

00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:35.750
actually look like our girls.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.730
One was from Zimbabwe
and hadn't worn shoes

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.890
until she was like
10 or something.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.940
DREW DOWDLE: One
was from Australia.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.565
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
And they were tough.

00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:46.940
DREW DOWDLE: And they
were tough, yeah.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.481
And they were willing
to do anything.

00:25:48.481 --> 00:25:51.570
Our plan was to put them on
the wires and throw them.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.539
We came up in the plan
that actually worked.

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:55.580
We were doing a test run.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.580
You want to tell it?

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.670
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: I was looking
at my iPad of the test run.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.510
I brought my family
with me and my kids

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.450
were like in Thai school
and it was really fun.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.560
And I was watching on my
iPad the stunt being done

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.560
and my four-year-old son
like saw it over my shoulder.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.370
And he's like, I
want to do that.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.580
And so Drew and I were
like, let's do that.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.860
Let's bring my son.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.830
We'll throw my son off the roof.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.590
And we'll let the
actresses watch.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.300
And if he doesn't freak out,
maybe they'll want to do it.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.500
And it worked.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.710
So I threw my son off.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.600
It was like a four-story roof.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.480
KEVIN VLK: Oh Jesus.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.540
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
He was on a harness,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.350
but it's like up to like
a construction crane.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.890
And so I threw him off
and Drew caught him.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.780
And he got up and he
wanted to go again.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.639
And then all the girls were
like, I want to go next.

00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:47.180
DREW DOWDLE: Including
the actresses.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.430
The stunt girls and the
actresses all, and the mothers

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.110
were there.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.590
You don't want to talk a
kid actor into a stunt.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.840
You don't even want to put
any pressure whatsoever.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.420
So the idea was if they
really want to do it,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.670
then that's a different story.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.340
And so throwing
Henry, John's kid,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.000
It just was like an
amusement park ride suddenly.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.010
And they were all like climbing
over each other to do it next.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.260
And this was just a rehearsal.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.140
She got to go twice.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.817
I only got to go once.

00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:13.650
It became like that.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.983
KEVIN VLK: We got so much money.

00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:15.810
Stop.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:16.970
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: And we
had originally planned it

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.020
that they'd be like sort
of face down, so that we

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.580
could swap a stunt kid in.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.680
But once it was the real
kids, then we're like,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.120
let's flip them, so we can see.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.661
But then it's like
now we're throwing

00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:31.240
'em off a four-story
building backwards.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.150
And these guys are like
letting the rope out

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.380
to a point that
they're free falling.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.840
Like you can tell in
one of those shots,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.440
her torso is below her feet.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.692
Like her feet are up
and it's her torso

00:27:41.692 --> 00:27:42.900
that's connected to the road.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.230
So she's free falling.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.380
And they were so brave.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.140
And that was one of things we
always talked to them about.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.900
We have a million
ways of movie magic.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.400
If there's ever something
your don't feel cool

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.440
with it's easy for us to
do something different.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.390
And they got that and knew that.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.130
And there was moments
you wouldn't even

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.390
guess that like, I don't
feel comfortable being

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.140
near a moped when it tips over.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:16.350
Or things like that, where it's
like, OK, we got it covered.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.150
And so you know, but they
had a good time with it.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.740
But it was gnarly.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.620
We hate using green
screens and CGI,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.469
so we tried to do
everything practically.

00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:27.510
KEVIN VLK: And it showed.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.000
It completely showed.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.500
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:29.630
I've

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.250
KEVIN VLK: Seen a lot of car
chases and a lot of motorcycle

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.770
chases.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.500
And like, "Mission:
Impossible 5"

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.415
has this insane, awesome
just motorcycle chase scene.

00:28:38.415 --> 00:28:39.790
I'm not sure if
you guys seen it.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.580
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.790
KEVIN VLK: And your
moped scene of them

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.970
going through the
crowd at a mile an hour

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.750
is way more intense than
that scene from "Mission:

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.370
Impossible."

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.900
DREW DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.108
KEVIN VLK: It had me way
more on the edge of my seat.

00:28:52.108 --> 00:28:54.620
It was just a completely
different kind of feeling.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.160
Can you just talk about the
evolution of that cause that

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.697
takes a lot of control I think.

00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:02.280
So it's an action
thriller, it's like,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.920
oh we have to do this car
chase scene or this thing

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.880
through the back alley.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.520
It was like, no, he's got two
kids and a wife on this moped.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.270
He can't do that.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.160
You Top speed's
five miles per hour.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.910
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.368
We always ask ourselves, how
do we do the slow speed chase?

00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:18.720
How do we make the really
intense slow speed action?

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.095
That one really
worked I thought.

00:29:20.095 --> 00:29:21.761
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, we always about

00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:23.580
like, how do you do
the micro-climax?

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.380
Like so many films end in this
bombastic you're on a thing

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.860
and people are jumping off.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.180
And things are exploding.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.030
And we're like what's the
smallest, like quietest,

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.130
like what's the micro-climax
version of this?

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.030
And so we always try to think of
this movie really in some ways

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.790
like it starts sort of big
and then it goes smaller

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.530
and smaller until the end.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.670
And we really like that it feels
more and more intense as you

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.369
go, if you're tightening it.

00:29:54.369 --> 00:29:55.910
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah,
we like that scene

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.160
too in that there's
a moment where,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.140
you have kind of a rabid mob.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.820
This kind of mob
violence mentality.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.190
And then you have a moment with
one individual within that mob.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.410
And he chooses to
not do what you

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.579
think he's going to do
because for a moment

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:13.370
he's an individual.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.860
He's not part of
this larger group.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.800
And that felt like a really
nice moment to do that.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.915
KEVIN VLK: Yeah.

00:30:18.915 --> 00:30:20.540
And we'll take some
audience questions,

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.623
if you guys want to pop
in there and ask anything.

00:30:22.623 --> 00:30:26.080
But while they're
getting up there,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:32.310
can we talk a little bit about
were there any scenes that you

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.010
guys wanted to get in
there that you couldn't?

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.180
You had to cut for time?

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.820
Or just was this pretty
tight knit once you

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.247
got into the shooting stages?

00:30:42.247 --> 00:30:43.580
DREW DOWDLE: Pretty close, yeah.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.913
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Pretty close.

00:30:44.913 --> 00:30:46.050
We barely trimmed anything.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.180
There was a scene or two of
Pierce that were so good.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.180
We had a great scene
of him in the hotel

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.969
that once we tested
it, we're like OK

00:30:55.969 --> 00:30:57.510
we're spending too
long in the hotel.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.500
So we trimmed out a couple
minutes of the hotel

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.430
just to get into it.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.590
But there was a great
moment with Pierce

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.730
and a woman on the elevator.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.850
He's so funny.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.360
We like to joke that like
Pierce was playing the Owen role

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.209
and Owen was playing
the Pierce role.

00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:17.750
KEVIN VLK: That's exactly what
I said to my friend last night

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.520
was that the roles are
completely switched

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.360
and I think that's what
I love the most about it.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.568
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:31:22.568 --> 00:31:24.972
KEVIN VLK: That switch
there was really good--

00:31:24.972 --> 00:31:25.930
DREW DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.640
KEVIN VLK: --you had
that eye on that.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.139
DREW DOWDLE: Really everything
we trimmed from the first cut

00:31:29.139 --> 00:31:31.690
to the final cut was pre-riot.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.060
In that kind of early part
of the movie in the hotel.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.920
We realized we spent a
little too much time there.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.044
There's some things that
weren't totally necessary.

00:31:38.044 --> 00:31:39.820
The one casualty
that we really regret

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.540
was the Pierce and
the elevator scene.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.511
But it was connected
to two other scenes.

00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:45.260
And then we could
remove like four minutes

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.093
if we got rid of it.

00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.960
So it became based
on a time thing.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.680
But from the riot to the end,
it changed very, very little,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.410
honestly.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.400
Just really turning screws
more than it was anything.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.640
Scalpel work, not really
any jackhammer work.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.080
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Yeah, and sort of

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.710
shaping some of those scenes.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.720
There's a couple
scenes where we just

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.254
wanted a little more
breath in the middle.

00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:06.670
DREW DOWDLE: It's amazing that
we sold it to the Weinstein

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.940
company, and even from
the sale to the finish,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.884
it was almost exactly the same.

00:32:10.884 --> 00:32:12.550
It was just really,
really minor tweaks.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.960
And you never know
how that's going

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.584
to go with any distributor once
you have a distributor on board

00:32:16.584 --> 00:32:17.860
sometimes.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.830
You sign the deal before
you have any idea what

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.996
the creative is going to be.

00:32:20.996 --> 00:32:22.360
And that's always scary.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.450
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Harvey
Weinstein bought it.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.040
He hadn't even seen
the whole movie.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.780
He'd seen like 10 minutes of
it on a laptop and was like,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.420
I'm buying it.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.239
And so then Drew--

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:32.030
DREW DOWDLE: I flew to
France with the DVD,

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.490
like OK, I hope he likes
the other 90 minutes.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.686
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah,
cause it could go anyway.

00:32:36.686 --> 00:32:38.060
You know it could
be like, great.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.610
You know, now that
I own the movie,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.776
let's get rid of those kids.

00:32:40.776 --> 00:32:41.600
And let's--

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:41.800
DREW DOWDLE: PG-13

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.758
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: --put
some dance numbers in.

00:32:43.758 --> 00:32:46.810
You just never know
how it's gonna go.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.139
And thankfully.

00:32:48.139 --> 00:32:50.180
KEVIN VLK: A song by
Pierce, that would be great.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.540
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: It's
like and you do that.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.140
We sit there and do
that to ourselves.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.200
Like what if he?

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.510
DREW DOWDLE: What's he
gonna want to do it now?

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.270
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah,
what's gonna happen?

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.280
KEVIN VLK: And it's Harvey,
so we got to make him happy.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.461
DREW DOWDLE: There's that.

00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:01.710
AUDIENCE: I was curious,
you've had a few movies, now.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.920
What was the experience
filming in Thailand

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.470
compared to other locations?

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.140
DREW DOWDLE: It was great.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.760
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Amazing.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.570
The Thai crews are incredible.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:16.960
Like it was I would say my
favorite filmmaking experience

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.460
ever.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.900
DREW DOWDLE: For sure.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.210
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
And we didn't want

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:27.220
to show up as like a big
army of Americans showing up.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.920
We wanted to become like
a part of the Thai crew.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.580
And so we brought very
few people with us.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.800
It was almost exclusively Thai.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.140
And in some departments
we might have one.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.350
We had a guy from Canada,
a guy from France,

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.020
and maybe an
Australian, and a Brit.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.080
DREW DOWDLE: And an
American costume designer.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.550
We had less than 10.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.299
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
Everyone else was Thai.

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:53.694
And it was so fun.

00:33:53.694 --> 00:33:55.860
DREW DOWDLE: And they felt
very creatively connected

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.401
to the movie.

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:58.670
A lot of times when
you shoot, whether it

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.590
be in LA, or Toronto, or
anywhere, a lot of the crew--

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.975
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Louisiana.

00:34:01.975 --> 00:34:03.141
DREW DOWDLE: --or Louisiana.

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:06.560
They're there to do a good
job, but they don't truly

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.770
care how it turns out.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.270
They're there to
collect a paycheck.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.580
And they're not going to
intentionally do a bad job.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.480
But they are not
emotionally invested.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.039
And we felt like this
Thai crew, there's

00:34:17.039 --> 00:34:18.830
so much pride in that
country, and the fact

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.449
that we're shooting there.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.324
They wanted to make sure
this film was great.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.082
Most places departments
don't really help each other.

00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:27.290
And usually it's union rules.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.480
A grip can't help the art
department carry their stuff

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.646
out because there's these
lines between departments.

00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:36.584
And in Thailand
none of those lines

00:34:36.584 --> 00:34:38.250
exist and everyone's
helping each other.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.010
It was a really
cooperative effort.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.010
And that was very different.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.980
It felt like being
in film school again,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.270
but like having 100
people on your crew

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.821
versus like two people.

00:34:48.821 --> 00:34:50.070
Everyone's helping each other.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.125
And it was really great.

00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:54.000
Wonderful experience.

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:57.760
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering about you

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.926
guys have a lot of experience
in your previous films

00:34:59.926 --> 00:35:00.640
with horror.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.870
But this is kind of horror in
a very, very relatable sense,

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.282
like real world absolutely
terrified this could happen.

00:35:07.282 --> 00:35:08.740
Could you talk
about some of things

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.114
that you brought from your
previous films that maybe were

00:35:11.114 --> 00:35:14.700
a little more sci-fi-ish
to this kind of real world,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.287
grounded in reality, experience.

00:35:17.287 --> 00:35:18.870
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
That's interesting.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.787
We actually started before.

00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:26.370
We did a film called,
"The Dry Spell,"

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.560
which was a comedy, which
is where we started.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.980
And then we started into horror.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.210
And then people got
to know us from that.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.620
But both of those
things are you're

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.180
building an anticipation.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.960
And then trying to pay it
off in an unexpected way.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.200
And so comedy works sort
of along that paradigm

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.790
and so does horror.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:50.640
And this being a
thriller, we do a lot

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.850
of that in this, where
we try to create suspense

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.557
towards something happening.

00:35:56.557 --> 00:35:58.390
And then something
happens you don't expect.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.456
And now we have to figure
out a new thing to do.

00:36:03.456 --> 00:36:05.580
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah, I mean
our previous three movies

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.140
have a similar through line.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.970
In that there's characters,
it's kind of a regular day,

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.760
or maybe they're doing something
irregular, but it's a day.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.110
And something happens.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.910
And then chaos ensues.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.380
And they need to try to survive.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.900
And so "Quarantine" and "Devil"
and "As Above, So Below"

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.715
all had that kind of structure.

00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:25.840
We like to joke sometimes
that our characters never

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.205
change clothes in our movies.

00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:28.174
It's always in one day.

00:36:28.174 --> 00:36:29.340
This time they changed once.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.122
So we threw our casting
designer a bone on this one.

00:36:32.122 --> 00:36:33.830
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
One change of clothes.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.538
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah,
one change of clothes.

00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:38.990
But for whatever reason, we love
that kind of incidental chaos

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.979
or crisis kind of movie.

00:36:41.979 --> 00:36:43.520
KEVIN VLK: So there
were a few things

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.720
that were kind of hit
points all the way through.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.180
One was definitely,
stay 10 steps ahead.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.372
That was pushed
through a few times.

00:36:52.372 --> 00:36:54.330
But the thing was the
little girl always asking

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.390
for the story of
how she was born.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.556
So can you talk about
where that came from.

00:36:58.556 --> 00:37:03.280
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: That
actually came from my first son

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.080
when my son Henry was born.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.050
It's like maybe over the course
of your life you see like one

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.600
or two things that
are truly miraculous.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.930
And for me, I know it sounds
cliche, the birth of my son

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:19.690
was miraculous.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.939
And I don't mean it like that.

00:37:20.939 --> 00:37:24.130
He got caught in, not
to get too graphic,

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.320
he got caught in my
wife's birth canal.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.369
And all of a sudden,
alarms were going off

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:30.910
and they rushed in
all these doctors.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.490
And they were going to do
an emergency c-section.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.840
And the doula who was there
told my wife talk to him.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.600
Tell him to move through it.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.620
Or they're going to have to
pull him out in an emergency.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.630
And so my wife started
yelling to him to,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.544
like seriously,
through the birth.

00:37:52.544 --> 00:37:54.710
And you could see in the
machines his heart rate was

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.800
crashing because he was stuck.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.520
And she was talking to him.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.900
And then you can see on the
monitors like objectively,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.130
this wasn't in my head.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.710
You could see objectively
he was reacting

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.430
to her asking him what to do.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.840
And it was this moment of,
it's probably the last time

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.930
he ever listened to her.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:22.060
But you could see he
was at that moment.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.185
And it was truly miraculous.

00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:25.810
DREW DOWDLE: We always
loved that idea,

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.660
like that idea that
[INAUDIBLE] said that day too.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.570
I wasn't there obviously.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:36.100
But he told me that he knows
your voice, even pre-birth,

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.430
he knows this one voice.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:41.141
And that was an idea that
really stuck with us.

00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:43.140
KEVIN VLK: Well, I love
that where it's at cause

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.720
the girl asks several
times during the movie

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.690
to hear the story.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.120
And he's like, not now, not now.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.860
And you wait.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.420
And the audience wants
to know it too, right?

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.290
And I always thought.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.030
By the end of the movie,
I kind of forgot about it.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.440
But then like--

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.030
DREW DOWDLE: Good.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.300
Perfect.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:53.720
KEVIN VLK: --I did.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.320
But then when it got to
the end all of a sudden,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.802
I was like, oh my gosh, yeah.

00:38:56.802 --> 00:38:58.010
And then they tell the story.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.051
And it's such a great tie
back to the movie cause

00:39:00.051 --> 00:39:01.999
it seems like she's a fighter.

00:39:01.999 --> 00:39:03.540
And that's what this
whole thing was.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.581
Like this family who fights
their way through and doesn't

00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:07.080
give up.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.290
So that was just amazing.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.720
DREW DOWDLE: Thank you.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:11.910
Glad you liked it.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:12.650
KEVIN VLK: Kind of one
of the last points.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.160
Yeah.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.680
What was the hardest thing to
get right in the entire movie

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.400
just throughout the process of
either writing or shooting it?

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.570
And also what was your
most proudest moment

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.229
on the film that came out
that worked out perfectly?

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:26.520
DREW DOWDLE: Oh, good question.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.020
Oh,

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.520
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE:
That's a toughie.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.800
I'd say there's a
scene near the end

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.380
where, I don't want
to give too much away.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.150
Sort of the last
clinic, there's a scene

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.730
with the oldest daughter and
Owen Wilson near the end.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.700
And it's a visceral scene.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.750
It packs a pretty big punch.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:52.650
And that was frankly the
scene I was the scared-- going

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.500
into the movie, I was like,
OK, if this isn't calibrated

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.284
perfectly, it's
not to work at all

00:39:58.284 --> 00:39:59.700
and people are
going to reject it.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.450
And

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.491
KEVIN VLK: I was also
shocked that the studio let

00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:03.660
that stay in, by the way.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.280
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: I know.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.510
KEVIN VLK: I was shocked cause
I've never seen that before.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.840
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: I know.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.270
DREW DOWDLE: Well,
If you notice,

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.860
there's literally no
way to take it out.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.860
Sometimes we design those more
challenging scenes to be like

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.280
you cannot get around them.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.000
KEVIN VLK: Against a wall and
we have no money for reshoots.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.570
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: If
you buy this movie.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.080
DREW DOWDLE: You can't go from
the scene before to the scene

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.620
after.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.540
It wouldn't make any sense.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.039
So yeah.

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:23.370
That's kind of our design.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.360
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Throwing
the kids off the roof,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.040
you assume when you see
the trailer, like oh,

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.831
that's going to be the
climax of the movie.

00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:31.756
But that happens like
halfway or a third of the way

00:40:31.756 --> 00:40:32.380
into the movie.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.160
Like that's pretty early.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.170
And then when people see that
in their heads, I think they go,

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.810
OK, well, it's only
downhill from here.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.990
But no, it keeps going.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:45.560
And so that was for us sort
of the natural conclusion.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.070
But it's such an emotional
scene for both the girl

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.400
and for the father.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.780
And it's gnarly.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.210
I would say that was
the most challenging.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.960
That's maybe the
scene I spent the most

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.820
time obsessing over and
trying to figure out

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.011
exactly how to get it right.

00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:06.260
DREW DOWDLE: In editorial too.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.280
It was exactly what length.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.850
And that one we spent probably
the most time on I would say.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:11.240
JOHN ERICK DOWDLE: Yeah.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:11.740
Yeah.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.709
Because that can't
go on too long or--

00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:16.000
DREW DOWDLE: --or be too short.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.124
KEVIN VLK: Or be too short.

00:41:17.124 --> 00:41:19.046
DREW DOWDLE: It's doing
the right balance.

00:41:19.046 --> 00:41:20.796
I'd say the one I'm
most proud of is going

00:41:20.796 --> 00:41:23.430
to be kind of a strange choice.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.136
Because it's not
any of the action.

00:41:25.136 --> 00:41:26.760
It's kind of before
the action happens.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.577
But there's a scene in the hotel
bathroom between Lake and Owen

00:41:30.577 --> 00:41:31.910
that I always loved on the page.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.820
And I was always like, OK,
hopefully this connects

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.190
and the performances are great.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.690
And hopefully the
audience likes it.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.356
Because it's kind of
an emotional couple

00:41:39.356 --> 00:41:43.060
scene, where she's trying
to suffer in silence.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:49.371
And he catches her and he
wants to make sure she's OK

00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:50.870
but you realize
what he really wants

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.990
is her to tell him that it's OK.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.240
And she won't do that for him.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.290
And we got more comments on
that scene from people like,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.160
oh I've had that
moment with my wife.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.140
Or I've had that
moment with my husband.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.445
And I don't know I'm
really proud of that moment

00:42:04.445 --> 00:42:06.111
because I feel like
the performances are

00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:07.990
just spectacular and
it really connected.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.150
KEVIN VLK: Yeah.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.280
That's really the movie.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.862
It's real and it's relatable.

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:12.570
And you watch it.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.105
And you're like, I hope
that I would act like that

00:42:15.105 --> 00:42:17.230
if I were to be put in that
situation with my kids,

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.570
or wife, or husband.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.230
It's phenomenal.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.160
So.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:21.410
DREW DOWDLE: Yeah

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.570
KEVIN VLK: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.236
DREW DOWDLE: Thank
you very much Google.

00:42:24.236 --> 00:42:25.960
It's nice to be here.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.160
KEVIN VLK: Thanks

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.710
