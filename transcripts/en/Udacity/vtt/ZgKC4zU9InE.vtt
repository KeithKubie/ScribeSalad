00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.630
So, we've now updated the diagram, which we placed the constraints and

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.850
associated the, the indirect constraints, and associated the,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.900
them with the, the components.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.140
Now we can begin to think about, well,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.350
implementing those components is going to involve being responsible for

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.310
making sure that those constraints are, in fact, satisfied.
