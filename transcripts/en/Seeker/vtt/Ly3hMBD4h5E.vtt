00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.800
Origami is the ancient art of Japanese paper
folding. For years it has been used to create

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.640
stunning works of art. But it has also been
used in maybe more surprising ways, like car

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.280
airbags, stents and even space exploration.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.540
What we want in space are large structures,
not necessarily massive, but large. Which

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.430
means you can make them out of thin materials,
and whenever you can make them out of thin

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.890
materials you can use origami to fit them
in these rockets.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.899
Many space projects have used the folding
principles of Origami; the solar array wings

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.670
on the ISS uses a z folding pattern and the
Mars Phoenix lander used a fan-folded solar

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.160
array, called the UltraFlex.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.820
Because the biggest rockets we have right
now are only about 5 meters in diameter, we

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.370
have to come up with a way of folding up this
very large structure so that we can launch

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:03.430
it in a rocket, and once it get to space it
can unfold itself... origami is one the underlying

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.460
mathematics of how large thin sheets fold
up.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.650
One origami project currently in development
at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is The Starshade,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.240
which is essentially a big star blocker. Have
you ever tried to take a picture of someone

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.000
when the bright sun is beating down on them?
Your subject is washed out and you won’t

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.350
be able to capture any detail. This is the
same problem astronomers have when trying

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.460
to image exoplanets. Currently astronomers
detect exoplanets indirectly using a shadow

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.870
technique called the transit method. For an
earth sized exoplanet orbiting a sun like

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.280
star, they can’t be imaged in detail, because
the stars they circle are much brighter than

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.650
they are. This is where the Starshade comes
in, to help block that bright light to better

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.280
help astronomers learn more about these mysterious
planets and look for biosignatures for life.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.970
One of the ways in which we're thinking about
suppressing the starlight is using something

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:10.509
called Starshade, which is a very large external
occulter …that blocks out that starlight,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.459
so we can see those really faint planets right
next to it. Sounds easy enough, but the Starshade

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.430
is roughly the size of a baseball diamond.
&nbsp;Because the Starshade is so huge...we have

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.920
to come up with a way of folding up this very
large structure into spaces that we can launch

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.180
it inside a rocket. And once it gets to space,
it can unfold itself. Which is where origami

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.470
comes in. This is one of the candidate fold
patterns that we had for the inner part of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.120
the Starshade, what we call the optical shield.
You can mathematically define how this sheet

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.300
of paper is folded up, and then by creating
what's called an isometric map… you can

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.390
define what the creases have to be on a flat
piece of paper to allow this sheet to fold

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.739
up in this very particular way. And the way
it unfolds is just like that. And it's quite

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.540
remarkable in its simplicity. This giant space
flower may seem simple in design but not in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.569
implementation. The Starshade will need to
unfold with millimeter accuracy. Once opened

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.239
thrusters will move the craft through space,
positioning The Starshade between the star

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.170
and the space telescope. With the star now
being shaded, the telescope can image the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.590
planet in detail to find out whether conditions
for life exist. Origami has been practiced

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.430
on Earth for &nbsp;years, and scientists will
continue to draw inspiration from it to help

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.409
package big space structures more efficiently.
&nbsp;From solar sails that use sunlight for propulsion,

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.099
to sun-shades for space telescopes like Gaia,
and the James Webb once it launches in 2019.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.510
We can take these ideas from origami and apply
them to spacecraft structures. Because when

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.950
it comes to the future of space exploration,
if we want to think big we also have to think

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.540
small. For more science documentaries, check
