00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Vincent Dureau: So let me show you something
else.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.990
So Rishi here is carrying his own Android
remote which by the way is paired to the same

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.530
box as I am, so that we can have two remote
controls controlling the same box at the same

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.509
time so that we don't need to fight for the
remote.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.160
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: And of course, Rishi couldn't

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.690
help it. While I was speaking, he was browsing
the Web, and he came up with a really neat

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.090
Web site that he wants to share with us. But
he doesn't want to share it on the small screen.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.710
He wants to share it on the big screen. So
how are you going to do that?

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.790
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Well, let me see -- the Wi-Fi
is kicking me off back and forth, so let me

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.400
see if I can get on really quickly. It will
a....

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.170
Okay. Let's see. All right. I am on. Hopefully
it stays on.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.399
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: I know you can do it.
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: I am watching a cool video

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.089
here, so I am actually watching it on my phone,
enabled in Flash, of course.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:03.180
Let's go ahead and take a look and see if
I can stay on again and push it directly to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.860
the TV.
[ Applause ]

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.299
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Voila.
(Video Playing).

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:24.670
&gt;&gt;&gt; Conan O'Brien: Lick your fingers first.
[ Laughter ].

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.610
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Wow! Rishi, that was a very
special video you shared with us.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.750
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Even better than what we
were watching on TV before.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.010
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Of course. All right.
So this is just the beginning. Why? Because

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.570
actually we are going to publish this IP remote
control protocol so that you developers can

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.979
build your own apps and your own remote controls
on the device of your choice, be it a PC,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.540
a smartphone, or a tablet, to enhance the
Google TV experience.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.549
All right of the so that's pretty much the
story about the hardware.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:09.250
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Rishi, do you want to tell

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.150
us about the software?
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Yeah. Can we pull back the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.520
slides, please, although I would love to keep
watching this video. It's pretty funny.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.340
All right. So let me talk a little bit about
the software. So the Google TV has three components

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.540
to the stack. The first is Android. We are
built on Android 2.1, and we will be upgrading

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.280
to later versions of Android over time, because
we have the ability to do over-the-air updates.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.120
Second, the browser. We are Google Chrome.
We needed a full Web compatible browser to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.050
be able to browse everything that's out there.
We chose the fastest.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.220
And finally, if you want to be fully compatible
with all the Web video content out there,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.670
you need to have Flash. So we also have a
full Flash 10.1 plug-in as part of chrome.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.530
And that's the software.
One thing we haven't talked too much about

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.370
yet is Android.
One of the benefits of being built on Android

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.590
and chrome is not only can we deliver great
Web applications to users, we can also deliver

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.959
Android apps.
Wouldn't it be cool if I can take my favorite

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.800
mobile app and actually just have it work
on my TV?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.790
Soon, you can.
