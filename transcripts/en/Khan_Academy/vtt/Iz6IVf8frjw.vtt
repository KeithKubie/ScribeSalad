00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.233
Voiceover:We've got 2 tables over here.

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:05.833
This first table tells us
that for any given value of X,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.566
what is the value of b to the x?

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.033
For example, if we look right over here,

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.166
if x is 1.585, b to the 1.585 is 3.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:20.899
This is telling us that b
to the 1.585 is equal to 3.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:22.653
Similarly ...

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:24.101
I can never say that ...

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:27.633
it is telling us that b to the 2.322 is 5.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.233
b to the 2.807 is 7.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.833
b to the 2.169 is 9.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.500
Now this table over here is telling us

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.766
for any given value of y,

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.234
what is going to be log base b of y?

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.633
This tells us that log base b of a is 0.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.500
Log base b of 2 is 1.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.566
Log base b of 2c is 1.585.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.900
Log base b of 10d, so this is
literally, this is telling us

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.033
that log base b of 10d is equal to 2.322.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.033
That's what this last column tells us.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:08.500
Now what I challenge you
to do is pause this video,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.166
and using just the information here,

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.433
and you don't need a calculator;

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:12.766
in fact, you can't use a calculator.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.306
I forbid you;

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:18.902
try to figure out what a, b, c, and d are

00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:21.366
just using your powers of reasoning,

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.833
no calculator involved.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.300
Just use your powers of reasoning.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.533
Can you figure out what
a, b, c, and d are?

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.966
I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.633
so let's see what we can deduce from this.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.500
Here, we have just a bunch of numbers.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.035
We need to figure out what b is.

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:45.366
These are all b to the 1.585 power is 3.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.700
I don't really know what to
make sense of this stuff here.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.433
Maybe this table will help us.

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:51.633
This first ...

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.300
Let me do these in different colors.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.233
This first column right over here tells us

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.700
that log base b of a,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.500
so now y is equal to a,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.966
that that is equal to 0.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.500
Now this is an equivalent
statement to saying

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.346
that b to the a power is equal to ...

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:13.700
oh sorry, not b to the a power.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.792
This is an equivalent statement to saying

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:22.633
b to the 0 power is equal to a.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:23.967
This is saying what exponent

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:26.168
do I need to raise b to to get a?

00:02:26.168 --> 00:02:28.100
You raise it to the 0 power.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.934
This is saying b to the
0 power is equal to a.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.566
Now what is anything to the 0 power,

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:35.167
assuming that it's not 0?

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:37.966
If we're assuming that b is not 0,

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.181
if we're assuming that b is not 0,

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:42.500
so we're going to assume that,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.633
and we can assume,

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.100
and I think that's a safe assumption

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500
because where we're raising b
to all of these other powers,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
we're getting a non-0 value.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.168
Since we know that b is not 0,

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:54.568
anything with a 0 power is going to be 1.

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:59.318
This tells us that a is equal to 1.

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:01.700
We got one figured out.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.801
a is equal to 1.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.768
Now let's look at this
next piece of information

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:07.694
right over here.

00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:09.100
What does that tell us?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.940
That tells us that log
base b of 2 is equal to 1.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.769
This is equivalent to saying
the power that I needed

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.766
to raise b to get to to 2 is 1.

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:26.166
Or if I want to write in exponential form,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:27.300
I could write this as saying

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.133
that b to the first power is equal to 2.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.500
I'm raising something to the
first power and I'm getting 2?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.966
What is this thing?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.766
That means that b must be 2.

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:40.700
2 to the first power is 2.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.366
So b is equal to 2.

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:47.434
b to the first power is equal to 2.

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:49.633
You could say b to the first
is equal to 2 to the first.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.038
That's also equal to 2.

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:54.201
So b must be equal to 2.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.900
We've been able to figure that out.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.433
This is a 2 right over here.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:58.233
It actually makes sense.

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:00.374
2 to the 1.585 power,
yeah, that feels right,

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:02.233
that that's about 3.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:04.901
Now let's see what else we can do.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:07.567
Let's see if we can figure out c.

00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:09.933
Let's look at this column.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.266
Let's see what this column is telling us.

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:15.766
That column we could read as log base b.

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:17.768
Now our y is 2c.

00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:23.600
Log base b of 2c is equal to 1.585.

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.837
Or we could read this as b,

00:04:25.837 --> 00:04:27.033
if we write in exponential form,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:34.200
b to the 1.585 is equal to 2c.

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:37.376
Now what's b to the 1.585?

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:42.366
They tell us right over here
that b to the 1.585 is 3,

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:43.834
is 3,

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:47.700
so this right over here is equal to 3.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.567
We get 2c is equal to 3,

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.968
or divide both sides by 2,

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:56.433
we would get c is equal to 1.5.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.066
This is working out pretty well.

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:01.015
Now we have this last column,

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:03.267
which I will circle in purple,

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.556
and we can write this

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:15.400
as log base b of 10d is equal to 2.322.

00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:19.967
This is saying the power I need
to raise b to to get to 10d

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:23.300
is 2.322, or in exponential form,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:31.133
b to the 2.322 is equal to 10d.

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.308
Now what is b to the 2.322?

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:34.234
They tell us over here.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:39.702
b to the 2.322 is 5.

00:05:39.702 --> 00:05:41.369
This is equal to 5.

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:44.567
We could write 10d is equal to 5,

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:46.500
or divide both sides by 10.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.833
d is equal to 0.5,

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:50.767
and we're done.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:55.233
We were able to figure out
what a, b, c, and d are

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:58.201
without the use of a calculator.
