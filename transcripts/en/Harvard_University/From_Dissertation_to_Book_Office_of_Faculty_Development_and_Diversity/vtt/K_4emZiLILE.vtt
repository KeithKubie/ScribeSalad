PHILIP LAUGHLIN: Thank you.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.910
[CLAPPING]

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.730
And I'm happy to say we did not
overlap at all in our content.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.996
We're safe.

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:11.620
First of all I'd just
like to start off

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.600
by thanking Amy Brand, the
former Cognitive Science

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.130
Editor at MIT Press for inviting
me to speak at the Harvard Club

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.706
today.

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:21.830
I'm confident this will be
the only time in my life

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.280
that someone asks me to speak
at an Ivy League institution,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.654
so I'm particularly grateful
that today's proceedings are

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.100
being videotaped and
posted on the web.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.470
I'm looking forward to sending
URL to my incredulous friends.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.210
In addition to giving me my
15 minutes of internet fame,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.730
I'm happy to be here
because preparing this talk

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.130
was an educational
experience for me.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.510
I have to confess
that although I've

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.980
been in my current position
for about 15 months,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.170
I had never even seen, let alone
read the MIT Press submission

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.010
guidelines for book proposals
until Amy had sent them

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.880
to me about three days ago.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.710
It turns out it's an extremely
useful document, definitely

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.820
more thorough and
professional than what

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.830
I have been giving authors, so
I strongly encourage everyone

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.810
here to refer to it when you
begin approaching publishers.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.787
I think the advice contained in
it is universal enough that you

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.620
could follow these
guidelines for just about

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.370
any academic publisher,
not just MIT Press.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.600
As useful as these proposal
guidelines are though,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.540
they don't give you a
sense of the process

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.910
that I go through when trying
to decide what to publish.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.650
It's sort of the difference
between reading a recipe

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.350
and cooking a meal, so I'd like
to supplement these guidelines

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.060
you have with some
background information

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.951
that you might find useful.

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:38.700
The first point that
I'd like to emphasize

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.660
to any aspiring
author is one that I'm

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.860
sure that we can
all sympathize with.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.400
And that is, yours
is not the only email

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.970
that I received today.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.970
Like most of you, I'm
drowning in e-mail.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.540
I receive about 1,000
work-related emails

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.910
every month, and the
vast majority of them

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.100
are about dozens
of book projects

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.750
that are already under contract
and being written, recently

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.030
completed and need to go into
production, and currently

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.540
in production and need to be
ready for the next catalog

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.110
season.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.009
And at any given
time, some percentage

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.950
of these projects, hopefully
a small percentage,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.840
are in crisis mode.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.000
Sometimes I'm involved in a very
delicate contract negotiation

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
with some big name author.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.130
Sometimes a manuscript has
to be rushed into production

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.680
immediately to meet
some important deadline.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.180
And sometimes an author is
irate about a copy editing,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.634
typesetting, or a
cover design job.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.050
That one doesn't
happen too often,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.508
but it does happen
occasionally, it

00:02:32.508 --> 00:02:34.900
and needs to be
addressed quickly.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110
So, a significant chunk
of my attention and energy

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.880
is already
monopolized by authors

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.610
who submitted book proposals to
me at least a year or two ago.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.560
I don't say this to discourage
anyone from contacting me.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.779
But I do want to make it
clear that, on a typical day

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.320
I'm not just sitting on my hands
hoping that someone sends me

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.890
a book proposal to look at.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.749
I usually have a pretty
full plate already.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.540
The second point that
I'd like to emphasize

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.430
is I already received far
more book proposals than I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.720
could ever hope to publish.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.810
Buried somewhere in
those 1,000 work emails

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.750
I received every month,
are about 20 to 30 queries

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.040
from potential authors who
are interested in seeing

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.130
their books published
by MIT Press.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.720
So during any calendar year,
I'm likely to receive somewhere

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.542
in the neighborhood of 250 to
350 book proposal submissions.

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:21.250
Essentially what this
means is that, even

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.820
if I apply the most rigorous
standards for acceptance

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.364
and rejected 90%
of what I received,

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:28.780
I would still have enough book
projects to meet my signing

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.074
goals and to keep MIT'S
production department busy.

00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:34.240
And in case you're wondering,
an acquisitions editor

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.810
should be publishing between
20 and 40 new books per year,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.505
depending on what
field you work in.

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:42.130
So I'd like to
emphasize that no matter

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.660
who you are, or where
you got your PhD,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.060
or how good your ideas are,
if you submit something

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.354
to me at MIT Press,
there's a very good chance

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.020
that you will receive
a polite rejection

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.590
letter from my assistant.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.780
Please don't take it personally.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.580
The problem isn't
necessarily with you,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.400
the problem is really the
system that we all operate in.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.830
I believe academics refer
to it as a social dilemma.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.330
This embarrassment of riches
that I sift through every month

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.900
definitely has an influence
in how I respond to authors

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420
and their book proposals.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.560
So a third point I'd
like to emphasize today

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.980
is, there are entire catalogs--
or entire categories of books

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.589
that I frequently
reject out of hand.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.290
For example, English
language translations.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.740
For whatever
reason, whether it's

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.823
the subject areas I've
worked in or the publishers

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:27.750
I've worked at, English
language translations

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.480
don't seem to do very well.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.210
And when I say work
very well, I am

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.720
speaking in the crudest
possible way about copies sold

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.559
and revenue generated.

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.600
I wouldn't go so far as
to say that I would never

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.190
publish a book
translated into English

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.830
from a foreign language,
but it's pretty unlikely

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.397
that I'll be interested in them.

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:47.230
Anthologies of previously
published material

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.800
is another category I'm wary of.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.570
MIT Press used to publish
anthologies very successfully

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.250
in the 1980s and 1990s.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.110
Many of those anthologies
are still in print

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.490
and continue to sell
steadily, but we've

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.240
seen a pretty dramatic decline
in the sales of new anthologies

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.884
over the past decade.

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:06.300
So I'm not quite so eager to
publish in this book category

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.860
anymore.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.460
In philosophy, the
edited conference volume

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.210
is very difficult
sell these days,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.330
and I've passed on quite a
few of them in the past year.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.690
And finally, the humble
festschrift, the edited book

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.730
in honor of an
esteemed professor,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.430
is something that
we'll do occasionally,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.120
if the right people are
involved and it fits our list,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.874
but for the most part, I try
not to make a habit of it.

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:30.290
I realize I'm starting to sound
like a broken record here,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.240
but without wishing to be
negative or discouraging,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.530
I would also include the
revised doctoral dissertation

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.306
on this list.

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:39.680
I don't think there's any
publisher anywhere in the world

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.440
that is currently plotting to
corner the market on revised

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.120
doctoral dissertations.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.156
I'm not sure exactly
how many dissertations

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:48.530
are written in
the US every year,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.180
but I'm pretty confident that
only a tiny percentage of them

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.619
are worth publishing.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:54.660
And the ones that are
worth publishing, generally

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.850
have very modest
sales potentials.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.240
And by modest, I mean
a few hundred copies,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.330
so the potential return on
investment is pretty low.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.210
To put it in stark,
realistic terms,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.700
even if your
revised dissertation

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.230
merits publication,
we're still kind

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.980
of doing you a favor
by publishing it,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.160
not the other way around.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.260
However, I will confess
that I've recently broken

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.230
my own self-imposed rule in
four of the five categories

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.202
that I've just listed.

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:21.660
Within the past
year I've signed up

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.329
an anthology of previously
published material,

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:25.870
and within the past
month alone, I've

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.730
signed up an edited conference
volume by a philosopher,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.000
a festschrift for a
philosopher, and a revised

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.887
doctoral dissertation
from a philosopher.

00:06:35.264 --> 00:06:37.930
Furthermore, it's quite possible
that in the spring of next year

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.013
I'll sign up another revised
doctoral dissertation

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:41.640
from a political theorist.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.430
So it is possible to get a
book published by a respected

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.420
University Press,
even if it falls

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.510
into one of these less
desirable categories.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.150
What did these authors
do to beat the odds?

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.050
I'll focus on the two
doctoral dissertations

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.340
since that's the purpose
of today's gathering.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.900
In the first example,
the philosopher

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.880
who I've already signed up
did something very simple,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.180
he shamelessly used
his connections.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.320
He became friendly with
a series editor of ours

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.700
and asked her for help
in crafting his proposal

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.350
and submitting it to us.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.580
This was a very clever
strategy because, if I didn't

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.170
want the book, I would have
to reject two people, not just

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.140
one.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.680
And the second person would
have to be a senior faculty

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.290
member who had previously
published a book with us

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.110
and is a pipeline for
future book projects.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.194
So even if I really wanted
to reject this project,

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.651
I would have been
forced to come up

00:07:28.651 --> 00:07:31.130
with a very compelling reason
to do so and communicate

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.174
that in a very delicate way.

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:36.090
And the second example,
the political theorist

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.870
who has not yet signed up.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.600
I had actually approached
her last spring

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480
to review a manuscript for me,
which she did a great job on,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.380
by the way.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.130
A couple of months
later, she contacted me

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.540
and asked if I was
interested in reviewing

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.120
her award-winning dissertation,
and in seeing if it would

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.549
be of interest to MIT Press.

00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:58.090
The fact that this
person had written

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.710
a very constructive review
for me in a timely manner

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.300
put her in a positive
light already,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.400
so I was a bit more
receptive to her proposal

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.880
than perhaps I would
have been otherwise.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.880
But what really got me
interested in the project

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.290
was that it had a unique
interdisciplinary thesis

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.750
that I had not seen
anywhere else-- attempting

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.390
to merge empirical psychology
with political theory.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.185
Plus she clearly knew the
MIT backlist very well,

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:21.810
and could articulate
how her book would

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.621
fit into our overall
publishing strategy.

00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:26.120
So she had clearly
done her homework

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.260
and presented
herself in a way that

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.910
made me take her seriously.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.570
In both of these
instances the authors

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.450
had a tentative
connection to the press

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.600
that they were able
to exploit-- one

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.322
through a series editor,
one by acting as a reviewer.

00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:43.780
Because of these connections,
I probably gave these authors

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.321
a little bit more of my time
and attention than they normally

00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:46.850
would have.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.249
And by a little more
of my time I mean,

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:50.790
gave their emails
a couple of minutes

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.964
rather than a couple of seconds.

00:08:52.964 --> 00:08:55.130
Of course, if the proposals
they had submitted to me

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.760
had been poorly conceived
or uninteresting,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.730
the conversation probably
would have stopped there.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.810
But the fact that they were also
able to deliver that they were

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.700
able to deliver
well-crafted proposals that

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.870
were able to withstand
the peer review process

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.194
was what really sealed the deal.

00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:15.360
But what if you don't have
an in with the publisher?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.990
What can you do to
improve your chances

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.336
of being taken seriously?

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:21.460
The first thing I would
suggest any aspiring author

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.594
is do your homework.

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:24.010
And I've always
wanted to say that

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.580
to a roomful of professors,
do your homework.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.330
Don't just start sending queries
out to any random publisher.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.590
Spend 30 or 40 minutes on Amazon
looking for the three or four

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.462
most relevant publishers for
your work and focus on them.

00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:38.170
By relevant publishers,
I mean publishers

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.880
that consistently produce
books on your subject area

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.490
to this day.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.240
If the last book that
a publisher produced

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.969
on a particular topic
was over 10 years ago,

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:49.260
that's usually a sign that
they pulled out of that area

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.890
and aren't looking
for new projects.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.890
Maybe 10, 15, 20
years ago one could

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.194
be acceptably ignorant
on this point,

00:09:59.194 --> 00:10:00.610
but today there's
really no excuse

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.280
for the author who
sends his manuscript

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.070
on pre-socratic philosophy to
the MIT Press, which actually

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.340
happened to me recently.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.140
Second, when making an initial
approach to a publisher,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.440
keep it brief.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.370
Really, I only need
three or four sentences

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.090
to determine whether or not I'm
interested in seeing something,

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.420
not three or four paragraphs,
not three or four pages,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.530
certainly not three
or four chapters.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.620
Three or four
sentences are fine.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.340
If I want to see more
material from you,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.870
I'm perfectly capable
of asking for it.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.790
What you want to avoid
at all costs is this,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.120
is my lone, low tech visual aid.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.620
This is an actual
book proposal that

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.980
was sent to me about a
month ago from an author.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.120
The very first email
that he sent me.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.870
And as you can see
it is six pages

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.150
of single-spaced material,
full of all the jargon

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.670
that Elizabeth was railing
against a few moments ago.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.510
Plus another 20
pages in attachments.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140
Unless this is a
love letter written

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.930
to me by Gisele Bundchen,
I'm not going to read this.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.650
I think I spent about
30 seconds perusing it,

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.730
and then I forwarded it to
my assistant to. reject.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.740
So, don't be this guy.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.880
Really, there's
absolutely no need

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.340
to send that much material
in an initial email.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.350
Third, if I do respond
to your initial query

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.670
and ask to see
more material, you

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.960
will really help your case
if the material you submit

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.300
follows APA style or
Chicago Manual Style.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.990
If I have to make formatting
changes to read what I've sent,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.670
that's not a good
starting position for you.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.180
There is absolutely nothing
wrong with double-spaced,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.450
New York Times Roman
font at 12 points.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.500
And it will greatly
increase the likelihood

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.480
that I will spend a few
minutes, rather than

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.540
a few seconds on your project.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.290
This seems like a very
simple thing to do,

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.570
but you'd be surprised how
many authors get tripped up

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.400
on this small detail.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.920
Fourth, if you think
your submission is--

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.470
if I think your submission
is interesting and worth

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.810
considering, I'll send
it out to three or four

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.040
external reviewers to look at.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.450
When choosing a
reviewer, I'm not

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.180
looking for your arch
nemesis or someone who

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.950
wants to make your
life miserable,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.310
but it just so happens
that reviewers can be harsh

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.270
and a little nasty sometimes.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.230
So when you respond
to reviewer reports,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.190
it's best to stay
above the fray.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.890
Don't get petty and
personal in your response.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.840
Try to separate the
substantive criticisms

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.479
from the personal ones,
and respond to those.

00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:30.020
When I present projects at are
publishing committee meetings,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.170
my colleagues definitely
reward mature adult behavior.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.890
So, an author who responds
to reviewer feedback

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.480
in a constructive way,
not a defensive way,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.130
is more likely to be approved.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.980
And finally, after all this,
if we do get to the stage

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.340
where I send you a contract
for your revised dissertation,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.300
I do have one piece of advice
for you on negotiating--

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.540
don't do it.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.720
Standard contracts don't
vary much from publisher

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.670
to publisher.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.550
And unless there is language
in the contract about waiving

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.640
constitutional rights or
giving up a firstborn child,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.880
just sign it and send it back.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.210
Getting your first book
published by a reputable press

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.920
is more important than haggling
over electronic royalties.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.930
Save it for contract number two.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.170
Thanks for listening.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.720
[CLAPPING]
