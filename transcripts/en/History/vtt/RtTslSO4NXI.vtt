00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.040
- UFO researchers have suggested
that the US Military

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.790
secretly built an installation
on the surface of the moon,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.540
to help combat an alien threat.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.000
If there are extraterrestrials
visiting the earth,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.960
and they're
potentially hostile, it

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.210
would make a great
deal of sense that we

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.540
would be prepared for this.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.080
NARRATOR: A secret military
installation on the moon?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.330
Could such claims,
along with those

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.580
made by former Canadian
defense minister

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.420
Paul Hellier, and Apollo
astronaut Edgar Mitchell,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.170
really be true?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.080
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining recently

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.750
declassified documents.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.170
July 20, 2014.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.170
The United States Army
declassifies and discloses one

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.420
of its biggest secret missions.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.830
Project Horizon.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.250
Project Horizon's mandate was
to create, by 1966, three years

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
before the first NASA
landing of men on the moon,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.620
a military base which could
hold at least 20 individuals,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.420
and which would be expanded
on over time, as well.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.790
It would be nuclear powered,
it would have its own water

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.790
supply, oxygen. And it really
would be the moon equivalent

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.960
of a military installation.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.620
The feeling was, from
the Wernher von Braun,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.880
from NASA, and indeed from
the entire government,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.290
that space would become
an important battlefield.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.960
We talk about
conventional warfare,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.120
and how that would play out.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.500
It's fairly clear that if
there is another war that space

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.790
will be a battlefield.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.500
The United States has
been working for a long time

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.000
in building new weapons
based on the technology

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500
that they've gained.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
If you control one of the
approaches to the Earth,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.170
it gives you an advantage that
you wouldn't otherwise have.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.790
Also, it's a launching
pad for anything

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.080
you want to do on Earth.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.460
NARRATOR: Could it be,
as some ancient astronaut

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.750
theorists contend, that
the US military was

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.080
successful in the construction
of a military base

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.170
on the surface of the moon?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.170
While the stated mission goal
was to establish dominance

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.460
over the Soviet Union
during the Cold War,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.040
many believe the
effort was not against

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.710
an antagonistic
global superpower,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.290
but an unknown
extraterrestrial force.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.710
JASON MARTELL: This is
even further expanded

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.540
upon when we look
at Reagan's legacy,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.120
and some of these things like
the Star Wars initiative.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.040
So it's very possible that when
we look at what was happening

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.040
in the Cold War era, maybe they
were trying to divert attention

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.500
to what was really going on.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.880
And that could
have been some type

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.880
of collaboration between
us and Russia of putting

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.330
a space base on the moon.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.790
Or doing some other
type of space platform

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.290
that currently now exists
within our solar system.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.540
There is no doubt in my
mind that Star Wars, initiated

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.830
by President Reagan, was more
related to the possibility

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.170
of being able to take the
extraterrestrials on for size

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.750
than it was against
rogue states.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.380
All of the best
information available

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.500
is that it was more intended as
a possible defense against UFOs

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.210
than it was against
rogue missiles.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.040
NARRATOR: Did the recent
disclosure of Project Horizon

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.750
only serve to try
to dissuade inquiry

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.790
into a real and escalating
military presence in space?
