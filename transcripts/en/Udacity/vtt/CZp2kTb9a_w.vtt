00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.265
Notice that I put this negative sign with the 3 in the numerator. I could have

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:08.586
also put the negative sign with the 1 in the denominator. Doing this allows us

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:12.722
to make some other moves with slope. Instead of going down 3 units and then

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:17.036
right 1, we're going to move up 3 units and left 1. We move left because the run

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.430
is negative. So here is my y intercept, and I move up 3 and then left 1. Notice

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.357
I still lined up with a point on my graph. And the same is true if I did it

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.641
again. So either way that we use the slope we can still wind up with our line.

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.839
Just be sure you use the negative in only one of the directions. In this case

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.208
the negative was with the rise, which was down. And in this case, the negative

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.631
sign was with the run, which is to the left.
