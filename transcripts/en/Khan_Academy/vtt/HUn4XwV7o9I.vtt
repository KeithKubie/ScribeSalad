00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.390
Is 3 comma negative 4 a
solution to the equation

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.060
5x plus 2y is equal to 7?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.270
So they're saying, does x
equal 3, y equal negative 4,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.600
satisfy this equation, or
this relationship right here?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.080
So one way to do it is just
to substitute x is equal to 3

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.670
and y equals
negative 4 into this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.230
and see if 5 times x plus 2
times y does indeed equal 7.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.660
So we have 5 times 3
plus 2 times negative 4.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.456
This is equal to 15.

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:34.240
15 plus negative 8, which
does indeed equal 7.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.280
So it does satisfy the equation.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.970
So it is on the line.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.120
It is a solution.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.109
x equals 3, y equals negative 4
is a solution to this equation.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.900
So we've essentially
answered our question.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.960
It is.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.614
Now, another way to
do it, and I'm not

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.030
going to go into
the details here,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.820
is you could actually
graph the line.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.870
So maybe the line might
look something like this,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.244
I'm not going to
do it in detail.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:57.400
And you see, if you have
a very good drawing of it,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.570
you see whether the
point lies on the line.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.310
If the point, when you graph
the point, does lie on the line,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.490
it would be a solution.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.080
If the point somehow ends
up not being on the line

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.650
then you'd know it
isn't a solution.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.066
But to do this, you would have
to have a very good drawing

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.250
and so you could very
precisely determine

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.540
whether it's on the line.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.030
If you do the
substitution method,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.360
if you just substitute the
values into the equation

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.010
and see if it comes
out mathematically,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.690
this will always be exact.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
So this is all we really
had to do in this example.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.500
So it definitely is a
solution to the equation.
