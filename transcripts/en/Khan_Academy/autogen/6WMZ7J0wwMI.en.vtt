00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.640
 We studied today about 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:11.070
 Exponential functions 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.660
 Exponential growth. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.340
 The following exponential function 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 y equals 3 x. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.575
 Note that 

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.260
 The independent variable x 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 The exponent is in this function. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 Draw a table that shows 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.740
 How fast exponential growth of this function and then you can draw the function curve. 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.540
 The first column values ​​x, and the second values ​​are y. 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.590
 The values ​​of x are negative 4, 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.350
 Negative 3, Negative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 Calculate y values ​​through 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.540
 Compensation for the x value in the function. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.110
 If x equals minus 4, y is equal to 3 as negative 4 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.460
 And equal 1 to 3 s4. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.420
 3S 3 equals 27, 3 hits equals 81. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.670
 If, y equals 1 on 81. 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.620
 When x is equal to minus 3, y is equal 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.530
 3 Asalab 3. 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 And equal 1 to 3 s 3 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.500
 Is equal to 1 on 27. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.050
 Note that the value of y 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.300
 Became bigger. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.460
 If x equals minus 2, y is equal to 3 ms negative 2 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.470
 And equal 1 to 3 squared, ie 1 on 9. 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.970
 When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 3 s 0 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 Equal to 1. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.750
 3 AS 1 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.370
 Equals 3. 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.825
 3 AS 2 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.200
 Equals 9. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050
 3 S 3 equals 27. 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.820
 3S4 equals 81. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.970
 3 S 5 equals 243. 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.690
 Draw a curve for these values ​​to notice 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.950
 How fast y values ​​increase. 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.495
 Draw the horizontal axis x 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.270
 The vertical axis y. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.400
 Let me do it in increments of 5, because I 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.500
 You really want to get the general shape of the graph here. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.690
 So let me draw a straight line. 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.600
 Suppose that this is 5, 10, 15. 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.240
 In fact, I will not get 81 this way. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.250
 I want to get 81 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.480
 Well, that's good enough. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390
 Let me draw it a little differently 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.030
 Of which I drew. 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.960
 Note that all y values ​​are positive 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.450
 You may notice, are positive values ​​because I have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.130
 Because the foundation is positive. 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.105
 So let me draw it like that. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.330
 Good enough. 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.750
 The coordinates of the vertical axis are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.320
 This is 80 there. 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.500
 This is 10. 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 This is 30. 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.860
 These will be good for rounding. 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.150
 The coordinates of the horizontal axis are 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.700
 This is a positive 5 here. 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.842
 In fact, let me hold it a bit more. 

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:28.990
 Negative 1, Negative 2, Negative 3 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.140
 Negative 4. 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.830
 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.980
 If x is equal to 0, y is equal to 1. 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.840
 Draw the point here. 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.860
 Somewhere out there. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.460
 When x is equal to 1, y equals 3, 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.700
 Draw this point almost here. 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.770
 If x equals 2, y equals 9 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.960
 Almost here. 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
 When x equals 3, y equals 27 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.500
 Almost here. 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.790
 If x is equal to 4, y is equal to 81, and this is the point here. 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.820
 Note that the y value has increased significantly. 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.170
 If x is equal to 5, y equals 243, ie 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.500
 The value of y increased much more. 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070
 If x is negative, y is lower 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.910
 Even at minus 1, we are at 1/9. 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.430
 And approaching 0. 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.660
 The higher the negative x values 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.220
 Y values ​​are closer than zero 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.140
 Negative A, 3 to minus a million, we are 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.590
 But it will not reach 0. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.380
 When the value of x is equal 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.060
 Negative infinity, the curve is close to zero, 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.350
 Then it starts to rise slowly 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.810
 Then suddenly rises dramatically 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.050
 The closer to the positive values. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.440
 Numbers, we will explode. 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040
 And continues to rise. 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.660
 At an increasing rate. 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.230
 So the idea here is just to show you that 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.850
 The function is really exponential, really exciting. 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.240
 There are exponential functions where exponential growth is much faster 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.880
 y equals x x. 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.690
 But the exponential growth of this function 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.970
 Also very fast. 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.220
 They moved on to the next issue 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.250
 For exponential functions. 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.970
 Someone sent a message to 10 people 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.162
 In the first week. 

00:05:22.162 --> 00:05:29.170
 He asked everyone who received the message 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.130
 Send it to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.775
 10 other people. 

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.140
 To be bad luck, your hair will fall down, and 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.350
 You will marry a frog, or anything else. 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.730
 Then send everyone the message 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.410
 To 10 other people 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.610
 In the second week. 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.250
 It is to 10 other people. 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.330
 So every one of these 10 originals sent 10 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.710
 This means that 100 people 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.860
 Receive the message. 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.500
 Each of those 10 sent 10, so that 100 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.800
 Sent messages. 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.050
 So, in the first week, 10 people received the message. 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.510
 In the second week 100 people. 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.570
 In the third week 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.260
 Each of the 100 people must send the message 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.730
 To 10 people. 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.110
 A series of messages. 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.330
 So, the total number of people who received the message until the third week is 1000. 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.840
 So, the general rule is 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.250
 Per week n 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.920
 How many people received the message? 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.960
 Week n equals 10 ms 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.080
 The number of persons 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.920
 Who received the message. 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.700
 For example, how many people received the message until the sixth week? 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.230
 How many people will receive this message? 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.140
 10 AS 6 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.150
 Equals 1 million people. 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.870
 One million people will receive this letter at 6 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.250
 Weeks, only by sending 10 messages each. 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.420
 If everyone sends the message 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.170
 To 10 people. 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.290
 But if you do, if every 10 people sent you too 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.760
 Send to 10 people and so on and so forth, by 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.420
 Week Six You will have a million people. 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.000
 Until the ninth week, the number of people is one billion. 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.610
 And so on 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.100
 You have finished the matter. 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.250
 I'll see you in the next video.
