00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:45.730 align:start position:0%
of that so what did you think of those
 

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
of that so what did you think of those
two<00:10:45.940><c> relationship</c><00:10:46.420><c> it</c><00:10:46.540><c> was</c><00:10:46.660><c> sort</c><00:10:46.900><c> of</c><00:10:46.930><c> in</c><00:10:47.050><c> the</c>

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
two relationship it was sort of in the
 

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
two relationship it was sort of in the
background<00:10:47.530><c> I</c><00:10:47.560><c> think</c><00:10:47.590><c> that's</c><00:10:47.860><c> one</c><00:10:48.010><c> of</c><00:10:48.070><c> things</c>

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.190 align:start position:0%
background I think that's one of things
 

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
background I think that's one of things
that<00:10:48.370><c> could</c><00:10:48.460><c> have</c><00:10:48.550><c> fleshed</c><00:10:48.760><c> out</c><00:10:48.850><c> yeah</c>

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.090 align:start position:0%
that could have fleshed out yeah
 

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.850 align:start position:0%
that could have fleshed out yeah
actually<00:10:52.090><c> because</c><00:10:52.360><c> I</c><00:10:52.480><c> really</c><00:10:52.780><c> was</c><00:10:53.020><c> I</c><00:10:53.320><c> was</c><00:10:53.590><c> more</c>

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:53.860 align:start position:0%

that<00:11:42.100><c> works</c><00:11:42.340><c> um</c><00:11:43.000><c> I</c><00:11:43.810><c> I</c><00:11:44.590><c> think</c><00:11:44.860><c> it</c><00:11:45.190><c> works</c><00:11:45.430><c> in</c><00:11:45.730><c> this</c>

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:45.910 align:start position:0%
that works um I I think it works in this
 

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.450 align:start position:0%
that works um I I think it works in this
in<00:11:46.090><c> the</c><00:11:46.180><c> sense</c><00:11:46.420><c> that</c><00:11:46.540><c> it</c><00:11:46.960><c> works</c><00:11:47.320><c> because</c><00:11:48.220><c> of</c><00:11:48.250><c> it</c>

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:48.460 align:start position:0%

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it works because of it
ultimately<00:11:49.300><c> doesn't</c><00:11:49.540><c> work</c><00:11:49.750><c> yeah</c><00:11:50.140><c> you</c><00:11:50.260><c> know</c>

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:50.350 align:start position:0%

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
think a sign of a good score in general
 

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.290 align:start position:0%
think a sign of a good score in general
too<00:14:42.680><c> is</c><00:14:42.860><c> when</c><00:14:43.010><c> you</c><00:14:43.100><c> don't</c><00:14:43.370><c> necessarily</c><00:14:43.790><c> like</c>

notice it like a first viewing that's
 

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.140 align:start position:0%
notice it like a first viewing that's
kind<00:14:47.780><c> of</c><00:14:47.840><c> when</c><00:14:48.260><c> it</c><00:14:48.290><c> just</c><00:14:48.830><c> fits</c><00:14:49.220><c> so</c><00:14:49.370><c> well</c><00:14:49.730><c> that</c>
