[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.092
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.500
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Thank
you guys for coming

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.540
to watch me make cupcakes.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.860
I would love for this to
be interactive and really

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.070
laid-back, so if anybody
has any questions

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.040
or wants me to talk
about something specific,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.470
you could blurt it out, or you
could say, "hey," or whatever,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.830
or use the microphone.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.880
We're going to do two
things together today.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.460
First, I'm going to make three
of our seven limited-edition

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.510
Valentine's Day flavors, which
you have here, which I highly

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.516
recommend getting.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.390
Obviously, I'm Melissa
from Baked by Melissa,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.240
and I want you to purchase
our product that I

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.560
worked so hard to create.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.740
But also, our Valentine's
Day collection

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.780
are some of the best flavors
we've ever had before,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.290
and it's our busiest
time of year,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.040
and I'm just most
proud of these.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.730
So I highly recommend them.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.660
Also, the packaging
is beautiful.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.860
You have this love
letter gift-box.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.910
I'm sorry, I have to.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.910
I'm so proud.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.550
It's like it's my child.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.560
Just a little fun
fact is that I used

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.750
to work with Deutsch
Advertising, which

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.420
had its office on
the 14th floor,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.730
and my cubicle was there.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.880
And I was fired
from my job there,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
and that's ultimately
what got me baking--

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.590
or I was baking, but
starting Baked by Melissa,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.240
so this is super
cool and full-circle,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.324
and I'm very honored to be here.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.642
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:36.220
And I'm pregnant.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.115
It's not cupcakes.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:40.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.220
OK.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670
Anyway, so I'm going
to make three flavors.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.660
The first flavor is my
absolute favorite flavor.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.430
It's our dark chocolate cupcake.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.489
I love dark chocolate.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.280
I eat a piece of dark
chocolate every night

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.720
before I go to sleep.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.051
Now I'm just going
to pop one of these.

00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.050
It's so weird that we've
never done this before,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.045
because it's so simple.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.670
And if you've ever been curious
as to how we make the cupcakes,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.530
now you'll see.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.670
And you could totally
apply this at home

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120
if you feel like stuffing
your own cupcakes.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.169
They'll probably be
a little bit bigger

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.500
until we start selling
the pans, but in order

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.710
to stuff a cupcake, all you
have to do is put your icing

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.920
or filling in a pastry bag,
and puncture the cupcake,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800
and just squeeze.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.160
It's so simple.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.210
When we first started the
company, I'm not like oper--

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.790
now, I'm pretty
operational, but I

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.690
used to use a knife to cut
a hole in every cupcake,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.590
and then stuff it.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.740
And then, a few
years ago, I realized

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.960
you could just do this.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.180
You know, they sell those
corers for the cupcakes.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.340
This is a dark
chocolate ganache,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.040
and this is our dark
chocolate icing.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.000
If you happen to have "Cakes
by Melissa," my cookbook,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.340
or get one, there's a
chocolate icing recipe.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.210
If you switch out the Hershey's
cocoa powder for the Hershey's

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.970
dark cocoa powder, you'll
get a dark chocolate icing,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.100
and it's so good.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.940
Have you guys tried this one?

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.910
It was the ones topped
with mini chocolate

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.950
chips and the pink
and red nonpareils.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.789
AUDIENCE: It's really good.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:18.830
It's my favorite cupcake.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.163
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: It's so good.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.180
And then, after we do
these three flavors,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.340
the next flavor is going to
be cookies and milk, which

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.330
is a vanilla version
of cookie dough.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.200
And it's also made with
a Chips Ahoy cookie

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.590
icing, because I just really
like dessert and snacks,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.660
and that's how I create.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.050
So when I was thinking about
doing a cookies and milk

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.450
flavor, I knew that it needed
to have Chips Ahoy cookies,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780
because when I was
growing up, that's what

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.470
cookies and milk means to me.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.850
You know, dipping the Chips
Ahoy cookie in the milk,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.766
and then letting the bubbles
come up until it got soggy.

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:07.789
Oh my god, I'm lying.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:08.830
I'm not doing Chips Ahoy.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.990
I'm not doing cookies and milk.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.800
I'm doing salted
caramel pretzel, which I

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.285
think we call white chocolate.

00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:17.410
SPEAKER 1: White chocolate.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.201
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
White chocolate pretzel.

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:20.279
So this one's good too.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.310
It's stuffed with
dulce de leche,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.070
and the icing is actually--

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.640
OK, but here, it's
the perfect example.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.480
The icing is a pretzel icing.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.490
So I wanted to figure out a
way to do a salty, sweet type

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.310
of cupcake without
just doing something

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.590
basic like salted caramel.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.200
And so I decided to put pretzels
in the icing and the brittle,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.610
so this is white chocolate
mixed with ground pretzels,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.080
and it's-- well, you tried it.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.210
I hope you liked it.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.450
But it's salty and
sweet, and to me, it

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.290
tastes like pretzels and
caramel, and it's amazing.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.800
So I'm just going to finish
icing these and top them,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.240
and then we'll do
the last flavor.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.100
And then, after that, I
am going to make a layer

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.850
cake for you guys.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.099
SPEAKER 1: Question over here.

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.240
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about-- do you still come up

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.831
with all the new
flavors yourself,

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:23.080
or do you have a team, or--
how involved are you still

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.863
in that process?

00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:25.654
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
That's a great question.

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:27.970
I'm very much involved
in that process.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.556
I create and conceptualize
every new flavor and product

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:34.180
that we create.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.410
I'm sorry.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.140
I get out of breath
randomly sometimes.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.850
It's new.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.230
I think it's because of that.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.147
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:45.670
So I apologize.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.150
I met my husband the day we
opened our very first store.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.980
It's a great, crazy story of
how we started the company.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.330
He's part of it.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.300
And I wound up hiring
him, and the two of us

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.989
used to ice every single cupcake
together, the first two years

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.030
that we were in business.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.470
And now he works in the
bakery and in corporate,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.980
and my role is president
and chief product officer.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.370
So I create and
conceptualize everything,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.740
but then he brings
it to production.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.130
So we work together.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.510
So I'll be make a pretzel
icing, and he'll be--

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.440
or this brittle, for example.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.300
You have to be able to produce
it to make thousands of them,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.930
so sometimes my requests
are a little silly.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.120
But he always figures
out ways to make

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.930
them work, and
sometimes he even takes

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.690
what I've either created
once or I'm asking for,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.040
and makes it even better.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.630
It's a very fortunate
partnership.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.690
The last of the three
flavors that I am making

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.450
is chocolate cookie dough.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.090
So cookie dough and cookie
flavors, in general,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.560
are a very popular thing for us.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.460
Everyone loves them.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.160
So this is a chocolate
version of cookie dough.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.910
It is chocolate cake.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.140
The stuffing is a chocolate
version of cookie dough,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.030
so it has cocoa in it, and it's
salty and sweet and delicious.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.000
It's iced with vanilla
icing, and it's

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.774
topped with chocolate
cookie dough that is here.

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:32.160
It kinda looks like
the poop emoji, but--

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:38.325
--there is a pink drizzle that
we put on top to make it look

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:39.210
like--

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.180
it works.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.540
It's crazy.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.875
But my pink chocolate
didn't melt so well,

00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:50.750
so you're just going to
get the cookie topping.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.730
And those are three of the
Valentine's Day flavors.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.975
I don't know where my
gloves are, maybe--

00:07:57.975 --> 00:07:59.660
well, here.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.366
So then you literally just--

00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:03.490
I would have put gloves on.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.790
It's just neater and easy,
but it's not a big deal.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.740
And that's the chocolate
cookie dough cupcake.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.500
It gets confusing.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500
We have cookies and cream,
we have cookie dough,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.260
we have chocolate cookie dough,
we have a double-cookie flavor,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.660
which is coming back soon.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.320
But cookies are so good,
and cookies with cake

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.210
are even more amazing.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.590
OK.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.556
Does anybody want a freshly
cupcake baked by Melissa?

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:34.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.880
OK, so that was part one.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.539
That's just, you know, why I'm
here-- bite-sized cupcakes.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.860
They're really amazing.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.610
I could ice cupcakes
all day long.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.850
I used to.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:54.350
For two years, that's all I
did, was ice and bake cupcakes,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.980
and I couldn't
have been happier.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.170
But we grew the business,
so now I do a lot of things.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.250
So in October, I came out
with a book that I wrote.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.060
It's called "Cakes by
Melissa," and the reason

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.890
that I felt like I
needed to write a book

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.290
was because I had all of
these recipes in my head

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.640
that I'd been using for Baked
by Melissa all the time.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.530
And even though you can't
make bite-sized cupcakes,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.820
I really wanted the
reader to be able to think

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.640
the way I think and get
creative the way I create.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.420
So I think it achieved that.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.780
And it takes you through
my creative process

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.700
of coming up with these
random flavor profiles,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.280
starting with a very base--

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.170
like vanilla cake,
as an example--

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.840
and then adding one
or two ingredients.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.330
And you can make anything.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
If you take your
vanilla cake base

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.450
and replace the liquid,
which is whole milk,

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.667
with strawberry puree, you
get this bomb strawberry cake.

00:09:57.667 --> 00:09:59.250
And it's crazy, and
it's super simple.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.720
And people always
think that baking

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.120
is crazy and really complicated,
but I don't think it is.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.540
So the cake that I'm going
to make for you guys today

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.230
is the tie-dye cake, because
that's why we're here.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.360
But we don't have a
ton of time together,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.450
so the cake is already made,
and my husband made it.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.280
He sent it to us.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.510
So it's big, so it's on one of
our sheet pans from the bakery.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.570
And I like to make my
layer cakes this way,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.090
because I don't like the crust.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.640
And obviously, in
the book, the recipe

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:48.900
is for a quarter-sheet
pan, because that's normal.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.500
But you know, we got this one.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.800
So you wouldn't have as much
scrap as I'm going to have,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.910
so don't judge.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.330
And I use the scrap to
decorate the cake too.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.500
But you take six-inch or however
big you want your cake to be--

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.670
Amazon is amazing.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.830
You can get anything
you need on Amazon,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.600
and you don't have
to be a baker.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.800
You can Google recipes.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.430
You could get "Cakes by Melissa"
and use those recipes and order

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.020
everything you need, and
then just have a lot of fun.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.680
So I actually didn't know
that these things existed

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.870
until I searched on
Amazon, because I wanted

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.480
to be able to make
cakes of all sizes

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.000
when I was recipe-testing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.580
So I like to punch
out my layers,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.270
because then it's like the
whole cake is delicious.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.040
You know?

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.190
Layer one.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.120
Got my vanilla icing.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.410
Does anyone know the three
ingredients in vanilla icing?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.609
AUDIENCE: Sugar.

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:48.650
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Sugar.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.119
AUDIENCE: Butter,
sugar, vanilla.

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:51.160
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Great.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.930
Butter, sugar, vanilla extract.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.530
It's so easy.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.050
I actually added a
little bit of whole milk

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.639
to this, because when
I'm spreading on cake--

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:03.180
you know how it can
get really messy?

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:10.760
This just makes it a much
smoother consistency,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.690
and it's much--

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.190
see?

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.795
It's so easy.

00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:17.170
So a little icing
between each layer.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.990
So before, again, I
wanted to write a book,

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.260
but I wasn't sure how I would
get the bit-sized cupcakes

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.560
through in this book that I
knew I couldn't give you recipes

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.350
for, because it's
impossible to bake them.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.430
And that's when I learned
how to make cakes.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.180
I had obviously
made cakes before,

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.060
but I had never really
put together a layer cake.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.350
So I'm telling you--

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.550
I'm not just saying this.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.740
Obviously, yes, I work
with my hands for a living,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.650
and I make cupcakes, but
if I could put together

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.280
these cakes--

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.490
I'm not the neatest
person in the world--

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.710
then anyone can.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.620
So that's layer two.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.710
It's like making a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.200
And then more vanilla icing.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.510
Does anyone have
any other questions?

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.150
What do you want
me to talk about?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.680
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that people really go crazy

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.777
for the cookie flavors?

00:13:12.777 --> 00:13:13.735
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Yes.

00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:17.470
AUDIENCE: And so I was just
curious what metrics like that

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.540
have to do with your
flavor development.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.650
Do you use those metrics
to figure out next flavors?

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.530
And how do you do that,
but also keep to what

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.940
you want your tastes to be?

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.731
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
That's a great question.

00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:34.750
So luckily, I've found
that, for the most part--

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.870
I'm not a vanilla person.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.460
The tie-dye cupcake is
our number-one seller.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.391
Thank goodness it is
our signature flavor.

00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:43.390
It makes complete sense.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.555
It's great for our brand,
but it's not my go-to.

00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:47.365
It's my daughter's.

00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:50.080
She loves it.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.970
But with that said,
for the most part,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.660
I know when a flavor
is going to be amazing.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.150
So the dark chocolate,
as soon as I tasted it,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.070
I just did a happy dance, and
I couldn't stop eating it,

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.050
and it's selling
so well right now.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.080
We obviously look at the
data, every week, actually.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.090
Mondays are dedicated
to sales meetings

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.380
to go over the previous week.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.820
And one of the
reports we look at

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.670
is the cupcakes and how
they sold a la carte,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.150
because that's super helpful
for me in product development.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.385
And I know that the Baked by
Melissa customer loves vanilla,

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:35.320
and chocolate, and
cookies, and stoner-type--

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.930
it's called Baked by
Melissa, so the double-cookie

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.620
is Oreo, cookie
dough, chocolate.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.580
It's so good.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.910
And that's what I
like, so it works.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.850
But I'm always looking to
see what's sells the best.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.620
Sugar cookie dough--

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.540
I have this sugar
cookie dough recipe

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.790
that I just Googled and
fell in love with, and maybe

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.560
changed a little.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.330
But really, it's just this
standard sugar cookie dough

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.740
recipe that I was making
for my whole office,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.490
and they loved it.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.190
I was like, oh my god, how
could I get this in a cupcake?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.600
And then I developed a
sugar cookie dough icing,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.020
which is sugar cookie dough
but with an icing consistency,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.580
and everyone freaked
out over that.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.038
And I kind of knew
that they would,

00:15:17.038 --> 00:15:20.890
because it's vanilla but cookie.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.690
So I get you guys.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.980
You know?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.080
AUDIENCE: Is there a
flavor that surprised,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.170
that sells as well as it
does, that you didn't expect?

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:37.930
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: I
like things that are--

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.910
I like double-cookie.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.700
So I guess I was pleasantly
surprised to see the tie-dye--

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.100
tie-dye is going strong.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.150
Tie-dye has been our
most popular flavor

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.410
since we started the company.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.320
And then, when
the book launched,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.620
I created an electric
tie-dye, which is just

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.630
brighter-colored tie-dye.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.215
And the two are neck-and-neck,
and every week I'm

00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:03.590
sitting in the conference
room, and I look at the report,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.900
and I'm like, yeah!

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.450
I root for electric tie-dye.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.066
I don't know why.

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:12.050
I like the newer one, I like
the colors, it's super bright.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.750
So that surprised me, because--

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.010
vanilla.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:15.790
So I get it.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.280
People like vanilla.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.710
Who likes vanilla
here, over chocolate?

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.195
Who likes chocolate
over vanilla?

00:16:26.195 --> 00:16:28.180
See, so it's surprising, right?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.830
But it's also very
colorful, and I've

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.380
learned that people
eat with their eyes.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.080
So in order for a flavor of
anything to be successful,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.290
it has to be equally as
beautiful as delicious.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.170
And it sounds like it's
not rocket science,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.325
but when I look at other
products out there--

00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:46.850
or when I go to a bakery,
or restaurant, whatever--

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.850
you really have to
sell with the way

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.830
it looks, and then the
taste is the other half.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.760
OK.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.470
So I stacked the cake.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.910
Three layers is
what I recommend.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.310
Otherwise, it gets
very difficult.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.020
A spinny thing is super helpful.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.980
And you see, it's
not super straight.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:15.770
No promises, but because
you have the spinny thing,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.788
it helps, because you
could spin it, and then--

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:19.329
I don't know.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.290
It's crazy.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.865
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.865 --> 00:17:27.040
So there's this thing that
we refer to as a crumb coat.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.060
This is the crumb coat.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.610
So you do this thin
layer of icing around it.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.810
You do a thin layer of
icing around the cake first,

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.010
and that just keeps
everything neat and together,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.760
and then you go back
and you ice it again.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.676
You're really supposed
to pop it in the fridge

00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:47.530
and let the icing harden,
and then do another layer.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.870
But I also like to
complicate things,

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.530
so I'm going to
put glaze on here.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.112
And it's really pretty--

00:17:54.112 --> 00:17:55.945
the little crumbs,
because they're colorful.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.290
But you could just do a
crumb coat on a tie-dye cake

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.060
and leave it.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.200
It looks like Funfetti.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.180
So "Cakes by Melissa"
came out in October,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.730
and I did all of this press,
and I work with my husband.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.320
And we have this weird
competitive nature,

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.260
but it really works,
and that's how

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.930
we come up with such amazing
flavors for Baked by Melissa.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:24.020
And I did a ton of live segments
like this, but for CNBC,

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.020
where you have a five-minute
segment and 30 seconds

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.687
to ice the cake.

00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:30.228
And one night, we were lying in
bed, and he's like, you know,

00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:31.630
when you do the
cakes on live TV,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.270
you should probably
make them look

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.730
really symmetrical and nice.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.478
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.478 --> 00:18:39.510
I was like, you try doing that!

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.255
It's so hard.

00:18:40.255 --> 00:18:42.325
So I'm going to try
and make this one

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:47.435
look really symmetrical
and nice for my husband.

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:48.810
And I'm going to
go home tonight,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.935
and when we're lying in
bed, I'm going to tell him.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.900
I appreciate all feedback.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.940
I think it's super important.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.380
See, look!

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.630
It's pretty nice so far, right?

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.610
You've just got to--

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.350
don't over-think it.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.410
You're baking to enjoy.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.230
That's why I bake.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.960
That's why we're all here,
because I love to bake.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.610
So when you're baking at
home, you should enjoy it.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:26.460
And I associate Valentine's
Day with baked goods, because--

00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:32.035
so if you don't want
to buy cupcakes--

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:33.250
which is totally cool.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.130
I get it-- you should make
something and think of me.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:38.896 --> 00:19:40.515
No, but it's just fun.

00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:41.890
I think you'll
have a great time.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:47.800
Do it with your friends, or
whomever-- your kid, your--

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.600
OK.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.550
So far, so good, right?

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.230
I think you're
actually technically--

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.781
I follow a lot of cake
makers on Instagram.

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:00.280
They usually start with the
top, and every time I watch one,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.181
I'm like, oh, I should
start on the top.

00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:02.930
And then I forget.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.810
One question that people
ask me all the time is

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.640
how we started Baked
by Melissa, of course,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.830
and what did you do differently?

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.670
All this stuff.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.460
And I think one
thing that's super

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.325
important to anyone who wants
to be successful at anything--

00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:24.130
can you see the prettiness of--

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.940
there's little specks
of the colors inside.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.810
There's a certain
attitude that I

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.770
think is necessary for
success in anything,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.600
especially in starting
your own business,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.110
and it's a positive attitude.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:43.020
And I know that sounds
crazy, but my attitude when

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.970
I was fired from my job--

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:53.400
so I was literally sitting
at this sink in my cubicle.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.917
And I was called to
HR, and I thought

00:20:55.917 --> 00:20:58.542
I was getting a promotion, and
I was fired, and I was so upset.

00:20:58.542 --> 00:21:01.986
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.470
True.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.454
I was so upset, guys.

00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:07.620
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.920
But I was like
anyone who got fired.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.370
I thought it wasn't my
fault, and I wanted to,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.060
you know, whatever-- retaliate.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.390
So I thought it was so unjust.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.440
I went right to my
brother's office, crying,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.339
and he said, go home
and start your business.

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:27.880
So go home, bake
your cupcakes, we'll

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.090
start a business out of it.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.600
And it's not crazy,
because I love to bake.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.260
And at the time, I--

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.730
Right?

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.230
It's pretty.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.862
OK.

00:21:38.862 --> 00:21:40.570
I don't have a lot of
time left, but I am

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.160
going to finish the story too.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.960
But while I'm doing that,
I'm going to make glaze.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.880
This is the best
part of this cake.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.350
I take things too far.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.510
If I mess something up,
I'll put glaze on it,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.180
and it'll cover it up.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.200
So I didn't mess
this one up, but I'm

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.830
going to put glaze on
it, because it's so fun.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.830
And glaze is very complicated.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.910
This is powdered sugar.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.910
And I'm going to add whole
milk, and that's glaze.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.530
I'm going to use a spoon.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.820
OK.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.690
So my brother is an
entrepreneur, a mad scientist

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.120
entrepreneur--

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.186
always had new business
ideas all the time.

00:22:21.186 --> 00:22:22.810
And I love to bake,
and I always wanted

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:28.400
to go into business with him,
start a business with him.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.510
So when he said, go home
and bake your cupcakes,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.510
I was like, great.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.400
It's a great idea,
because I'm really upset,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.890
and I like to do that,
and it'll make me happy.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.020
And at the time, I was
baking my tie-dye cupcakes--

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.470
I'm just going to move this--

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.452
for everyone and anyone.

00:22:47.452 --> 00:22:49.160
If it was your birthday
and I loved you--

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.326
and I love a ton of people--

00:22:50.326 --> 00:22:51.680
I baked you tie-dye cupcakes.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.900
And the reason that I did that
was A, because I love to bake,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.730
but B, because has anyone
ever baked something delicious

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.395
and given it to somebody?

00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:02.720
It's the best feeling.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.010
Truly, that's why I did it.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.080
It was totally selfish.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.730
I loved to bake for people
because it made me feel good,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.640
and I did it all the time.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.110
And I had been known
for my tie-dye cupcakes.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.510
So when he said to do it,
I was like, great idea.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.720
I baked four batches of
cupcakes the night I was fired.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:25.590
My tie-dye, cookie dough,
s'mores, and peanut butter cup.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.950
I would say those are my
four favorite flavors.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.620
And I wound up sending them
into work with my best friend's

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.380
little sister, who was
interning at Alison Brod PR.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.440
Anyone heard of
Alison Brod, maybe?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.330
She was like a celebrity to me.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.590
I'm not neat in the kitchen.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.680
A female who started
her own business.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.510
All women work there, whatever.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.772
I hoped that she would
try the cupcakes herself,

00:23:51.772 --> 00:23:53.980
but I didn't even know if
she went to work every day.

00:23:56.956 --> 00:23:59.020
I just didn't know.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.450
But in the back
of my mind, I was

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.200
hoping that Alison
would see the cupcakes,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.658
and something
amazing would happen.

00:24:03.658 --> 00:24:06.670
And would you know, that's
exactly what happened.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.370
So I sent all these
cupcakes into work

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.980
with Carly, who was
interning there--

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.980
I'm out of breath again.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.500
I'm sorry.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.680
And Alison saw them.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.274
She had her caterer in the
office, luckily, at the time.

00:24:23.274 --> 00:24:25.190
And she was like, Ben,
look at these cupcakes.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.540
They're amazing.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.706
You should reach out to her.

00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:27.740
So he did.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.250
So I got a call from
Alison Brod's caterer.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.670
The day after I was
fired from my job,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.165
he wanted to bring me
into his office, which

00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:35.915
was his apartment.

00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:36.950
It was a little shady.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.310
I went with it for a tasting.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.110
So I ran back to my
brother's office,

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.760
and I was like, holy shit,
I just got to a tasting

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.990
with Alison Brod's caterer.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.570
And he had his own business,
building websites for people,

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.420
so it was perfect.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.920
I said, we have to
go, and they were

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.150
like, we have a
business already,

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.110
he could be a part of it.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.568
I'm splitting it
up into two bowls,

00:24:58.568 --> 00:25:00.520
and I'm going to dye each one.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.025
Pink and blue, because those
are my favorite colors,

00:25:04.025 --> 00:25:07.520
and because they look
beautiful when they combine.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.240
So we were like, OK, we
need a name and a logo.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.662
I wanted to go in there like
I had a business already,

00:25:13.662 --> 00:25:14.870
and he could be a part of it.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.420
Otherwise, what would
come from the opportunity?

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.520
That was my mindset.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.832
And Brian and Matt were
totally cool with it.

00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:26.550
Is there a spoon,
like a soup spoon?

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.359
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:29.400
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Great.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.190
A-ha.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.710
Perfect.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.180
Thank you.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.410
So you don't need
complicated stuff.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.215
So my brother's business partner
at the time for Muse Box,

00:25:40.215 --> 00:25:41.840
which was the web
development company--

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.780
and it was literally just the
two of them in this little tiny

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.700
office on 38th and 8th--

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.290
was also our
childhood friend Matt.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.370
So he knew me very well.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.350
So my brother insisted that
the name of the company

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.560
had a personal tie, so we
liked Baked by Melissa.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.540
I really wanted the
company to be called Baked,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.370
but he insisted that
my name was in it,

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.040
which I'm so thankful about.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.760
And Matt created the logo,
and it's the same exact logo

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.520
we had today.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.890
I think I cried when I saw
it, because it's so perfect,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:16.950
and it's so who I am and
who our brand is now.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.550
And I mocked up bakery
boxes with our logo.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.095
I got flat pastry boxes from
the Clover Deli on 34th and 2nd,

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:26.220
which was right across the
street from my apartment

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.260
at that time.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.960
And I went to the
caterer for a tasting.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.230
He loved the cupcakes, and I
did my first event with him less

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.390
than a week after I was fired.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.480
We made business cards that
had my name, my home address,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.670
and my cell phone number,
but they were also

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.880
branded Baked by Melissa,
so they looked so legit.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.621
My parents were like,
what is happening?

00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:51.870
People are just going to be
knocking on your apartment

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.980
door.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.260
Literally, suite 27G.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.325
I was apartment 27G.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.570
And yeah, so people
came, and they

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.820
saw these unbelievable
bite-sized cupcakes

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.634
that were so beautiful
and also delicious.

00:27:04.634 --> 00:27:07.300
Everyone knew cupcakes, but they
had never seen them bite-sized,

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.832
which was so cute.

00:27:08.832 --> 00:27:10.290
And they would take
a cupcake, then

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.730
they would take a
business card, and then

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.188
you would go to
bakedbymelissa.com,

00:27:13.188 --> 00:27:18.510
which Brian and Matt
obviously helped me create.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.820
And we founded the
company together.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.377
So the three of us
worked our butts off

00:27:23.377 --> 00:27:24.585
to get to where we are today.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.040
We shot the whole website
on my Ikea coffee table

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.370
with a white bed sheet between
the table and the cupcakes,

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.650
using my Canon
point-and-shoot camera.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.027
And when people
saw the cupcakes,

00:27:40.027 --> 00:27:41.610
they went to Baked
By Melissa, and you

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.270
could purchase 100 cupcakes
or more to be delivered by me,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.090
from my apartment,
using the subway.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:52.780
I would put a Baked by Melissa
sticker on a white pizza box.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.070
And that's how we
started Baked by Melissa.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.459
I did events, I
cold-called caterers,

00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:00.750
I took advantage of every
opportunity that came my way.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.100
OK.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.180
Glaze time.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.410
This is just really fun.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.380
So I like tie-dye
and bright colors.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.790
Therefore, the cake is going
to be very much like that.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.780
So while we were
shooting the book,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:21.680
I realized that if you alternate
colors of glaze, on a cake,

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.700
it makes a tie-dye effect.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.070
And a beautiful shade of purple.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.230
So that was 10 years
ago, which is crazy.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.730
So since then, we've
opened 14 retail locations.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.570
We ship our product
nationwide, so you

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.320
can send these to anyone.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.430
bakedbymelissa.com.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.365
Google love.

00:28:49.365 --> 00:28:51.600
Can you see the top?

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.410
I just want to--

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.280
OK, anyway.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.570
And then this is
an offset spatula.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.800
This is a baby one.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.460
Oh, it's so pretty.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.710
It'll start to drip,
and you could totally

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.820
control all this stuff,
based on how much liquid you

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.140
put in the glaze.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.410
If you want it to drip more,
then you put more liquid.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.590
If you want to cover the whole
cake, you could do that too.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.060
I just like to have fun with it.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:26.500
Glaze dries really quickly,
so you have to move quick.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.870
It's just so pretty.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:29.801
OK, watch this.

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:30.300
Ready?

00:29:35.668 --> 00:29:43.290
And you could make
it like tie-dye.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.590
Yeah, it's fancy.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.130
I'm very fancy.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.570
There we go.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.596
I guess I could probably
make it look prettier.

00:29:54.596 --> 00:29:55.677
You know what?

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.710
I make little smudges.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.000
But this is how I create things.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.270
I just go with it, and
the end result is always

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.510
beautiful, no matter what.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.599
Does anybody have any
questions for me, while I--?

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:17.390
AUDIENCE: How do you
mass-produce something

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.837
that seems so individualized?

00:30:18.837 --> 00:30:20.295
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
That's so funny.

00:30:20.295 --> 00:30:21.600
That's a great question.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.310
So when the book came
out, my CEO and I,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.210
who was probably my favorite
person in the world--

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:33.819
we were like, shit, are people
going to want to buy cakes now?

00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:36.110
We just came out with a book
called "Cakes by Melissa."

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.750
Are they going to assume
that we sell cakes?

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.850
So we had to figure that out,
how to mass-produce cakes.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.760
So what we do is we
make these sheets--

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.890
my husband does.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.230
He makes all of these
sheets of tie-dye cake,

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.900
and then we have one
person who assembles them.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.620
And I took a really long--

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.550
it's pretty quick.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.970
We do sell a tie-dye
cake just like this

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:06.230
at bakedbymelissa.com.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.720
You can pre-order it.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.820
We say four days in advance, but
of course we make exceptions.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.510
And wow, it's so pretty.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.840
You can pre-order it, and
then pick-up is in-store only.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.470
It's funny, because
Alison Brod has

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.940
been ordering a
ton of these cakes,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.120
and I just love her so much.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.230
I would do anything for her.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.280
So I actually handwrite
"Happy Birthday"

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.120
to whomever she wants,
which we do not do,

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.800
but whatever Alison
wants, Alison gets.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.400
So I do that for her.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.010
And they're actually iced--

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.629
this cake is-- I did
this for the first time

00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:46.920
when we were shooting the book.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.694
I didn't plan.

00:31:48.694 --> 00:31:50.860
I could have never told you
what this cake was going

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.980
to look like before I made it.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.460
But the cake that I made while
we were shooting the book

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.990
inspired the cake
that we now sell,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.140
and it's so beautiful, and
so delicious, and so moist.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.699
It's very moist.

00:32:05.699 --> 00:32:06.198
Sorry.

00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:08.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.720
What do you guys
think about that word?

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.714
Do you think it's gross?

00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:15.454
AUDIENCE: No, I'm OK with it.

00:32:15.454 --> 00:32:17.370
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: For
baking, it makes sense.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.220
But we have conversations
about that word a lot

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:27.010
in my line of work, meaning
at Baked by Melissa.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.520
We don't use it
in our marketing,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.920
although I fight for it,
because it is, our product.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.100
And then this is
my sprinkle blend.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.590
And there.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.900
There's my tie-dye cake.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:47.714 --> 00:32:51.370
SPEAKER 1: I believe we
have a few boxes of cupcakes

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.560
to give away for anybody
who has questions.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.096
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Oh.

00:32:55.096 --> 00:32:56.720
SPEAKER 1: And people
who asked already

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.535
can get one too, don't worry.

00:32:58.535 --> 00:33:01.265
Can you pass the mic back there?

00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:03.390
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Everyone
should just grab a fork

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.320
and take a bite.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.177
That's what I would do,
but that's not appropriate.

00:33:16.141 --> 00:33:19.292
It's like an arts-and-crafts
project that you can eat.

00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:23.180
AUDIENCE: So did you
always make mini cupcakes?

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.570
Did you ever make larger ones?

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:29.039
Or what made you decide to
then do cupcakes specifically?

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.080
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: I always
baked large cupcakes.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.190
I really love cupcakes, so
I wanted to eat big ones.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.795
But I also would eat two
large cupcakes a day,

00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:40.170
and I knew that
if I was starting

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.750
a business with a product, it
had to be unique and different

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.590
in some way.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.030
So we decided to
make it just a bite.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.550
This way, you could
try every flavor

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.450
without the
post-dessert field trip,

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.710
and everything's
under 50 calories.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.460
It's all real, the best
butter, sugar, Hershey's cocoa,

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.830
Hershey's chocolate, Chips
Ahoy cookies, Oreos--

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.072
but it's just 50 calories.

00:34:02.072 --> 00:34:03.780
Less than that, because
it's just a bite.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.699
It's perfect.

00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:07.740
AUDIENCE: It's brilliant.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.240
Yeah.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.199
RIP Crumbs.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:13.090
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
I love all cupcakes.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.949
AUDIENCE: I have
a few questions,

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.860
but on that note of loving all
cupcakes, living in New York,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.500
do you have any other--

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.949
besides your own-- any other
favorite stops around the city?

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:26.340
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
I love Sprinkles.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.429
I do.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.750
I love their strawberry cake.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.280
I really just love it all.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.550
I love all cupcakes.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.190
I even like Crumbs' cupcakes.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.960
There, I said it.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.580
I used to get two Crumbs
cupcakes every day,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.995
from the Clover Deli.

00:34:42.995 --> 00:34:44.370
They didn't say
they were Crumbs,

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.409
but I know that
they were Crumbs,

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:51.206
or they were made by
the same people who--

00:34:51.206 --> 00:34:52.729
yeah.

00:34:52.729 --> 00:34:53.639
Any other questions?

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.409
AUDIENCE: Being a mom, working--

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.589
how do you do [INAUDIBLE] that?

00:34:58.589 --> 00:35:00.630
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: When
I first had my daughter--

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.530
so she's two now--

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.080
I was like, oh, you know, I just
work hard and do everything,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.310
give my all, which is true.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.380
I do, and it's hard.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.906
So it's just really hard.

00:35:09.906 --> 00:35:14.970
But I think it's important to
love what you do every day.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.730
And I love going
home to my daughter,

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.990
but I also love working.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.630
I don't think being
a stay-at-home mom

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.280
would be for me.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.700
I'm tired a lot, being
pregnant and stuff,

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.690
but I'm really happy that I am
going to be an example for her.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.500
Anyone can do anything,
and women can do anything,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.870
and I'm happy to
embody that for her.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.403
And it's hard.

00:35:43.403 --> 00:35:44.153
AUDIENCE: Sure is.

00:35:44.153 --> 00:35:45.190
Thank you.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.940
AUDIENCE: So you said
you met your husband

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.300
on the first day of business?

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.258
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Yes.

00:35:49.258 --> 00:35:51.000
AUDIENCE: Tell us that story.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.680
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Sure.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.870
So it was opening day of our
very first retail location.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.410
For those of you who
know the Soho area well,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.510
the corner of Broadway
and Spring Street,

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.200
before it was NikeTown, was
a cafe called Cafe Bari.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.600
And Cafe Bari had this
little pick-up window

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.100
that was attached
to it, and that

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.220
was our first retail
location-- a bite-sized--

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.610
if you will-- pick-up window
on Spring Street and the corner

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.550
of Broadway.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.310
And it was part of Care Bari.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.530
So opening day,
I'm freaking out,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.780
thinking, who's going to
stop at this hole in the wall

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.738
and buy cupcakes they've
never heard of before?

00:36:26.738 --> 00:36:30.390
I'm 24 years old, literally got
fired from my job seven months

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.339
prior, was just hustling
to bake cupcakes and try

00:36:34.339 --> 00:36:35.505
and do what I love everyday.

00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:36.960
And now we're opening a store.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.070
So I was freaking out.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.840
I didn't have the experience
or the confidence I have today.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.606
I'm sitting at the bar.

00:36:44.606 --> 00:36:46.980
We had gotten somebody to work
the booth for opening day,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.850
so I could chill.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.080
I had baked enough cupcakes.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.170
It was the first moment I
was sitting down in months.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.290
And David Z. was sitting
next to me at the bar,

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.820
and David Z. used to have
all these shoe stores named

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.570
David Z. throughout Manhattan.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:03.150
His nephew was Ronnie Fieg, who
founded Kith, so that whole--

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.540
Ronnie used to work
for him, whatever.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.060
And David was a
regular at Cafe Bari.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.650
He came every morning
for his coffee,

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.020
and he was there that
morning for his coffee.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.040
And he's like a charac--
he's like an old-- eh,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.170
he's like my dad's age.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:18.580
He is like a character.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.280
He takes it too far
sometimes, though.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.655
I had never met
him before, but I

00:37:21.655 --> 00:37:24.990
knew who he was, because
he was well-known to me.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.050
And he looks at the
bartender, who I had also

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.686
never met before,
and he says, Adi,

00:37:29.686 --> 00:37:30.810
who is this beautiful girl?

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.476
And the bartender
looked me up and down,

00:37:32.476 --> 00:37:34.230
and he said, that's my wife.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.900
And I felt like he
was such a jerk,

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.585
but that's how I met my husband.

00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:41.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.460
And he's Israeli, so
he would look at me

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.260
with these foreign
eyes, like I'm

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.810
the most beautiful girl in the
world, and it totally worked.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:57.530
SPEAKER 1: Please get the mike.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.280
AUDIENCE: Do we have
time for another one?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:37:59.778
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:00.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.115
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Yeah,
I'm just washing my hands.

00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:02.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.278
How did you guys come
up with the pricing

00:38:04.278 --> 00:38:05.280
model for your products?

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.190
I know each of
these is a dollar.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.941
I obviously buy your
product, and I spend that,

00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:11.940
but some people say that's
too much, too little.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.810
How did you price it all?

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.226
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY:
I'm telling you

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:16.140
it's definitely not
too much, because there

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.922
is so much that goes into every
single one of these cupcakes.

00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:21.630
You know, our cupcakes
have been a dollar

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:27.590
since the day we started the
company, which is pretty crazy.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.030
And I don't think as
much thought went into it

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.950
as you would
imagine, or probably

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.436
as we should have put into it.

00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:35.310
But they're a dollar.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.330
It's very clean.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.860
I think it's nice
to be able to just--

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:47.170
hey, $3 for three cupcakes,
and that was our pricing model.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.110
We started the company at
the end of the recession too,

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.560
so it was a time when people
weren't going and spending

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.120
a ton of money on things.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.970
So for one dollar, you
could get something

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.230
that tastes delicious, brings
you back to your childhood

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.737
and makes you happy, instead
of going and buying jeans.

00:39:04.737 --> 00:39:06.070
And yes, I am going to eat this.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.890
AUDIENCE: Soo you have
an awesome success story.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.000
But if you look back,
is there anything

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.854
you would have done
differently now, looking back?

00:39:17.854 --> 00:39:20.270
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: I would
have more confidence in myself,

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.280
probably, because
through my experience

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.520
I've learned that
you can do anything.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.390
I can anything, you
could do anything.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.450
It's a certain attitude,
and mindset, and work

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.430
ethic, and being
persistent and positive

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.820
and all that stuff that's
so cliche and totally true.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.970
And I wish I knew that the way
I know that today, because maybe

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.926
I would have even--

00:39:41.926 --> 00:39:43.870
now, if I set my
mind to something,

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.835
I know I'm going to
achieve it, which is nice.

00:39:47.835 --> 00:39:48.785
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:48.785 --> 00:39:50.292
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:51.500
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Thank you.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.412
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:52.412 --> 00:39:55.780
OK, so my question is, what
is your favorite memory with

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.550
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.580
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Oh.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.850
I have so many.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.310
We've been around for 10 years.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:11.090
I took over Instagram
recently, in October,

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.350
during the launch of the book.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.770
This was another "you
can do anything" thing.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.210
Wrote the book in three
months, which was crazy,

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.520
but I really wanted it to
launch for holiday 2017,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.110
because that's a great
opportunity for us to have

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.540
things to talk about
from a brand perspective.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.750
And I told our CEO, I'm
going to take over Instagram.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.194
And the only way the launch
of the book will be successful

00:40:32.194 --> 00:40:33.985
is if I do that, and
I'm going to figure it

00:40:33.985 --> 00:40:34.943
out and make it happen.

00:40:34.943 --> 00:40:36.030
And he's like, you are.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.670
I know you are now.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.790
And I was very persistent
with the one person

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.060
who I knew there,
and I wound up taking

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:49.350
over Instagram's account,
which is 270 million followers.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.100
I did an Instagram
story and a post

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.140
on the feed on
National Dessert Day.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.400
And I'm not one
to say something's

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.330
going to happen
before it happens,

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.330
but we had gotten
confirmation, and we

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.580
created the concept beforehand,
and I was so excited.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.286
So I told everybody,
and they said they

00:41:08.286 --> 00:41:09.410
were going to post at 4:00.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.201
They were on the other
side of the country,

00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:14.300
and we were just waiting
and wasting time.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.450
We were in Bloomingdale's
after an event.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.050
It wasn't happening,
and I was freaking out.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.210
And then I was on the
subway, underground,

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.630
going to another
event in Brooklyn.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.900
And then we got out of
subway, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.500
I could cry.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:29.344 --> 00:41:30.727
Oh, it's so exciting.

00:41:30.727 --> 00:41:34.130
And yeah, that's
what it's about.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.140
We work so-- you, we--

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.880
we work so hard, so
enjoying those moments--

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.570
and that was a big moment--
but all the little moments too.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.146
That's totally necessary.

00:41:46.146 --> 00:41:47.812
SPEAKER 1: One more
question over there.

00:41:47.812 --> 00:41:49.616
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:49.616 --> 00:41:51.240
When you were starting
up, did you ever

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.615
worry about
competition, and what

00:41:52.615 --> 00:41:55.484
did you want Baked by
Melissa to be known for?

00:41:55.484 --> 00:41:57.400
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: You
give me so much credit.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.697
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:01.775 --> 00:42:03.260
All I knew is that
I had the chance

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.780
to do what I love every
day, which was bake cupcakes

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.150
and, in turn, eat them.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.507
But-- focus.

00:42:11.507 --> 00:42:12.590
I was focused on doing it.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.420
I took advantage of every
opportunity that came my way.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.880
If somebody wanted to try the
cupcakes, they got cupcakes.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.380
I would go deliver
them, no matter--

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.170
I cold-called
catering companies.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:27.410
All of my mind-power was
focused on doing everything

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.930
I could to do what
I love every day,

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.780
because I knew that if I
did it and it didn't happen,

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.620
then one day I would
look back and think,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.600
"coulda, woulda,
shoulda," and I just

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.040
can't live my life that way.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.760
So the rest of the
stuff, I didn't have time

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.459
to think about.

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.250
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.590
SPEAKER 1: Yes, thank you
so much for coming in.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:47.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.740
MELISSA BEN-ISHAY: Thank you.
