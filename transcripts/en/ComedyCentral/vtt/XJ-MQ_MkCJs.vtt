California,
the blow-me state, uh,

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.340
recently passed
a spate of new laws,

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.708
and boy, howdy,
are they enforceable.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.543
For instance,
you are no longer allowed

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.178
to hold your cell phone
while driving.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.146
Uh, that is really going
to cut into

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.082
my carpool lane masturbation,
but, hey...

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.151
-(laughter) -...the life
it saves may be your own.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.087
Also, California Uber drivers
are no longer allowed

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.789
to be sex offenders or drunk.
Oh...

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.091
(laughter)

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.592
That's a good rule.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:28.295
-Way to stay ahead of the curve.
-(laughter)

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.131
Comedians, as California goes,
so does the nation,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.432
and we are a nation of laws.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.268
What are some new laws
you'd like to see passed

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.435
in other states?

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.837
Ron Funches.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.939
Uh, in Florida, it is now legal

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.876
to fight with your shirt off
and (bleep) with your shirt on.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.178
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter)

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:48.749
(applause and cheering)

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.651
(laughter)

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.920
Nothing wrong with
a Florida shirt-cocking.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.422
There's nothing wrong with that.
Kyle Kinane.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.624
Uh, in Massachusetts,

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.394
if you can make it through
a Dropkick Murphys concert

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.728
without starting a fistfight,

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.697
you can skip
a child support payment.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.365
(laughter)

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.668
-(applause and cheering)
-HARDWICK: Oh. Finally.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.069
(Funches giggling)

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.071
Mary Lynn.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.407
Alaska, go ahead
and (bleep) a moose.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.507
We know you're doing it anyway.
