00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.150
In most topics you have to get
pretty advanced before you

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.410
start addressing the
philosophically interesting

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.460
things, but in chemistry it
just starts right from the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.490
get-go with what's arguably
the most philosophically

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.000
interesting part of the whole
topic, and that's the atom.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.910
And the idea of the atom, as
philosophers long ago, and you

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.040
could look it up on the
different philosophers who

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.540
first philosophized about it,
they said, hey, you know, if I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.460
started off with, I don't know,
if I started off with an

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.720
apple, and I just kept cutting
the apple -- let me draw a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520
nice looking apple just so
it doesn't look just

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.030
like a heart .

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.720
There you go.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.710
You have a nice looking apple,
And you just kept cutting it,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.150
smaller and smaller pieces.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.990
So eventually, you get a piece
so small, so tiny, that you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.080
can't cut it anymore.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.190
And I'm sure some of these
philosophers went out there

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.700
with a knife and tried to do
it and they just felt that,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.685
oh, if I could just get my knife
a little bit sharper, I

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.720
could cut it again and again.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.560
So it's a completely
philosophical construct, which

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.380
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't
too different to how the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.440
atom is today.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.709
It's really just a mental
abstraction that allows us to

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.500
describe a lot of observations
we see in the universe.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.380
But anyway, these philosophers
said, well, at some point we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.320
think that there's going to be
some little part of an apple

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.980
that they won't be able
to divide anymore.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.000
And they called that an atom.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820
And it doesn't just have to just
be for an apple they said

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.550
this is true for any substance
or any element to that you

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.150
encounter in the universe.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.830
And so the word atom is really
Greek for uncuttable.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.090
Uncuttable or indivisible.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.680
Now we know that it actually is
cuttable and even though it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.970
is not a trivial thing, it's
not the smallest form of

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.730
matter we know.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.060
We now know that an atom is
made up of other more

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.570
fundamental particles.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.260
And let me write that.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.780
So the we have the neutron.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.050
And I'll draw in a second how
they all fit together and the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.730
structure of an atom.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.520
We have a neutron.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.780
We have a proton.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.150
And we have electrons.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.100
Electrons.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.250
And you might already be
familiar with this if you look

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.410
at old videos about atomic
projects, you'll see a drawing

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.285
that looks something
like this.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:21.940
Let me see if I can draw one.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.340
So you'll have something
like that.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.300
And you'll have these things
spinning around

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.800
that look like this.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.430
They have orbits that
look like that.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.840
And maybe something that
looks like that.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.845
And the general notion behind
these kind of nuclear drawings

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:39.280
-- and I'm sure that they
still show up at some

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.530
government defense labs or
something like that -- is that

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.020
you have a nucleus at the
center of an atom.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.090
You have a nucleus at the
center of an atom.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
And we know that a nucleus
has neutrons and protons.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.510
Neutrons and protons.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.570
And we'll talk a little bit more
about which elements have

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.150
how many neutrons and
how many protons.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.810
And then orbiting, and I'm going
to use the word orbit

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.550
right now, although we'll learn
in about two minutes

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.150
that the word orbit is actually
the incorrect or even

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.160
the mentally incorrect way
of visualizing what

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.200
an electron is doing.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.190
But the old idea was that you
have these electrons that are

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.180
orbiting around the nucleus very
similar to the way the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.850
Earth orbits around the
Sun or the moon

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.810
orbits around the Earth.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.890
And it's been shown that
that's actually

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.900
a very wrong way.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.720
And when we cover quantum
mechanics we'll learn why this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.020
doesn't work, what are the
contradictions that emerge

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.500
when you try to model an
electron like a planet going

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.110
around the Sun.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.920
But this was kind of the
original idea, and frankly I

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.840
think this is kind of the idea
that is the most mainstream

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.230
way of viewing an atom.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.550
Now, I said an atom is
philosophically interesting.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.910
Why is it philosophically
interesting?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.200
Because what we now view as the
accepted way of viewing an

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.610
atom really starts to blur the
line between our physical

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.120
reality and everything in the
world is just information, and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.180
there really isn't any such
thing as true matter or true

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.440
particles as the way we define
them in our everyday life.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.950
You know, for me a particle,
oh, it looks

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.740
like a grain of sand.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.149
I can pick it up, touch it.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.730
While a wave, that could be like
a soundwave. It could be

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.670
just this change in
energy over time.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.870
But we'll learn, especially when
we do quantum mechanics,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.010
that it all gets jumbled up as
we start approaching the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.970
scales or the size of an atom.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.780
Anyway, I said this was an
incorrect way of doing it.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.590
What's the correct way?

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.500
So it turns out-- this is a
picture, not a picture really,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.140
this is also a depiction.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.850
So it's an interesting question,
what I just said.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.360
How can you have a picture
of an atom?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.910
Because is actually turns out
that most wavelengths of

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.800
light, especially the visible
wavelengths of light, are much

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.540
larger than the size
of an atom.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.400
Everything else we
quote-unquote, observe in

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.350
life, it's by reflected light.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.900
But all of a sudden when you're
dealing with an atom,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.480
reflected light you could almost
view it as too big, or

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.470
too blunt of an instrument with
which to observe an atom.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.150
Anyway, this is a depiction
of a helium atom.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.160
A helium atom has two protons
and two neutrons.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.850
Or at least this helium
atom has two

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.520
protons and two neutrons.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.580
And the way they depict it here
in the nucleus, right

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.800
there, maybe these are the two--
I'm assuming they're

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.210
using red for proton and
purple for neutron.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.100
Purple seems like more
of a neutral color.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.740
And they're sitting at the
center of this atom.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.480
And then this whole haze around
there, those are the

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.370
two electrons that helium
has, or that at least

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.400
this helium atom has.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.510
Maybe you could gain or
lose an electron.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.510
But these are the
two electrons.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.560
And you say, hey, Sal, how can
two electrons be this blur

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.330
that's kind of smeared
around this atom.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.520
And that's where it gets
philosophically interesting.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:09.070
So you cannot describe an
electron's path around a

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.770
nucleus with the traditional
orbit idea that we've

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.700
encountered when we look at
planets or if we just imagine

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.740
things at kind of
a larger scale.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.840
It turns out that an electron,
you cannot know exactly its

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.680
momentum and location at any
given point in time.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.870
All you can know is a
probability distribution of

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.640
where it is likely to be.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.490
And the way they depicted
this, black is a higher

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.700
probability, so you're much
more likely to find the

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.580
electron here than
you are here.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.750
But the electron really
could be anywhere.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.690
It could even to be here, even
though it's completely white

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.670
there, with some very, very,
very, very, very low

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.660
probability.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.180
And so this function of where an
electron is, this is called

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.720
an orbital.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.430
Orbital.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.120
Not to be confused with orbit.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.600
Orbital.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.100
Remember, an orbit was
something like this.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.050
It's like Venus going
around the Sun.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.750
So it's very physically easy
for us to imagine.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.370
While an orbital is actually
a mathematical probability

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.570
function that tells
us where we're

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.920
likely to find an electron.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.020
We'll deal a lot more with that
when we cover quantum

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.270
mechanics, but that's not going
to be in the scope of

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.670
this kind of introductory set
of chemistry lectures.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.150
But it's interesting, right?

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.800
An electron's behavior is so
bizarre at that scale that you

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.780
can't-- I mean, to call it a
particle is almost misleading.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.180
It is called a particle, but
it's not a particle in the

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.300
sense that we're used to
in our everyday life.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.230
It's this thing that you can't
even say exactly where it is.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.600
It can be anywhere
in this haze.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.630
And we'll learn later that there
are different shapes of

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.160
the hazes is as we add more and
more electrons to an atom.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.580
But to me, it starts to address
philosophical issues

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.340
of what matter even is, or do
the things we look at, how

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.150
real are they?

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.920
Or how real are they, at least
as we've defined reality?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.750
Anyway I don't want to get
too philosophical on you.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.520
But the whole notion of
electrons, protons, they're

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.090
all kind of predicated on
this notion of charge.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.580
And we've talked about it before
when we learned about

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.890
Coulomb's law.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.470
You could review Coulomb's laws
videos in the physics

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.810
playlist. But the idea
is that an electron

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.240
has a negative charge.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.070
A proton, sometimes
written like that,

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.250
has a positive charge.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.299
And a neutron has no charge.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.830
And so that's what was tempting
about the original

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.590
model of an electron.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.310
If they say, OK, if this thing
has positive charges, right?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.050
So let's say this is two
neutrons and two protons.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.585
Let's say it's a helium atom.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:51.050
Then we'll have some positive
charges here.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.070
We have some negative
charges out here.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.330
Opposite charges attract.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:03.710
And so if these things had
some velocity, enough

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.350
velocity, they would orbit
around this, just the way a

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.310
planet will orbit
around the Sun.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.200
But now we learn, even though
this is partially true, that

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:23.760
the further away an electron is
from the nucleus, it does

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.700
have more, it's true,
potential energy.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.240
In that it will want to move
towards the nucleus, but

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.580
because of all the mechanics at
the quantum level, it won't

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.950
just do something simple like
move in a path like that, like

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.140
a comet would do around the Sun,
it actually has this kind

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.690
of wave-like behavior, where it
just has this probability

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.170
function that describes it.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.680
But the further away
an orbital, it

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.280
does have more potential.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.080
We're going to go a lot more
into that in future videos.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.140
But anyway, how do you recognize
what an element is?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.500
I've talked a lot about the
philosophy and all of that,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.050
but how do I know that
this is helium?

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.230
Is it by the number of
neutrons it has?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.220
Is it by the number
of protons it has?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.070
Is it by the number
of electrons?

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.960
Well the answer is, it's by
the number of protons.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.090
So if you know the number of
protons in an element, you

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.660
know what that element is.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:21.760
And the number of protons,
this is defined

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.010
as the atomic number.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.320
Now, so let's say I said
something has four protons.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.520
How do we know what it is?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.070
Well if we haven't memorized it,
we could look it up on the

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.560
periodic table of elements,
which we'll be dealing with a

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.210
lot in this playlist. And you'd
say, oh, four protons,

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.680
that is beryllium.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.540
Right there.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.150
And the atomic number is the
number that you see up there.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.010
And that' s literally the
number of protons.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.220
And that is what differentiates

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.160
one atom from another.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.340
If you have fifteen protons,
you're dealing with

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.315
phosphorus.

00:11:00.315 --> 00:11:06.340
And all of a sudden, if you
have seven protons, you're

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.150
dealing with nitrogen.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.060
If you have eight, you're
dealing with oxygen.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.680
That is what defines
the element.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.940
Now, we'll talk in the future
about what happens with charge

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.140
and all of that.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.010
Or what happens when you
gain or lose electrons.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.760
But that does not change what
element you're dealing with.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.230
And likewise, when you change
the number of neutrons, that

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.290
also does not change the element
you're dealing with.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.980
But that leads to an obvious
question of, well, how many

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.900
neutrons and electrons
do you have?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:43.370
Well, if an atom is
charge-neutral, that means it

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.100
has the same number
of electrons.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.835
So let's say that
I have carbon.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.620
Its atomic number is six.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:12:00.240
And let's say its mass
number is twelve.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.450
Now what does this mean?

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.870
And let me say further that this
is a neutral particle.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.460
This is a neutral atom.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.570
So the atomic number
for carbon is six.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.860
That tells us exactly how
many protons it has.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.280
So if I were to draw a little
model here, and this is in no

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.330
way an accurate model.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.000
I'll draw six-- two, three,
four, five, six

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.380
protons in the center.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.100
And the weight of these protons,
each proton is one

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.870
atomic mass unit, and we'll
talk more about how that

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.120
relates to kilograms.
It's a very small

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.580
fraction of a kilogram.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.230
Roughly I think it's
1.6 times 10 to the

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.160
minus 27th of a kilogram.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.080
So let's say each of these are
one atomic mass unit, and

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.990
that's approximately equal to,
I think, 1.67 times 10 to the

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.320
minus 27 kilograms. This
is a very small number.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.290
It's actually almost impossible
to visualize.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.750
At least it is for me.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.240
This tells me the mass of the
entire carbon atom, of this

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.300
particular carbon atom.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.790
And this can actually
change from carbon

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.100
atom to carbon atom.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.720
And this is essentially the
mass of all of the protons

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.410
plus all of the neutrons.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.540
And each proton has an atomic
mass of one, in atomic mass

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.760
units, and each neutron
has an atomic mass of

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.530
one atomic mass unit.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:28.660
So this is really the number
of protons plus

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.910
the number of neutrons.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.280
So in this case we have six
protons, so we must also have

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.110
six neutrons.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.920
Six neutrons plus six protons.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.490
Now, where are the electrons?

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.130
Well, I said it's neutral, so
the proton has an equal

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.360
positive charge as the
electron's negative charge.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.340
So this is a neutral atom, and
it has six protons, so it also

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.380
has six electrons.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.000
Let me draw that.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.180
So we said it has six
neutrons in here.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.900
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.863
So that's the nucleus
right there.

00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:09.300
And then if we were to draw the
electons-- well, I could

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.110
draw it as a smear, but if we
want to kind of visualize it a

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.670
little better, we could say,
OK, there's going to be six

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.290
electrons orbiting.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.460
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.280
And they're going to be moving
around in this unpredictable

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.830
way that we would have
to describe with

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.770
a probability function.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:30.170
And so the interesting thing
about it is, most of the mass

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.890
of an atom is sitting
right in here.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.860
I mean, you might notice that
when people care about the

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:40.480
mass, when they care about the
atomic mass number of an atom,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.610
they ignore the electrons.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:47.660
And that's because the mass
of a proton, one proton

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.530
mass-wise, is equal
to 1,836 electons.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:58.250
So for thinking about the mass
of an atom, for all basic

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.920
purposes, you can ignore the
mass of an electron.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.570
It's really the mass of the
nucleus that counts as the

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.200
mass of the atom.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.400
Now, you might see this periodic
table here, and you

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.680
say, OK, they gave us the
atomic number up there.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.030
The atomic number of
oxygen is eight.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.190
It means it has eight protons.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.470
The atomic number of
silicon is 14.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.660
It has 14 protons.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.230
Now what is this right here?

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.505
Let's see, in carbon.

00:15:28.505 --> 00:15:34.150
In carbon they have
this 12.0107.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.980
That is the atomic
weight of carbon.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.230
Let me write this.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.390
Atomic weight of carbon.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:56.730
The atomic weight of
carbon is 12.0107.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.710
Now, what does that mean?

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:03.200
Does that mean that carbon has
six protons and then the

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.480
remainder, the remaining 6.0107
neutrons, it has kind

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.710
of this fraction of a neutron?

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.130
No.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.790
It means if you were to average
all the different

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.470
versions of carbon you find on
the planet and you were to

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:25.490
average the number of neutrons
based on the quantity of the

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.360
different types of carbon,
this is the

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.730
average you would get.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.980
So it turns out that carbon, the
two major forms, the main

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.130
one you'll find is carbon-12.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.460
So that's like this.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.210
So that has six protons
and six neutrons.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.710
And then another isotope
of carbon.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.420
Now an isotope is the same
element with a different

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.370
number of neutrons.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.170
Another isotope of carbon is
carbon-14, which is much more

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.240
scarce on the planet.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.920
We don't know how much in the
universe, but on the planet.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.750
Now, if you were to average
these, not just a straight-up

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.480
average, then you would get
carbon-13 and then the atomic

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.130
weight would be 13, but you
weight this one much higher

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.160
because this exists in much
larger quantities on Earth.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.589
I mean, this is pretty
much all of the

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:09.270
carbon that you see.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.619
But there's a little
bit of this.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.530
So if you weight them
appropriately, the average

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.420
becomes this.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.200
So most of the carbon you'll
find-- if you just found

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.569
carbon someplace, on average
its weight in atomic mass

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:27.040
units is going to be 12.0107.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.190
But that idea of an isotope
is an interesting one.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.180
Remember, when you change the
neutrons, you're not changing

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.820
the actual, fundamental
element.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.210
You're just getting a different
isotope, a different

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.590
version, of the element.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.500
So these two versions of carbon
are both isotopes.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500
Now, I want to leave this video
with what I think is

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.850
kind of the neatest idea behind
atoms. And it's the

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.780
most philosophically interesting
things about them.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.190
It's that the relative size--
so, we have these electrons,

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.340
which represent very little
of the mass of an atom.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.470
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an
atom are the electrons.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.560
And even those, it's hard
to even describe them as

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.790
particles, because you can't
even tell me exactly where and

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.170
how fast one of these
particles is moving.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.880
They just have a probability
function.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.280
So most of the atom is sitting
inside the nucleus.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.880
And this is the interesting
thing.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.080
If you look at an atom
on average, if you

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.040
say this is my atom.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.300
Let's say I had two atoms that
are bonded to each other.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.065
And I were to say, how much
of this is actual stuff?

00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:32.120
And when I say stuff, that's a
very abstract concept, because

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.670
we're talking about the
nucleus, right?

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.740
Because the nucleus
is where all the

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.470
mass is, all the stuff.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.750
It turns out that it's actually
an infinitesimally

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.160
small fraction of the volume of
the atom where-- the volume

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.920
of the atom is hard to define,
because the electron can

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.870
pretty much be anywhere, but
if you view the volume as

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.580
where you're most likely to find
the electron, or with 90%

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.710
probability you're likely to
find the electron, then the

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.150
nucleus is, in a lot of cases
and the way I think about it,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.740
it's about 1/10,000
of the volume.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.590
So if you think about it, when
you look at something, if you

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.460
look at your hand or if you
look at the wall or if you

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:14.830
look at your computer, 99.999%
of it is free space.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.470
It's nothing.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.320
It's vacuum.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.600
If you had ultra-small-- I
guess we could call them

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.020
particles or something-- most
of them would pass straight

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.690
through whatever you look at.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.530
So it already starts to kind of

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.210
question our hold on reality.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.120
What is there when, if-- and
this is fact, this isn't

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.350
theory right here-- that if you
take anything down to the

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.580
building blocks, down to the
atomic level, most of the

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.450
space of that kind of,
quote-unquote object, is free

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.470
vacuum space.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.490
You could go straight through
it if you could get down to

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.940
that scale.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.880
This image of a helium atom,
they say right here this is

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.520
one femtometer.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.810
Right?

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.060
One femtometer.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.180
This is the scale of
the nucleus of a

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.780
helium atom, right?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.090
One femtometer.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.310
This is one angstrom, right?

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.820
And they say that equals
100,000 femtometers.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.360
And just to get a sense of
scale, one angstrom is 1 times

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.420
10 to the negative
10 meters, right?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.830
So the atom is roughly on the
scale of an angstrom.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.780
In the case of helium,
the nucleus is

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.990
even a smaller fraction.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.930
It's 1/100,000.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.700
So if you had-- let's say you
had liquid helium, which you'd

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.190
have to get very cold to get.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.610
If you're looking at that,
most of it is free space.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.550
If you're looking at an iron
bar, the great, great, great,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.310
great, great, great majority
of it is free space.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.500
And we're not even talking
about, maybe there's some free

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.240
space inside the nucleus
that we could talk

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.210
about in the future.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.950
But to me, that just blows my
mind that most things we look

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.870
at are not really solid.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.530
They're really just empty space,
but they look solid

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.360
because of the way light
reflects on them or the forces

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.130
that repel us.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.100
But there really isn't something
to touch there.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.800
That most of this right here
is all free space.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.260
I think I've said the word free
space now, and I think

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.370
I'll leave further

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.020
mind-blowing to the next video.
