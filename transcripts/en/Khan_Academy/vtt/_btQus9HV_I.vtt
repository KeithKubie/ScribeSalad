00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.040
Let's try to evaluate 7
and 6/9 minus 3 and 2/5.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.760
So like always, I like to
separate out the whole number

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.410
parts from the fractional parts.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:19.320
This is the same thing as 7
plus 6/9 minus 3 minus 2/5.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.220
And the reason why I'm
saying minus 3 minus 2/5

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.524
is this is the same thing
as minus 3 plus 2/5.

00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:28.190
And so you distribute
the negative sign.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.004
You're subtracting a 3, and
then you're subtracting the 2/5.

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:33.920
And so now we can worry
about the whole number

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.340
parts, 7 minus 3.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.310
Well, 7 minus 3 is
going to give us 4.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.040
So that's going to give us 4.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.330
And then we're going
to have 6/9 minus 2/5.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
So let me think about
what 6/9 minus 2/5 are.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.280
6/9 minus 2/5, well,
we're going to have

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.770
to find a common denominator.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680
So this is going to
be the same thing.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.930
And I think the least
common multiple of 9 and 5

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.812
is going to be 45.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.020
Literally, you then multiply.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.180
They have no common factors.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.380
So it's going to be over 45.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830
To go from 9 to 45, I
have to multiply by 5.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.040
So I'm going to have to
multiply the numerator by 5.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.120
So 6 times 5 is 30.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.750
Then I'm going to subtract.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.584
To go from 5 to 45, I
had to multiply by 9.

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.250
So I have to multiply
the numerator by 9

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.750
if I don't want to
change the value.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.240
So 2 times 9 is 18.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.050
And 30/45 minus 18/45 is
going to be something over 45.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.270
30 minus 18 is 12.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.400
If I subtract these two
fractions right over here,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.010
I get 12/45.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.900
So it's 4 plus 12/45.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320
Or if we wanted to write
it as a mixed number,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.240
this is equal to 4 and 12/45.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.480
But we're not done yet.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.070
We can simplify this further.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.180
12 and 45 have common factors.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.645
They're both divisible by 3.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.787
Actually, they're both
divisible by-- well,

00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.370
I think we can divide
more after that.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.911
So let's see.

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.810
If we divide the numerator by
3 and the denominator by 3,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.370
we end up with 4.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.880
And 12 divided by 3 is 4.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.630
And 45 divided by 3 is 15.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.190
4 and 4/15.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.410
And actually, we're done.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.120
These two can't be
simplified anymore.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.732
4 and 4/15.
