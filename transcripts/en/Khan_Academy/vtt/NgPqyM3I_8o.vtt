00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:01.660
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.070
think about how supply and/or
demand might change based

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.840
on changes in some
factors in the market.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.910
And then think about what that
might do to the equilibrium

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.040
price and equilibrium quantity.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.220
So let's say at
some period, this

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.270
is what the supply
curve looks like

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.406
and this is what the
demand curve looks like.

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:23.280
And then all of a sudden,
this thing happens.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.410
A new disease-resistant
apple is invented.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.500
What's likely to happen
for the next period?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.490
Well, a new disease-resistant
apple being invented,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.990
this is something that
clearly impacts the growers,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.580
clearly impacts the suppliers.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.860
All of a sudden, they'll
have fewer apples

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.590
succumbing to disease.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.980
And so they will be able
to produce more apples.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.590
So at any given
price point, this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.650
will shift the
quantity supplied up.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.900
So at any given
price point, it will

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.030
shift the quantity of
apples supplied up.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.880
Or you could say that
the entire supply

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.180
curve is shifted to the
right, or supply goes up.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.650
And let me draw
the entire curve.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.250
And obviously, if now we have
disease-resistant apples,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.160
even our minimum price to start
producing apples is lower.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.070
Now, when we had the supply
curve shift in this way,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770
when it shifted
to the right, what

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.070
happens to the
equilibrium price?

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.350
Well our old equilibrium
price was right over here.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.120
Our new equilibrium price--
so this is the old one.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.320
And this is our new
equilibrium price.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.210
We're assuming that demand
has not changed at all.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.540
So this is our new
equilibrium price.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.800
So our new equilibrium
price is lower.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.937
So the price went down.

00:01:37.937 --> 00:01:40.270
And you don't have to-- you
could have probably reasoned

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.400
through that before,
taking an econ class.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.816
But this way, at least you
have some way to think about it

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.930
and think about how the
curves are changing.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.700
Now, let's think
about this scenario.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.730
So this is before.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.130
So in all of these
examples, the graph

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.230
is what happened before
the news came out,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.780
or the event came out.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.090
So this is before.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.100
And then a study is released
on how apples prevent cancer.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.410
So what is that likely to do?

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.490
Well, no one wants cancer.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.480
And so more people are going
to be eager to have apples.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.280
This will change
customer preferences.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.200
They will prefer
apples even more

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.610
when they're at the supermarket.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.960
So this is clearly affecting
demand customer preferences.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.860
And so at a given
price, people will

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.810
want-- they will demand a
higher quantity of apples.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.610
The quantity of apples demanded
at a given price will go up.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.330
So the demand curve
will shift to the right.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.060
Or you could say, the
demand would go up.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.310
So that's the new demand curve.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.050
So here, demand goes up.

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:42.060
And let me write it over here.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.170
In this situation,
supply went up.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.450
Here, demand goes up.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.800
And what happens to the price?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.830
Well, this is our old
equilibrium price.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.280
This is our new
equilibrium price.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.530
The price clearly went up.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.404
So the price went up.

00:02:57.404 --> 00:02:59.820
And actually over here, let's
think about the quantity too

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.330
in this first situation.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.200
This is our old
equilibrium quantity.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.400
This is our new
equilibrium quantity.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.336
Quantity went up,
which makes sense.

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:11.210
You have fewer apples
dying, price went down,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.470
more people want to buy them.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.280
Here, price went up, and
what happened to quantity?

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.300
Quantity-- this was our
old equilibrium quantity.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.310
This is our new
equilibrium quantity.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.210
Quantity also went up.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.710
More people just
want to buy apples.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.590
They don't want to get cancer.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.050
Now let's think about these
scenarios right over here.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.560
The pear cider industry
launches an ad campaign.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.260
And for the sake of
this, let's assume

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.730
that the same growers who grow
apples can also grow pears.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.500
That makes it interesting.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.590
So you have a couple
of interesting things.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.550
By launching this
advertising campaign--

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.425
we're going to assume
it's a good advertising

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:55.700
campaign-- this clearly will
make demand go up for-- sorry,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.720
it'll make demand go up
for cider, for pear cider,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.767
relative to apple cider.

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:02.350
Most people, when
they think of cider,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.740
they think of apple cider.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.740
Now all of a sudden,
pear cider comes out.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.640
It'll make demand for
apple cider go down.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.000
So this is apple cider
demand will go down.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.339
Now, if apple cider
demand goes down,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.800
the apple cider producers are
going to demand fewer apples.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.120
So this is going to mean that
apple demand will go down.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.450
At any given price point,
apple demand will go down.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.092
So apple demand, the demand
curve, will shift to the left.

00:04:38.092 --> 00:04:39.800
Or I should say at
any given price point,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.110
the quantity demanded
will go down.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.630
And so the entire demand
curve, the entire relationship,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.690
will shift to the left.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.360
Now, that's not all
that might happen.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.360
Because if you think about
it from the suppliers

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.818
point of view, and I don't know
if this really is the case,

00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:57.220
but let's assume that the
farmers who grow apples

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.340
can also grow pears.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.970
Well, they might say,
well, now that there's

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.580
more demand for pears,
they're doing this advertising

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.230
campaign, I want to-- and
probably the price of pears

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.140
has gone up-- they
might say, well,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.910
I'm going to devote more of
my land to pears and less

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.730
of my land to apples.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:21.710
And so the supply of apples-- so
apple supply-- want to be clear

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.020
here that we're talking about
apple-- the apple supply

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.540
might go down.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.400
So it'll also shift to the left.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.790
So they're both
shifting to the left.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.650
Now what is likely
to happen here?

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.830
So the demand went down
and the supply went down.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.800
They both shifted to the left.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.360
Well, here the way I drew it,
this was our old equilibrium

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.275
price, this is our
new equilibrium price.

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.650
It actually looks the way that
I drew it right over here,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.330
that it did not change.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.880
The equilibrium quantity
definitely did change.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.070
So let's see, this is our
old equilibrium quantity.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.920
This is our new
equilibrium quantity.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.420
This clearly, the
quantity, went down.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.050
It was a bad day for apples.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.180
But the price didn't
change, because, at least

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.710
in the example, we assume
that the farmers actually also

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.770
produced fewer apples.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.310
It turns out, I could have
drawn this in multiple ways.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.540
And actually, let me draw
it in different ways here.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.100
So the quantity
definitely-- so let's

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.440
think about other scenarios.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.110
Let me draw it
slightly different.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.760
Let's say that the supply goes
down even more dramatically.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.230
So let's say the supply shifts
all the way-- the supply shifts

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.470
really far back.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.210
Now, what happened?

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.480
Well now, our
equilibrium price--

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.300
because the reduction in
supply was kind of more extreme

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.140
than the reduction in demand.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.870
And it really depends on how the
curve shapes and all of that.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.453
The main thing is
to reason through it

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:46.490
or to actually see what
the actual results are.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.230
But in this situation, all of a
sudden that the price went up,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.949
but the quantity
definitely still went down.

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.990
So in this case, the one
thing that you're always

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.656
going to be sure of
is that the quantity

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:58.230
will go down but
the price went up.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.230
Because this effect-- the
supply went down much more

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.350
than the demand did.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.190
And so the price went up.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.940
Now I could have done
another scenario.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.960
I could have done another
scenario where maybe the supply

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.410
barely budged or maybe the
demand went down dramatically.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.980
Let me draw it where the
supply barely budges.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.010
So maybe the supply, it only
gets shifted a little bit

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.160
to the left.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.706
So maybe the supply
curve looks like this.

00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:25.330
Now all of a sudden, once again,
quantity definitely goes down.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.137
So in all of the scenarios,
the quantity will go down.

00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:31.470
But I've just done three
scenarios where the price could

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.600
be neutral, the price could go
up, or the price could go down.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.730
So you actually
don't know what is

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.780
going to happen to the
price based on this.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.905
You would actually have to
look at the actual curve

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:43.385
and see what the new
equilibrium prices are.

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:44.510
Now let's look at this one.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.260
The apple pickers unionize and
they demand wage increases.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.620
So this is an issue
for the suppliers.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.610
So all of a sudden,
one of their inputs,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.820
one of their costs of
production, which is labor,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.110
has gone up.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.470
So if their cost of
production has gone up,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.110
now at a given price point,
they are less profitable,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.760
less willing to produce apples.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.650
So at a given price
point-- so we're

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.530
talking about the suppliers--
at a given price point,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.920
they will supply
a lower quantity.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.140
So this is going
to lower supply.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.690
And when you lower supply,
what's going to happen?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.470
Well, your
equilibrium quantity--

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.929
this was our old one, this
was our new one-- equilibrium

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.279
quantity definitely goes
down, the quantity went down.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.570
And what happened to the price?

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.809
We're assuming nothing
changes to the demand.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.440
So this was our old
equilibrium price.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.600
This is our new
equilibrium price.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600
It went up.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.090
Quantity went down,
and price went up.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.500
And I encourage
you to-- well one,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.580
I should have told you
this at the beginning, too.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.310
You should have tried to do
these yourself and then see

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.820
what I had to say
about them-- but I

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.210
encourage you to try this out
with different situations.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.200
Think of situations
yourself and even

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.160
think about different markets
other than the apple market.
