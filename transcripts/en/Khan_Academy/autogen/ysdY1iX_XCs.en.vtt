00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.892
 Ezra loves gardening. 

00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:04.661
 Each sunflower plant that he watered, 

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:08.469
 needs 0.7 liters of water, 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.440
 and every lily which he watered, 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.600
 it needs 0.5 liters of water. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.020
 Ezra has a total of 11 liters of water for its plants. 

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:19.857
 The following inequality 

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:22.270
 S represents the number of sunflowers, 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.460
 and L represents the number of lilies, 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 which Ezra can pour. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.240
 Let's see if there's any logic in it. 

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:29.800
 It seems that... 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.540
 The number of sunflowers is S 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.860
 and he must use 7/10 of a liter of plant. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.280
 So this first member here is here 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.795
 is how much water is used 

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.318
 for irrigation of sunflowers. 

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:45.492
 The second article is how much water 

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:47.544
 is used for watering lilies, 

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:51.280
 because he needs half a liter for a lily. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.340
 And he has a total of 11 liters. 

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.928
 So the sum up here 

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.960
 must be less than or equal to 11. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.800
 All right. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 Ezra watered 10 lilies. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.820
 So L equals 10. 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.980
 How many sunflowers can he most pour 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 with the remaining amount of water? 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.900
 Let's think a little about this. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 We have 0.7 on the number of sunflowers he wares. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.260
 Plus ... 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.491
 Let L assume that L equals 10. 

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:22.963
 He watered 10 lilies 

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:27.020
 and each uses half a liter. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.620
 So 0.5 by 10 will be 5. 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.400
 We'll have 5 liters of watering 10 lilies. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 And this must be less than or equal to 11. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.160
 We may try to separate S on the left side. 

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:46.530
 Let's do it. The number of sunflowers. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.220
 We can first pull out 5 on both sides. 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.120
 We remove 5 from both sides. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.620
 And we will stay on the left side 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920
 only by 0.7 on S. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.000
 This expression is the total amount of water, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.780
 which he will use for sunflowers, 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.280
 which must be less than or equal to ... 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.300
 11 minus 5 is equal to 6. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.720
 And now we can divide both sides to 0.7. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.677
 By not having to change inequality, 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.420
 because we divide to a positive number of 0.7. 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.900
 We will get S ... 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.777
 S is less than or equal to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.960
 6 divided by 0.7. 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.740
 Or we can even write it like ... 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 we can write it like ... 

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.395
 This is 6 divided by 0.7. 

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.730
 Let me write everything like a liver. 

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:43.455
 This is the same as 6, divided by 7/10, 

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:48.576
 which is equal to 6 in 10 on 7, 

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.510
 which is equal to 60/7 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.168
 which is equal to ... how much is that? 

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.711
 8 and 4/7. 

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:02.273
 So S should be less than 8 and 4/7. 

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:03.683
 Now, assuming that he ... 

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.500
 we only think about whole plants ... 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.940
 i. with integers, these are actually whole plants. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.319
 So if S should be less than 8 and 4/7, 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.426
 how much sunflower he can best pour 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.920
 with the remaining amount of water? 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.740
 It can spawn at most 8 plants. 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.572
 We will assume that it can not be poured 

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.057
 only part of a plant. 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.480
 He either watered something or did not watery it. 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.560
 So he will spawn 8 plants. 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.960
 Because this is the largest integer, 

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:35.631
 which is less than 8 and 4/7. 

00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:36.316
 That suits ... 

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.480
 I have to say that this is less than or equal to 8 and 4/7.
