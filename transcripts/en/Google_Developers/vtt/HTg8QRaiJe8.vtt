[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.390
MEGAN SMITH: Hello, and welcome
to Women Techmakers.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.680
This is the first of a series
that we hope to send to you

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.320
from Google Live.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.500
We started with a panel at
Google I/O last year, the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.990
night before I/O. It was
incredibly popular, and so we

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.270
decided that we would
expand the series.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.660
We want to talk to amazing
women in our industry.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.610
And today we have
Leslie Bradshaw.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850
So before we start,
my background is--

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.720
I've been at Google for almost
10 years, leading new business

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.620
development and M&amp;A.
Today, I'm a vice

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.900
president over in Google[x]

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.190
team.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.570
And I'm joined by Betsy.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.370
BETSY MASIELLO: Hi, I'm Betsy.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.130
I've been at Google for about 4
years, and I'm on the public

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.890
policy team.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.970
And I work on a variety of
different policy issues.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.190
One of my favorites is how data
can be used to transform

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.490
the economy.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.500
MEGAN SMITH: So one of our ideas
with women techmakers is

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.420
that there's an amazing number
of women in our industry

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.554
already, and throughout the
history of our industry who

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:06.530
have had a huge impact.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.760
And so we want to raise the
visibility of them, even

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.500
though we often are frustrated
by the percentages.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.770
Sometimes in teams we'll see
10%, 20%, or 30% women.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.200
But the women who are here
are fierce, fabulous, and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.730
contributing a lot.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.900
And so our goal with this
series is not only to

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.580
highlight the astounding
contributions they're making,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.320
but also encourage more people,
men and women, to join

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.150
the tech industry.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.570
So, OK, welcome Leslie
Bradshaw.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.240
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Thank
you, both.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.353
MEGAN SMITH: Our first guest.

00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:34.790
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yes,
the hot seat.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.330
MEGAN SMITH: So you are the
president, COO, and co-founder

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.150
of JESS3, the amazing data
visualization company.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.890
Can you talk a little bit about
what you guys do and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.970
what you're thinking about?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.910
LESLIE BRADSHAW: So what
we do is really bring

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.160
information to life.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.350
And I think not a day goes by
that there's not another

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800
article about big data, and big
data problems, and what

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.170
are you doing with your data?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.750
And one of the most important
things is not just only the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.970
analyzing and kind of
algorithmic work around the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.750
data, but it's that final
mile, the visual.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.940
And making sure that people
are engaging, and being

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.669
educated, and absorbing
the information.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.390
So we've really decided to
specialize on that front and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.310
tip of the spear with data.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.870
MEGAN SMITH: It would be fun,
I think, to show people some

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.980
of things you guys
have worked on.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.500
And when we were talking,
preparing a little bit, you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.980
talked about the range of
different kinds of products

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.830
you guys do.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.650
Whether they're full live or
whether they're sort of more

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.370
of a static traditional
visualization.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.215
Do you want to kind of share
a little bit of that?

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.170
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah, there's
really a continuum.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.030
When you think of data
visualization and you're in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.520
tech, you're thinking
interactive.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.180
And that's probably the most
dynamic, interesting kind of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.700
API-based data visualization.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.810
But on the other end of the
spectrum, you have static.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.930
And that's what you'd see
mostly on Mashable with

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.100
infographics and I think the
stuff that's been put out

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.260
there by the sports industry
and financial

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.180
industry for years.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.150
It's about telling stories
with data.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.870
"The Economist" does a fantastic
job of little spark

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.150
lines and pie charts.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.070
And then in between you have
animation [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.950
has pioneered in terms
of geocoding all

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.400
of the polling locations.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.070
So there's just amazing--

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.560
data.gov.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.640
There's a lot of sources
of data out there.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.310
And then, you then need to
analyze it and come up with

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.930
some outcomes and some potential
logic that's going

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.390
to power your system.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.700
And that's probably the hardest
thing for people who

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.770
aren't engineers to do and think
about because there's a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.350
lot of conditions, a lot of
if-thens that you have to

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.170
think ahead about.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.600
And I think most people want to
just push a few buttons and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.210
then have things compare and
then reconfigure themselves.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.710
I would say infographics are
an easier lift because that

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.250
way you're able to hit pause
on the data, look at it,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.540
snapshot it, and then come out,
what we call as in the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.560
narrative phase.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.150
And just as if you're writing
a paper in college, you need

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.420
to have a thesis, supporting
evidence, and a conclusion.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.310
And that's what we've
done in both the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.810
static and the motion.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.430
Whereas, interactive, it's
a shifting ground.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.870
The conclusion changes
as the data change.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.890
MEGAN SMITH: Let's show an
example of something.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.170
We've been lucky to
work with you guys

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.970
tomorrow as the US election--

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.130
for those here in the
US listening.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.930
There's a visualization we've
done with the news and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.720
politics team at Google,
actually with you guys.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.490
And so I don't know if
we can flip to that.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.100
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah, we've
been working closely with the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.329
Google politics team out
in Washington, DC.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.930
And what we've been doing is
taking the search data and

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.560
search interest around key,
decisive moments.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.320
Whether it's a debate and
seeing, at what point did

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.910
people-- what were
search spikes?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.920
When people were looking
up the word "Biden" and

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.330
"malarkey?" Or, what was it--

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.550
"horses" and "bayonets." Those
were some of the search terms

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.690
that were spiking during
the debates.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.730
We were also very active
during the primaries in

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.950
looking at which candidates were
surging in which states.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.550
And one of the things-- and I
know Google won't necessarily

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.850
say this, but I'll go
ahead and say it.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.860
It became very predictive
of outcomes in

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.010
states to see what--

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.320
going in probably three to seven
days out, what states

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200
were interested and what
counties even were interested

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.440
in which candidates were
correlating very closely with

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.550
the outcomes in those states.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.390
So it was a really exciting
thing for us to be able to

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.160
kind of watch this
huge data set.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.070
And to take something where
Gallup normally would be

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.870
polling people by phone and a
certain kind of end example.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.320
Whereas Google, the sample
is much larger and it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.830
geographically has integrity
as far as who's

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.560
searching for what.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.820
So a lot of the Google work,
really excited about tomorrow.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.200
And we've been working with all
you for about a year now.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.976
MEGAN SMITH: Thank you.

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:29.450
And then, maybe another
example.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.300
Which one should we pop to?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.470
Do you want to talk
about the Samsung?

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.930
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah, let's
talk about the Samsung wall a

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.490
little bit.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.010
What we've done at various live
events, I think that's

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.210
one place where user-generated
content really spikes and the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.610
data set becomes interesting.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.140
And what we did with Samsung in
both 2011 and again in 2012

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.690
at the South by Southwest
Interactive Festival.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.250
And looked at what terms
were trending.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.940
What startups were starting
to surge.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.090
What panelists were getting
the most chatter.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.310
And then, of course, the night
life, which parties were the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.420
most popular, who was
checking in where.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.110
MEGAN SMITH: Which
is really fun.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.650
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.010
We're looking at that kind
of outcome screens.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.640
But even going through our
thinking and our processes,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.270
what information is going to be
important to that end user?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.790
You've got people
walking around

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.430
and badges and hungover.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.380
What kind of information
do they need to know?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.450
Well, they need to know
where the panels are.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.080
And if they're missing the
panels or they're stuck in

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.120
line, what's being said
and being shared?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.500
And that was something that
we really watched.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.980
It was at a point throughout the
event that certain pieces

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.870
of news were breaking.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.720
There was a rumor that CNN was
going to buy Mashable.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.670
And all of a sudden, our screen
showed all of the

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.680
people discussing it.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.540
And everybody's eyes just kind
of glued to it as if it was

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.350
the TV station.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.610
So we're always looking
at live events.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.840
Obviously, politics,
sporting events.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.630
We did a project around the
NFL and Superbowl XLV with

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.460
Twitter and just looked at ways
that fans were excited

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.350
and talking trash, and
going back and forth.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.680
And those are really the moments
where the data spikes.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.340
And then, things start getting
interesting at that point.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.460
BETSY MASIELLO: A lot of what
you're describing is sort of a

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.500
new way of sociology, measuring
what's happening in

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.260
real-time using all this data.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.600
And I think you were telling
me, as we were preparing

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.390
earlier, that you had
studied sociology a

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.660
little bit in school.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.350
What was your path like to get
from that to what is now a

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.490
very data-intensive sort
of role in life?

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.040
LESLIE BRADSHAW: I think when
we all go to high school and

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.920
college, there's probably
about five jobs we can

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.800
conceive of.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.330
There's an astronaut,
a firefighter,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.910
a teacher, a lawyer.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.285
And I thought I was going to be
a lawyer because I thought,

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:37.510
oh, that's what some of
my family members do.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.640
That's what smart people do.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.710
Make some money.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.880
And you go into school, and then
all of a sudden you get

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.790
exposed most often to this
liberal arts education.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.680
And you're just eating
from the buffet of

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.660
education and life.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.350
And I loved sociology
and statistics.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.340
And then I'm over here and I'm
learning about Western

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.940
civilization.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.570
So there was a lot of courses
that I took at the University

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.440
of Chicago that just, my mind
was open and it was cross

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.440
disciplinary, and it was just
a lot of intellectual

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.660
cultivation, I guess.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.690
So you go through that and
then you graduate.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.960
And then you need
to get a job.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.200
And at that point I said, OK,
well, I've been an assistant

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.220
paralegal at a few law
firms back home.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.190
I guess I'll be a lawyer.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.570
I guess I'll go in
that direction.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.320
And while there at my first law
firm, it was at the moment

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.600
when a lot of the phishing
scandals and a lot of the

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.100
domain name squatting
was occurring.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.930
And I was helping track
those violations.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.659
I would screenshot the source
code or I'd screenshot the

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.340
domain name violation, pull up
the trademark, and make a

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.320
little file.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.799
It started to dawn on me that
there was this kind of

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.950
cataclysmic shift as brands
were coming online and as

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.190
other people were exploiting
brands that there was

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.080
something to the digital
brand management.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.030
And I think that's really where
I started saying, OK,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.060
there gold in them
there hills.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.310
And not that I was early to say
that because it was 2005

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.350
and .com had already
come through.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.430
But it was starting to impact
brands in a way that I think

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.380
forever changed the way they
approached their brand

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.050
management.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.800
MEGAN SMITH: Almost like a pure
digital agency, which is

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.200
where you guys, as
a team, came.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.880
In fact, to the level where as
you started, I think everybody

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.960
was in different cities.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.770
Is that true?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.395
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah.

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:16.270
So with JESS3 what we were
starting to realize is working

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.080
at traditional agencies, working
in law firms, there

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.240
was just a lack of grabbing onto
this new frontier in a

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.060
really holistic way.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.550
People were digitizing records
and trying to kind of think

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.490
beyond email.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.720
But it wasn't happening fast
enough for our liking.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.440
So my business partner and I,
we were 24 at the time.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.520
And he was doing a lot of
freelance work and I was kind

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.320
of getting a little bit bored
filing papers and

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.740
screenshotting source
code all day.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.930
So we started building out a
bit of a company that we

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.290
decided we weren't going to
draw specifically from our

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.540
geography, but we were going
to use the internet to find

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.250
the best talent.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.970
And at the time, most people
would put their

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.570
portfolio work on Flickr.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.020
But over the years, now you have
things like Behance and

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.190
Dribbble, and Forest.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.440
And we're able to identify kind
of the best in class.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.110
And going to blogs like
infosthetics and Information

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.810
is Beautiful, you see whose work
is featured and you say--

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.610
everybody has a rate.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.210
We were able to even work
with Nicholas Felton

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.160
who's now at Facebook.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.380
And we worked with him on an
infographic years ago because

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.100
we just reached out and said,
hey, we love your work.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.090
And we had a project
and collaborated a

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.106
little bit with him.

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:19.720
MEGAN SMITH: That's a great
best practice for--

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.900
in visualization you can see
amazing work and then go get

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.200
those people.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.700
LESLIE BRADSHAW: It is.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.420
It's a very, very transparent
industry.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.420
And every once in a while,
you'll get someone who puts a

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.780
portfolio piece up that they
were one team member of a

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.480
larger team.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.850
But by and large, it's kind of
what you see is what you get.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.360
MEGAN SMITH: You've had
people from Poland.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.400
You guys were in DC.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.810
LESLIE BRADSHAW: We were
in Washington, DC.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.550
And in a lot of ways, I thought
of us less as an

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.300
agency and more--

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.250
there was almost kind of this
supply chain management that

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.800
was going on because I'd wake
up at a certain time and I

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.250
would check-in with people that
were producing graphics.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.172
And then I'd have to check-in
with the animators who were in

00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:55.940
a different city.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.160
It was a lot of coordination.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.530
And I would definitely say that
the cloud played a huge

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.260
part in even being able
to conceive that we

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.780
were able to do it.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.580
But I will also say that there
has been so many times that

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.150
when we all come together and
work together, we do a Google

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.110
War Room every time
we have an event.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.940
And that's when it just--
it's more efficient.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.350
And certainly there's a lot to
be said about the cloud, but

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.910
the human interaction I've come
to really appreciate in

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.840
the last year or so.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.190
MEGAN SMITH: You guys have
explosive growth.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.040
The things in Fast Company, Inc,
everybody's saying you

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.810
guys are just--

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.420
it's an amazing story.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.390
And so it's sort of--

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.810
I don't know if you can talk a
little bit about the fly the

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.240
plane and build the plane
at the same time kind of

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.590
experience you guys have
been going through.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.030
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Well, as I
noted, it started with my

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.370
partner and I. Then we had
a couple of freelancers.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.540
And we were throttling between
doing work for local

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.040
businesses, and doing logos,
and that kind of work.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.470
And we were stretching at the
same time, because we saw this

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.350
user-generated content
opportunity.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.360
We were leveraging, originally
Delicious and

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.370
Flickr had good APIs.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.410
And then, eventually Twitter
came online.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.230
And of course, Facebook
opened their platform.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.200
So we really decided, first
and foremost, let's

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.880
specialize.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.780
Let's specialize in data
visualization.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.880
And let's go a step further and
let's even specialize in

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.040
social media data
visualization.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.280
And it's kind of like betting
on the right horse because

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.900
those things were kind of
up and to the right.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.340
And as those user basis got
larger and the volume and

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.220
velocity of their content got
bigger, there were brands who

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.570
wanted to take that and
make sense of it.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.810
There were people who wanted
business intelligence and

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.700
insights off of it.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.250
So that really was a big part
of our explosive growth was

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.910
the specialization and
capitalizing off of the

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.510
proliferation of APIs.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.410
The second thing about the
growth is that it really came

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.980
down to just really trusting and
going after what we knew

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.870
was the right thing.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.420
Unlike startups and
products, we don't

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.860
have any venture funding.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.140
So this is 100% bootstrapped,
cash flow management, kitchen

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.950
table business, hope we make
payroll, hope that check comes

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.060
in on time.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.550
But in a way, you have these
amazing brands, like Google

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.480
and Red Bull and NASA,
underwriting your

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.120
experimentation.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.490
So we did a lot of prototyping
in the early days.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.870
One big piece of advice I always
love to give is, don't

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.360
wait for a client to pay you.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.130
Take some of those profits
and reinvest.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.270
And I think that some of our
projects, like the I Voted

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.710
project where we did the first
kind of visual, real-time

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.010
civic participation.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.320
We also did another project
called The Geosocial Universe,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.140
a very simple graphic that just
showed the enormity of

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.130
mobile versus some of the more
kind of Lilliputian, Gowalla

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.570
at the time and Foursquare.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.960
And those are things that are
proofs of concept that later

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.480
turned into lead generation.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.070
And kind of proved out something
that we knew that we

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.286
could do, but nobody was
yet paying us to do it.

00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:47.250
MEGAN SMITH: Almost
like how you found

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.700
some of your artists.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.400
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Exactly.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.330
Yeah, so it's kind of you've got
to chum the water a little

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.354
bit, and then get people to
think in the way that you know

00:13:55.354 --> 00:13:56.970
that you can deliver on.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.120
Really, actually amazing, our
first Google project came

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.430
about because we made a video
called "The State of the

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.610
Internet." And at the time,
we had never done a video.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.010
And we were going to a lot
of lectures and local

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.560
universities and just talking
about the growth of the

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.440
internet was being driven by
social media, and social media

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.550
is something that is
very flexible and

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.520
everybody can get involved.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.700
And we wanted to show that.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.170
And we did it usually through
a few slides.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.870
We said, you know what?

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.050
We're going to do a video.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.300
So we put this video out.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.630
And lo and behold, big
surprise, it goes

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.540
viral on the internet.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.370
A video about the internet goes
viral on the internet.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.280
It's very meta.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.000
And we got a call from Google
and the Google Translate team.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.655
And they were looking for a
motion graphics team, and they

00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:36.365
had seen our video.

00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:38.290
And little did they know it was
the only video we'd ever

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.710
done at that point.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.690
But fake it till you make it.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.250
And it turned into a project
where we did the official

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.060
About video for the
translate team.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.170
And it was a lot of fun.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.340
BETSY MASIELLO: Very cool.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.180
You said you were
only 24 when you

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.620
started this whole venture.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.180
And you and your partner Jesse
are not in the first

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.850
generation of leaders
in this space.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.560
Where do you see this
interactive space going?

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.130
And then, where do you
want to take it?

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.460
So one thing I see companies
that are being founded today,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.980
there's not a clear line of, oh,
it's a service business or

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.920
it's a product business.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.560
I think terms like creative
technologists are emerging.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.400
People are hiring data
scientists that are not just

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.000
at Oracle, but anybody who's
trying to analyze metrics and

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.630
make kind of mission-critical
decisions.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.510
So I would say there's a fusion
between the art of

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.520
marketing and the science of
technology in Silicon Valley.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.630
And what we've said of our firm,
we want to fuse Madison

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.250
Avenue and Silicon Valley.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.850
Now we're based in Los Angeles
and we also want to fuse

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.610
Hollywood in there.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.260
So we're kind of throwing
all three together.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.470
But I don't think we're
the only ones.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.300
I think there's a lot of other
companies who are looking at

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.750
the proliferation of content,
and trying to make sense of it

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.770
and put it in a way that is
discernible and digestible.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.220
And at the same time, looking
for ways to storytell and

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.380
looking for ways to
engage people.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.180
And then also, monetize it.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.820
And add some kind of layer of
payment and the ability to

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.810
kind of keep growing.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.640
So I would say, by
and large, it's a

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.900
fusion of art and science.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.790
And where we want to
take it is just

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.890
through those three doors.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.710
We want to continue to work
with the Madison Avenue

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.720
brands, and help
them storytell.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.900
But at the same time, we want
to have our own prototyping

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.100
and products division where
we're taking some of our

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.510
learnings while we're processing
all of this data

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.520
and thinking about, well, gosh,
if every client comes to

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.870
us every year around the
Oscars or the Olympics,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.110
there's a product here.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.700
There's a way to
visualize that.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.960
And I think there's certainly
some smart folks getting into

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.720
this space and specializing
only in that.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.220
You have somebody like a Mass
Relevance or, on the business

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.670
intelligence side, Radian6
or Crimson Hexagon.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.040
But nobody's specializing
specifically in

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040
the design of it.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.290
Whenever they close a round of
funding, they always say, oh,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.670
we're having 60 engineers.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.370
But you don't really hear them
talk a lot about UI designers

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.600
or graphic artists.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.970
And I think that's where we've
really differentiated and also

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.050
partnered with firms that
specialize more

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.320
on that back end.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.609
MEGAN SMITH: It's really
important because

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.970
visualization has a way-- it
certainly reminds me some of

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.480
the greatest change comes
from storytelling.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.550
You may have the data, but
until you storytell well

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.829
around it, nobody really gets
the point, or they don't see

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.790
how it connects to them,
or there's no

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.339
sort of call to action.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.800
And so you guys are the visual
form of that in a really

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.050
interesting way.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.620
Another example that might be
fun to show or great to show

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.360
would be the one that you guys
did with American Express.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.410
In fact, that's a static
version, but it has to do with

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.150
change for women in business.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.350
LESLIE BRADSHAW: This is
one, of course, near

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.030
and dear to my heart.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.940
Near and dear, I'm sure, to
the audience as well.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.770
But American Express did a great
job of pulling a lot of

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.520
data out of the Census report in
2010 and looked at a lot of

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.650
the small business growth.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.185
And just how women were driving
growth in, I think it

00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:52.660
was 7 out of 13 major
categories.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.790
And just the economic impact
of women-owned businesses.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.200
Now, they released a report
in the spring.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.480
And a lot of people picked it up
more just kind of based on

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.670
some of the factoids.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.260
But they thought, there's a
longer shelf life to this.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.000
So we ended up creating 90
pieces of content with them.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.960
One is a large infographic that
shows just kind of the

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.420
overall path from starting a
company to the growth and the

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.670
kind of macroeconomic impact.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.000
And then what we did is we
worked with individual

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.070
entrepreneurs and we asked
them questions.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.720
MEGAN SMITH: Is this the one?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.180
Yeah, this is the one.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.580
LESLIE BRADSHAW: "Your Business,
Your Goals, Your

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.480
Journey." And then we worked
with individual entrepreneurs

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.760
who would tell their story.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.900
So there was a kind of
storytelling through data, and

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.730
then there was more of a
qualitative storytelling

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.190
through the women who were
doing this themselves.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.820
And we used some terms,
we call it

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.160
socially optimized content.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.810
Now, an infographic, when you
look at some of those

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.570
scrolling ones and you try to
put it on your G+ page or your

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.380
Facebook page, they become
really hard to read.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.930
So what we've done is we kind
of optimize it for the

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.640
particular dimensions
on the platform.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.070
So we create snackable
graphics.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.430
So it kind of cracks open,
kind of in a fractal way,

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.820
takes the big infographic and
maybe makes 10 smaller

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.620
graphics out of it.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.980
So part of the 90 pieces of
content, one was this anchored

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.370
mega infographic--

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.470
supergraphic which is what
Edward Tufte would call it.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.970
And then, we had a lot of other
kind of snackable pieces

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.890
that were easier to share,
easier to see on your mobile,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.160
easier to share on social, put
on Tumblr, that kind of thing.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.130
MEGAN SMITH: This is a
huge contribution.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.290
I was able--

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.780
for a little while at Google I
led kind of a transition of

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.050
google.org where we added more
engineering, like Google

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.200
Crisis Response and outreach
to nonprofits.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.130
And one of my observations in
that particular space is that

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.950
people are doing amazing work,
but the end product when

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.000
they're communicating is often
a very thick journal or

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.540
written document that a subset
of people have sort of maybe

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.060
the background to read that,
or less people are able to

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.220
read that just because
they're busy.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.520
So being able to do things like
this, sort of synthesize

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.030
the data, and then put it into
visual form is really, I

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.190
think, a high contribution and
an important skill, a 21st

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.830
century skill.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.490
BETSY MASIELLO: You were talking
a little bit earlier

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.750
today about saying, have
you measured this on

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.470
decision-making?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.920
And you were saying actually,
no, you've measured it on

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.170
consumption, which is
pretty interesting.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.680
So you find that people are
actually consuming this

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.710
information when it's
in graphic form.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.980
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Anecdotally I
can say, one of our clients,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.070
Nike, we do a lot of reporting
on growth of their social

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.090
platforms and how social is
kind of driving to their

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.790
commerce site.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.890
And we were originally
delivering this.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.555
We'd load it up in Google
Docs, and then

00:20:27.555 --> 00:20:28.590
we'd export as a PDF.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.210
And it was a written document.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.890
And it seemed kind of
counter-intuitive because here

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.040
we are a visual storytelling
form and we're

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.160
delivering this Word doc.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.240
And so what we ended up doing
is turning that information

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.030
into an infographic.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.520
So every week, we produce
an infographic for Nike.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.060
It's optimized for Keynote
or PowerPoint slide.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.190
And it gives you
just the facts.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.230
And its storytells with
qualitative and quantitative

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.575
information.

00:20:51.575 --> 00:20:54.620
And I can tell you, everybody
looks forward to that.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.730
It's something that the
executives have on their desk.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.970
It's easier to kind of make an
argument or have a discussion

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.250
as opposed to having, as
you said, a big kind of

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.040
thick ream of paper.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.690
And I've written plenty of big
thick reports in my life.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.310
And I know that even the most
considerate, intelligent

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.850
people just do not
have the time.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.290
And I think what information
design does is it distills it

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.960
down and really forces you to
kind of get those potent

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.870
nuggets in front of someone
in a faster way.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.080
One of my favorite projects,
actually thinking about a big

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.560
ream of paper.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.490
So we had 150-page
white paper.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.810
And if we can pull it up.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.110
If you even just Google
Economist and JESS3, it was a

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.580
project where they had done--

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.700
"The Economist" had put together
a study of 113

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.490
countries and the
global economic

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.250
opportunity for women.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.050
And amazing project.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.020
And it was something
that, again, near

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.690
and dear to my heart.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.430
And it was "The Economist,"
so they've got great data.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.340
But it was 150-page
white paper.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.240
And you can just imagine there's
probably 8 people out

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.130
there, 4 of which are working
on a PhD and 4 of which are

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.560
probably paid to read it.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.470
And they came to us and
we animated it in

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.680
the 6-minute piece.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.220
And it was incredibly
powerful.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.010
And we just saw it just spread
like wildfire online.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.690
And it distilled down six
executive findings.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:16.290
It story told about the gap
between policy and practice.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.060
And it really illustrated that
in a very powerful way.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.790
And that convinced me
immediately, from here on out,

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.920
any time I have a report it's
either going to be animated or

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.010
it's going to be designed in
an infographic because you

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.670
could just see the audience.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.770
Because it was presented
at a forum, their

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.220
World in 2011 series.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.740
And other people got up there
and kind of showed your

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.790
traditional slides.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.940
And people kind of
checked out.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.460
But the video, you could just
watch everyone's body posture

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.430
and their eye contact.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.640
And so I think the consumption,
again, I don't

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.370
have the hard data.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.930
But qualitatively, I've seen
people really engage better

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.840
with both video and infographic
content.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.950
So I think it's a smart tool,
whether it's an internal

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.320
communication or whether you're
doing any kind of

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.560
consumer-facing communications.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.640
IBM has done a great job.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.700
Think about their Smarter
Planet, and that entire

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.710
campaign is an icon, data-driven
kind of thing.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.840
And that's where consumers
are today.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.270
They are more educated.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.610
They are wanting to consume
Wikipedia and IMDb while

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.410
they're watching their
favorite show.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:20.020
And brands are being smart to
put that information at their

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.090
fingertips.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.030
BETSY MASIELLO: It's
not just consumers.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.530
I think in the policy space,
a lot of what you've talked

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.220
about is sort of policy
relevant.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.310
And certainly, there's a lot of
150-page reports floating

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.260
around out there about various
different policies--

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.190
MEGAN SMITH: That are
good, but they're

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.790
like not the end product.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.240
They need to stop being
the end product.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.790
We need the visualizations, and
then the social discussion

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.420
after that to be more of the
goal with the data behind it,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.140
real good data.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.830
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Exactly.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.230
Absolutely.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.690
BETSY MASIELLO: So you
have a regular--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.440
a column on forbes.com where you
advocate for women getting

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.220
more power seats.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.010
Tell us a little bit about why
that's so important to you.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.920
LESLIE BRADSHAW:
So I saw Sheryl

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.210
Sandberg's TED talk, TEDxWomen.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.690
And she talked about there was a
couple of staff members from

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.980
George Bush's staff that gave
up seats and kind of stood

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.810
against the wall.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.790
And she kind of used that as
this metaphor, more women need

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.570
to take that seat
at the table.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.470
And looking up quite a bit to
Sheryl, I thought to myself,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.410
not only do they need to sit at
the table, but they need to

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.300
be at the head of the table.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.130
The idea of it's not just about
more seats, but it's

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.160
about more power seats.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.400
I think we're seeing parity in
a lot of areas for women that

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.630
weren't here 50 years ago.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.590
We think about education,
obtaining higher levels of

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.510
education, and master's degrees
and law degrees.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.890
But it starts dropping off
the further up the

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:33.820
food chain you go.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.460
And so what I advocate for is
that we don't want to see

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.140
single and low double-digit
numbers in Congress, in

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.590
venture capital funding,
in-- you name it.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.070
Even the clergy I looked up and
it was 15% of all clergy

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.960
leadership are female.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.820
So seeing those numbers get
closer to 50% is something

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.970
that I hope to see in my
lifetime across as many

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.690
industries as possible.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.260
MEGAN SMITH: One thing that's
interesting is the president

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.520
of Harvey Mudd College has been
working hard on computer

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.740
science because computer science
for a very long time

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.720
has been 10% to 20% women
in the field.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.440
Which doesn't make sense given
the impact and the fun in

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.370
what's out there.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.000
But she was studying how the
entry point into that

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.310
particular major is
somehow not of

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.640
interest to women at scale.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.250
And so she made three changes.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.610
One of them was to take the
freshman to the Grace Hopper

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.910
Celebration on Women in
Computing, which is where

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.430
4,000 women get together who are
computer scientists at all

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.810
level from senior fellows to new
undergrads, so they could

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.860
see women in the field.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.090
The second thing that
they did was change

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.600
the class entry point.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.660
So that instead of straight
into programming, they

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.230
actually did things that showed
you what this field was

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.790
about, and challenge projects,
and then get into programming,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.220
which was really important.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.990
And they also did a little
bit of rework on the

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.080
attitude in the class.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.480
And they had people, instead of
sort of let me prove to you

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.840
how I can code, it's more like,
hey, if you're really

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.110
good, why don't you prove how
well you can help other people

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.620
and turn people into more mentor
peers with sort of the

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.040
rock star programmers.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.695
And they're at 42% women after
3 years in the computer

00:26:08.695 --> 00:26:08.840
science program.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.120
LESLIE BRADSHAW: I just
got goosebumps.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.550
That's amazing.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.220
MEGAN SMITH: Which is
really exciting.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.920
Yeah.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.740
So it's really, I think in a
lot of ways, showing people

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.580
how exciting these careers
are and how fun they are.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.480
And whether you're
coding or whether

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.600
you're in the core team.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.350
Because all of the tech teams
are really cross functional

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.770
teams of writers, and
visualization, and artists,

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.310
and people who keep the trains
running on time, and people

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.245
who run the back end of the
systems, front end, et cetera.

00:26:33.245 --> 00:26:36.500
So helping people see a way into
that because there are so

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.900
many jobs in our field, it's
exciting to see finally when

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.340
there's a few bright spots.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.560
Because it is pretty daunting,
the numbers are daunting.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.260
LESLIE BRADSHAW: The numbers are
daunting, but I love this

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.030
idea of different
entry points.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.610
I think one thing people often
say, oh, there's not enough

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.360
female technical people to
found companies and I'm

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.150
looking for a technical
founder.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:01.260
And I think it's not the right
question to be asking is

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.540
whether or not you're that
hard core inner computer

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.630
science person, but there's
other things that can bring

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.330
you to that table.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.820
There's people that can
do interaction design.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.300
There are people
that can do the

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.200
operational side of things.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.560
People that do HR piece of it.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.800
It all needs to come together.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.740
And certainly, when you look at
those numbers, I think the

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.460
number is more than just 20% to
30%, but probably expands

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.410
closer to that 50% that
we'd want it to be.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.640
I look at my own company
and the way that--

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.450
the gender makeup.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.790
And it's about 50-50.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.440
We've had women.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.080
We've had female programmers.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.680
Our head of information design
is a woman and she's based in

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.630
England, Tiffany Gonzalez.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.520
And we've had interactive
designers that are women.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.700
It doesn't have to
be that kind of,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.730
again, that hard core.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.770
I think when you think of
somebody in their basement

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.070
programming or eating Cheetos
and drinking Mountain Dew or

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.850
Red Bull or something
like that.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.705
I think that's that default
stereotype, but I think

00:27:56.705 --> 00:27:57.960
there's a lot of other
entry points.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.520
And I love that the program
that it sounds like Harvey

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:00.790
Mudd has been--

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.340
MEGAN SMITH: You can eventually
get to be the

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.680
Cheeto-eating programmer in the
basement, but not right

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.570
away on the path.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.130
Talk a little bit
about school.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.150
Because I think one of the other
things with women coming

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.980
into technology, having
confidence in yourself

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.380
You actually have been an
entrepreneur for a long time.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.910
You guys have a family farm.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.060
LESLIE BRADSHAW: So one thing
I would say about my

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.410
upbringing is I've looked a
lot to my father and his

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.060
entrepreneurial self.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.570
He didn't go to college and just
kind of started working

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.390
his way up through
various jobs.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.160
And eventually, went from being
a ski lift operator in

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.790
Lake Tahoe to being a general
manager after 13 years.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.370
So I saw my father go to work
early in the morning, late at

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.380
night, take any shit he could
get, and just learn every

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.440
aspect of the business.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.670
So that in my mind was like,
OK, that's how you do it.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.340
Learn every aspect of the
business and work your way up.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.480
I think my parents also
instilled a lot of

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.290
confidence in me.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.690
And I have a younger sister,
so it's just us girls.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.160
And it wasn't, oh, boys do
certain things, girls do

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.790
certain things.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.930
We were always very
active outdoors.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.500
I loved science and math and
went to a science and math

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.020
camp and econ camp.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.180
And that was always
encouraged.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.510
So I never had a lack of
confidence, and probably could

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.800
be said atc certain points, I
probably have a little bit too

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.740
much confidence.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.930
I think each personality is
going to develop differently.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.160
There's probably men out there
with less confidence and the

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.220
women that are overconfident.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.440
But in general, I think women
tend to put themselves second.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.340
Whether they're sisters, or
mothers, or daughters, they're

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.810
always in this role of making
sure everyone's OK.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.190
And when you make sure
everyone's OK, sometimes you

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.800
kind of take that foot
off the gas pedal.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.540
Again, to use some Sheryl
Sandberg language in talking

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.950
about not stepping up and
saying, yes, I'll take that

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.490
opportunity.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.072
But you know what?

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:45.350
Oh, Frank, he's been
working hard.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.620
Let's have Frank have this one,
or giving the credit,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.280
kind of further distributing
it.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.600
And I think that those are some
really great traits of

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.350
the female gender.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.810
But at the same time, they are
inhibiting, oftentimes, the

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:00.225
advancement and putting women
further at the top.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.330
MEGAN SMITH: You were accepted
to University of

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.950
Chicago and to Davis.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.085
And you decided not
to go to Chicago.

00:30:09.085 --> 00:30:10.660
Say a little bit about that.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.200
LESLIE BRADSHAW: So here I am,
I graduated from a rural high

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.680
school in Junction
City, Oregon.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.110
And I was valedictorian and I
thought, OK, I'm going to go

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.040
make my way in the world.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.520
And I was touring a couple
different schools, among them

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.270
Davis and Chicago.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.950
And I went to Chicago and all
of the students had already

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.370
read all the texts
that they were

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.990
discussing in the classes.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.230
They had gone to private
schools.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.700
And I had no concept of this,
but they actually paid as much

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.340
to go to high school as I was
about to pay to go to college.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.600
And it just completely
blew my mind.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.980
And it was intimidating.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.390
Honestly, it was very
intimidating.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.200
And then I was offered a full
ride scholarship to UC-Davis.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.970
Because I had grown up in
Northern California and

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.330
Oregon, I had family members
in Sacramento

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.760
and around the area.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.230
I thought, OK, I'll go there.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.840
And I'll tell you, two
weeks in, I knew I

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.890
made the wrong choice.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.220
Davis is a wonderful place,
great school, really enjoyed

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:58.790
the professors.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.070
But it was really large.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.660
People weren't going
there for academic

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.970
inquiry at the volume.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.040
It was kind of more
of a default.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.500
Like, oh, I did pretty
well in high school.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.230
I'm going to matriculate
to this school.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.360
Whereas Chicago, highly
self-selecting.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.110
You're on the South
Side of Chicago.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.900
It's cold.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.060
The school's hard.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.940
You have to take
a lot of math.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.840
And I decided to reapply.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.450
And at that point when I
reapplied, I was talking with

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.440
the counselor.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.960
And he said to me, Leslie, you
didn't just get in once, but

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.630
you got in twice.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.070
So you do deserve to be here and
I hope you remember that

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.160
for the rest of your time.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.850
So I ended up graduating
top 2% of my class.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.500
And went to every single
lecture, did not

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.410
miss a single beat.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.410
Because it was if you didn't,
everybody else

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.180
would kind of lap you.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.830
So it was a really competitive
environment, but it was also

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.770
really kind of nerdy, and fun,
and being smart was cool.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.870
And I loved that.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.860
MEGAN SMITH: But I think it's
telling you've done this

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.560
amazing thing.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.180
But to have a moment where sort
of confidence is taking

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.280
you in a different direction
is important.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.060
I think that happens to a
lot of women and men.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.560
And it's important to note that
that's a pretty normal

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.270
experience.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.380
And then, you get
back up and go.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.930
And just keep going.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.120
LESLIE BRADSHAW: The one secret
to my success at JESS3,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.610
and now looking back at the last
30 years of my life, it's

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:13.760
perseverance.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.600
It's discipline.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.250
It's showing up every
single day.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.460
And there were so many points
throughout the last six years

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.980
that it would have been so
easy to walk away because

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.650
things got stressful, people
quit, project didn't go as

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.190
well as we'd like it to.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.970
But I also knew that there
was more to come.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.125
If we just kept showing up--

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:36.390
I knew that if I kept showing up
and putting my best in, and

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:41.460
showed that to the rest of the
team, then we could make it.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.910
We've had a couple of
really great awards.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.740
You mentioned we made the Inc
500 this year at number 430

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.990
with our growth.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.320
And that took every
ounce of me.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.250
Every blood, sweat, tears.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.300
It's only been in the last few
months that I'm starting to

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.870
sleep regular hours again.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:57.950
But for six years--

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.640
and for three of those
years mind you, I

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.050
had a full-time job.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.360
So I was coming home, eating
dinner, rallying, working from

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.230
8:00 PM to 4:00 AM, collapsing,
rallying again,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.750
getting back up and going
to my other job.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.310
And did that straight for three
years until we finally

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.350
had enough money and potential
to make that bigger leap.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.090
So there's, certainly again,
lots of times that you could

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.790
have just folded up and walked
away, but showing up every day

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.370
as I did, whether it's at
University of Chicago or with

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.380
JESS3, it's just
giving it 110%.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.820
MEGAN SMITH: Yeah, showing up
at the place you want to be

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.550
and going for it.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.890
I mean, you're at over $5
million in revenue at this

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.310
point, which is just amazing.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.570
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yes.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.790
So when I look back and I add up
every single year, which I

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.820
do sometimes, we've officially
crossed the $10 million mark,

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.610
which is really just a big
number in my mind.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.060
I can hardly even
think about it.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.770
But it's every little check,
every little moment kind of

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.920
collected all in one place.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.070
And this year, due in large part
to amazing partnerships

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.450
with clients like American
Express and we talked about

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.050
Google and Samsung.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.370
Another one that we worked
with over years is Intel.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.050
It doesn't get more Silicon
Valley than being able to work

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.940
with the chip maker that
made it all possible.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.720
So it's been fantastic.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.969
And to have the trust
of those brands--

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.409
and they're coming to us for
really fun prototyping,

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:14.380
experimental work.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.090
And they're looking
to us to kind of

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.739
help them think through--

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:20.790
I always think of us almost as
the Navy seals who are kind of

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.980
dropping out of a black
helicopter and

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.860
kind of solving something.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.224
And then kind of zip-cording
back up.

00:34:27.224 --> 00:34:28.020
MEGAN SMITH: And then
it goes on.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.980
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Yeah,
it keeps going.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.400
BETSY MASIELLO: We've
talked a lot about

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.980
your distributed team.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.850
How do you think that
leadership--

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.570
how do you change your
leadership style to adapt to

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.290
what sounds like is a very
distributed global

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.989
team around the world?

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.030
LESLIE BRADSHAW: So one of the
things that I always try to do

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.270
is have as much face
time as possible.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.110
And oftentimes, that face time
comes in the form of a Skype

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.500
session, or a Google Hangout.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.929
Oftentimes, our information
design director is logging on

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.480
just as I'm logging off.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.489
And I'll grab her on IM
and say, hey, Tiff,

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.420
let's just catch up.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.940
And at that point, I always like
to hear from everyone and

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.300
just say, what are
you working on?

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.360
Any roadblocks?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.260
Anything that you're
bumping up against?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.180
I think also, we typically do
one to two summits a year

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.740
where we bring everyone together
as much as we can

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.460
from all over.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.110
And that's an opportunity to
break bread together and to

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.290
finally work together in the
same room on a whiteboard.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.590
And that's incredibly
important.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.720
But also, making sure that we're
constantly celebrating

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.590
wins as a team.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.840
And whether that's through our
blog, or tweeting it, or

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.980
sending around emails, there's
kind of a constant flow of

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.380
discussion groups that
are going on.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.170
And then we have a couple of
other distribution lists and

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.900
list groups within
the company.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.440
We have Ladies at JESS3.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.040
We send around links when the
Anne-Marie Slaughter piece

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.410
came out in "The Atlantic," or
just different things that we

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.060
want to kind of rally around.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.890
And we certainly make sure to
just reinforce contributions

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.900
from, oh, this person did this
and shout everybody out.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.190
Because sometimes you've
never met the person.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.020
Or people don't know who's
working on everything because

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.600
even though it's a small team
of 30, about 30 full-time,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.190
there's dozens, if not hundreds,
of contractors

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.280
worldwide that are
contributing.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.200
And to be able to pull everybody
in is tough, but

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.740
we've managed to do it.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.710
MEGAN SMITH: There's a couple
questions on moderator.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.270
So let's see, DBR in San
Francisco wants to know, how

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.620
do you balance growing head
count to be able to take on

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.970
more work with growing cash
flow to make pay?

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:29.890
How do you balance that?

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:34.570
And he or she is also saying,
how have the clients of JESS3

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.930
changed over time?

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.145
And how's the focus
of the work?

00:36:37.145 --> 00:36:38.720
All right, so maybe those
are a little bit

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.940
related in some ways.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.970
LESLIE BRADSHAW: So in terms of
head count, one thing we've

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.860
always done is, it's been
mostly contractor.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.750
And we'll do kind of
permalancer, someone who is

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.970
permanently part of the team but
you don't bring on as that

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.080
full-time employee
with benefits.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.880
And that model has been
incredibly successful for us

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.940
because then we're able to kind
of throttle up and down.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.280
It's known by both ends that
it may be that way.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.790
So first and foremost, relying
more on contractors, less on

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.950
full-time head count.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.560
The second thing, as far as the
ways that the clients have

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.280
changed over the years.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.590
We did Busboys and Poets, their
logo, helped with their

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.050
mural in Washington, DC.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.435
A really just amazing restaurant
and entrepreneur

00:37:20.435 --> 00:37:22.940
Andy Shallal.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.760
That was one of Jesse's
first clients.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.420
He built the entire website
on Blogger.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.750
And designed it all himself and
hacked it together because

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.970
he's not a programmer, per se,
but he's a designer and he

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.210
figured it out.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.380
And we would still have that
client while we started

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.410
picking up clients like
Nestle and Pfizer.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.760
And we started working, kind
of bridging with having

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.080
agencies do overflow.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.590
So we'd get hired by
agencies to work on

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.390
subcontractor basis.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.350
And I will say, it was a painful
process to go from the

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.860
small business servicing because
we had a price point

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.260
that we could make a little
bit of money.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.300
And at the time, it was
just subsidizing.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.200
Jesse and I both had
full-time jobs.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.430
And at that point, it was just
kind of mad money to go on

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.310
vacation or something.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.900
But what happened when we both
quit our jobs and all of a

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.050
sudden we had a few employees,
it got real.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.490
And the pricing needed to get
real to reflect that.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.320
And our previous clients that
we were still servicing at a

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.920
certain price point,
it wasn't working.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.220
So we had to--

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.860
I guess the term might be fire
clients or have that tough

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.090
conversation.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.330
And that was probably one of the
hardest things I've ever

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:33.180
had to do in this position of
six years is no longer work

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.610
with certain clients
because they had an

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.560
expectation of a price.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.770
But in order for me to cover
overhead full-time and also

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:42.330
our talent pool, we just kept
trying to increase and

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.790
increase the kind of people
we were bringing in.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.760
So the price of their time went
up, so then we had to

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.590
pass it on to the customer.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.750
So that was a difficult
transition.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.870
And I would say that all
occurred probably about 2010.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:58.890
And by 2011 and 2012, we'd been
100% direct to brand, no

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.610
agency overflow work.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.090
And been able to keep our
pricing consistent, so that

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.280
there aren't those conversations
again.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.050
MEGAN SMITH: We have a couple
more over here.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.540
Let's see.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.310
So someone interested in getting
to-- it doesn't say

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.020
from where.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.520
For someone who's just starting
out in tech, how do I

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.840
get into information design?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.320
Where would you start?

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.420
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Well, I would
definitely start with being

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.820
comfortable with wire framing.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.310
And I wire frame on
a whiteboard.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.660
I often take photos of things
that I've sketched out.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.320
But just being comfortable with
drawing and using Adobe

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.920
Illustrator is also what our
information architects use.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.980
It doesn't have to be high
fidelity in the way that if

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.510
you see some really elaborate
UX work that a web

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.250
designer might do.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.160
But having the wire framing
and the drawing skill is

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.590
incredibly important.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.080
The second thing to be thinking
about is to start

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.750
looking at what kind of data
sets are available.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.490
And start thinking about how
you might pair them.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.540
One thing we did with Google
during the primaries is we

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.540
would take a Gallup data set.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.190
Then we would take a CNN poll.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.700
We would take the exit,
actual outcome.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.570
And then we'd take Google
Search data.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.500
And just being able to look at
multiple types of data and be

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.640
able to kind of storytell.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.120
So start thinking about data
and information, but then

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.480
also, find a way to draw
and think through

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.980
kind of some sketching.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.200
And Edward Tufte, I would say
he does a great course three

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.310
times a year throughout
the country.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.690
Try to take one of
his courses.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.720
They're pretty theoretical, but
I think it starts getting

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.310
your mind thinking about it.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.100
And it's not as intimidating
as it sounds.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:37.150
You really can have that lo-fi
wire framing process.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.880
And then you can hand it off to
someone else on the design

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.830
line, and they can kind of bring
it to life and do some

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.456
of the more beautiful, kind of
sexy visualization things.

00:40:46.456 --> 00:40:48.450
BETSY MASIELLO: Do you find that
people in your team make

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.560
that transition from starting
out with wire framing?

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.060
How hard a transition is that
to make from, I don't really

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.840
know what I'm doing?

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.920
I'm going to learn how to do
this first easy thing, and

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.260
then sort of get into
the harder, more

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.210
technical roles over time.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.970
LESLIE BRADSHAW: I would say we
have a lot of people coming

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.190
in who have a strong
background in

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.180
research and analysis.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.960
We've had people that
are history majors,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.950
who are former reporters.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.310
So they understand
how to storytell.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.480
And all they need to do is
partner with the next person

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.460
sitting kind of along
the continuum.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.730
In this case, it's Tiffany.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.190
And be able to work with
her to interpret that.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.400
And she's as much a designer
as she is a strategist.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.800
So it's kind of a fusion
of the two.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.210
I would say her role
is that linchpin.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.780
And then, the next one down
the line is that kind of

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.560
creative artist, who may not
have any concept or any

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.620
mathematical or statistical
background, but they're really

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.220
good at making things
look beautiful.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.180
And having the wire frame gives
them some parameters and

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.340
helps them understand the
relationship between data.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.030
I think one thing that we did
early on was institute the

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.240
wire frame in our infographic
and even

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.730
our storyboard process.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.750
Whereas, we see a lot of
people-- and if you've seen a

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.240
bad infographic, this is
probably what they did.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.480
They had an idea and some
information, and then they

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.540
designed it.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.020
Just went straight
to graphic color.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.770
And they skipped over
that process.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.445
And I think that's an incredibly
important process

00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:11.490
because that's when you work out
the kinks of, well, does

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:12.910
this make sense?

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.350
Am I really telling a story or
am I just making it look good?

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.540
Why are we doing this?

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.370
What's the goal?

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.130
What are you trying
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.360
There's two questions here that
are related to something

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.580
you guys were talking
about before.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.070
One is sort of talking about how
companies can involve more

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.190
women and starting early ages.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.950
But also talking about biggest
challenges in social in 2013.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.010
I actually think that part of
one of the answer says that

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.190
you were talking about, you guys
are both doing big data.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.710
You're doing visualization.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.850
There are a lot of jobs
that people predict.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:44.870
We need data scientists.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:45.395
We need visualization.

00:42:45.395 --> 00:42:46.380
We need people.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.890
In some ways, these kinds of
jobs, as an enticement to

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.100
young people, young
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.780
And also, sort of as a social
challenge, just being able to

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.310
see in big data.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.570
I don't know if you guys would
talk a little bit about it.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.050
I forget the number of jobs that
it's predicted are going

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.705
to be in this area, but it's
thousands and thousands.

00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.300
BETSY MASIELLO: It's
in the millions.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.680
MEGAN SMITH: That we need
to get ready for.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.690
And like the beginning of
computer science, probably

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.940
most of the people coming
to these jobs won't--

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.990
in terms of computer science,
people didn't have computer

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.970
science degrees because the
departments weren't there yet.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.350
And so people came from math
and economics and art,

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.080
whatever engineering.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.460
And so in the same way for
data visualization, other

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.000
places, they've going to
come from all over.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.220
So it's huge opportunity for
people for career growth if

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.050
they're interested.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.430
So I don't know if you guys
want to talk a little bit.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.400
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Well, I would
have loved some encouragement

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.230
from the teachers who saw
that I loved math.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.580
And then I was really good at
Latin, which is a big kind of

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.290
formulaic system.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:40.120
And there's a great program
going on in England called

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:40.800
Code is the New.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.730
Latin.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.760
And before I remember my parents
always saying, you

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.420
need to learn Latin.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.080
You need to learn Latin.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.960
And that was what you were
supposed to do to understand

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.980
root language and be successful
in business and

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.030
Medical and legal and fields.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.300
But you think about now shifting
that perception of

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.520
before it was all about going
into, let's say, law, if you

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.830
were going back to our original
five potential

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:06.140
vocations as a child, and making
engineer a really--

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.750
engineer, statistician, data
scientist, making that a part

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:09.490
of that choice set.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.390
And educating students not just
at the college level, but

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.550
really as they're coming up
and showing them what that

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.070
looks like.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.240
And I think that could be a
big disconnect potentially

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.510
between classrooms that are
still teaching to some pretty

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.250
basic vocational roles to
teaching to the future.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:27.770
And encouraging any
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.640
proclivity in math or a
fascination with science or

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.560
numbers that they can
parlay that into a

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.780
very important field.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.540
That, as you said,
the jobs abound.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.010
MEGAN SMITH: It's interesting
because it's sort of like the

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.120
makers, the makers
movement, meeting

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.640
sort of design thinking.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.470
So vocation ability to make
things, but also think about

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:51.020
how to transform or invent
or build sort of fits.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.970
It's interesting, there's an
article in "Technology Review"

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.710
this month, just a one page
update from Nicholas

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.660
Negroponte on the $100 laptop,
the one laptop per child.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.940
And there's some Android
tablets--

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.705
getting a phone call.

00:45:02.705 --> 00:45:03.955
Sorry.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.830
So of the Android tablets that
are in Ethiopia right now with

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.760
some kids who have no access
to literacy and

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.480
those kinds of things.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.440
But one of the things he said,
I think there's 400,000 kids

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.010
in Uruguay with PCs.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.770
Part of their curriculum,
they're all programming.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.050
So this idea that
all children--

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.340
Sue Black in the UK, who's in
computer science field is

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.690
thinking that, why shouldn't--

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.100
once you've learned to read in,
say second or third grade,

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.140
we're teaching kids cooking and
instruction in that way.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.560
Why shouldn't we learn
programming?

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.680
It's an instruction.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.630
It's a form.

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.700
And so you're starting to see
that actually with the

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:35.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.955
PC.

00:45:36.955 --> 00:45:39.710
So getting more coding and
making into the schools I

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.570
think will be critical.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:40.770
LESLIE BRADSHAW: Right.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.100
We learn the quick, brown
fox jumps over--

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.250
the typing, and you think about
all the different things

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.830
that are systematic and
coding among them.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.000
And the earlier that you
can introduce that,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.910
we do it with language.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.290
It's just another type
of language.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.220
And it is, in many ways, the
new Latin because it is the

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.660
universal thing upon which so
much is based in the world.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.590
I like that a lot.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.710
MEGAN SMITH: Well, we are I
think at the end of our time.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.260
Leslie Bradshaw, thank
you so much for

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.760
joining us here at Google.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.470
And Betsy for joining me.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.256
And everybody out on
the web page, thank

00:46:13.256 --> 00:46:15.100
you for joining us.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.240
I think the series is going to
go all week, and then we'll

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.090
expand from there.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:18.690
Thanks.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.940
BETSY MASIELLO: Great.
