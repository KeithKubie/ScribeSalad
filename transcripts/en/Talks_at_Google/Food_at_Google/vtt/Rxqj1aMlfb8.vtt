JENNA TAYLOR: Today, I'm
super excited to welcome

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.460
Liza Gershman to Google.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.270
Welcome.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.380
LIZA GERSHMAN:
Thank you very much.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.879
Thank you.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.030
JENNA TAYLOR: It's your
first time here with us?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.200
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's
my first time here,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.460
and I'm really honored to be.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.890
I've always wanted
to come to Google,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.640
so I'm very excited and
honored that you've all

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.410
taken time out of
your really busy days

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.540
to come be here and
learn about Cuba

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.940
and eat amazing food that
the team has prepared.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.420
I'm really thankful to
everybody on the Google staff,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.065
and also to my
awesome publicist,

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.530
Andrea Burnett,
who organized this.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.050
And then also Kirk Dye,
who is my right hand

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.280
on all my projects.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.200
So thank you guys so much for
being here and for having me.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860
And it really is an
honor to be at Google.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.130
You're the first stop
on the book tour,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.550
so this is very exciting.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.850
The book is official
today right now.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
So yes, Amazon released
it today officially,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.100
and my publisher
sent out a blast.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.889
So this is really fun to have
Google be the very first stop,

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:01.430
so thank you.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.870
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, what
better place to start a fun

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.129
adventure than Google land?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.280
LIZA GERSHMAN: Exactly.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.290
JENNA TAYLOR: Fantastic.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.375
So you're not technically
a chef, right?

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.250
LIZA GERSHMAN: Right.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.833
JENNA TAYLOR: Neither
am I, thank God.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.090
You're a photographer.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.590
So anybody who's
seen the book, it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.965
all about these
beautiful photos.

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.450
So tell us a little bit about
how that became a career

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.680
writing cookbooks.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.513
LIZA GERSHMAN: Sure.

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:24.260
Actually, it's a
bit of a long story.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.170
I'm a photographer and a
writer, and I'm a great eater.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.610
Aren't we all great eaters?

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.946
JENNA TAYLOR: Amen to that one.

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:32.570
LIZA GERSHMAN: People always ask
me-- this is my 12th cookbook.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.940
And people ask me, how
do you write cookbooks

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.480
when you don't cook?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.890
And the simple answer is,
I am great at research.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.140
People give me their recipes.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.780
I'm very curious,
and I love to eat.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.780
Just because I don't spend
time in the kitchen--

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.400
I save that for the
experts who won't

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.770
burn things and ruin things.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.320
But I am great at eating, I'm
great at making reservations,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.160
and this book is
not just a cookbook.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.060
It's a food book.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.580
And it's something so much
different from a cookbook.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.190
It is a connection with Cuba.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.210
It's about a place.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.360
It's about people.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.660
It's interviews with
restaurant owners.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.410
And it's recipes from people
in their home kitchens in Cuba

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.560
and people in their
restaurants and friends--

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.320
people who have become my dear
friends over the last 13 years

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.640
that I've been going to Cuba.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.420
So it's that.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.770
It's the story of the island.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.410
It talks a little bit
about the politics of food.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.360
Food is political
anywhere you are.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.644
Cuba food is especially
particularly political.

00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:32.060
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, I thought
it was a fascinating glimpse

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.460
into kind of an opaque
culture for many of us.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.710
So how did you start
going down to Cuba?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.240
What was your first reason?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.059
And then you kept going back.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.600
LIZA GERSHMAN: I
did keep going back.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.290
So it's one of the few places
that I have gone repetitively.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530
I really believe
life is so short,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.000
and there's so
many places to see.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.800
You need to keep
experiencing and exploring.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860
But Cuba and I have a thing.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.110
We are in love.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.870
And the first time
I went was 2003,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.730
and I went with Global Exchange.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.370
It was an educational
exchange tour,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.720
and it was the only way to go.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.630
When I went, there
were no other tourists.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.480
There was my tour group,
and at that moment in time,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.680
that was it.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.510
And we had to stay
with our guide.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.620
There were 13 of us.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.210
He had a script.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.747
By the end of the week, we could
very much tell it was a script.

00:03:20.747 --> 00:03:23.330
And he broke it a little bit and
said like, oh, I'll tell you,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.740
but I might get in trouble.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.350
And it was just a very
different time and place then.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.130
It really was right before 2003.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.640
It was many years before
the Cuban government decided

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.200
that individuals could
own their own businesses,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.820
so it was very much the
old ideology-- the old way

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.560
of thinking in Cuba.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.300
And I am really grateful
that I got to see that.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.560
So even then, just my first
moment off the airplane,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.760
I felt like I was home.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.029
And if you've had
that experience where

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.820
you've gone somewhere
other than your home,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.230
and you've had such a strong
emotional connection--

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.180
it's the sense and the
sounds and the visuals,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.550
and it just feels like
this is part of me already.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.740
It's like already built
into my DNA somehow,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.509
even though as far as I
know, I am not at all Cuban.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.300
And so that was it.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.770
I had this trip,
and I was really

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.029
intrigued and interested.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.850
And anywhere that you
say nobody's going--

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.510
I went.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.360
Sign me up.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.000
How do I get there?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.670
So for me and Cuba,
that's why I went then.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.170
I had just finished
graduate school.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.170
I have a master's degree
in English and American

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.140
literature.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.307
And I took a year to
travel afterwards,

00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:34.640
because I didn't know what I
was doing with my master's.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.754
I wasn't there to teach.

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:36.920
JENNA TAYLOR: Join the club.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.794
LIZA GERSHMAN: Right.

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:40.750
I was there as a personal
indulging moment,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.250
where I wanted to talk about
literature in this really dorky

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.600
way that nobody else wanted to.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.260
And so I went to grad school.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.670
JENNA TAYLOR: I was an art
history major, so I'm with you.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.160
LIZA GERSHMAN: And you guys
probably all understand, too.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.284
There's probably something
that every single person

00:04:51.284 --> 00:04:53.700
in this room is an expert
at or really curious about

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.660
that your general friends do
not want to know about, right?

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.860
So that was me and books, and
that was then me and Cuba.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.910
And so I went, and I loved it.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.290
And then I didn't go
back for a long time.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.190
There wasn't an
easy way to do it.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.300
And I wanted to make
sure I went legally,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.430
and that I was doing
things on the up and up.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.070
And I was curious about so
many places in the world.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.170
So I've been really
fortunate and blessed

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.960
to go to 51 countries.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.940
I'll be impressed by
that when I get to 100.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.400
Until then, to me, it's nothing.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.290
But I've been really
fortunate to travel a lot,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.480
and so I didn't go to
Cuba for a long time.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.820
And then I was at
a talk in New York.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.210
Many things in my life happened
really serendipitously--

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.710
all the good things do.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.960
I was at a talk in New
York I had been invited to.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.940
And the author was
speaking about a book

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.310
she had just done on Cuba--

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.520
Damon Seeley.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.616
Hi.

00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:46.240
Damon's my best friend from high
school, so that's really nice.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.156
JENNA TAYLOR: Welcome.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:48.550
LIZA GERSHMAN: He's a Googler.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.383
JENNA TAYLOR: I love
the Google connections.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:50.920
Welcome.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.220
LIZA GERSHMAN: So I was
at a talk in New York,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.370
and I didn't know the author
was speaking about Cuba.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.890
And she spoke about Cuba, and
I went up to her afterwards.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.940
And I said, oh, my gosh.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.780
I've been to Cuba.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.680
I loved going.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.080
I would love to take you
out to coffee or a drink

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.810
and talk more.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.820
And she said, oh, sure.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.760
Here's my contact information.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.860
And you know, like most
people, she assumed

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.860
I would never follow up.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.530
But then the next day, I was
on her phone, on her phone.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.030
I'm here.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.810
When can we go to lunch?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.010
When can we go to coffee?

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.910
So anyway, we met.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.620
And she said, as
it turns out, I'm

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.510
writing a book about
Cuban food, and we

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.580
need a food photographer.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.540
And I said, oh, I've
done 11 cookbooks.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.840
Maybe I could photograph yours?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.067
And she said, great.

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:32.150
The publisher I'm working
with is called Skyhorse.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.690
And I said, oh, I've done
eight cookbooks with Skyhorse.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.190
That's really a
no-brainer for them.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.560
JENNA TAYLOR: Small world.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.435
LIZA GERSHMAN: Right?

00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:38.650
Small world.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.190
Serendipity.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.157
Serendipity, right?

00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:43.990
I don't know if you
believe in signs or not.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.400
I'm kind of superstitious.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
And when things are
that in my face,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.024
I'm going to pay attention.

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:49.750
So even if you're just
not-- coincidence,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.100
whatever you want to call it.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.180
I listen.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.380
So she and I went and
met with the publisher.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.609
And long story
short, she did not

00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:58.900
work out for the project for
the publisher, ultimately.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.059
And they said, Liza,
we know you can write.

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.600
Will you please just
write this book?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.750
And so I said, sure.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.140
But I now have to go back
and do all this research.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.120
And they said, OK.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.130
We'll get on it, right?

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.171
JENNA TAYLOR: Aw, shucks.

00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.520
I got to go to Cuba.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.122
Darn it.

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:14.080
LIZA GERSHMAN: Exactly.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.645
So that led to a three-year true
love affair with the island.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.420
Last year, I spent
more nights in Cuba

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.850
than I did in San Francisco.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.590
I have incredible
friendships there.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:35.380
I'm friends with artists and
painters, musicians, writers,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.410
and also I'm friends with all
these economists and engineers.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.090
It's such a fascinating place.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.500
Your taxi driver in Cuba likely
used to be a chemical engineer

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.230
or likely used to
be a physicist.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.040
And the person that's making
your sandwich most likely

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.500
is an economist and
has a master's degree.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.810
It's just the way
their culture is,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.450
and I'll explain all
that in a minute.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.110
If you can remind me,
please, I'll talk about that.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.021
An average Cuban
salary is $25 a month.

00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:05.020
And if you have a high--

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.710
JENNA TAYLOR: A month?

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.230
LIZA GERSHMAN: A month.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.290
And if you have a high
paying professional job,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.160
it's about $45.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.400
If you work in the tourism
industry-- yeah, exactly.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.745
So if you're the top
surgeon in Cuba--

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.620
well, if you're the very
top surgeon in Cuba,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.328
you're working on the
Castros, and you're

00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:20.960
having bonus this way.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.560
But if you're guy number 15,
you are making $45 a month,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.460
and that's not
enough to do what you

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.130
need to be doing for living
in a comfortable way.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.299
So then you come, and you
get involved with tourism.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.780
And if you're a driver,
you can make $20 for a ride

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.460
from point A to point
B. Or you can make food

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.300
at a restaurant, a normal
tourism restaurant--

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.640
or just not a touristic
place, but a restaurant

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.950
that somebody in this
room might go to-- a meal

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.380
might be $25, $30.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.495
So right there, the benefits
are so high for Cubans

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:01.120
to be involved in
the tourism industry.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.370
And out of all of the countries
I've been to on the planet,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.360
they are by far the most
entrepreneurial people

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.990
I have ever met
in my entire life.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.700
They are scrappy and inventive.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.960
They're like MacGyver.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.380
They will make a car out
of this thing, this thing,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.020
and that thing.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.520
And you have no idea how that
works, but suddenly it's a car.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.014
And it's also cool looking.

00:09:23.014 --> 00:09:25.180
JENNA TAYLOR: It sounds
like that there's no choice.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.450
You have to be that way.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.470
LIZA GERSHMAN:
There's no choice.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.100
It's out of necessity.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.810
JENNA TAYLOR:
Traditional norms are not

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.900
going to get you
where you need to be.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.370
LIZA GERSHMAN: They're not.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.620
And people really think
out of the box in Cuba,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.887
because the box doesn't work
or it doesn't exist, right?

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:37.970
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, I was
really interested in it.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.760
You talk about food as really
being more than just food.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.010
It's woven into their culture.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.519
It's just part of every
aspect of life there.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.560
Talk a little bit about
that and what that means.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.643
LIZA GERSHMAN: Absolutely.

00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:51.430
So I think we're so fortunate,
particularly all of us

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.490
in this room.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.270
I'm assuming
incorrectly most likely.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.130
I can eat every day, right?

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.949
It might not always
be at Gary Danko,

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:01.240
but I can eat every single day.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Any one of you
with a badge can eat every day.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.470
And I bet that you do
more than once a day.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.232
We're super lucky.

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:09.190
LIZA GERSHMAN: Exactly.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.995
So anybody in Cuba who
grew up during the '90s

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:15.040
or was alive during the '90s
went through this time period

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.600
they call the "special period."

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.209
And the special period was the
least special period of Cuba.

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:22.000
JENNA TAYLOR: It's like
a branding exercise

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.350
more than anything
it sounds like.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.160
LIZA GERSHMAN: Yes.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.030
So the special period was
when the USSR at the time

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.300
pulled out, and Cuba
was left with literally

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.340
no international support.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.650
And they were fending
for themselves.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.370
And Cuba is an island,
so one would assume,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.900
oh, they're eating fish all day.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.570
They're growing vegetables,
fruits, no big deal.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.730
They can absolutely
sustain themselves.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.500
But it's just not woven
into their culture that way.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.310
And because of a number of
governmental regulations,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.040
people are not allowed to fish
because they can't have boats.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.490
People are not allowed to grow
their own produce unless they

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.570
live in the countryside.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.070
You can only live
in the countryside

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.050
if you were born
in the countryside.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.740
Or if you don't have
that opportunity

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.460
to have been born
in the countryside,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.440
you can purchase
fruits and vegetables.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.140
But if you're a farmer, you have
to give a certain percentage

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.790
to the government,
and then you can

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.010
maintain the rest for yourself
and sell a very small portion.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.716
Well, when you
take the vegetables

00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:22.090
from the farm in
the countryside,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.000
and you get on the highway
to come to Havana where

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.250
the biggest population is
to sell the vegetables,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.110
there's probably a roadblock.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.090
There's probably some
kind of checkpoint,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.310
and something will happen.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.400
So a lot of the people
in Havana are not

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.620
getting the amount of
vegetables they need.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.990
Not only that, but if you
imagine a country that

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.170
has the most chemical-free
fertile soil in the world

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.490
and the most pristine
living reef on the world,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.380
and you're not allowed
to have a boat,

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.370
you can't effectively
fish for the reef.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.230
It's not in your culture
to swim because it's

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.811
an island where people have
spent decades escaping.

00:11:59.811 --> 00:12:01.060
So people don't learn to swim.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.540
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a
little bit like Alcatraz.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.660
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's a
little bit like Alcatraz.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.670
So for every single thing I
have to say that is a concern,

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.359
there are so many positives
that outweigh the concerns.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:13.400
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure, sure.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.566
But there's real challenges.

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:17.474
LIZA GERSHMAN: There are real
challenges for Cuban people.

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.390
If we just talk about
San Francisco right now,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.450
I can tell you how I've seen
it changed in my lifetime.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.340
There are no homeless
people in Cuba.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.450
There's no gun violence.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.070
There's nobody who's
addicted to drugs

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.510
because they don't have drugs.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.920
They don't have guns.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.600
Every single person
has an education.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.670
Every single person on
the island can read.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.680
There is no AIDS--

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.700
very little cases of STDs.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.380
There are so many
remarkable things,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.800
and there are constraints.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.560
So it's a complicated place.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.380
Whenever I bring people to
Cuba, which I do all the time,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.537
people always come with some
kind of a preconceived notion.

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:52.120
They want to-- is
this right or wrong?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.911
And I find that
particularly my friends who

00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:57.180
are in their 50s or older come
down, and they have an idea,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180
and they want an answer.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.510
Is this a good or bad place?

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.010
It's not.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.870
It's a complicated place, right?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.606
It's a complicated place.

00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:06.970
But there are so many
wonderful things.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.810
So food is changing.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.500
And food is, I think in
any culture, a great way

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.057
to really see what's happening.

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:14.140
Who are they trading with?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.240
Where are they getting
influences from?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.040
How are they learning
and expanding?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.410
What are they doing
to be innovative?

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.360
You can really see
that, because the thing

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.484
that every single person on
the planet does is has to eat.

00:13:25.484 --> 00:13:26.650
JENNA TAYLOR: We got to eat.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.310
We got to eat.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.030
LIZA GERSHMAN: Every person
on the planet eats, right?

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.090
JENNA TAYLOR: Food brings
us all together, right?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.910
It's a great unifier.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.140
LIZA GERSHMAN: Right.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.310
Not everybody plays music.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.150
Not everybody sings.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.266
Not everybody can do math.

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:34.390
Not everybody goes running.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.090
But every single
person has to eat,

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.180
so you can see so much about
a culture in their food.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.840
And the food in Cuba has really
changed over the last few years

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.370
with the growth of tourism.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.260
And in 2010, the Cuban
government allowed Cubans--

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.590
for the first time
since the embargo--

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.840
for the first time to
open their own businesses.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.660
And if you're going to
open your own business,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.760
you want to open it in
the tourism sector, right?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.280
Because that's the way you're
going to make the most money.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.020
So the way to do
that-- many people

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.450
opened up restaurants
in their own homes.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.490
So the paladares
initially were--

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.440
and it was fun to go to them.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.700
It was one room, and you'd go,
and you sit at the one table

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.240
in the room.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.505
And the mother or the
grandmother would cook for you,

00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:19.630
and you would eat the meal.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.980
And then you'd pay some money.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.170
Now, with the growth
of tourism, paladares

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.060
have become more like
actual restaurants.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.894
And Havana in particular
is getting some restaurants

00:14:27.894 --> 00:14:29.560
that are as high end
as things you would

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.340
see in San Francisco, which
is really tremendous to see

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.230
that change over
the last five years.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.920
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's exciting.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.753
LIZA GERSHMAN: Yeah.

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.731
It's very exciting for people.

00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:40.480
There's just so much
potential and promise

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.580
for the Cuban people in
that, because more people

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.320
are being employed outside
of governmental jobs.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.239
So they're being able
to have higher salaries.

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:49.780
JENNA TAYLOR: I was
really interested

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.800
in the limited
number of ingredients

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.720
that repeat in the book--

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.329
obviously diversely
expressed, but talk

00:14:58.329 --> 00:14:59.620
a little bit about why that is.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.380
We're dealing with a
small subset of things.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.420
LIZA GERSHMAN: So back
to what I was speaking

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:10.300
about earlier is part of
the complicated nature

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.300
of the island is when you have
an embargo for so many years,

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.240
you're not getting seeds
from other populations.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.650
You're not trading with people.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.580
And so Cuba in itself
grows very few things.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.470
Their soil's
absolutely wonderful,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.300
and they basically grow--

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.540
they grow plantains, bananas,
a lot of root vegetables,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.400
pineapple.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.697
But they're not growing
avocados, for example.

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:33.280
They're not growing
heirloom tomatoes.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.960
They're not growing mushrooms.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.227
They're not growing olives.

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.810
All of the things
that we kind of take

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.935
for granted that we think--

00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:40.980
JENNA TAYLOR: Californians
are all like, [GASP]..

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.500
LIZA GERSHMAN: No avocados,
which is bad for me.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.958
JENNA TAYLOR: No
heirloom tomatoes?

00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.130
What are you talking about?

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.588
LIZA GERSHMAN: So
that's something.

00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:48.370
When I was there
a few trips ago--

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.119
maybe it was last year-- there
was a group of German farmers

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:51.910
who had been there.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.300
And they were all in their
late 50s and early 60s.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.280
And these were a
group of 10 men who

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.870
had all-- when the
wall came down,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.530
they were responsible
for seeding and supplying

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.800
all of the farming culture.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.389
So they came to Cuba to look
and see if that was possible.

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:10.180
And one guy was the
potato guy, and one guy

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.290
was the tomato guy, right?

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.670
Each person had their specialty.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.460
And at the end of the trip--
which is when I met them

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.940
at the end of their trip--

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.506
they said, it's so complicated.

00:16:19.506 --> 00:16:20.630
It's muy complicado, right?

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.547
It's so complicated
and frustrating.

00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:24.130
And they've already
been through that.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.525
They've already been through
their own food revolution.

00:16:26.525 --> 00:16:26.900
It wasn't for them.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.660
JENNA TAYLOR: You're
coming from that background

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.670
to say it's complicated.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.670
It's pretty complicated.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.669
LIZA GERSHMAN: So when
people are coming with me

00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:34.690
and they ask what to
pack, I always say,

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.240
if you can't get it
camping, you probably

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.700
can't get it in Cuba, which
is a great rule of thumb.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.489
And it helps you really imagine.

00:16:41.489 --> 00:16:43.030
Can I get deodorant
when I'm camping?

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.460
No.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.210
Is there a store where
I can buy lemonade?

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.020
No.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:56.320
Is there a place where
I can get jalapenos?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.905
No.

00:16:56.905 --> 00:16:58.780
So I always say, if you
can't get it camping,

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.730
you probably cannot
buy it in Cuba.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.280
And also, the government
has brokered deals

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.339
with companies for one product.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.540
So let's say you go
into a grocery store.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.650
The shelves will
be sort of stocked,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.819
but they have one brand.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:19.020
So they might have four rows
of this one brand of oil.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.700
In Mill Valley, how many of you
have been to the kombucha aisle

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.260
in Mill Valley at Whole Foods?

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.560
It's the whole wall.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.589
And it's, I don't know,
100 kinds of kombucha.

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.130
But that's not the
way it is in Cuba.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.130
You have one product for every
single thing that you have.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.590
And luxury-- if you go
into the five star hotels--

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.290
which they're really
not five star to us--

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.620
if you go into those hotels,
the shops in the hotels

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.470
are selling Suave as
the fancy shampoo.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.950
And so really, we're
blessed in so many ways.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.760
But just our access to
products extends to food.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.130
Also, Cubans are
on a ration system.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.220
So the Cuban government
automatically--

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.480
just if you're born,
you get an education.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.460
You get health care.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.420
You get housing.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.210
It might not be the most ideal,
but you still get housing.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.435
It's a complicated system
of who do you know,

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:08.560
and how do you know them
depending on the hierarchy

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.139
of what you get.

00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:12.430
But you're given a ration book.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.510
And the ration book covers your
food for 20 days of the month.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.500
And what it covers is
not enough for protein,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.050
and it's not enough for--

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.580
it's very minimal and basic.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.040
But a lot of Cubans,
that's what they exist on.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.196
And unless you have this extra
job, or you work in tourism,

00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:31.570
or you're doing
multiple things--

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.760
you're renting out an
Airbnb room in your house--

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.800
that's what you're living on.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.380
But everybody has something,
it's just not quite enough.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.840
It's never quite enough.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.010
JENNA TAYLOR: Fascinating.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.250
Chef, are you about ready
to kick off our demo?

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.500
Chef Christie is going to
actually prepare something

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.570
delicious for all of us.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.240
What are we making today?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.100
LIZA GERSHMAN: We're
making a chicken dish.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.230
We're making the mojo chicken.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.155
JENNA TAYLOR: Mojo chicken?

00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:56.300
LIZA GERSHMAN: Yes.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.040
JENNA TAYLOR: All right.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.470
Well, a little secret I'll
share with you-- the first step

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.150
of the mojo chicken involves
the loudest blender on earth,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.305
so we're going to focus
on chef for just a minute.

00:19:05.305 --> 00:19:06.640
LIZA GERSHMAN: Before
we do the blender,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.650
can you raise your hand
if you've been to Cuba?

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.733
I'd love to know who in
the room has been to Cuba.

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:11.310
Awesome.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.810
Great.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.496
That's more than I anticipated.

00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:16.840
JENNA TAYLOR: Does Miami count?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.964
LIZA GERSHMAN: It does not.

00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:20.560
It's very Cuban, but
it's a world apart.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.860
JENNA TAYLOR: Right, yeah.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.512
It's Cuba US.

00:19:23.512 --> 00:19:24.970
LIZA GERSHMAN: So
the question was,

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.500
in Miami and on the
east coast, there's

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.791
so much great Cuban food,
and what are the differences?

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:31.270
And primarily, the difference
is access to ingredients.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.050
So Cuban chefs in Cuba are
so limited on ingredients.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.900
And if somebody like
myself, let's say,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.900
wanted to bring sun
dried tomatoes in a bag

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.780
and give it to a chef friend,
that chef friend-- if somebody

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.940
from the government came
into their restaurant

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.190
and saw that they had sun
dried tomatoes on their menu

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.750
or in a meal, that
person could go to jail.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.250
So it's not worth
the risk for them.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.700
So here's a story that Kirk
reminded me on the drive

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.520
down here that you guys
might want to hear about.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.760
Beef is totally
prohibited in Cuba.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.200
It is only reserved
for tourists.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.625
If you kill a cow, the
penalty is a lifetime in jail.

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:07.000
JENNA TAYLOR: A
lifetime in jail?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.510
LIZA GERSHMAN: A
lifetime in jail.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.030
And if you murder
somebody, it's 10 years--

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.185
a person, even a person.

00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:12.560
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's interesting.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.250
LIZA GERSHMAN: So if you're
caught with beef illegally,

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.277
the penalty is very high, even
if you haven't killed the cow.

00:20:18.277 --> 00:20:20.860
So I have a friend whose husband
just spent four years in jail

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.660
and got out this
week, thankfully,

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.120
because he was driving
on the highway,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.190
and there was a
man that he knew.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.500
Cuba's really small, so
everybody sort of knows

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.750
everybody, or you're a friend
of a friend of a friend.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.710
JENNA TAYLOR: It's like Google.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.580
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's
like Google, sure.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.496
No, it's much smaller.

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:36.220
It's 11 million people.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.320
I always say to
people, Havana is

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.520
the size of Union Square and the
Tenderloin, and then that's it.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.870
That's where the highest
concentration of the population

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.370
is.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.402
So if you're in Union
Square, you run into your--

00:20:49.402 --> 00:20:51.610
raise your hand if you've
ever been downtown and seen

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.149
someone you know.

00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:54.190
Right, so it's like that.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.690
OK.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.796
So he saw somebody he knew on
the highway who needed a ride.

00:20:57.796 --> 00:20:59.170
Everybody's always
needing a ride

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.880
because most Cubans
don't own a car.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.350
Because a car in Cuba--

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.980
a beat up car could be $15,000.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:12.580
A new car from China could be
$250,000, $75,000 for something

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.700
that's from the '90s, so
most Cubans don't own a car.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.270
So this man needed a
ride, and the other man

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.030
didn't check in the bag.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.790
If you needed a ride,
I would not say,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.690
what's in your backpack, right?

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.750
So the other man had four
pounds of beef in the bag,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.630
and they were stopped
at a checkpoint.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.181
And my friend's husband was
told by the police, well,

00:21:35.181 --> 00:21:35.930
you're the driver.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.390
You must have known
what was going on.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.460
You're going to prison.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.084
So for four years,
he's been in prison.

00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:42.190
And he just got out
this week, thankfully.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.440
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, treat
that steak with a little bit

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.280
more respect, huh?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.320
What do you think, Chef?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.767
Fire this thing up.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.350
Everybody bear with
us for one second.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.296
I promise it'll be
delicious and worth it.

00:21:53.296 --> 00:21:54.070
Come on, chef.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.820
I thought that was
going to be way louder.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.770
There we go.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.139
What is a bathtub
pig, and why is that

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:08.180
a good thing and not
something that terrifies me?

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.596
LIZA GERSHMAN: So during the
special period in particular,

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:13.640
when people had even
less access to food,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.300
people were really surviving
then on maybe a piece of bread

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.140
in the morning and a glass
of water with sugar in it.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.070
They were eating terrible
things like pizza dough,

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.630
and then they would put
condoms on top of the dough

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.060
and melt that in
place of cheese.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.084
It was a very dire--

00:22:30.084 --> 00:22:31.000
JENNA TAYLOR: Plastic?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.810
LIZA GERSHMAN: Plastic.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.990
The '90's-- that was an
incredibly dire time in Cuba

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.800
where there were no
resources for food.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.330
Yet here, it's an island.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.710
They could fish, but it's
very complicated, right?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.690
So anyway, there were
no resources for food

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.600
that the government was willing
to allow the people to have.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.030
And so people would make a trade
with somebody and get a piglet.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.884
And then they would
bring it to their home,

00:22:58.884 --> 00:23:00.300
because it was
illegal to do this.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.860
And they would raise
it in the bathtub,

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.235
and then they
would slaughter it.

00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:05.310
And then to make
money and have food

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.110
to feed their
family for the year,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.390
they would sell it off to
their neighbors discretely,

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.240
and they would keep
some for themselves.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.614
So those are bathtub pigs.

00:23:12.614 --> 00:23:14.405
JENNA TAYLOR: So this
was a common practice

00:23:14.405 --> 00:23:17.100
that there's bathtubs
full of pigs.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.130
LIZA GERSHMAN: So every
Cuban has a workaround

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.780
for everything, right?

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.630
So the fix is, all right,
we're not allowed to eat pork,

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.892
but I need protein.

00:23:26.892 --> 00:23:29.100
I'm going to go get a pig
and raise it in my bathtub.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.484
Cubans are so genius this way.

00:23:30.484 --> 00:23:31.650
Everything has a workaround.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.990
They have a black market
that the government just

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.250
looks the other way about.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.950
It even has a website,
and it's called Revolico.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.660
And if you need something,
you go to Revolico.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.950
Let's say I'm a painter.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.410
Right now, there is
an incredible shortage

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.760
of artistic supplies.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.227
There's no canvas anymore.

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.310
You can't get white paint.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.960
So all of my friends
who are painters

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.690
are having this
extreme freak out

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.400
about not being
able to make art.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.610
So naturally when I come
down, I'm bringing supplies.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.840
But they are making--

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.590
they're inventive.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.980
So a friend of mine,
he found an article

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.680
that was about how the
Egyptians made paint,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.180
so he's been making paint.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.790
He's been making paint the way
the Chinese were making paint.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.861
So I might not do that,
because I'm a lazy American--

00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.360
not that all Americans are lazy,
but I am probably not going

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:18.420
to--

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.160
JENNA TAYLOR: Just
used to having

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.495
what you should need and want.

00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:21.630
LIZA GERSHMAN: I'm used to being
able to go to a paint store.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.880
And if I can't, then I'll
probably give up and move on

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.900
to another project.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.860
But a Cuban's not
going to give up.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.940
They have an idea, and
they're sticking with the idea

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.080
and making the idea happen.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.580
And it's just part
of their culture,

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.130
so that's really a remarkable
thing about their culture

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:35.630
that I love.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.930
JENNA TAYLOR: It's amazing.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.530
Absolutely.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.404
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's a
huge inspiration for me

00:24:39.404 --> 00:24:42.330
to be there and see how
inventive people are,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.030
and their determination
for things, and for change,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.240
and their allegiance
to family and friends,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.220
and the social network
that they've developed

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.540
that is community-based.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.790
Because when you don't have
the internet in your home,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.250
and you don't have your phone
and you need information,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.380
the only way to get
it is to ask somebody.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.642
And so it's a gossip society.

00:25:00.642 --> 00:25:02.350
Everything happens
through word of mouth.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.270
So if you have a question about
something, or you want to--

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.720
is it going to rain today?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.480
How do they know?

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.480
Is there a meteorologist
they can get a hold of?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.110
No.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.705
But when I'm in
Cuba, sometimes I'll

00:25:11.705 --> 00:25:13.080
text somebody in
America and say,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.670
what's the weather forecast?

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.830
And they're always wrong.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.580
And then I ask my
friend's mother in Cuba,

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.180
and she'll say, oh,
it's raining in an hour.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.689
They just know.

00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:23.980
JENNA TAYLOR: That's fantastic.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.070
I think we could do
with a little bit more

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.611
of that kind of
thing in our culture.

00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:28.570
LIZA GERSHMAN: I agree.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.069
JENNA TAYLOR: Chef, you want
to talk about a little bit what

00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:32.110
you're doing over here?

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.660
CHRISTIE: So I tossed some yams.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.900
And I always like to point
out that a lot of recipes

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.170
will say, put them in a
bowl before you toss them.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.030
It's no reason to dirty a bowl.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.162
Just go ahead and toss
them on the sheet pans.

00:25:47.162 --> 00:25:49.620
JENNA TAYLOR: Dirty the sheet
you're going to dirty anyway.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.780
I like your style.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.340
CHRISTIE: I always
like less dishes.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.030
So just a little bit of olive
oil, salt, some seasoning,

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.880
and we're going to
pop these in the oven.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.460
And then for the
mojo dish, we're

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.140
serving them with
the yams, but also

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.380
with some peppers and onions.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.930
So I'm just sauteing.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:07.710
I'm going to put
some wine in there.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.501
LIZA GERSHMAN: Can
everybody hear Christie?

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.670
CHRISTIE: Can you guys hear me?

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.370
I'm going to put some wine
in here, reduce it a little.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.840
And then we have the chicken.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.160
I made the mojo sauce.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.390
I put it onto the whole chicken.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.910
We've had one
already marinating,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.159
so we're just going to go
ahead and put that in there,

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:28.489
pop it in the oven,
and let it go.

00:26:28.489 --> 00:26:30.030
JENNA TAYLOR: Smells
amazing already.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.410
I'm super excited.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.135
Just scooch us out
of your way whenever.

00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:35.051
CHRISTIE: I'm just going
to pop these in here.

00:26:37.236 --> 00:26:38.610
JENNA TAYLOR:
Surprise, surprise.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.730
I can see the finished
product in there already.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.337
It's TV magic.

00:26:43.337 --> 00:26:43.920
We'll pretend.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.720
It's OK.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.540
So I also heard it's similar
to lots of big cities.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.812
There's Little Italy.

00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:54.270
How is that possible within
the tiny Union Square footprint

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.910
of Havana that they've got
these other culinary influences

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.630
coming to life?

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.585
LIZA GERSHMAN: So the
only sub-neighborhood

00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:00.960
they have that
would be like that

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.950
is they have a Chinatown, which
surprised me the first time

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.020
I went to Cuba.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.570
But they had a huge
Chinese influence

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.046
of people coming from
China to build things.

00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:13.920
And then there's been
a big Italian influence

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.630
in the cuisine.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.430
You can always
find pizza or pasta

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.310
on any menu pretty much,
which is also surprising,

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.360
but it's delicious.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.212
And they have
tomatoes, they just

00:27:23.212 --> 00:27:24.420
don't have heirloom tomatoes.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.670
So they have the right
ingredients for that cuisine.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.710
I'm always telling them, you've
got the right ingredients

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.310
for tacos.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.797
Let's make some.

00:27:30.797 --> 00:27:32.880
JENNA TAYLOR: You're going
to bring tacos to Cuba.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.980
LIZA GERSHMAN: I'm going to
bring tacos to Cuba, exactly.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.130
I'm always like, let's
have a burrito today.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.350
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, you're
from California, right?

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.690
LIZA GERSHMAN: Exactly.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.023
JENNA TAYLOR: So that's what
California girls should do.

00:27:40.023 --> 00:27:41.570
We propagate tacos
around the world.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.819
I love it.

00:27:42.819 --> 00:27:44.610
Does anybody have any
questions while we're

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.484
waiting for all this
magic to cook down?

00:27:47.484 --> 00:27:49.650
You think of Cuban food,
you think of all this spice

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.090
and seasoning and
these strong flavors,

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.798
but they don't have
a lot of ingredients.

00:27:52.798 --> 00:27:55.320
So are we being influenced by
the American interpretation

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.080
of Cuban food, or how do they
really bring that to life?

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.913
LIZA GERSHMAN: Sure.

00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:00.280
It's a little bit of both.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.613
There are some dishes, like
the dish we're eating today.

00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:05.490
The mojo sauce is really
prolific in Cuban cuisine,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.860
and it's very
flavorful, very spicy.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.620
The national dish of
Cuba is ropa vieja,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.950
and that is the most
delicious shredded beef,

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.160
if they can get it,
otherwise they use pork.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.530
And that's in a tomato sauce
that's really wonderful.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.430
So they do have some
spices, absolutely.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.120
A lot of what we think about
is an American interpretation,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.220
just like Mexican food here.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.650
If you go to Oaxaca,
it's not the same, right?

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.160
Similar.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.900
The culture is spicy, in a way.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.670
It's not hot in flavor.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.400
Cubans in general don't
like hot temperatured food.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.050
They're very
resistant to pepper.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.000
They don't understand.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.500
Why would you put
that on your food?

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.261
It's so hot.

00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:48.510
They don't have a lot of hot
peppers in their cuisine,

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.720
but they do have a
lot of rich garlics

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.220
and onions and things like that.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.542
So you get a lot of
flavor from that.

00:28:57.542 --> 00:29:00.000
JENNA TAYLOR: So if beef isn't
available to regular people,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.620
is there a big
divergence between what

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.200
tourists eat in Cuba and
what Cubans eat in Cuba?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.430
LIZA GERSHMAN: Absolutely.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.270
100%.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.150
Tourists have a much richer--
and I talk about this a lot

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.150
in my book about
how these recipes--

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.790
so many Cubans will never
be able to experience

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.560
some of these dishes.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.380
If you work in tourism, then on
occasion you have enough money.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.170
Or maybe you have a friend
who works in a restaurant.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.774
If you work in a restaurant,
sometimes you order--

00:29:24.774 --> 00:29:26.190
there's a saying
in Cuba about it.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.160
Where you order
more than what you

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.660
think you're going to sell so
you can give it to your staff,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.320
and they can take it home.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.500
JENNA TAYLOR: Family meal, yeah.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.690
LIZA GERSHMAN: Family
meal, exactly, exactly.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.790
So lobster, for example,
is another thing

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.000
that's forbidden to anybody
who's not a tourist.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.970
But if it's a restaurant,
maybe the lobster guy

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.341
had 10 lobsters today.

00:29:43.341 --> 00:29:44.340
You're only selling two.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.250
You might buy them all
so everybody can eat.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.530
Cubans take care of
each other very much,

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.330
which is another
really remarkable part

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.720
of their culture.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.079
So there is a huge difference,
and it's changing a little bit.

00:29:58.079 --> 00:30:00.620
As tourism dollars are coming,
people are getting more money.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.516
And everyone has somebody in the
family that works in tourism,

00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:04.390
so it's trickle down.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.140
People are always
working for their family

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.180
and for their friends
and supporting them.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.730
The traditional meal you might
eat if you don't have access,

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.570
you definitely eat a diet--
a lot of beans and rice.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.560
But it's mostly rice-heavy
with very few beans.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.590
And then eggs-- you'd have a
lot of eggs, a lot of bread,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.440
and maybe some chicken
if you can get it.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.670
That's the most common--

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.209
and then very little
vegetables and fruit.

00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:31.250
JENNA TAYLOR: Interesting

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.340
LIZA GERSHMAN: But
it's all in the book.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.180
And you can read in detail
about it, particularly

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.740
if you read the introduction.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.115
That's where you
can really learn

00:30:39.115 --> 00:30:42.160
about all the changes in food
over the last few decades.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.421
JENNA TAYLOR: Did you have
a question over there?

00:30:44.421 --> 00:30:44.920
OK.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.575
So this is a
fascinating question,

00:30:46.575 --> 00:30:47.755
and I want to hear it.

00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:49.840
So one, can you talk a little
bit about distribution network,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.610
knowing there's a lack
of road infrastructure

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.818
and maybe electricity for
refrigeration and all that?

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:56.470
And then secondarily, how do
those people who are running

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.810
restaurants get their food?

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.852
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's a very
complicated situation.

00:31:00.852 --> 00:31:02.268
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
muy complicado.

00:31:02.268 --> 00:31:03.500
We keep going back to that.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.990
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's
muy complicado.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.300
I always have to be
thoughtful about what I say,

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.170
because I'm mindful
of my love of Cuba

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.170
and wanting to go there.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:16.630
So I have to be very considerate
about how I phrase things.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.480
It is a place with a
lot of complicated rules

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.020
that are ever changing and a
complicated infrastructure.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.580
The roads are not the best.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:30.040
And having a car or a
truck traveling from a farm

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.650
and to the city--

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.380
they just don't have the
equipment to do that, really.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:41.890
So the flow is limited,
and the supply is limited.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:48.130
And the restaurants operate
through the black market

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.909
almost entirely.

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:52.450
JENNA TAYLOR: So even though
the travel industry is approved,

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.866
you still have to go black
market to get your ingredients.

00:31:54.866 --> 00:31:58.390
LIZA GERSHMAN: So government-run
hotels and restaurants have

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:05.220
very terrible ingredients, and
the service is something to--

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.740
JENNA TAYLOR: I will
say, maybe not the best.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.699
I haven't been, but
I heard from someone

00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:14.740
that it was not the best.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.156
LIZA GERSHMAN: So
restaurants that

00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:21.150
are now becoming more Western, I
guess you'd say, or higher end.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.500
I don't know how we
want to phrase that.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.920
They are absolutely forced to
use the black market every day,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.790
all day.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.860
And there's just a
turn the other head.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.230
But if you had dried
cranberries on your salad,

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.880
we can't overlook that.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.020
But if you're getting lobster,
well, we can overlook that.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.145
It's a big "don't ask,
don't tell" kind of culture.

00:32:40.145 --> 00:32:42.436
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, I love
many things about your book,

00:32:42.436 --> 00:32:44.777
but food to me is a perfect
inroad into any culture,

00:32:44.777 --> 00:32:45.360
like you said.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.510
It's the great unifier.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:50.140
But I think that the images that
you pair with these recipes,

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.410
I think, really do bring to
life, again, a place where

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.310
fewer of us than normal
really have had access to go.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.270
It's fascinating, and I love
hearing your inside scoop on

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.027
really what it's like
and how it's changing.

00:33:04.027 --> 00:33:05.110
LIZA GERSHMAN: Absolutely.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.620
And it's also this wonderful
place where you can be--

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.930
where you are forced
to be-- completely

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.620
disconnected from the internet
and from your cell phone

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.980
and from all the other
companies in the world

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.350
that we do this with.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.522
People there are talking.

00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:21.730
They're having conversations.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.810
They're thinking about things.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.480
They're discussing the things
they're thinking about in a way

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.720
that a lot of my friends
have stopped doing, frankly.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.236
And sometimes we'll get to
Cuba, and I'll think, oh, yeah,

00:33:31.236 --> 00:33:33.250
I haven't had a conversation
with you in two years.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.300
We're just hanging
out in the same room.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:34.885
JENNA TAYLOR: And now
we're going to chat.

00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:36.550
LIZA GERSHMAN: And now
we're going to chat.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.260
Now we're stuck
together for seven hours

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.595
with no distractions.

00:33:39.595 --> 00:33:39.940
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
great, though.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.460
Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.020
LIZA GERSHMAN: So it's amazing.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.310
And family is really important.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.976
People end up living
with their families

00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:45.160
for much of their life.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.410
It's really unusual
to be a Cuban

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.930
and then go have your own
apartment or your own house,

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.492
so community is very strong.

00:33:51.492 --> 00:33:53.200
And I think there's
a lot of joy in that.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:59.530
So what I noticed beyond their
remarkability of invention

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.680
and creation in
Cubans, I also notice--

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.720
there's just a
palpable sense of joy.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.710
For people who have such limited
options, they're so joyful.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.800
The culture is joyful and
alive and vibrant and musical,

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.630
and everybody dances or sings.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.620
You're required to spend
two years in art studying.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.239
That was really
important to Fidel,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.400
and so everybody has to do that.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.310
And I think that's
a real benefit--

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.730
to learn something about an art
really brings joy to your life.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.190
And you can see that
in their culture.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.560
It's incredible the
spirit people have,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.330
and they're so resilient.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.659
In most families,
someone has left,

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.420
and so people have this
internal pain and struggle.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.239
But they are so positive
about everything.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.159
I have friends where
three of their siblings

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.260
don't live in Cuba,
but they just still

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.429
have this zest and love for
life that I find is remarkable.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:53.152
And people aren't
self-medicating.

00:34:53.152 --> 00:34:55.360
They're not taking prescription
pills to go to sleep,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.949
and they're not
drinking too much.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.490
In a country if you make $25
a month, and a bottle of rum

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.130
is $7, you're probably not
spending all of your money

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.330
on that bottle of rum.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.300
So I've really never seen--

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.910
of course, there have
to be some drunk Cubans.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.220
That's not part of the culture.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.310
My friends have a drink,
and that's it, right?

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.660
And that's just part of it.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.342
They don't understand
the concept.

00:35:18.342 --> 00:35:20.050
JENNA TAYLOR: Well,
excess is not a thing

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.380
that really exists there.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.580
LIZA GERSHMAN: Excess
is a privilege.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.040
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's pretty powerful.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.914
LIZA GERSHMAN: It is.

00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:26.700
So there's a lot of
joy in that culture,

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.297
despite the lack of things.

00:35:29.297 --> 00:35:30.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Constraints.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.780
LIZA GERSHMAN:
Constraints, absolutely.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.988
JENNA TAYLOR: Did somebody
over here have a question?

00:35:33.988 --> 00:35:34.950
I love that question.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.340
So how does having a camera
change your relationship there?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.350
It sometimes might give you
access, sometimes it might not.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.202
What has that been like?

00:35:43.202 --> 00:35:45.160
LIZA GERSHMAN: I find
that there are many times

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.076
I don't use my camera.

00:35:46.076 --> 00:35:47.950
On my last trip, I
didn't take any pictures.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.340
I'm there so often
that now I go to--

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.580
my last trip, one of my
friends, it was her birthday.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.330
Another friend had an
art gallery opening,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.600
so I went to see those things.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.530
And the only pictures I took
were on my cell phone of like,

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.692
hey, we're here
together-- the selfies.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:04.150
So sometimes I'm bringing my
camera, and sometimes I'm not.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.580
People are very receptive
to being photographed.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.520
I find that cultural norms in
countries really dictate that.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.737
So some countries I go to
and every single person

00:36:13.737 --> 00:36:15.070
wants their picture taken by me.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.630
And I'm like, you'll
never see this.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.800
Are you sure?

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.246
When I went to China,
every person near me

00:36:20.246 --> 00:36:22.870
wanted me to take their picture
and wanted to be in my picture.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.000
Guatemala-- nobody wanted
their picture taken.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.940
Because in Mayan culture,
they believe that you're

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.860
stealing their soul.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.110
Most Cubans enjoy having
their picture taken.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.480
And then, of course, there
should be an exchange.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.420
I come from much more
privilege than they do.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.960
And so if I take someone's
photo, I'm giving them a meal,

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.700
or I'm giving them some money,
or I'm bringing them something.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.370
I think that's really
important to me--

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.572
to always be constantly giving
back to everybody in Cuba.

00:36:51.572 --> 00:36:53.780
So when I go down, for
example, I have clothes there.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.240
I don't bring a
suitcase any more.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.570
But I bring two suitcases
that are gigantic,

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.760
and I check them, because
I'm bringing gifts

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.080
for all the people I know.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.330
And then I bring extra
gifts for other people.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.680
So I bring guitar strings
for musician friends.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.660
I bring tattoo needles
for a tattoo friend.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.750
I bring canvas and paint
for another friend.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.789
My lovely housekeeper
that I'm always with--

00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:16.830
I bring her new bras,
because you can't get them.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.064
I bring her lotions, and I
bring her earrings and things.

00:37:20.064 --> 00:37:21.480
She just loves
that kind of stuff.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.500
So it just depends on who
I'm visiting at the time.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.900
But I'm always
bringing something,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.280
because I'm a guest
still, no matter what,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.340
even though they
all say I'm Cubano.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.060
I'm a guest.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.550
And I have so much, and I'm
so grateful for what I have.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.410
And I know that anything
that we can give to anyone

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.629
there is more than they have.

00:37:42.629 --> 00:37:43.920
JENNA TAYLOR: That's beautiful.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.720
I love that.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.110
Chef?

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.245
CHRISTIE: I'm going to
actually take this--

00:37:49.245 --> 00:37:50.745
JENNA TAYLOR: This is what
we've all been waiting for.

00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:51.000
LIZA GERSHMAN:
This looks amazing.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.555
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh my gosh.

00:37:51.555 --> 00:37:51.900
LIZA GERSHMAN: You guys,
this looks delicious.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.170
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, my gosh.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.217
Oh, my gosh, chef.

00:37:54.217 --> 00:37:55.530
Wow.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.290
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.870
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's beautiful.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.450
Beautiful.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.617
JENNA TAYLOR: It's gorgeous.

00:38:01.617 --> 00:38:03.658
LIZA GERSHMAN: You guys
are really lucky that you

00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:05.370
get to eat like this every day.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:06.570
It's amazing.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.100
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, it's true.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.319
I'm not going to lie.

00:38:10.319 --> 00:38:11.360
You got a question there?

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.304
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I had a question.

00:38:13.304 --> 00:38:16.327
What was the reaction of your
Cuban friends to the book?

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.660
JENNA TAYLOR: What did your
Cuban friends think of book?

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.640
LIZA GERSHMAN: So the book--

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.900
it was a 2 and 1/2 year
project, so they all--

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.080
where's the book?

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.810
How's the book?

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.860
And I finally got
to bring the book.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.370
I got back from my last
trip four days ago,

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.830
and I finally got to bring
the book on the last trip.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.492
And Cubans-- they're not
accustomed to receiving gifts.

00:38:37.492 --> 00:38:39.200
It's just not part of
the culture, right?

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.700
When you don't have,
you don't give.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.880
So you give a gift to somebody,
and they say, oh, thank you.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.190
And you think, oh, I guess
you're not really excited.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.460
And then a while later, you
realize how excited they are.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.089
But it's not like
the kid at Christmas

00:38:52.089 --> 00:38:53.630
unwrapping the paper
screaming, which

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.690
is kind of the response I
like when I give a gift.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.670
JENNA TAYLOR: It's also just
not part of their culture.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:57.800
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's not part
of their culture, right?

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.966
JENNA TAYLOR: I also like
that response, by the way.

00:38:59.966 --> 00:39:02.360
LIZA GERSHMAN: But it's not.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.904
I kept telling Kirk I would
give somebody my book,

00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:06.320
and they would
say, oh, thank you.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.279
And then they'd maybe go
walk away or whatever.

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.778
Maybe it was a restaurant, and
I'd sit down and have a meal.

00:39:10.778 --> 00:39:12.650
And then I'd get up
to use the restroom.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.108
And I'd look over,
and then I would

00:39:14.108 --> 00:39:17.660
realize the entire staff
was out of the kitchen,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.940
and they were looking at
every page of the book.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.100
And that was such an honor.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.870
JENNA TAYLOR: That's beautiful.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.560
LIZA GERSHMAN: That to me
was really worth every moment

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.395
that I wanted to give
up on this project.

00:39:29.395 --> 00:39:30.770
When you're writing
a book, there

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.430
are a lot of times where
you just want to be done

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.370
and over it, and you're
ready to say, I quit.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.230
People really were grateful.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.670
And to see them genuinely--
they weren't taking it

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.060
in front of me, and I think
that's what made it better.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.780
They were doing it, but it
wasn't show her we like this.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.390
JENNA TAYLOR: It's more genuine.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:48.765
LIZA GERSHMAN:
It's more genuine.

00:39:48.765 --> 00:39:50.420
And it was really
every single time.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.980
It was incredible.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.830
Yeah, it was great.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.913
People are really pleased.

00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:55.340
And I put so many friends in it.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.290
JENNA TAYLOR: I was going say,
are your friends in there?

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.110
I love it.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:58.250
LIZA GERSHMAN: Yeah,
my friends are in it.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.590
So it's like a yearbook
of my friends, right?

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.450
This is my friend
Enrique, and he

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.640
owns La Guarida, the most
famous restaurant in Cuba.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.950
In the front, we've
got two of my drivers

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:10.740
and one of my friends
that's a guide.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.490
It's like a yearbook of
my Cuban life basically.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.060
These are my friends.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.899
And it's really fun, you know?

00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:19.190
JENNA TAYLOR: What a privilege.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.273
LIZA GERSHMAN: It's great.

00:40:20.273 --> 00:40:23.280
My friend and his
dog are in the back.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.070
And in the back of the book,
I have a suggested itinerary--

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.830
my favorite things to do.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.950
I have a section that's how to
stock your pantry to prepare

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.930
all of these easy dishes.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.800
There's a section,
spruce up your Spanish--

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.710
just a couple of fun words.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.140
There's a list of
Cuba's top restaurants,

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.855
Rob, and bars, and the addresses
of them so you guys can--

00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:42.980
JENNA TAYLOR: There you go.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.610
LIZA GERSHMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.820
So it's not just a
cookbook, you know?

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.960
It's a lot of things.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.850
It's really kind
of a guide to Cuba,

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.840
and there are always more.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.000
And then people who register
online on my website,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.670
you'll get emailed
some other tips

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.710
about-- is it OK to say that?

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.890
You'll get registered some other
information about Cuba that's

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.630
not in the book,
so that's fun, too.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.630
JENNA TAYLOR: Very cool.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.170
So what are your favorite
recipes from the book?

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.870
LIZA GERSHMAN: Oh, ropa vieja
is my favorite dish in Cuba.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:15.800
It's the national dish of
Cuba, and it's so flavorful.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.670
It's a low simmer.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.070
It's like a slow cooker
recipe, basically.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.390
It's delicious.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.920
I love rice and beans.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.540
I'm always going to
be a fan of that.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.940
Plantains and this
chicken is good.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.690
All the drink
recipes are amazing.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.110
The cocktails-- obviously,
it's a place that--

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.010
it's lively.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.580
Rum-- let's have a cocktail
and listen to music.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.570
Just one.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.880
Maybe two.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.420
JENNA TAYLOR: So ropa vieja
is primarily a beef dish, so--

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.210
LIZA GERSHMAN: So
Cubans improvise.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.640
That's the motto of Cuba--

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.430
improvise.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.520
And so they'll use whatever they
have, and that's usually pork.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.920
Pork is the most easy
protein for a Cuban to get.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.380
JENNA TAYLOR: So a pork
ropa vieja is very Cuban.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.610
LIZA GERSHMAN: In the
book, the recipe's

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.980
for beef, just because I
know we're American, right?

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.990
And where's the beef here?

00:42:02.075 --> 00:42:03.200
JENNA TAYLOR: Anybody else?

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.293
Questions?

00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:07.186
AUDIENCE: Is there a difference
in the food from the north

00:42:07.186 --> 00:42:10.680
part of the island, like
Havana compared to Santiago?

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.760
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.367
Does the food change on
different parts of the island?

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:17.200
LIZA GERSHMAN: That's
such a great question.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.250
So my favorite part of the
island is "the Orient,"

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.310
and that is the area
that is the countryside.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:27.270
And the food there comes
farm-to-table in the most

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.190
original, authentic way
farm-to-table exists.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.415
And there are a lot of
restaurants that you can go

00:42:32.415 --> 00:42:34.140
to that are farms, and you eat.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.090
They bring everything
from the farm,

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.070
so you're eating straight
out of the garden.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:42.750
And I would spend my whole life
just in Viñales if I could.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.724
If I had the internet, I
would live there permanently.

00:42:46.724 --> 00:42:48.390
JENNA TAYLOR: You're
at Google, so we're

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.629
happy that you said that.

00:42:49.629 --> 00:42:51.920
LIZA GERSHMAN: Can you make
this happen for me, please?

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.420
Great, you're working on it.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.628
JENNA TAYLOR: Cuban internet.

00:42:53.628 --> 00:42:55.670
Send them Loon
Balloons over to Cuba.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.830
LIZA GERSHMAN: Get ready
for me to be moving then.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:58.630
JENNA TAYLOR: I love it.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.260
Well, I know that we're getting
some delicious bites plated up

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:01.801
for you guys.

00:43:01.801 --> 00:43:04.170
Is there a couple
of last questions?

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.570
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
favorite Cuban restaurants?

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.900
JENNA TAYLOR: Favorite Cuban
restaurants here or in Cuba?

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:10.910
In the US.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:11.910
LIZA GERSHMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:15.330
My favorite Cuban restaurant in
San Francisco is Media Noche.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.830
It's down in the Mission.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.590
And they're partnering with
me on a number of events

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.390
coming up, so it's really fun.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.410
Yeah, I love them.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:23.970
The food is fantastic.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.400
They have a lot of integrity
in their ingredients

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.570
and their recipes.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:30.630
It's owned by two women
who are our peers.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:34.166
I love to support women
in their endeavors.

00:43:34.166 --> 00:43:35.040
They've been to Cuba.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.330
They've spent time there.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.680
And it's such a cute place.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.580
It's very pretty, and I love it.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.150
So yeah, Media Noche
in the Mission.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.402
JENNA TAYLOR: Favorite stories
from the home kitchens?

00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:45.610
LIZA GERSHMAN: Gosh, so many.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.068
JENNA TAYLOR: You're
like, so many.

00:43:47.068 --> 00:43:49.430
LIZA GERSHMAN: So
many, so many stories.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.770
You know, it's one of those
places where every time I go,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.310
there's some wild
story that happens.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:59.040
I'm trying to think of something
off the top of my head,

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.570
but it's just so nice to be
invited into someone's home.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.636
And people are so generous.

00:44:03.636 --> 00:44:06.700
Santeria is one of
the religions in Cuba,

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.660
and it's similar to
voodoo, but it's different.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.610
Anyway, if you are walking by
anywhere and you hear drums,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.410
you are welcome to come in
and be part of the Santeria

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.800
festivities.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.660
And most of those
involve cakes--

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.520
many, many, many, many cakes.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.370
And you're really encouraged to
participate and dance and sing

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.671
and eat, and you don't have to
be a practitioner of Santeria,

00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:32.170
but it's just part
of their culture.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.360
And it's expected that they
will invite in visitors.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.950
And so that is a really neat
way to be able to see inside

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.660
of people's lives and homes.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.490
And people will
shout down to you.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.560
You'll hear drumming,
and you'll be walking by.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.880
And somebody will be
out in the balcony,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.750
and they'll shout down.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.760
And they'll be saying,
come up, come up, come up.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.468
And then you come up,
and suddenly you're

00:44:50.468 --> 00:44:52.376
in a room that is a
quarter of this size.

00:44:52.376 --> 00:44:55.000
And there are 20 people that are
dancing, and there's drumming.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.690
And there are like 40
cakes on the table.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.420
So that is one of my favorite
things about home cooked

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.002
Cuban food, absolutely.

00:45:03.002 --> 00:45:03.710
It's pretty neat.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:04.918
JENNA TAYLOR: Super powerful.

00:45:04.918 --> 00:45:06.730
I love that visual.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:08.060
Thank you so much for coming.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:08.920
LIZA GERSHMAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.960
JENNA TAYLOR: Everybody, on
behalf of Google, thank you.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.210
LIZA GERSHMAN: Thank you guys.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.310
