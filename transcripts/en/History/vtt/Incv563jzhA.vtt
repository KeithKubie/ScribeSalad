[laughter]
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.530
If I knew you guys
were in town--

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.900
- Get out of here!
- --we would have been gone.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.330
How you doing, bro?
- Yeah!

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.270
[music playing]

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.530
This was the first post-war
American sports car.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.570
It came out in 1951.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.500
The Chevy Corvette
came out in 1953.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.370
Think about the guy that bought
this car back in the day.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.370
They were a driver.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.470
It was extremely expensive.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.970
They knew what they
were getting into.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.100
Stitch!
- Hey!

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.530
[laughter]

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.730
Tell me what you did!

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.130
The master herself.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.370
Oh, it's got power windows?

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.230
It does.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.270
Push the button.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.400
STITCH: Woo!

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.830
MIKE WOLFE: Are you kidding me?

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.630
STITCH: Slick, huh?

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.370
I like that.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.530
We literally had
to fix everything.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.900
Every time I went to work on
it, something was rusted shut.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.400
I had to wrestle this
car to the ground

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.070
and put my boot on its neck.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.830
Ooh, baby, I love
when you talk that way.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.070
This was one of
those projects that we

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.300
were pretty stoked to get.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.130
But we had our moments
where we just really

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.270
weren't that excited about it.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.970
[laughter]

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.800
And I'll tell you why--

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.730
Two years, man.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.330
Well, here's
the reason why, is

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.570
because in a normal restoration,
you bring it back new.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.700
This one, we're
trying to keep it

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.000
like it just came
out of the barn--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.330
MIKE WOLFE: You did it!
- --not all shiny new.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.500
So I mean, we just
threw stuff at it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.630
until we liked what we saw.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.900
You guys nailed it, man.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.670
We tried different [inaudible]
different techniques.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.700
You absolutely nailed it.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.030
Yeah, I mean, he
welded some panels

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.930
in where fresh metal
had to be patinaed

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.200
to make it look like it is.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.730
MIKE WOLFE: This car has
been like a wild animal

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.230
that needed to be tamed.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.630
From the moment we
decided to pull it out--

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.530
FRANK FRITZ: Oh, oh, oh, ho!
MIKE WOLFE: Whoa!

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.700
This thing fought
me tooth and nail.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.030
It made me scratch in the mud,
in the rain to resurrect it.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.830
But I had the easy
part of this job.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.570
Crafty B and Stitch are
the ones who've been living

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.670
with this thing for two years.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.600
We had a little
problem with the motor,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.730
and it had to come back out.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.470
We had some push rod issues.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.800
Something that happened at
the engine machine shop.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.370
Nobody caught it, it
wasn't a big deal.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.470
But they fixed it.
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.800
CRAFTY B: And we put
her back in and--

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
FRANK FRITZ: That's
a lot of engine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
The coolest thing
about this car

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.870
was totally the
motor, and the fact

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.570
that somebody pulled
the original motor out

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330
and put a Cadillac motor in it.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.630
That's the moment for me.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.100
MIKE WOLFE: That is killer.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.600
When Nash was thinking
about building the car,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.230
he wanted a Caddy engine in it.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.270
Now we're bringing
all that back to life.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.000
And Crafty B was
the guy that did it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.870
We actually buffed
the paint, you know?

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.030
And I think it buffed
out pretty good.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.670
And then we blended in some
different-- like, actually wood

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.400
stain.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.700
And then we cleared it.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.730
We fixed all the rust.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.670
Can I touch it?

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.000
Sure.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400
You know you wanted
gray, so I gave you gray.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.670
I love gray!

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.100
I wanted to put a little
plaid influence in there.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.100
I wanted to keep the style
like the original seat

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.670
was as far as the pattern.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.570
I was trying to get
into the brain of Mike,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.700
of what is your passion?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.070
What are you thinking?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.470
But also trying to honor the
original interior of this car.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.200
So I added a little bit
of European influence.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.030
It's suited to the
car, the age, the year.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.070
It's impressive.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.730
And then I thought,
well, a red carpet

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.830
bounded it in the gray.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.070
See, I wanted to
turn you loose on this.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.300
I wanted you to do
whatever you wanted to do.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.770
I entrusted you.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.070
It's incredible, really.
[laughter]

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.900
I mean, it's beautiful.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.770
STITCH: Aw, thanks.
Awesome.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.570
It is.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.970
I mean, it's a work of art.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.330
When you look at the
exterior of the car,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.930
and you can see it's
worn and it's weathered

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.970
and it tells a story, you don't
want to open the door and go--

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.530
wow, what happened
to the interior?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.800
You want it to connect.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.970
She did that.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.370
She did the right colors.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.900
I mean, the choices that she
made are absolutely perfect.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.030
Frank, check the key, man.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.870
FRANK FRITZ: Oh, that's cool.
[laughter]

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.670
That's a Crafty B custom.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.970
Start her up, big boy.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.630
FRANK FRITZ: Let's
hear this thing purr.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.970
STITCH: Woo!

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.900
[laughter]

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.330
FRANK FRITZ: Sounds good!

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.430
MIKE WOLFE: The car
exceeded every expectation.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.700
This steering
wheel is huge, man.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.700
It's like a school
bus steering wheel.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.430
This was an evolution
that had to happen.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.500
I got to drive it, man.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.930
- Brakes are good, right?
- Sorry, man.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.170
Hey, wait for me.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.570
MIKE WOLFE: Crafty
B and Stitch lived

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.530
with this thing for two years.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.830
And they never lost sight of
what my vision was, and they

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.330
carried it through, man.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.970
It's bad to the bone.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.330
Get out of here!

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.800
[laughter]

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.700
MIKE WOLFE: I've sat
in this car a few times

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.870
and imagined what it was like
to drive it, how it would sound,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.470
how it would handle.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.030
It's been a journey.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.600
But now after driving
it and feeling it,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.800
I know I made the right
decision on the shop I chose,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.170
and just flat out doing it.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.630
Because now, man, it's
got lots of life and lots

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.130
of miles ahead of it.
