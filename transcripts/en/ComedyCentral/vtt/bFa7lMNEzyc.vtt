00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:01.702
great apartment.

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.770
So many cool pieces.

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.305
Great, like,
cabinets and--

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.573
Right, enough.

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.208
Beard, where
your room at?

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.644
Right back there
on the right.
Oh, God, finally.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.880
Later.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.948
Oops.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.650
That's too many.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.685
You wanna?
Yeah, sure, okay.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.954
Yeah? Okay.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.659
That's dope.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.662
That's my art.
Oh, cool.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.834
What is this?

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:34.902
That's a little
embarrassing.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.236
That's my
grandfather's sweater.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:39.339
He's dead and this is the
last thing of his I have.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.774
Sometimes I sleep
in it, you know,

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.009
it just reminds
you of him.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.211
Would you put it on?

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.613
Sure.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.315
Were you, like,
close with him?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.584
He was, like, my best
friend, you know?

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.152
We did tons of
stuff together.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.088
He taught me how to fish,
skip stones, whittle.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.158
Did you, like, cry,
when he died?

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.526
Can I be honest
with you?

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.828
Please.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:02.930
I cried so hard
I thought I didn't

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.965
have any more tears
left in me.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.366
Oh, my God.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.868
He was like my best
friend, you know?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.269
And my worst enemy.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.672
Totally.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.779
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.714
I want to take
this slow.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.382
It's gonna take a long
time to get my dress off,

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:23.717
so that's gonna--

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.086
It's kind of
super slow.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.098
You know what?

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.766
We should go up to the
roof, the view is sick.

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:40.901
Okay.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.270
It sounds super
sexy and romantic.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.706
So romantic.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.118
Oh, my God,
what the--

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.386
Holy shit!
What?
