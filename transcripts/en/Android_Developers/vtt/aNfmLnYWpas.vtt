YACINE REZGUI: Android
Q Beta is now available,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.600
which brings us one step
closer to the final release.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.870
We want to make sure your
applications work properly

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.860
by the time Android Q updates
are released to the public.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.440
In this video, we will
discuss the Android Q Beta

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.070
program, its timeline,
available developer resources,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.660
and explain the two
options you have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.300
for testing it, installing
it on your device,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.100
or using an emulator image.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.650
To give you another view
on the release process,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.680
the first three beta milestones
provide an early test

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.980
and development environment to
help you identify compatibility

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.410
issues in your current apps.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.140
At beta 4, you will have
access to the final APIs

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.020
and SDK to develop with as
well as updated beta system

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.520
images to test system
behaviors and features.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.380
Also starting beta
4, you will be

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.140
able to publish apps to
device running Android

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.170
Q at the official API level.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.740
At beta 5 and 6, you will
have release candidate builds,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.240
which includes the final APIs
and near-final system images.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.550
As you test and
develop, we strongly

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.370
recommend keeping your
development environment up

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.890
to date as beta
updates are released.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.200
The Android Q
preview SDK includes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.050
changes that are not
compatible with some older

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.090
versions of entry studio.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.850
For the best development
experience with the Android Q

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.060
preview SDK, we recommend
that you install the latest

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.340
version of Android Studio.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
After you open Android
Studio, download and install

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.940
the Android Q preview SDK
using the SDK manager.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.310
You will also need to update
your platform build tools

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.260
to version 28 or higher.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.440
Finally, you can
create virtual device

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.620
by downloading the Q image
and use it as the deployment

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.010
target for your application.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.010
If you have a Pixel
device, you can install

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.260
Android Q beta on your phone.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.390
To download the beta, go to
g.co/androidbeta and obtain

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.600
to the beta program.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.330
After restarting
your device, you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.340
can navigate through the system
update screen on your phone

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.620
and tap the Update button
to download and install

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.190
Q. If you want to revert
your phone to Android Pie

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.350
after your test, you
can simply opt out

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.840
of the beta program
from the same address

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.930
and update your device from the
system update screen as before.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.220
Be aware that this process will
remove all locally saved data

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.230
on your device.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.390
With above
preparations complete,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.340
you can build your
app and then conduct

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.670
basic compatibility testing on
behavior and privacy changes.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.795
Finally, update the target
SDK in your Gradle file

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.240
for further testing and
adoption of new features.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.460

features and changes in Q,

ways to capture comments,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.770
