[MARGOLIS] As a bedside nurse, as an administrator, as a chief nursing officer, as a CEO,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.240
I've had  wonderful mentors, and I've had wonderful opportunities to learn.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.240
And I think that's how I got here -- on the shoulders of others.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.060
who were willing to help me and who were willing to teach me.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.120
[WOODYATT] In addition to being a strong leader and a strong visionary,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.200
at the core, Marilyn is a nurse.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.760
And I think that's what makes her such a great leader.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.860
[MARGOLIS] Who wouldn't want to work at a place where the CEO is a nurse?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.060
[WOODYATT] I chose nursing as a career because I wanted a career that was not only challenging,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.640
but it was a career that was rewarding at the same time.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.100
I also wanted a career that allowed me to be innovative

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.200
and allowed me to constantly be thinking about new ways of doing things better for patient care.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.020
It's a universal career. It's a career that's accepted everywhere around the globe.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.640
[MARGOLIS] With Corey, he's enthusiastic, he is a collaborator, he's a great communicator.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.400
He's a thinker. He wants to improve things.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.700
[WOODYATT] I decided to become an emergency room nurse because I wanted something that challenge me.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.440
And I wanted a profession that would force me to think critically.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.860
[MARGOLIS] I hope that really what defines us is our compassion,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.160
is our love of what we do, and the love of the patients.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.360
[WOODYATT] There's really nothing more rewarding than a patient telling you that they appreciate your time,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.060
that you were a good listener, and that they just needed someone to speak to, and you were there for them.
