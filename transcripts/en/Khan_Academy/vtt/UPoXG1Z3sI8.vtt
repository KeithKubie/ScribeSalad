00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:01.867
- Let's figure out what percentage

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:06.070
of a benzene molecule by mass

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.495
is made up of the carbons,

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:10.320
and what percentage is
made up by the hydrogens.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.348
And as we see, each molecule of benzene

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:16.344
has six carbons and six hydrogens in it.

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:18.178
And I encourage you to
pause the video now,

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:20.025
and use a periodic table,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:21.692
we'll be a little bit more
precise in this video,

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:25.201
we'll use the actual atomic weight

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.502
to calculate the molecular mass,

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:29.345
or you should say the molecular weight

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.010
of a benzene molecule, and then figure out

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.117
what percentage of that is from carbons,

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:35.827
and what percentage of
that is from hydrogens.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.566
So I'm assuming you
have had your go at it,

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.168
so let's first think about what percentage

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:43.071
is from the carbons, or let's see

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.799
what the carbon contributes to the mass.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.782
So you have six carbons, so the C six

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.171
is going to be six times, and if we get

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.901
our periodic table out, we see that

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.409
the atomic weight of carbon, is 12.011,

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.948
so the weighted average
of all the isotopes

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:01.007
as found on Earth, and we've
talked a lot about that,

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.768
12.011 atomic mass units,

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:09.768
this is going to be
12.011 atomic mass units,

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.802
and the contribution from hydrogen,

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:16.645
the contribution from hydrogen,

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.552
let me do that in yellow...

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:22.209
The contribution from hydrogen,

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.285
from the six hydrogens, is going to be six

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:26.652
times the atomic weight of hydrogen,

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:30.833
which is 1.0079, by this periodic table

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.202
that I have right here, once again,

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:33.692
the weighted average of all the isotopes,

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:37.268
et cetera, et cetera, 1.0079.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:42.268
1.0079, and so, the molecular weight

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:48.882
of this whole thing, a
typical benzene molecule,

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:50.405
if you were to take the weighted average

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.303
of all of its molecular masses,

00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:54.201
based on the prevalence
of the different isotopes

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.174
on Earth, well, you would just say

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:58.682
it's just going to be the
sum of these two things.

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:03.682
It is going to be six times 12.011

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:11.583
plus, six times 1.0079, and then what

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.133
is that going to give us?

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.441
Well, let's see, let's
get a calculator out,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:26.441
so let me clear that, so 12.011

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.350
times six gives us 72.066,
so this right over here.

00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:40.133
is 72.066, and actually, I probably

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.369
could have done that in my head,

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.702
well anyway, let's look at what we have

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:48.428
from the hydrogen, so the hydrogen

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:53.428
are going to be six times 1.0079

00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:01.007
gets us to 6.0474, plus 6.0474,

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.953
now we're going to add them together,

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.589
but since I only go to
the thousandth place

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.979
in terms of precision here,

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.413
if I care about significant figures,

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.861
significant digits, then I'm only going

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:18.384
to go three spaces to
the right of the decimal,

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:20.380
but let's add these two together,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.380
so I'm going to get 6.0474, plus 72.066

00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:32.045
equals, and I'm just going
to go three to the right,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.045
so 78.113, so this is equal to,

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:44.004
78.113 atomic mass units,
that's the molecular mass

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:47.666
of a molecule of benzene,
now what percentage

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.161
is from the carbon? Well, it's going

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:55.161
to be equal to the 72.066 over the 78.113

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.918
which is equal to, all right,
so let me just clear this.

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:08.918
So 72.066 divided by 78.113 is equal to

00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:19.113
0.9225, it keeps going on and on and on,

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:20.758
but in terms of percentages,

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:23.459
this is going to be, and let's say

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.689
I want to keep my precision,

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.464
so I have five significant digits in both

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:29.395
the numerator and the denominator,

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.747
so I can have five significant digits

00:04:30.747 --> 00:04:35.747
in the answer, so it's not .92259,

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:42.204
.92259 if I were to round this eight up,

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:45.928
because I have this six here.

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:52.466
So this is 0.92259 which is,

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:54.848
let me see, this is approximately equal

00:04:54.848 --> 00:04:57.400
to since I'm now rounding,
and this is equal

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.400
to 92.259 percent carbon.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.304
Now, the remainder is
going to be hydrogen,

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.813
of course we can figure that out,

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:11.813
that's going to be 6.0474
divided by the 78.113,

00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:22.273
which is going to get us,
so let me clear it out.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:29.006
So 6.0474 divided by 78.113,

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:37.846
is equal to 0.07741, and let's see

00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:43.623
I have five significant
digits in either case,

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:48.712
so this is going to be, 0.07742.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.710
0.07742, did I do that right?

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:01.878
I have trouble remembering these numbers.

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:06.878
Let's see, 0.0774, and
then I round that one up

00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:09.109
because I have an eight
in the next place over,

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:12.422
so four, two, which if
I were to express as

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:14.686
a percentage, and this is
five significant digits

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.867
right here, one, two, three, four, five,

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:18.689
as a percentage is equal to,

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.023
and this is roughly, since I'm rounding,

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:26.023
this is going to be 7.742 percent,

00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:33.061
and these roughly do
add up to 100 percent.

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.307
So most of the mass here,

00:06:34.307 --> 00:06:35.618
even though you have an
equal number of carbons

00:06:35.618 --> 00:06:38.385
and hydrogens, most of the mass here

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:40.168
is from the carbons, and a little over

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:44.735
92 percent of the mass
is from the carbons.
