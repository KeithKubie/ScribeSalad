00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.020
MARGALIT FOX: Thank you all
so much for coming.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.050
I'm Margalit Fox, and I'm
particularly gratified to get

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.700
to talk to code people today
about what is essentially a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.500
secret code from the
ancient past.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
So here's how our time together
will be organized.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.750
I'm going to read a brief
selection from my new book,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.120
"The Riddle of the Labyrinth,"
and then I will talk about the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.850
heuristics of exactly how one
goes about deciphering an

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.960
unknown script from
the ancient past.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.690
After that, I will be delighted
to take questions.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.190
And then we will have a small
stampede or a big stampede to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.400
sign books.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.620
So the opening of our book is
called "Buried Treasure," and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.220
it opens at Knossos
on the island of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.950
Crete in the year 1900.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.700
"The tablet, when it emerged
from the ground, was in nearly

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.770
perfect condition.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.819
A long, narrow rectangle of
earth and clay, it tapered

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.090
toward the ends, resembling
a palm leaf in shape.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.040
One end was broken.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.100
That was not surprising
after 3,000 years.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.990
But the rest of the tablet was
intact, and on it, inscribed

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.320
numbers were plainly visible.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.530
Alongside the numbers was a
series of bewildering symbols,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.110
which looked like no
writing ever seen.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.470
In the coming weeks, workmen
would lift from the earth

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.940
dozens more tablets, some
fractured beyond repair,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.770
others completely undamaged.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.970
All were incised with
the same curious

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.470
symbols, including these.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
The tablets were what
Arthur Evans had

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.360
come to Crete to find.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.210
It had taken him only a week to
locate the first one, but

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.790
his discovery would
forever change the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.640
face of ancient history.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.090
On March 23, 1900, Evans,
a few carefully chosen

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.050
assistants, and 30 local workmen
had broken ground at

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.710
Knossos in the wild countryside
of northern Crete

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.330
near present-day Heraklion.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.500
He was rewarded almost
immediately.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Even before the first week was
out, his workmen's spades

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.700
turned up fragments of painted
plaster frescoes in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.680
still-vivid hues depicting
scenes of

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.090
people, plants, and animals.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.680
That is from the queen's
bathroom.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.240
I would like to have
such a bathroom.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.550
Still farther down, they
encountered rows of huge

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.010
gypsum blocks, the walls of a
vast prehistoric building.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.500
Evans had come upon the ruins of
a sophisticated Bronze Age

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.970
civilization, previously
unknown, that had flowered on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.470
Crete from about 1850
to 1450 BC.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.080
Predating the Greek classical
age by 1,000 years, it was the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.160
oldest European civilization
ever discovered.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.190
At 48, Arthur Evans was already
one of the foremost

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.860
archaeologists in Britain.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.120
His discovery at Knossos, which
the newspapers swiftly

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.460
relayed around the world, would
make him among the most

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.410
celebrated ever.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.890
For the sprawling building
beneath the knoll, he swiftly

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.490
concluded, was none other than
the palace of King Minos, the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.200
legendary ruler of Crete.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.830
It was for Minos, legend held,
that the architect Daedalus

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.640
had built the Cretan labyrinth,
which housed at its

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.610
center the fearsome Minotaur,
half man, half bull.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.470
As Evans's investigation would
reveal, the palace at Knossos

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.370
spanned hundreds of rooms
linked by a network of

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.700
twisting passages.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.410
Surely, he would write, this
vast complex was the historic

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.220
basis of the enduring myth
of the labyrinth.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.360
Unseen for nearly 3,000 years,
the Knossos palace was hailed

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.769
as one of the most spectacular
archaeological

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.620
finds of all time.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.170
In his first season alone, Evans
uncovered an exquisite

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.750
marble fountain shaped like
the head of a lioness,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.500
carvings of ivory and crystal,
and, still more impressive, a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.910
carved alabaster throne,
the oldest in Europe.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.300
But these treasures paled beside
what Evans found on the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.900
excavation's eighth day.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.190
On March 30, a workman's
spade dislodged

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.490
the first clay tablet.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.390
On April 5, a whole cache of
tablets, many in perfect

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.700
condition, was found in a single
room of the palace.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.450
The tablets, when Evans
unearthed them, were Europe's

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.270
earliest written records.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.660
Inscribed with a stylus when the
clay was still wet, they

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.140
dated to about 1450 BC, nearly
seven centuries before the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.190
advent of the Greek alphabet.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.390
The characters they
contained--

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.520
outline drawings in the shape
of human figures, swords,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.660
chariots, horses' heads, and
other tiny pictograms--

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.940
resembled the symbols
of no known

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.850
alphabet, ancient or modern.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.960
Evans named the writing system
Linear Script Class B, Linear

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.230
B for short.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.820
He had also turned up evidence
of a somewhat older Cretan

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.370
script, which he called, quite
reasonably, Linear A. The end

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.380
of his first season's dig, he
had unearthed more than 1,000

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.264
tablets written in Linear B.

00:05:59.264 --> 00:06:02.110
Though Evans couldn't read the
tablets, he immediately

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.230
surmised what they were, the
administrative records

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.650
carefully set down by palace
scribes documenting the

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.480
day-to-day workings
of the Knossos

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.520
Palace and its holdings.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.380
If the tablets could be decoded,
they would open a

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.220
wide portal onto the daily life
of a refined, wealthy,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.640
and literate society that had
thrived in Greek lands a full

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.680
millennium before the glories
of classical Athens.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.640
Once their written records could
be read, the Knossos

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.360
Palace and its people,
languishing for 30 centuries

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.730
in the dusk of prehistory, would
suddenly be illuminated.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.610
With a single stroke, an entire
civilization would

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.830
become history.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.390
But which civilization was it?

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.370
As Evans well knew, many ethnic
groups had passed

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.500
through the Bronze Age Aegean,
and there was no way to tell

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.380
whose language and whose culture
Linear B represented.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.910
To him, though, this seemed
a small impediment.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.460
Evans was already
something of an

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.420
authority on ancient scripts.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.210
And with characteristic
assurance, he assumed he would

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.450
one day decipher this one.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.250
But Evans underestimated the
formidable challenge Linear B

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.800
would pose.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.110
An unknown script used to write
an unknown language is a

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.170
locked room mystery.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.620
Somehow, the decipherer must
finesse his way into a tightly

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.080
closed system that offers
few external clues.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.960
If he is very lucky, he will
have the help of a bilingual

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.480
inscription, like the Rosetta
Stone, which furnished the key

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.210
to deciphering the hieroglyphs
of Ancient Egypt.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.490
Without such an inscription,
his task is all but

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.500
impossible.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.240
As Evans could scarcely have
imagined in 1900, Linear B

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.970
would become one of the most
tantalizing riddles of the

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.850
first half of the 20th century,
a secret code that

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.950
defied solution for more
than 50 years.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.460
The quest to decipher the
tablets or even to identify

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.700
the language in which they were
written would become the

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.430
consuming passion of

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.820
investigators around the globe.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.500
Over time, two besides Evans
emerged as best equipped to

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.330
crack that code.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.920
One, Michael Ventris, was a
young English architect with a

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.260
mournful past, whose fascination
with the tablets

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.010
had begun as a boyhood hobby.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:40.289
The other, Alice Kober, was a
fiery American classicist, the

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:44.010
lone woman among the serious
investigators, whose immense

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.860
contribution to the decipherment
has been all but

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.340
lost to history.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.920
To Ventris, the solution brought
worldwide acclaim.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.880
But before long, it also
brought doubt, despair,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.460
personal and professional ruin,
and, some observers

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.700
believe, untimely death.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.280
All this, of course, was decades
in the future that

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.960
March day at Knossos when the
first brittle tablets emerged

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.490
from the ground.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.990
But of one thing Arthur Evans
was already certain.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.880
Guided by the smallest of clues,
he had come to Crete in

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.250
search of writing from a time
before Europe was known to

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.010
have writing.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:31.640
And there, he now knew beyond
doubt, he had found it."

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.150
So now that you've found it,
what do you do with it?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.960
Assuming you are the decipherer,
your first order

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.500
of business is to find
out exactly how much

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.090
trouble you're in.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.220
Every written document transmits
linguistic signals

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.330
to its readers on two levels
simultaneously.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:00.720
One, the language of the text,
and two, the script

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.240
used to write it.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.040
When you confront any
inscription, ancient or

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.060
modern, you'll find that one
or the other of these

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.610
elements, and sometimes
both, may be unknown.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.640
In combination, our two elements
give us four possible

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.120
relationships between the
language of a text and its

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.450
script, and some combinations
turn out to be much harder to

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.090
decipher than others.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.130
We can plot these relationships
by means of this

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.240
handsome little four-cell
table.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.900
So let's start with the simplest
case, represented by

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.660
the blank cell on
the upper left.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.430
Here, a known language is
written by means of a known

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.290
script, as in--

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.050
that's the easy part.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.450
The other three cells represent
decipherments of

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.020
varying difficulty.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.760
But the one I want to focus on,
because it describes the

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.930
Linear B situation perfectly, is
the cell on the lower right

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.170
where an unknown language
is written by means

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.570
of an unknown script.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.930
This is the most fiendishly
difficult of our four cases

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.770
for it thrusts the decipherer
into a linguistic terra

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.970
incognita without so much as
a map or a compass at hand.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.530
And that is precisely the
situation that the

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.810
investigators of Linear B found
themselves in for five

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.160
decades after Arthur Evans
unearthed those

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.570
first tablets in 1900.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.800
The language of the tablets was
unknown, and the script

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.200
used to write that language,
well, that was a thicket of

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.750
strange, beguiling symbols.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.280
What you're dealing with, then,
is indeed the linguistic

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.260
equivalent of a locked
room mystery.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:01.220
And there is no possible way
to get hold of a key.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.660
Or is there?

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.820
Even in our toughest case, where
both language and script

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.380
are unknown, the script itself
turns out to be filled with

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.170
internal clues.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.290
It's the decipherer's
job to know how and

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.640
where to find them.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.010
If you are that decipherer and
you are staring down an

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.990
unknown inscription, you need to
begin by subjecting it to a

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.160
very particular series
of diagnostic tests.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.130
Each test is a little forensic
exercise designed to coax the

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.160
script, bit by bit, to yield
up its identity.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.430
Now, the first test is so
obvious that decipherers

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.290
sometimes forget to do it.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.520
You have to establish at the
very beginning whether the

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.580
tangle of symbols in front of
you actually is writing.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.530
Suppose in your excavation you
unearth this tablet with its

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.720
rows and rows of primitive
symbols.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.260
Is this writing?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.940
In fact, it is a painting by
Paul Klee done in 1927 called

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.250
Pastoral (Rhythms).

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.870
Now suppose you unearth
another artifact, this

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.040
whimsical stone carving.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.440
Could that possibly
be writing, that

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.830
silly-looking thing?

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.100
And indeed it is, as
someone knows.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.760
These are ancient Mayan
hieroglyphics, a writing

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.350
system deciphered only in
the late 20th century.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.630
So once you've established that
you indeed have writing,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.640
your next task is to establish
exactly what kind of writing

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.360
system you have.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.620
And to do this, it's helpful to
think of a writing system

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.190
as a kind of map.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.860
At bottom, all writing really
does is map the sounds of

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.910
spoken language onto a series of
designated graphic symbols,

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.420
the characters of the script.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.250
There are only three types of
mapping possible, and every

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.080
writing system in the world is
one of these three types or

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.370
some combination of them.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.730
In our first type of writing
system, a character stands for

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.090
a whole word.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.200
This is a logographic system,
and the best known example of

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.870
it is, of course,
Chinese writing.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:24.160
In the second type, a symbol
stands for a smaller unit, a

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.490
syllable, like "ma" or "pa" or
"bo." And here we have the

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.700
Cherokee syllabary invented
by Chief Sequoia in 1819.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.000
And this is a classic example
of syllabic writing.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.170
The third type is one that we
English speakers know well in

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.140
which characters stand usually
for just one individual sound.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.700
And that, of course,
is an alphabet.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.520
So when you're staring down an
unknown writing system and you

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.140
need to figure out what
kind of system it is,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.610
how do you do it?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.650
In principle, you can do it with
a very simple diagnostic.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.130
Just count the number of
different characters the

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.790
script contains, and the total
will tell you what kind of

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.610
writing system you're
looking at.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.500
If the number is very large,
in the thousands or tens of

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.470
thousands, of course you're
looking at a logographic

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.090
system, like Chinese, where
each word has its own

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.860
designated symbol.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.050
If the number is between about
80 and 200, then you have a

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.000
syllabic system, like the
Cherokee script, which has 85

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.600
characters.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.160
If the character count is only
in the dozens, however, as in

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.220
a writing system that has,
say, 26 symbols, then of

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.020
course, you're looking
at an alphabet.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.090
Now, after you've determined
what kind of writing system

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.140
you have, your next task is to
figure out the direction in

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.240
which the script runs.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.960
We lovers of the Roman alphabet
are accustomed to

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.320
scripts running from
left to right.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.060
But we also know that other
scripts, like Hebrew and

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.670
Arabic, run from right to left,
and still others, like

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.630
Chinese and Japanese, are
written from top to bottom.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.620
But scripts can run
in stranger ways.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.470
In its earliest days, the
Greek alphabet, like its

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.390
mother, the Phoenician alphabet,
which was a Semitic

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.160
script, was written from
right to left.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.440
Eventually, Greek settled into
its familiar left to right

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.020
order, an order that the
alphabets of the world

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.610
descended from it share today.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.820
But for a time in between,
Greek writing literally

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.950
flopped back and forth within
a single document, running

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.600
from left to right and
from right to left

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.210
in alternate lines.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.040
The result is a curving thread
of script that calls to mind a

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.060
furrowed field, and it's known
as boustrophedon, Greek for

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.360
"as the ox turns." And notice,
too, that in the right to left

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.260
lines, the ones marked in red,
the direction of each

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.550
individual letter is
also reversed.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.480
So how do you determine
the direction of

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.430
an unfamiliar script?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.099
The most effective test is to
scan the writing surface for

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:23.060
what we call white space, places
where the text has

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.910
filled out a line
incompletely.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.280
If some archaeologist of the
future were to study a page of

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.400
an English, and I happen to have
a pretty good one right

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.880
here, the unfilled spaces at
the right hand edge of many

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.290
paragraphs would tell him
instantly that the Roman

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.630
alphabet runs from
left to right.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.480
Your last immediate task
is to find word breaks.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.030
We Roman alphabet users
are spoiled.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.800
We have these lovely,
easy-to-spot things called

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.470
spaces between the words
of our written texts.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.420
But not all writing systems
bother with

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.940
marking word divisions.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.430
The boustrophedon writing we
saw a moment ago was a

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.680
continuous stream of characters
with no word breaks

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.310
of any sort.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.820
And without knowing where word
breaks begin and end, you are

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.120
at a deep disadvantage.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.600
You have no easy way of telling
whether the system is

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.450
logographic, syllabic, or
alphabetic, what the language

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.160
of the inscription might be, or
even if the inscription is

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.350
writing at all.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.310
So what did all these elegant
diagnostic tests tell Arthur

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.940
Evans about Linear B?

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.090
To start with the first
essential question, were the

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.590
strange Bronze Age

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.630
inscriptions, in fact, writing?

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.930
Fortunately for Evans,
Linear B passed

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.010
this first test handily.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.240
He understood right away that
the tablets were the archival

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.680
records of the palace
at Knossos.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.810
They were grouped together
by subject.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.670
Tablets about horses were
stored in one place.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.590
Tablets about chariots, about
grain, about weapons.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.990
Evans knew beyond doubt that the
tablets were documentary

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.070
records, meant to be read.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.340
And I should explain that long
before the Linear B script

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.230
could be read, the subject
matter of many of the tablets

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.280
could actually be gleaned from
the logograms that were

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.380
impressed into the soft clay
sealings that held closed the

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.090
wooden boxes in which completed
tablets were stored.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.410
It's the Bronze Age version of
labeling a file drawer to

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.040
indicate its contents.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.280
And here are a few of my
favorite Linear B logograms.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.930
They took a lot of
baths, evidently.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.230
And last but not least,
my two all-time

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.490
favorites, 3,000 years old.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.890
They are so transparent, they
would be at home today on any

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.200
restroom door in the world.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.630
So Linear B was unquestionably
a writing system.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:14.740
And as such, it was what
we call a mixed script.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.960
It was organized around this
basic set of about 85

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.960
characters, a number that falls
squarely within the

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.340
count for syllabic systems.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.120
And in addition, it contained
the set of logograms like the

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.360
ones we just saw.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.710
Next, Arthur Evans had
to determine the

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.220
direction of the script.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.280
And this, too, turned
out to be easy.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.190
So remember, to find script
direction, we

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.280
look for white space.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.230
And happily, the Linear
B tablets have

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.180
white space to burn.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.980
So he knew immediately, written
from left to right.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.460
Evans's last immediate
task was--

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.070
and this tablet, by the way,
to back up for a minute,

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.600
counts men.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.790
And then there's our
man logogram down

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.380
the right-hand edge.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.610
Evans's last task was to
look for word breaks.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.400
And here, too, the
Linear B scribes

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.090
did him a great kindness.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.690
On the tablets, the scribes
had thoughtfully incised

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.360
little tick marks which
indicated the spacing between

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.650
groups of characters.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.420
So you can see how much
information it's actually

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.960
possible to wring from an
ancient script without even

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.980
knowing what language it records
or what sounds to

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.750
ascribe to any of
its characters.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.780
Using just these kind of
diagnostics, Evans did a

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.820
masterful job of coaxing all
this information from the

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.120
tablets very early on in the
first couple of years of the

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.240
20th century.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.300
But after that, he made
almost no progress.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.080
Though he lived another four
decades and worked ferociously

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.320
on the script to the end of his
life, he was never able to

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.800
determine what language Linear
B recorded, how any of its

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.230
characters was pronounced, or
what virtually any of its

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.840
words meant.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.390
As a result, Linear B acquired
the well-deserved reputation

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.410
as one of the most intractable
puzzles in history.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:16.130
When Evans died in 1941 at the
age of 90, the meaning of only

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.670
a single Linear B
word was known.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.150
The word was this.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:26.090
And while nobody had any idea
how to pronounce it, context

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.940
revealed its meaning.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.790
The word was seen over and
over at the ends of

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.440
inventories on the tablets,
just before the tally.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.400
And here it is in two
places on the big

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.310
tablet we saw earlier.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.680
And the tallies come after it.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.185
So context reveals it almost
certainly means total.

00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:54.480
All in all, total wasn't much
to show for 40 years' work.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.370
Then along came Alice Kober,
the great unsung heroine of

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.500
the Linear B decipherment.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.410
It was Kober, sitting night
after night at her dining

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.420
table in Brooklyn, who hunted
down and identified the hidden

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.730
patterns within the script that
would furnish the key to

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.310
its decipherment.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:20.190
Alice Elizabeth Kober was born
in Manhattan in 1906, the

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.980
daughter of recent Hungarian
immigrants.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.970
A brilliant student, she
attended Hunter College here

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.580
in Manhattan, and we are
fortunate enough to have her

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.450
transcript.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.260
And what I love about Alice is,
look how well she did in

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.590
courses that matter, and
look how she did in

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.820
courses that don't.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.780
We like Alice.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.780
At Hunter, Kober majored in
Latin and minored in Greek.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.070
And it was there in a class on
early Greek life that she

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.740
appears to have encountered
Linear B. She

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.990
was immediately hooked.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.750
Undeciphered scripts have
that effect on people.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.630
And on her graduation in 1924,
she announced to anyone who

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.020
would listen that she would one
day solve the riddle of

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.770
the script.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.670
In the end, after spending
almost 20 years attacking the

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.050
problem, Alice Kober almost
kept her word.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.910
Scholars now agree with that
without the painstaking

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.540
advances she made, Linear B
would most likely never have

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.630
been deciphered when
it was, if ever.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:28.350
And scholars also agree that
Kober herself might well have

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.920
been the one to decipher
it if she had only

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.700
lived a little longer.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.060
Kober began her analysis of the
script in the early 1930s.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.860
She spent the next two decades
scouring the inscriptions for

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.370
repeated patterns of symbols
that all by themselves would

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.230
illuminate the structure of the
language of the tablets.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.420
She kept at it until very nearly
the day she died in

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.080
1950, just two years before
Michael Ventris cracked the

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.720
code using the methods
she had devised.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.915
But because history is nearly
always written by the victors

00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:07.490
and the story of Linear B has
long been a British masculine

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.560
triumphal narrative, Kober's
vital contributions to the

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.280
decipherment have remained
largely overlooked until now.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.540
Kober earned master's and
doctoral degrees in classics

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.370
from Columbia.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.760
And in 1930, she joined the
faculty of the newly created

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.560
Brooklyn College.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.860
Throughout her archived
correspondence, a good 1,000

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.630
pages, she laments the necessity
of working and the

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.880
time it took away from what
she considered the true

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.700
enterprise of her life--

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.500
the deep, serious business of
deciphering Linear B. She was

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.230
saddled with a heavy teaching
load, but night after night,

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.930
after her classes were taught
and her papers graded, she sat

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.830
at the table in the house in
Flatbush that she shared with

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.410
her widowed mother, cigarette
burning at her elbow, and

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.730
poured over the strange
Cretan inscriptions.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.610
Alice Kober never married, nor
is there evidence she ever had

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.100
a romantic partner.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.400
Her life was her work, and what
a great, great deal of

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.390
work there was.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.040
When she began her analysis of
Linear B, Kober kept her

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.270
extensive tabulations in
a series of notebooks.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.710
But during World War II and for
years afterwards, paper

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.230
was extremely scarce, and she
could no longer get notebooks.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:34.820
Undaunted, she cut out by hand
an enormous series of ersatz

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.490
index cards using the backs of
old greeting cards, church

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.890
circulars, examination Blue Book
covers, and it must be

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.890
disclosed, an awful lot of
checkout slips she pinched

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.780
from the Brooklyn
College library.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.730
On the blank sides of her
homemade index cards, like a

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.710
cryptanalyst unraveling a
cypher, Kober notated in her

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.190
tiny hand every possible
statistic about every

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.350
character of Linear B in every
inscription then known--

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.200
a character's frequency at the
beginnings of words, the

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.650
middles of words, the ends of
words, its frequency in

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.000
combination with every other
character of the script, and a

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.230
great deal more.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:27.310
Over the years, Kober hand-cut
and annotated 180,000 cards,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:32.240
storing them in the one paper
product of which, sadly, she

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.490
appeared to have no shortage.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.560
From the beginning, Kober
approached the decipherment

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.050
differently than any other
investigator, and these

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.410
differences let her progress
farther than anyone else had.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.900
For one thing, she adamantly
refused to speculate on either

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.170
the language of the tablets or
on what sound to ascribe to

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.540
any Linear B character.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.680
What she did that
was so radical--

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.540
for no decipherer
of any script in

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.810
history had done this--

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:09.110
was to treat the symbols of
Linear B as abstract objects

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.770
of pure form.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.750
Rather than speculating on what
words the inscriptions

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.000
held or on how to pronounce any
of those words, she looked

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.700
ceaselessly for patterns
glimmering

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.240
within the script itself.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.700
Now, Kober knew that to solve
the riddle of Linear B, a

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.680
decipherer would have to inhabit
a world that was, as

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.700
she evocatively described
it, a world of

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.290
form without meaning.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.100
And of all the serious
investigators, she was most

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.310
willing to dwell in that world
for however long it took.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.730
Now, when I was working on the
book and I was writing this

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.270
passage about form without
meaning, there came to me

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.310
unbidden a haunting riddle
from my childhood that I

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.360
hadn't thought of in probably
almost 40 years.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.490
And on a small scale, the riddle
gives a really nice

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.250
taste of what it's like to
analyze written characters as

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.970
objects of pure form without
any recourse to meaning.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.160
And by pure coincidence, the
solution to the riddle is all

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.840
too relevant to Alice
Kober's life.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.090
So here it is.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.360
So what's being described
here?

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.400
If we solve the riddle a line
at a time, we get a crossbar

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.700
and a circle complete, an
upright where two half-circles

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.445
meet, a triangle standing
on its own two feet, two

00:29:54.445 --> 00:29:59.720
half-circles, and a
circle complete.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.620
Pure objects of form.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.200
As Kober approached the far
more difficult problem of

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.600
Linear B, considering form
independent of meaning let her

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.130
spot patterns that others
had missed.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.720
And it was codifying these
patterns that furnished the

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.280
greatest step forward
in the decipherment.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.270
And because her methods allowed
the symbols of the

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.540
script to be analyzed entirely
in the abstract without regard

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.180
for their sound value or for
the language of the script,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.500
they could be applied with equal
precision to any unknown

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.300
script used to write an
unknown language.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.980
And it was just these methods
that ultimately let Michael

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.710
Ventris decipher Linear B.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.690
But by the late 1940s, Alice
Kober was seriously ill.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.580
As I learned in writing this
book, cause of death is

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.000
routinely redacted from New York
City death certificates

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.040
of this period, so precisely
what killed her will remain

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.240
one of the enduring
small mysteries of

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.690
the Linear B story.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.430
But based on her history of
chain smoking, she almost

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.000
certainly had some
form of cancer.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.090
But let's look more closely at
two of the vital discoveries

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.830
she was able to make
in her short life.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.870
She died at the age
of only 43.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.570
Her first great discovery, made
in the mid-1940s, was

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.490
that the language of Linear B,
whatever it was, had been an

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.250
inflected language.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.770
That is, that it relied on word
endings, much as Latin or

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.600
German or Spanish
does, to impart

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.070
grammar to its sentences.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.120
Now, how was she able to know
this without being able to

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.700
read the tablets?

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.730
The discovery came from her
rigorous search for patterns

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.960
in the script.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.640
Among the patterns Kober
identified were the ones that

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.395
can be seen in these three
groups of related words.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.680
Now, most of the groups Kober
identified contained three

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.070
related words, and columns two
and three here are typical in

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.320
that respect.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.790
Michael Ventris would waggishly
name these trios of

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.510
related forms "Kober's
triplets." So I'd like you to

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.810
pay special attention to the
triplets in column three and,

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.490
in particular, to the last word
in the column, which will

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.340
turn out to be the lynchpin on
which the decipherment turns.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.750
Now notice that each group
of words shares a

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.125
similar set of endings.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:42.890
Much as in Spanish, the words
"hablo, I speak," "quiero, I

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.950
want," and "puedo, I can do,"
where there the O ending

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.440
encodes the concept first-person
singular.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.860
In the Linear B examples,
as in the Spanish, the

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.670
highlighted portions of the
words are the inflections, and

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.010
the un-highlighted portions
are the stems to which the

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.510
inflections attach.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.910
Now this pattern of inflection,
in turn, let Kober

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.540
identify critical relationships
among the

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.020
characters of Linear
B. And this was her

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.030
second great discovery.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.430
To take a very simple example,
in column two here of our

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.240
triplets, these two characters,
which I'm now

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.520
highlighting in pink, link a
word's stem to its suffix.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.070
And they turn out to be related
to each other in

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.950
extremely revealing ways.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.740
As Kober discovered, because of
their crucial position in

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.890
the word-- she called them
the bridging characters--

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.640
these characters will always
start with the same consonant

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.330
but end in different vowels,
just as the symbols 'ba" and

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.520
"bo" do in English.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.930
The same thing is true of the
corresponding characters in

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.840
column three, whatever those
shared consonants and vowels

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.170
might actually turn out to be.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:08.020
Before she died in 1950, Kober
was able to draw up grids of

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.580
these related characters.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.840
And as she well knew, if the
sound values of even a couple

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.540
of characters could be
determined, then the

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.330
interdependencies she had
plotted would let the whole

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.900
grid fill itself in in a kind
of domino reaction.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.760
It reminds me today of
a Sudoku puzzle.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.170
This is the abstract grid that
Kober drew up with just five

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.469
pairs of characters, including
the two pairs we saw in the

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:38.340
previous slide.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.340
There they are.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.190
And this was the great payoff
that she was able to reap from

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.889
having lived for so many
years in this world of

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.389
form without meaning.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:53.040
And it was precisely these
relationships that would let

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.780
Michael Ventris, after he read
Kober's published articles in

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:03.000
the late 1940s, make a crucial
intuitive leap and then, using

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
this web of interdependencies
that she had set up, decipher

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.430
Linear B.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.250
Now the extraordinary thing
about Ventris is that he was

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.730
neither an archaeologist,
like Arthur Evans, nor a

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.050
classicist, like Alice Kober,
nor a scholar in any other

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.490
field that might have made
him a likely decipherer.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.760
He was, in fact, an architect.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.910
You can see his magnificent
architect's penmanship on

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.580
display in one of the hundreds
of Linear B inscriptions he

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.690
copied by hand.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.860
And even more striking to me,
you can see it on display in

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.920
his everyday handwriting,
which looks like fine

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.040
letterpress printing.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.490
Now, Michael Ventris was almost
certainly the most

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.750
natively brilliant of the three
central actors in the

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.350
Linear B drama.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:54.610
He had a prodigy's gift for
inhaling entire foreign

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.390
languages and could be speaking
like a native in a

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.810
matter of weeks.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.890
He also had an obsession with
the tablets that began in

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:08.900
1936, when he was 14 and saw
them in a London museum on a

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.420
class trip.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.650
Before he was out of his
teens, his attempts at

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:18.300
deciphering Linear B would be
a consuming distraction from

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.650
great loss.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.230
Both of his parents had died,
one by suicide, by the time he

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.680
was 18 years old.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.860
In June of 1952, after spending
more than half his

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.250
life in the grip of Linear B,
Michael Ventris, just shy of

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.830
his 30th birthday, solved
the riddle.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.940
His decipherment made him world
famous, but in the view

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.550
of some observers, it also
cost him his life.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:51.080
He died just four years later
at 34 in a swift, strange,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.730
inadequately explained accident
that may in fact have

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.800
been suicide.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.860
But in his short life, Michael
Ventris managed to solve one

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.650
of the greatest riddles
in Western history.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:08.190
And his solution took flight
from this great intuitive leap

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.610
that he made in the
spring of 1952.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.890
The leap involved the sets of
inflected words he had dubbed

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.260
Kober's triplets.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.290
Now, let's look again at that
third column of triplets we

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:25.740
saw a moment ago, and in
particular, at the third word

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.110
in the column.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.350
Now, you have actually
encountered this word already

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.400
in the very first slide
of the day.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.450
Here it is, front and center on
our handsome book jacket.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.680
In the spring of 1952, as he
worked feverishly on the

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.600
script in his elegant London
flat, Ventris made a

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.660
remarkable conjecture.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.700
Now, everyone knew that the
tablets were the municipal

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.290
documents of this Bronze
Age Cretan kingdom.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:00.710
What if, Ventris wondered, some
of the related words in

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:06.090
Kober's triplets were actually
related forms of Cretan place

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.070
names, forms analogous to
English sets like London,

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.000
Londoner, or Brooklyn,
Brooklynite, Brooklynese?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.390
It was a truly brilliant
conjecture.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.270
Just think for a minute about
the municipal documents in

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.470
your own life.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.100
I live here in Manhattan, and
when I examine all the papers

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.750
I've accumulated over the
years, from marriage

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:32.600
certificate to local tax forms
to a billion jury summonses, I

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.210
observe they all have
one thing in common.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:38.140
Somewhere on each of them,
prominently featured, appear

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.040
the words "City of New York."

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.590
Now, there was every reason to
believe that the tablets,

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.800
which were the civil documents
of an ancient Cretan culture,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.570
might contain something
similar.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.040
With this in mind, Ventris began
assigning sound values

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.740
experimentally to the characters
in Kober's

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.490
triplets, based on the
relationships among the

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.900
characters she had previously
mapped out.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.380
One word, in particular, reared
up seductively, and

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.040
it's our old friend
from column three.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.400
So let's do what Ventris did
now and examine the word a

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.650
syllable at a time.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.720
Ventris's own ongoing analysis
of the script already

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.360
suggested to him that the first
character stood for the

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.630
syllable "ko." He thought the
next character stood for the

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:37.010
syllable "no." That left only
the third character, which

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.440
other evidence suggested
stood for "so."

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.200
The result, ko-no-so, suggested
a very particular

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.520
place, and not just any place,
but Knossos, the principal

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.060
city of Cretan antiquity.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.010
So on the strength of this word,
Ventris plugged sound

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.660
values into other words on the
tablets, and they too yielded

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.730
important Cretan place names.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.890
And one after another, these
place names let the solution

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:11.540
to the riddle mass
before his eyes.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.490
On June 1, 1952, Ventris took
the microphone at BBC Radio to

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:20.440
announce to the world his
remarkable discovery.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:26.230
Linear B, it turned out,
recorded a very early dialect

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.510
of Greek, spoken long before
Hellenic peoples were known to

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:35.516
have existed, 500 years before
Homer, and a good seven

00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:39.570
centuries before the advent
of the Greek alphabet.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.630
What happened was this.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:45.040
In about 1450 BC, invading
Greeks, who were rude,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.920
unlettered people, poured from
the mainland into Crete.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.400
And the high Cretan
civilization, the Minoan

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.210
civilization that they
immediately proceeded to

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:00.730
overrun, had, among its other
attractions, this magical

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.340
indigenous method for taking the
sounds of spoken language

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.610
and setting them down
permanently on wet clay.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.340
And this indigenous Cretan
script, by the way, which is

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.200
several centuries older than
Linear B but looks a great

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.190
deal like it, is what we
now call Linear A.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.400
Now, the Greek conquistadors
knew a good thing

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.120
when they saw it.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.690
They took this indigenous Cretan
script, adapted it for

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:27.950
use with their own language, and
eventually carried it back

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.780
with them to the mainland.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:34.080
And indeed, tablets written in
Linear B were subsequently

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:39.040
found at several
mainland sites.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.200
So in sum, what we have in the
tablets are the documentary

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.700
records of the first Greek
peoples, the Bronze Age heroes

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.030
of whom Homer would one day
sing, men and women who lived

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.120
in the age of Odysseus and
Helen and Agamemnon.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.760
And it is thanks to three
remarkable 20th-century

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:12.490
heroes, Arthur Evans, Michael
Ventris, and Alice Kober, that

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.300
these extraordinary records have
been unearthed, unlocked,

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:23.420
and after 30 centuries, are
readable once more.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.390
Thank you for coming.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.530
I'll be happy to
take questions.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:33.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.370
MARGALIT FOX: Anybody?

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.840
AUDIENCE: Where did the--

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.530
AUDIENCE: Grab the mic.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:38.780
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:48.460
You mentioned that the thing--
he had clues from the text

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.020
about ko, no, and so.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.820
Where did those clues
come from?

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.080
MARGALIT FOX: Right.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.050
Naturally, for the sake of time,
I had to elide that bit

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:55.590
for the talk.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.870
I can't get anything
by you guys, I see.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.890
So what I'll say, and this is
not self-interest speaking,

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:01.780
it's in the book.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.930
But Ventris had indeed been
toying with the script for

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.510
literally half of his 30
years by that point.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.650
I can tell you one thing
very briefly.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.790
We'd already established this
marvelous what I think of as

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:19.040
the Sudoku web of dependencies,
where if you get

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.160
one or two sound values,
suddenly the dependencies give

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.380
you the others like a chain
reaction in chemistry.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.770
Ventris was actually brilliantly
able to get five

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:29.550
sound values.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.370
And we discuss this
in the book.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:35.270
The Linear B syllabic writing
system or syllabary, as it's

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:39.010
known, was what's called
a CV type of syllabary.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.420
There are different types.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.700
CV, of course, represents
consonant, vowel, consonant,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.080
vowel, in regular alternation.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.220
So it's ideal for writing a
language whose words are

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.790
structured phonetically that
way, like Hawaiian, consonant,

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.130
vowel, consonant, vowel.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:56.950
But if you're a scribe, and this
is the only tool you have

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.940
to work with, suddenly you're in
real trouble when you have

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.780
a word that starts
with a vowel.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.320
What do you do?

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.640
There's no symbol for it.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.960
And Ventris, through doing
years of minute frequency

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.490
analysis, much as Kober was
independently doing, made the

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.210
inspired discovery that of the
85-some characters in Linear

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.160
B, there were five that
came up with seemingly

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.460
disproportionate frequency at
the beginnings of words.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.190
And he determined correctly that
these were what he called

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.510
pure vowels.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:32.200
So in those five characters, he
suddenly knew these five,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.700
in whatever order, are "ah,
eh, ee, oh, oo." And from

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.630
there, he was able to get this
grid of dependencies to pay

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.140
dividends and eventually
getting the

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.920
syllables of ko-no-so.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.670
So that's the fast
explanation.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.480
Someone else?

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.900
AUDIENCE: What is the current
status of Linear A?

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.510
MARGALIT FOX: Undeciphered and
will always remain so for the

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:58.120
most eminently pragmatic,
quotidian reason in the world.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.560
There aren't enough data.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.490
Many fewer tablets were found.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.240
And as anyone who solved a
cryptogram knows, the longer

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.390
your ciphertext, the better
statistically your odds of

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.970
decipherment.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:12.890
So unless some Aladdin's cave
bursting with Linear A

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.520
inscriptions is one day found,
Linear A will probably always

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.670
remain one of the great
undeciphered

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.510
scripts of the world.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:22.390
And there are still a
number out there.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:23.640
Someone else?

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.220
Well, thank you.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.480
Oh, yes.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.680
AUDIENCE: One here.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.640
MARGALIT FOX: Excellent.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.000
AUDIENCE: Maybe just one
on this side, please.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.990
MARGALIT FOX: Do you
want to go ahead?

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.080
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.540
Now, you mentioned
that the tablets

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.640
were municipal records.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.760
Was anything else written
in Linear B?

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.470
MARGALIT FOX: Very little.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.500
Linear A is also--

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.360
again, they know from the

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.890
pictograms, comparable records.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.830
A few Linear A inscriptions,
which they know from the kind

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.620
of objects they're inscribed
on, are clearly religious

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.370
dedications.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.420
But Linear B, in finding the
Linear B archive, Arthur Evans

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:11.720
had basically unearthed the
record room, the account books

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.700
of this kingdom.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.870
And that has caused some
observers over the years to

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:16.950
say, well, they're boring.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:18.110
There's no literature.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.420
Well, come on, guys.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.490
There wasn't literature 500
years later in Homer's day, so

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.030
what did you expect?

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.410
But what there is, and the whole
last chapter of the book

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.140
talks about this, is it's like
the equivalent of an

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.140
anthropologist of the future
coming here and unearthing the

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.350
National Archives and would know
immediately how men and

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.540
women lived in the 19th
century, 20th century.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.290
Well, here, too, we know from
the tablets what crops were

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.760
harvested, what goods were
made, what products were

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.940
bought and sold, what was
sacrificed to the gods.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.280
The gods liked to get a lot
of wine, apparently.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.430
They weren't stupid.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:58.360
And we even see fascinatingly
this pre-Greek society

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.470
becoming Hellenized, where you
see the names of familiar

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.130
Greek gods, like Poseidon and
Zeus, standing shoulder to

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:08.990
shoulder with these weird,
indigenous pre-Greek gods with

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.310
names like Mistress
of Wild Horses and

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.690
Mistress of the Labyrinth.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:18.480
So you learn how these Bronze
Age women and men lived every

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.410
day 3,000 years ago from these
very quotidian records.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.750
AUDIENCE: Have the same
techniques been tried against

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.610
Etruscan or other
lost languages?

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.420
MARGALIT FOX: Say again,
I'm sorry.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.860
AUDIENCE: Have the same
techniques been tried against

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.780
Etruscan or any other
lost languages?

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.320
MARGALIT FOX: I believe so.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.890
In fact, the interesting thing
about Etruscan, which is a

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.900
lost non-Indo-European language
of ancient Italy,

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.040
Michael Ventris, from the time
he was a boy until literally

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.440
weeks before this Greek solution
asserted itself in

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.070
front of his eyes, fervently
believed that the tablets were

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.210
written in a form of
ancient Etruscan.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.840
And of course, Kober, who met
him once in 1948, and they

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.200
clearly didn't think much of
each other, he was committing

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.890
the cardinal sin of imputing--

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.160
he was working from the wrong
end of the telescope.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.150
He ascribed a language first and
then, of course, tried to

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.160
make the data sets go into all
sorts of configurations they

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.840
didn't want to go
into to, voila,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.110
make it come out Etruscan.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.200
And she remained adamantly
agnostic on the language of

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.150
the tablets for just
this reason.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.660
To answer your question,
I'm sure the

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.730
techniques have been tried.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.810
And of course, now that we are
in the computer age, there are

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:37.190
all kinds of digital techniques
that are available

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.200
for archaeological decipherment
that these people

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.010
didn't have.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:44.660
That's the other amazing thing
about Linear B is it was all

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.530
accomplished entirely by hand
without the aid of a single

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:52.450
computer or a single bilingual
inscription that, like the

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.690
Rosetta Stone, would give Linear
B on one side and a

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.570
known language in a known
script on the other.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.310
One has never been found for
Linear B to this day.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.860
AUDIENCE: Did Linear B have a
system of inscribing numbers

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.480
using figures as well?

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.550
MARGALIT FOX: Yes, they did, and
we, unfortunately, didn't

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:12.400
have time to show it.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.840
I can describe it.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.470
because of course, the tablets
were inventories of, we bought

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.400
500 pigs today, and stuff.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.820
And so the tablets, like
anybody's account books, teem

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.550
with numbers.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.700
And fortunately for Arthur
Evans, the numerical system

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.140
was quite transparent, and he
was able to work that out

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.140
right away.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.330
They, as we do, use a base
10 numerical system.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:38.930
But strikingly, their base 10
system is recorded by means of

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.410
just five symbols.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.860
So there's one symbol, for
instance, for the number one.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.540
It's a little vertical line.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.790
And so if you want to write the
number nine, the scribe

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.820
would just make nine
of those symbols.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.980
The number 10 is a
horizontal line.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.180
So to write the number 99, he'd
write 10 horizontal lines

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.550
followed by 10 vertical lines,
and so on, up to--

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.560
there's a symbol that
goes-- the highest

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.890
order is tens of thousands.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.480
So the system can record any
number up to 99,999.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.070
And there's a very nice picture
of it in the book.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.050
Yes.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.200
AUDIENCE: You've established,
or told us that they

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.560
established, that the language
of Linear B is Greek earlier

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.450
than what we normally think
of as Ancient Greek.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:29.760
Is there a way of finding a
history in Linear B as a

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.060
script to Greek script?

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.980
Is there a connection
between the two?

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.620
MARGALIT FOX: No, in fact,
there's a disconnect.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.250
What happened is Linear B, we
now know, records what is

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.290
called Mycenaean Greek, the
language of Bronze Age era

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:50.180
Greece and these dependencies
that the Greeks colonized.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.870
Not long after the tablets
were written, the various

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.160
Mycenaean palatial centers, both
at Knossos and centers on

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.390
the mainland, Pylos, Mycenae
itself, some others, were

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:06.330
destroyed in a cataclysm whose
cause will remain unknown.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.730
It could have been a
lightning strike.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.220
It could have been-- it was a
very earthquake prone region.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.170
All it takes is one earthquake
to knock over an oil lamp, and

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.420
you have devastation.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.140
It could have been deliberate
sacking.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:23.090
But the Mycenaean culture
effectively had died out by

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.780
about 1200 BC and earlier
on Crete.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:31.260
The tablets that we have,
written between 1450 and 1400

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.580
BC on Crete, what we have is
only the last year of records

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.840
of this palatial center.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.440
By 1200, on the mainland, the
palaces were gone as well, and

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.700
with them, writing.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.250
What followed then was a
long Greek dark age.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.120
People continued
to speak Greek.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.390
The art of writing was lost.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:54.230
Because remember, in Homer's
day, 500 years after the

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:58.220
Cretan tablets were inscribed,
the Homeric epics were written

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.360
and transmitted orally.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.260
So they didn't have writing
again until the Greek

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.480
alphabet, which was, of course,
derived from the

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.000
Phoenicians.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.580
The Greek alphabet came in about
800 BC, give or take.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.860
So there was indeed this dark
age of several hundred years

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.290
of no literacy.

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.090
It's kind of sad.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.861
AUDIENCE: So the language
evolved, but the writing

00:52:19.861 --> 00:52:20.340
disappeared.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.550
MARGALIT FOX: Exactly right.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:24.480
The language continued
uninterrupted, and you can

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.760
actually look.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.040
There are words that we now
know how to sound out in

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.090
Mycenaean Greek.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.530
The word for the king
or ruler of the

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.150
palatial center was wanax.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.910
We would Romanize it as
W-A-N-A-X. Well, that shows up

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:42.360
500 years later in
Homer as anax.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.630
So you can make these
very similar--

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.230
you can map a whole philological
chain of a word's

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:53.730
evolution, but not so with
writing, as you said.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:54.980
Anyone else?

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.840
AUDIENCE: Does the fact that
they're written on clay affect

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.810
what the symbols are?

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:04.300
I know the Sri Lankan script is
written on reeds, and that

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.940
had an impact on the
shape of the--

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.920
MARGALIT FOX: It
certainly does.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.690
And it certainly affects
how the symbols look.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.200
It affected it in ways that
made it difficult for

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.020
decipherment.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.930
One, just the friability of
the clay, that a lot of

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.330
tablets were damaged.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:26.170
You'll notice it's much easier
to show drawn transcriptions

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.400
or now typeset transcriptions
of the tablets than

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.370
photographs of the actual
tablets, because they're

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.300
incised in such low relief, they
don't photograph well.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.830
And they're eroded by time
and water and soil

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.790
and all that besides.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:41.750
So that's one thing.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.990
And in fact, it affected the
very name of the script.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.660
Why is it Linear B?

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.800
Well, the B we know because it's
the successor to Linear

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.340
A, the indigenous
Cretan script.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.700
But why linear?

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:57.410
Arthur Evans named it so because
unlike the other

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:01.500
really well-known script written
in clay, Mesopotamian

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.670
cuneiform, which was impressed
with a wedge-shaped tool,

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.190
these Cretan scripts were made
with linear strokes.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:12.420
It's much more the way you or I
would write a letter by hand

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.490
in our own alphabet,
so hence, linear.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:18.450
So indeed, the clay did affect
the very form and hence the

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.870
very name of the script.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:21.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:24.310
Where can you see the tablets
or the artifacts from the

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.550
civilization right now?

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.940
MARGALIT FOX: Well, of course,
the easiest place is online.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.500
Just do a Google search.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.750
You guys know how.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.840
But if you want to see them in
the flesh, as it were, in the

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.320
clay, many of the Cretan ones
are at the Heraklion Museum.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.330
Heraklion is basically--

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.010
Knossos is a suburb of
Heraklion, put it that way.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.940
They're right close together.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.050
Some are in Athens.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:53.170
And many, because Arthur Evans
was for years also the keeper

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.990
of the Ashmolean Museum in
Oxford, as they call their

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.580
head curator, many are
at the Ashmolean.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.350
There are a few-- they may be
copies, but good copies--

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.550
at the Metropolitan Museum
here in New York.

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.530
So that would be my first
stop, were I you.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.310
AUDIENCE: One more follow-up
question about Linear A. Have

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.320
there ever been any sort of
archaeological digs looking

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:19.790
for possible remnants underneath
the ash flow from

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:21.490
the Thera eruption?

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:21.980
MARGALIT FOX: Right.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.230
There was an eruption on Thera,
or as we call it,

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.490
Santorini, which devastated
the whole region.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:32.040
There was a tsunami and an ash
fall, and that, too, may well

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.440
have contributed to the demise
of these Mycenaean kingdoms.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.660
As for specific digs to
look for Linear A,

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.650
that I do not know.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.000
It's an empirical question.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.620
What I can tell you about Arthur
Evans's dig at Knossos

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.730
is he went down far enough to
determine that that palatial

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:53.310
site at Knossos had actually
been inhabited as far back as

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:53.930
the Stone Age.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.350
But he wasn't interested in
artifacts from that region, so

00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:00.290
he very quickly honed in on the
Bronze Age as the focus of

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.200
his search.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.150
Linear A, so far, there just
doesn't seem to be that much.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.860
But as for dedicated
excavations,

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.640
that's a good question.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.010
I don't know.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.460
I'm sorry.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.280
Any last questions?

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.000
Well, thank you all so
much for coming.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.830
You've been wonderful.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:24.330
