1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
Yeah. And so now he's, uh, he's
in, uh, uh, an Alzheimer's home.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,510
But, but uh, yeah, that's the part
about is it scary about turning 50?

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,430
But he's like in,
they're nailing all these chicks we call,

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,280
we will go in there and he's like making
out with some girl with a nasal cannula

5
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:21,150
on and carrying her oxygen bottle and
he's convinced that they've been married

6
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:24,760
for a few
dead.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,740
I have a bit in my act about the
outbreak of STDs in nursing homes.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,940
It's out of control. Viagara oh, it's
not only just that, these people, I mean,

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,310
I mean my dad has really
advanced Alzheimer's, um,

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,420
and he knows that he misses his Mustang.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,500
Uh, I took all this bicycles
away and I need to get laid.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,130
That's it. I mean, and he's in
there just running around with it.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,860
If we got called to my sister and I
take care of my dad in that manner.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,310
And so we get called to the, uh, home,

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,340
almost like being called to the
principal's office as a, as a parent.

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,950
And they're like, your dad's
literally in here. Fucking everybody.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
Like,

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,040
yeah. Literally had the feeling
of getting janked in there to the,

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,550
to the principal's office.
Like your kids a fuck up.

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,510
Your Dad's fucking every but
yeah, it'd be proud. Oh heck yeah.

21
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,540
What does he care? What do
you all care? That's my point.

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,150
That's what I say about him
in my acts. Like, come on man.

23
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,910
How do you want these people
die out? What? Their heart
to stop with the playing.

24
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:37,330
Bingo. Yeah. Yeah. Have a good time.

25
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,740
Just don't want him hurt each
other. We'll see. I mean the,

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm in the healthcare business also
home health care and so I know, yeah,

27
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,550
I've got a lot of different ventures.
But what do you in,

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,140
how are you in the home health
care? Home health care with,
uh, with, uh, my wife, uh,

29
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:54,010
we 16, 17 years, um, maybe longer. Uh,

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,480
so in the state of Texas it's probably
the second or third largest home health

31
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:01,120
care, but I'm talking real home
healthcare. Like you've got to get shots,

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,350
you've got to get therapy.
You got,

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
these are Aryans that are going in and
they're not, so you go into bathe grandma,

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,660
what is your business?

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,440
So you hire a bunch of nurses to take
care of the people that are at home. Yeah,

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,790
it's prescribed,
uh,

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,080
like through Medicare or insurance or
whatever to where maybe somebody gets a

38
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:22,081
knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe
it's an injury or cancer or what have

39
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,760
you.
And so it's a very rewarding business.

40
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,670
We probably have 3000 to 2,500,

41
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:32,290
3000 patients at any given time all
around the state of Texas. And uh,

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,570
so it's, uh, it's,

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,600
it's a fun business to be and that
you're really getting help people,

44
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:42,090
but at the same time, this shit
out there crazy. These guys are,

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,193
they're getting after it.

46
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,540
You go into the nursing home and it's
like Dan do this 78 year old Jews had more

47
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,320
ass than I had

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,153
last week.

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,560
Well, you don't have anything else to do.
Nothing. Yeah. Why not? Why not? Why not?

50
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,170
My thought is why not? Well, I bought
my dad, uh, you know, he's got his room.

51
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,580
That's kind of like an
apartment or whatever.

52
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,900
And I bought him strip stripper sheets,
or not stripper sheets, but uh, uh, uh,

53
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,530
twister, twister sheets with the all
the bread and polluted peak times.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,680
And I hung a board thing up
behind his bed. I'm like, Dad,

55
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,300
if you're getting after
you might as well have fun.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,100
I mean fuck Bingo or freaking whatever.
So when, because he has Alzheimer's,

57
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:26,080
does he remember when he gets after it?
I think it's cities just so focused on,

58
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,830
and he says he was the, what would you
call him? A Casa Nueva or he was, he,

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,830
my dad got some serious ass my whole
life as a teenager. I was like,

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,460
God Dang it.

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,990
My Dad's like banging everything and
tense when your wife leaves you with kids,

62
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:45,400
when you're young, you just realize,
okay, I forgot about this longterm shit.

63
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,920
Yeah, let's just enjoy the
moment. Yeah. But I mean,

64
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:51,580
my dad was straight up products of the
sixties and seventies, you know, so he,

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,230
he like put dye his hair blonde and his
eyebrows blonde and shit and walk around,

66
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,780
look at like Matthew mcconaughey from
dazed and confused. All right. All right.

67
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:05,740
All right. Try driving his Mustang. You
know, he'd come pick me up from school.

68
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,580
What kind of Mustang did you
have back then? It was like
a 72 fast back, you know,

69
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,420
red and black with a four speed and he'd
be hammering it and I'm like, you know,

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,871
five,

71
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,650
six years old at the age I'd fall on
the floor because nobody wore a freaking

72
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,670
seatbelt back then.
And uh,

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,380
his idea of after school care was the
skating rink because he knew that thing.

74
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,620
It'd be open till nine.
So drop us off.

75
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,550
I'm at the skating rink eating
99 cent corn dog meal and uh,

76
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,100
he'd come pick us up usually around 10
or 11 with some irate skating rink owners

77
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:39,840
sitting there pissed off. And he
said, wow, he was a bad ass though.

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,390
Or is a bad ass still? I mean, he's
nailing chicks in a freaking nursing home.

79
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,460
Come on.
It's so weird when you become an adult,

80
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,320
isn't it? Oh yeah. You know,

81
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,740
when you think about [inaudible]
round for what we're doing,

82
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,630
we've got a drink wine from Arabian
Rawlings for sure. Raymond Rawlings,

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,680
Raymond Miller, Rawlings, that
his mother fucker that ever lived.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,780
So I loop for sure.

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,070
I mean, I guarantee you he got more
acid than you and I did this whole week.

86
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,000
I believe it. He's freaking
probably banging one right
now. Yeah. It's like, hey,

87
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,840
what's that noise in the back?

88
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:18,340
Sounds like my son is the youngest
team plus the goal. The goal is like,

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,220
or the bonus rather is that they can't
get pregnant. You got that? Yeah.

90
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,760
I mean it's over. Yeah. Well I mean
that's a, that's not happening,

91
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,750
but you can still get some diseases
and stuff. Yes they do. Yes they do.

92
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,930
But the thing is where are
they getting them? Well,

93
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,460
somebody had it and then
the next thing you know,

94
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,920
all a hundred people in that
building have done it right.

95
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,950
But did they have it already or do
they getting it from the building now?

96
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,090
They had it already.
He had it already.

97
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,210
So you're dealing with herpes or you're
dealing with like the real weird ones

98
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:53,380
like syphilis and gonorrhea and shit
and syphilis and gonorrhea is like, hey,

99
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,070
you got to treat this. Where
are you getting this? Oh No,
it's, it's, it's prevalent.

100
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,630
It's everything. Right.
But the question is like,

101
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:04,370
are they getting it from outside sources?
Maybe. Maybe. I mean, who knows yet that,

102
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:07,280
that, that uh, unfortunately
that just had the baby, you know,

103
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,660
that it's been invalid for a 20
something years. That's crazy.

104
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,940
Yeah.
Somebody,

105
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
somebody knocked her F and I'm like
2007 2011 chlamydia infections amongst

106
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:24,101
Americans 65 and over increased
by 31% and syphilis by 52% yeah,

107
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,010
but that, the problem with
that is 52% all right. Okay.

108
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,310
Let's say there's a hundred cases and
then the next year there's 150 all right.

109
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,530
That's 52% no big,

110
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,230
tens of hundreds of millions of people.

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,310
My Dad's probably in there going,
come on baby.

112
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm going to buy some
preliminary ideas though.

113
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,600
I don't like the number of
percent because if there's,

114
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,720
there's four people and then
the next year there's six,

115
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:57,620
that's 50% increase and I'm saying I
don't like numbers like that because you

116
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:00,500
could make, oh my God, it's
an epidemic I want, I want,

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,480
I want numbers like human beings. Yeah.
Well I'm sure it's out there on the web,

118
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:09,130
but like I said, my dad's probably thinks
chlamydia is a flower. He's given us.

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,210
He's given this girl.

120
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm going to get you some chlamydia is
and we're going to have a good time. Yeah.

121
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,180
There's no condoms in nursing homes.
You know we got,

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,940
we got a worse 3000 reported
cases of chlamydia among
people. 45 and older. Okay,

123
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,730
but I'm 45 and older.
That's normal.

124
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,920
45 and older people are walking around
meeting New People with 43,000 seems like

125
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,350
a very low number. Super
Low. That's what I'm saying.

126
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,510
That's why I don't like
these percentage numbers.

127
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:39,650
Gonorrhea had seat from doing this
podcast all these years. I've,

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,000
I understand when people can make things
seem greater than they really are.

129
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:48,950
Go back to that. Jamie, do you have a our
P card? No, but someone set one to us,

130
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,740
to me and Ari.
Ari to the comedy store,

131
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:56,660
but I think that was just some asshole
who tried to thousand sounds low. Yeah.

132
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:01,520
Primary and secondary syphilis 5,650
cases were reported in this age group,

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,680
but that is 45 the thing about 45 and
older is 45 year old people in 2019 it's

134
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,860
not like 45 year old people
in the 60s absolutely.

135
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,410
These animals are out there
fucking hitting the gym
and doing squats and flying

136
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,200
to Thailand. They're probably getting
it from the sweat on the gym bench.
