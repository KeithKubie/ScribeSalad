00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.520
Wearing academic robes is a tradition that
dates back to at least the 12th century, around

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.370
the time when the first universities were
being founded in Europe.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.160
During this time, most scholars were also
clerics or aspiring clerics, and excess in

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.450
apparel was not encouraged.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.510
As such, in the beginning it is thought that
there was little difference between what the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.750
academics were wearing and the laity, excepting
that the academics and clergy tended to wear

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.230
very plainly colored garb.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.460
Beyond that, the clothing was simply practical.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.410
When the universities were originally formed,
they had no official buildings of their own

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.050
to hold lectures in, so classes typically
gathered in nearby churches.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.120
Their simple robes and outer covering served
the purpose of keeping them warm in the drafty

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.510
medieval church buildings, and the hoods kept
the weather off when they ventured out of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.530
doors.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.380
The earliest standardization of academic garb
occurred as a byproduct of a 1222 edict by

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.070
Stephen Langton at the Council of Oxford,
where it was declared that all clerks should

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.710
wear a form of the cappa clausa, a long cape
typically worn over a robe.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.950
In short order, this became thought of as
a mark of an academic as the newly minted

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.080
universities adopted it for the aforementioned
reasons, while at the same time the clergy

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.159
in general (outside of academic contexts)
over time wore it less and less.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.360
By 1321, this ultimately lead to the University
of Coimbra mandating that plain gowns be worn

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.450
by Licentiates, Bachelors, and Doctors.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.340
By Tudor times, more or less this same basic
standard had been set for academic dress at

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.480
Oxford and Cambridge.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.570
Gradually more comfortable versions were adopted
keeping a version of the robe, but without

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.920
the thick outer layer.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.650
As for coloring, things remained very plain,
generally black.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.729
Certain colors weren’t designated to represent
specific areas of study until a few centuries

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.430
later in the late 1800s, with the standards
varying from country to country and in many

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.220
cases university to university.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.950
So that's the gowns, what about the goofy
looking caps, or mortarboards?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.840
The mortarboard is called such due to it resembling
the flat board used by bricklayers to hold

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.290
mortar (called a 'hawk').

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.920
The cap is simply a square, flat board fastened
to a skullcap with a jaunty tassel fastened

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.540
to its center.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.430
Some historians suggest the mortarboard is
the descendant of the biretta, which was headgear

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.670
often sported by Roman Catholic clerics, scholars
and professors.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.080
This, in turn, probably derives from common
pileus (brimless hat) worn by the laity.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.890
The wearing of this hat was first ordered
in 1311 by the Church at the Synod of Bergamo,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.300
spreading from there as standard headgear
by clerics.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.680
By the 15th century, the mortarboard cap was
incorporated into the standard garb for many

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.340
scholars, among others.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.270
It was initially not generally undecorated
as today (other than the tassel), but early

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.810
versions could feature elaborate embroidery
and adornments.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.489
Further, in the early days at some universities,
the mortarboard was reserved for those who

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.370
had earned the title of "master" or “doctor.”

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.940
As explained by French historian Jacques Le
Goff:

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.720
“Once he had passed the examination, the
candidate became licensed, however he could

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.740
only possess the title of “doctor” and
teach as a Master following the public examination

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.190
… In this way, he assumed for the first
time the role of the Master in a university

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.190
setting.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.070
After this, the archdeacon ceremoniously conferred
upon him the authorization to teach, along

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.160
with the symbolic regalia appropriate to his
function: a professorial chair, an open book,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.739
a golden ring, and the mortar board or cap.”

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.680
Today the bar is not set quite as high, and
all grads are typically entitled to mortarboards

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.959
in regions where they are worn.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.569
The tradition of the graduating class throwing
their caps in the air at the end of the ceremony

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.940
has a relatively recent genesis.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.080
The first known instance of this was in 1912
at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.380
There are slightly conflicting accounts as
to the reason they did this, but the general

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.290
story is that it is because the Academy decided
to give them their officers' hats at the graduation

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.290
itself.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.120
Thus, the graduates chucked their midshipmen's
caps in the air upon graduation, and ceremoniously

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.910
placed their officers' hats on.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.030
Unfortunately, how accurate that story is
and how that ended up catching on with other

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.980
universities has been lost to history.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.590
It may simply be it happened independently
in many places as after the ceremony is over,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.580
no need for the stupid hats anymore, and it’s
kind of fun to throw things in excitement.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.060
Whatever the case, from medieval abbeys where
the style of dress was more or less just a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.770
version of what most people wore in parts
of Europe at the time, to modern high school

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.230
gyms where the garb is decidedly out of place
outside of certain ceremonies, caps and gowns

00:04:49.230 --> 00:06:11.279
have continued to denote academic accomplishment,
with no sign of the tradition letting up any

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:39.279
time soon.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.831
Bonus Fact:
As for why judges typically wear robes, this

00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:46.390
more or less seems to be for similar reasons
as gowns for academics.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.710
For example, this became the standard uniform
for judges in England during the reign of

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.370
Edward II, who ruled from 1327 until 1377.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.580
At this point, as mentioned, they had already
been the standard garb for academics for over

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.529
a century, as well as worn in other settings.

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:06.170
For instance, this type of garb would also
have been appropriate for wear for a visit

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.390
to the royal court, so a judge wearing his
robes outside of the courtroom would not have

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.540
been out of place.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.440
The standard robe color for judges in England
at this time was not black, however, but rather

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.480
came in three colors: violet for the summer,
green for the winter, and scarlet for special

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.539
occasions.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.690
Judges often received the material for these
robes as part of a grant from the King.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.070
However, new guidelines dictating which robes
could be worn at certain times appeared in

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.000
1635, including suggesting judges wear black
robes with a fur trim during the winter and

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.880
violet or scarlet robes that feature pink
taffeta for the summer.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.589
By the middle of the 18th century, English
judges typically wore a scarlet robe with

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:48.270
a black scarf and a scarlet hood when presiding
over criminal cases, but for civil cases,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.690
they often wore black silk robes.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.740
Judges in the U.S. ultimately borrowed this
tradition from the British.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.099
This topic actually produced debate between
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams after the

00:07:58.099 --> 00:07:59.099
revolution.

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:02.950
Jefferson argued that American judges should
distance themselves from the traditions set

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.620
down by the English and wear only a suit in
court.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.130
Adams, a lawyer, disagreed and wanted judges
to continue wearing the robes and wigs of

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.180
English judges.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.330
A compromise ensued, with it being decided
that the new American judges should wear the

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.460
robe and not the wig.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.919
That said, in the United States the wearing
of robes by judges is now only tradition.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:27.000
Even in the Supreme Court of the United States
there is no requirement that its justices

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.650
wear a robe in court.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:44.530
Despite this, the vast majority of judges
do so anyway, with some exceptions.
