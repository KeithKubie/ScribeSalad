00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
In today's video,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.500
we are taking a look
at three different types

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.600
of fire extinguishers,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.100
how they put out three different
types of fire, and why.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.840
[Music]

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.000
Guys, we are up here at the Dome
today with three different types

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of fire extinguishers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.434
because we want to take a look
at just what's inside them,

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.100
and what kind of tires
they can put out.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100
So to start out with,
we need some fire.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
Yay, fire!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.400
So first, let's talk
about the different types

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.892
of fire extinguishers you can
normally find for your house.

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:31.641
This is the most

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.100
common fire extinguisher
you're normally going to find.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.700
This is your ABC
fire extinguisher.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.994
Now, A, B and C stand for
three different types of fires.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:42.335
So any type of fire
that starts with wood,

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:43.100
paper, trash,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440
that's a solid fire
and that's a Class A.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.873
A Class B fire is
actually going to be liquids.

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:49.500
So if you have a gasoline fire,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.393
or an oil fire,
something like that,

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.232
you would use this
with the type B.

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:56.100
You also have the type C,
which is an electrical fire.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700
Now, while these
can be used on electronics,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.775
it's not typically the one
that you want to use

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.400
if you want to save
your electronics,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.600
because this will actually
produce a residue.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.300
This is another type
of fire extinguisher

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.433
that's slightly newer
in the market.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.588
This is specifically made
for kitchen grease fires.

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:12.838
As far as I'm aware,

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.438
this is the only
UL-approved kitchen grease

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:16.723
fire fire extinguisher.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:17.900
The first ingredient

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
in this fire extinguisher is
actually sodium bicarbonate,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.000
which is just baking soda.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, this is going
to put out any sort

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.300
of grease fire supposedly.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.200
We're going to test that.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.700
But again, it's going
to ruin your food.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.140
This is a third
fire extinguisher.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.550
A lot of times you can find
these in office settings.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.700
Now, I've never actually used a
Tundra fire extinguisher before.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000
Supposedly, this is
an aerosol powered foam spray.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.300
Now, I've never used it.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.100
I'm not even sure what
the ingredients are.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.000
I searched and I
could not find out online

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
what Tundra uses
in their fire extinguishers,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.800
so we want to take a look at it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:58.280
[Music]

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.800
That's probably enough.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.400
Note, oil has a flash point
of 619 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.500
and the fire point
of 662 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.755
So that's what we're trying
to get this to.

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:13.988
Now, we also have
some handheld flares today.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:15.100
Now, technically, none

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.100
of our fire extinguishers are
made to put out chemical fires,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.300
but I want to see if they can.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.100
These aren't even road flares.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.900
These are Marine flares.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.400
Never used one this before.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.500
We stepped away
for maybe 30 seconds,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.600
and our oil is on fire.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.580
That was fast.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.900
Grease fires in the kitchen
are extremely dangerous,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.431
because a lot of times
people will panic,

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.729
they will try
and pick up the pot,

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:39.649
and throw it outside.

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:40.700
But you could splash it.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.191
You could spread the fire
everywhere or burn yourself.

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:44.900
Another problem with
a grease fires is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.800
that people will try
and throw water on them.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.458
Now, water is not going
to do anything.

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:49.200
It just splashes.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.100
It's just gonna make it worse.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.566
So that's why you use a dry
chemical fire extinguisher,

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.300
or a CO2 fire extinguisher.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.720
Either of those will work.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm going to try
one of ours now.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.640
[Music]

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.000
That's a lot of fire.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.400
That's why you don't throw
water on a grease fire.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.581
That's not putting it out.

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:12.400
What it's doing is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.220
it's actually splashing the oil
and spreading it around.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.900
That one burned itself
out because again,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.200
we're not using too much oil.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.000
It's time for round two.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.940
[Music]

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.800
So last time,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.700
it took us about two and a half
minutes with our oil on top

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.760
of our forge to hit that flash
point and auto-ignition.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.600
All right, 47 seconds.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.840
It's bubbling.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.180
No smoke yet though.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
Five minutes.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.460
There we go.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.200
5 minutes, 21 seconds.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.760
[Music]

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.500
So now, we're gonna use
our fire extinguisher

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
that's specifically made
for fires of these type.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.700
We're going to try and catch
some of our baking soda

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.614
and the other ingredients in one
of the bowls to look at the bit.

00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:03.407
Now, these cans,
a lot of people think

00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:05.100
that they spray
for quite a long time.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.800
They actually have about 8
to 10 seconds of spray time.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.950
So you need to move quick.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.400
Aim for the base of your fire

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.300
from about five
to six feet away.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.938
Make sure that you put
the whole thing out.

00:04:13.938 --> 00:04:16.200
Usually, you want to make sure
that you're aiming all of it

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.600
into the container
before you back way.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.400
But like I said,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.800
we're gonna let a lot
of this burn off,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.900
and then I'll try
and capture some as well.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:40.300
[Music]

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.320
Well, that is very useful.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.300
This is a good example
of why CO2 fire extinguishers

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.410
are sometimes nice.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.998
Yes, that put out our fire
very very quickly.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.760
But if that was dinner,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.580
now it's covered
in baking soda,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.380
and so is your entire kitchen.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.900
So here's what
you're going to find

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.400
if you ever discharged
a kitchen fire extinguisher.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400
So it's not that foam
and it's not water

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.940
like you might see in movies,
it's a dry chemical.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.400
Now, this is a bit
of an irritant.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.500
So I actually held my breath
when I was over there,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.200
got out of the dust
cloud very quick,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200
because well, it's not going
to be too hurtful for you.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.100
It can cause irritation
to your eyes and lungs.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.700
You don't want to breathe it in.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.340
[Music]

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.520
I do have quite a bit
of water with me,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.200
and water does put
out solid fires.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.400
But I want to test

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.418
our fire extinguisher
that's specifically made for it,

00:05:29.418 --> 00:05:30.900
our ABC fire extinguisher.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.700
Now, the main ingredient
in this one,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.700
like I said before is
monoammonium phosphate.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.400
Again, I'm going
to spray the fire,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.664
and then I'm going to try
and capture some of this so we

00:05:39.664 --> 00:05:40.900
can look at it afterwards too.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.800
So for this one,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
you're going to stand
six feet back.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.854
So it's a little
bit farther back

00:05:44.854 --> 00:05:46.500
than you need to be
with your kitchen fire.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.300
You aim at the base of the fire,
never at the top of the flames.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.200
[Music]

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.460
That was so fast.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, this you absolutely
do not want to breathe in.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.500
Spray and then get away.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.000
We have our two different types

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.220
of dry powder fire
extinguisher substances here.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.240
You can already
see the difference.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.220
So this one,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.500
you can see the mono
ammonium phosphate already has

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.100
that strange yellowish tinge.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.080
This one, baking soda.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.650
So now, I want to go and put
this through a few other tests.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.400
This stuff is not supposed to
be able to put out a gas fire.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.000
I still want to put some in our
forge just to see what it does.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.420
[Music]

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.500
So first, I'm just
going to try sprinkling

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.722
some of this in there.

00:06:25.722 --> 00:06:28.000
And again, main ingredient
is baking soda.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.900
Oh.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.360
Well, that was awesome.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.500
It actually did dampen
the flames for a little bit.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.000
[Music]

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.400
Wow, that is a much cooler
reaction than I was expecting.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.900
I'm just wondering
if it's the quantity,

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.500
or if this is a small
enough contained fire

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.738
that it's easy enough

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:52.905
for the ingredients
to just snuff it out.

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:56.200
This again would be your normal
kitchen fire extinguisher

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.700
that's used for grease fires.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.580
Let's try our ABC
fire extinguisher.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.620
[Music]

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.600
Well, that's awesome.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
This is actually changing
the color of the flames.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.200
I don't know why,
but that's awesome.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.107
So we've already seen

00:07:09.107 --> 00:07:11.700
that tossing in a little bit
of our fire extinguishing powder

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.700
will put out our gas flames
for just a couple of seconds.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.900
I'm actually going to try
and pour it into a crucible,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.000
and super heat it just
to see what it does.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.480
[Music]

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.840
Not expecting any
huge reactions here.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.300
Because if this were to melt
or burn or anything else,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.280
it wouldn't be really useful
for a fire extinguisher.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.700
So it's been a few minutes.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.904
Our Crucible is red-hot,

00:07:32.904 --> 00:07:35.954
and nothing has happened to our
ABC fire extinguishing powder.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.740
So we're going
to turn this one off.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.340
Kind of what we expected.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.300
But that's pretty cool.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.100
So, for our last test,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.400
we have got our Tundra
fire extinguisher.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.300
Like I said before,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.000
I know that this
is an aerosol can,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.200
and I'm pretty sure

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.432
that this is going
to be a foam spray,

00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:51.700
but I'm not positive.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.500
We're going to put
this to the test up

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.855
against a marine flare.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.520
Now, these are
technically chemical fires.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.579
None of the extinguishers

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.805
that we have used today are
meant to put out chemical fires.

00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:03.080
Let's see if they can.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.260
[Music]

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.500
Now, this is something that's
kind of interesting to note.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.000
While there is
a huge size difference,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.705
this fire extinguisher
only has a lasting spray

00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:14.176
of about 8 to 10 seconds,

00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:17.200
whereas the Tundra has about
32 seconds of spray time.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.920
So while it does have
a longer lasting spray,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.850
you actually have to be
even closer to the fire.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.825
So that's a huge downside
to one of these.

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:26.050
The other ones,
you can be five-six feet away.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.500
This one have to be about
three feet from the fire

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
to actually put it out.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.700
Thankfully, our marine flare
is a very contained fire.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.600
So I'm safe enough

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.400
to get that close and see
if this is gonna work.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:45.380
[Music]

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.140
Huh?

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.880
[Music]

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.800
Still going.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.000
All right, I would have been
very disappointed in this flare

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.600
if it had a gone out
because it's a marine flare.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.100
Let's try again though.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:12.800
[Music]

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.220
Oh, this is interesting.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.300
It's not really a foam.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.620
It's basically a water.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.140
[Music]

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.800
It's definitely a liquid,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.260
and it has definitely
put out our flare.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.600
Liquid foam fire extinguishers
versus Marine flare,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.180
fire extinguisher wins.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.020
So these are the fire
extinguishers that we use today

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:35.603
because they are
the most common ones

00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:37.521
that you're going to find
around your house,

00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:38.671
around your workspaces,

00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:41.073
but there are actually five
types of fire extinguishers.

00:09:41.073 --> 00:09:43.189
These are just the ones
that were going to be easiest

00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:43.800
for us to test,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.356
and kind of show you
what they're going to do,

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:45.809
and the ones

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:47.700
that are going to be most
readily available to you.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.500
So, your fire extinguishers.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.800
Are they going to put out
the fires they're supposed to?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.350
Absolutely.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.700
Turns out that they can put
out a few other things too.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.400
Guys, that's not all.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.800
We've always got more
for you to see.
