00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.150
As another example, the attacker can
also hide part of the attack and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.050
cause the IDS to miss
detecting the attack.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.650
For example,
by sending fragments that overlap,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.630
the IDS may discard a fragment that
overlaps with a previous fragment.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.300
While the end host may accept both.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.980
Again, the result is that,
the IDS will miss the attack.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.470
Here's an illustration
of this evasion attack.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.910
Again, the attackers sends
a packet although out of order,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.650
both the end host and
the IDS will assemble them in order.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.680
However, the two As here
are overlapping fragments.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.870
The IDS drops the second A, so therefore
the IDS only sees A, T, T, C, K.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.748
On the other hand, the end-host accepts
both fragments even though they overlap,

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:54.370
therefore the end-host sees A,
T, T, A, C, K.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.970
In other words, the end-host gets
attacked by the traffic, yet

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.510
the IDS misses the attack.
