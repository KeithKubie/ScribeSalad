&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
My name is John Evans.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.559
I'm with the labor group here in Davos and
the most important issue is

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.130
how to begin to look at distributing the benefits
of growth, uh, more

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.430
fairly than in the past.
We've seen inequality increase throughout

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.519
the industrialized country,
we've seen inequality increase in developing

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.789
countries.
Wagershare has fallen so the real issue is

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.419
not just about growth but
how to distribute growth, how to get sort

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.810
of institutions which build
fairness into the global economy and actually

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.289
give people a fair slice
of the cake.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.390
That's the big issue in Davos I believe that
has to be tackled.
