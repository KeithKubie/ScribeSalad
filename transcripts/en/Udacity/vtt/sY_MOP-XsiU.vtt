00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.900
The most common task you'll
complete on Piazza is reading.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.109
&gt;From the home screen on Piazza, you can
read any of the topics on the left.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.380
Just click the topic to
load it in the main window.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.640
The numbers on the topics
indicate how many updates there

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.080
have been since you
last viewed the topic.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.100
You'll notice that the topics are
flagged with other information as well.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.000
This icon with the four lines
indicates a topic is a note.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.260
That means that the topic is more of
a discussion, not a question and answer.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.210
This icon with the three bars is for
a poll where you can vote on something.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.910
If the topic is a question,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.080
it will either appear in
red if it is unresolved, or

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
it will have icons showing it has been
resolved by a student or instructor.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.150
For example,
this question is unresolved.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.430
We can see there is no answer provided,
and so it appears in red on the left.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.680
A yellow i icon means that the question
has received an instructor's answer.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.850
A green s icon means that the question
has received a student answer.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.370
For example, in this topic we see the
question has received both instructor

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.840
and student answers.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.950
So both icons appear.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.460
A check mark on top of the green s

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.220
means that an instructor has
endorsed a student's answer.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.130
There may also be some flags on
the left side of the topic list.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.410
This flag means the topic or
question was posted by an instructor.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.220
This flag means the topic is only
visible to you and the instructor.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.340
This flag means the topic is only
visible to a particular subgroup,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.660
like a project group, or a study group.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.370
Finally, there are also
flags below the questions.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.770
Sometimes an instructor will endorse
a question or a note as a good note, and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.270
this will appear.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.730
Unresolved followups
are also noted below.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.980
These refer to the followup discussion,
which we'll talk about in a bit.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.180
&gt;&gt; Many of our OMS classes can have
several hundred students in them.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.203
And, as such,
the topic list can get very large and

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:01.890
can be pretty overwhelming.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.590
But, remember, there's not usually
nearly as much content there as there

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.110
actually appears to be.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.830
But to kind of wade through it, I'd like
to show you one of my favorite features.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.240
It's hidden under menu in Piazza.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.930
It's the archive feature.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.000
To get to the archive feature,
mouse over a topic.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.820
And then hover over the arrow
that appears on the left.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.840
Then come down to Archive.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.750
Click it and the topic will no
longer appear in your topic list.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.390
Archiving a topic will remove
it from your topic list, but

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.845
it won't remove it from everyone else.

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:32.570
And archived topics are still available
to you in a way we'll talk about a bit

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.250
later, but it won't be there
to clutter up your view.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.910
So if you're reasonably sure that
a topic isn't going to have any updates

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.310
that are going to interest you.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.810
Or, if you feel like the topic
has reached its logical end,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.570
feel free to archive it like
this to keep it out of your way.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.779
You can also use this menu to subscribe
to e-mail updates about a thread by

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.621
clicking Follow.

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.073
Or to mark a thread as unread if
you want to make sure to come back

00:02:51.073 --> 00:02:51.600
to it later.
