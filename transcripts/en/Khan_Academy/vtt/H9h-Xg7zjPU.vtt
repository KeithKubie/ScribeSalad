- [Instructor] Particle
moves along a straight line.

00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:05.139
Its speed is inversely proportional

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:08.715
to the square of the
distance, S, it has traveled.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.927
Which equation describes
this relationship?

00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:13.352
So I'm not even gonna
look at these choices,

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:15.623
and I'm just gonna try to
parse the sentence up here

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:18.584
and see if we can come
up with an equation.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:22.114
So they tell us its speed
is inversely proportional,

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:22.947
to what?

00:00:22.947 --> 00:00:26.805
To the square of the
distance, S, it has traveled.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:27.979
So S

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:29.729
is equal to distance.

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:33.055
S is equal to distance.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.958
And how would we denote speed then,

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.397
if S is distance?

00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:40.725
Well speed is the rate
of change of distance

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.263
with respect to time.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:43.813
So our speed would be

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:46.133
the rate of distance with respect to time.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.893
The rate of change of
distance with respect to time.

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:52.295
So this is going to be our speed.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:53.734
So now that we got our notation,

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.073
S is the distance,

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:58.331
the derivative of S with
respect to time is speed.

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.047
We can say the speed which is d,

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:01.880
capital S,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.105
dt,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.600
is inversely proportional.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.190
So it's inversely proportional,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.403
I wrote a proportionality constant,

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:09.236
over what?

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.320
It's inversely proportional to what?

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.349
To the square of the distance!

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.410
To the square of the
distance it has traveled.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.243
So there you go,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.667
this is an equation that I think

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.556
is describing a differential equation,

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:24.557
really that's describing
what we have up here.

00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:25.565
Now let's see,

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:26.710
let's see what,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.070
which of these choices match that.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.716
Well actually this one
is exactly what we wrote.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:32.549
The speed,

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.506
the rate of change of
distance with respect to time,

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:38.477
is inversely proportional to
the square of the distance.

00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:40.354
Now just to make sure we
understand these other ones,

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:42.339
let's just interpret them.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.580
This is saying that the distance,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.198
which is a function of time,

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:49.741
is inversely proportional
to the time squared.

00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:51.207
That's not what they told us.

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:52.771
This is saying that the distance

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:55.533
is inversely proportional
to the distance squared.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.408
That one is especially strange.

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.405
And this is saying that the
distance with respect to time,

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:00.775
the change in distance
with respect to time,

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:03.397
the derivative of the
distance with respect to time,

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:05.500
dS/dt or the speed,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.633
is inversely proportional

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:08.466
to

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.684
time squared.

00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:10.659
Well that's not what they said,

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.334
they said it's inversely proportional

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:15.017
to the square of the
distance it has traveled.

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:16.934
So we like that choice.
