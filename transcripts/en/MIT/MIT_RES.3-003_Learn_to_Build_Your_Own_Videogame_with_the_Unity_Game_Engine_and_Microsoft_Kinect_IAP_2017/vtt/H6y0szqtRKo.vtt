00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.860
KYLE KEANE: So today,
we're going to do something

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.810
where we talk about our name.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.492
Renew icebreakery
thing for like 15--

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:27.950
well, no, there's
a lot of people--

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.150
20 minutes.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.630
Name, what brought you here.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.970
And, oh yeah, right off the bat
I'll say the more you all talk,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.040
the less I talk.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.420
So you'll get sick of
my voice, I promise.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990
I am very monotonous at times.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.900
And so, the more you guys
participate by saying words,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.100
the less you have
to hear my voice.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
So I would like three
things that we would

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920
like to know about each other.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.970
So if you could say--

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.239
I need three more bullet
points about things

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.239
that we're going to say.

00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:08.190
This is the moment
where you talk,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.142
otherwise I just
have a compulsion.

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:11.600
I want to hear my
voice constantly,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.360
that's why I'm in
front of a classroom.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.630
AUDIENCE: Favorite video game.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.620
KYLE KEANE: Favorite video game.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.120
Cool.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.470
Oh, that's so well-themed.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.300
Nice.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.410
All right.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.260
No, honestly.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.310
We had one-handed food during
the seminar I was teaching,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.460
but, yeah, favorite video
game is really on point.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.260
I can write, I promise.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.170
There we go.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.850
All right, favorite video game.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.810
I can do this.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.300
AUDIENCE: Programming
background?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.880
KYLE KEANE: Programming
background, sure.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.848
Do we want to know
languages or--

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:55.038
AUDIENCE: Either languages,
amount of rough--

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:56.050
amount of experience.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.496
Things like that.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:58.460
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.000
So something about your
general level of experience.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.510
And if you have nothing
to say about that,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.520
then just say [INAUDIBLE]--

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000
and that's perfectly fine.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800
That gives us a good read
on what's happening there.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.886
One more bullet point.

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:30.010
Are these called bullet
points when they're dashes?

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.403
Maybe they're just
called dashes.

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:32.090
AUDIENCE: Close enough.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.372
KYLE KEANE: Falsima, was it?

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:34.330
AUDIENCE: Close enough.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.371
KYLE KEANE: Close enough.

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.629
Oh, yes, that's good.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.920
AUDIENCE: You can call them
bullets-- squashed bullets.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.170
KYLE KEANE: Squashed bullets--

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.820
I like that.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.320
All right.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.625
One more fun thing.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.520
AUDIENCE: How about what
you might do with Unity?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.229
KYLE KEANE: Cool.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.728
All right.

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:47.690
What do you want to do?

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.773
Well, if you think that
that's different than what

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.296
brought you here.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.670
AUDIENCE: All
right, fair enough.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.980
KYLE KEANE: Yeah.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.780
All right.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.080
I like it, but all right, so--

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.520
the vision for the type of game.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.353
Because some of you may
have come with this,

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.300
oh my god, I have this
amazing side scroller

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.750
that involves pajamas
and bed sheets.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.740
So you can feel free
to share that here.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:16.400
What type of game or
what you want to do.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.580
I know that it's way too
small, but that's all right.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.484
We'll get it from example,
once each other starts sharing.

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:26.651
AUDIENCE: Where you're from.

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:27.942
KYLE KEANE: Where you're from--

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:28.610
I love that one.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.776
There's so many fun things--

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.550
I'm from Southern California.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.850
And when I was in
Southern California,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.600
most people were from
Southern California.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.090
But now that I am in
Cambridge, I get so excited.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.440
I'm like, that person--

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.810
I had a freshman in
my seminar this year

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.210
that was from my neighboring
city in Southern California.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.731
It was so exciting.

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.230
All right.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.580
So--

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.220
KYLE KEANE: It is Chino
Hills, California,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.630
which is a tiny weird little
city that is not really

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.707
connected to many other cities.

00:03:55.707 --> 00:03:57.040
AUDIENCE: Near LA, I'm guessing.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.940
KYLE KEANE: It's
in-between LA and San

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.600
Diego and out into the desert.
