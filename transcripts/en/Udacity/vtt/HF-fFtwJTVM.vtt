00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.702
Great job.

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:05.580
By this point you have started to
analyze the problems that exist in your

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.870
company.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
Throughout the standard degree, we'll
dive deeper into typical problems faced

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.110
by companies and
come up with potential solutions.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.280
In the process,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.740
you'll learn about spinning up
virtual machines in the cloud,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.980
using configuration management software,
managing microservices, and more.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.110
In the meantime, make sure to submit
Projects Zero for review and feedback.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
Now DevOps is all about
communication and collaboration.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
We put this into practice when
building this nano-degree.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.290
We have people from Udacity and Google,
people from operations, development,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.200
project management, who agreed to
lend their expertise to the program.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.010
That said,
it's time to hear from someone new.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.443
I'm going to pass you along
to my colleague, Carl.

00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:58.073
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Carl,
a course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:00:59.105
In the next lesson,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.393
we'll talk more about the history
of dev ops in the Combs Model.

00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:03.010
See you soon.
