00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.210
- [Instructor] We are told that Eddie

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.470
drove from New York City to Philadelphia.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.640
The function d gives the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.120
total distance Eddie has driven

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.430
in kilometers t hours after he left.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.890
What is the best interpretation
for the following statement?

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.790
D prime of two is equal to 100.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.600
So pause this video, and I
encourage you to write it out.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.290
What do you think this means,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.070
and be sure to include
the appropriate units.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.440
And now let's do this together.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.110
If d is equal to the distance,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.440
the distance driven, then to get d prime,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.940
you're taking the derivative
with respect to time.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.460
So one way to think about it is,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.010
it is the rate of change of d.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.600
So we could view this as d prime is

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.120
going to give you the instantaneous,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.120
instantaneous, instantaneous rate.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.740
And they are both functions of t.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.740
So one way to view d prime
of two is equal to 100,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.220
that would mean, well,
what is our time now?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.010
Well, that is our t, and that's in hours.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.840
So two hours, actually
let me color code it.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840
So two hours after leaving,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
after leaving, Eddie,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.547
Eddie, drove, drove,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.530
and this means, so it'll
be grammatically correct.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.844
Drove at an instantaneous,

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:40.844
instantaneous, instantaneous rate of,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.400
and let me use a different
color now for this part,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700
of 100, and what are the units?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.680
Well, the distance was
given in kilometers,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.060
and now we're gonna be thinking

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.010
about kilometers per unit time.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.010
Kilometers per hour, so
this is 100 kilometers,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.200
kilometers, per hour.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.740
So that's the interpretation there.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.993
Let's do another example.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.190
Here we are told a tank
is being drained of water.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.260
The function v gives the
volume of liquid in the tank,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.440
in liters, after t minutes.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.410
What is the best interpretation
for the following statement?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.600
The slope of the line tangent to the graph

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.600
of v at t equals seven is
equal to negative three.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.230
So pause this video again

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.610
and try to do what we just
did with the previous example.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.000
Write out that interpretation,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.873
make sure to get the units right.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.020
All right, so let's just remind
ourselves what's going on.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.020
V is going to give us the
volume, as a function of time.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.510
Volume is in liters,
and time is in minutes.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.290
And so they're talking about the slope

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.200
of the tangent line to the graph,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
the slope of the tangent
line to the graph of v,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.800
that's just v prime.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.720
So if you take the derivative
with respect to time,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.330
that's going to give you v prime,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.550
and these are all functions of t.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.760
These are all functions of t.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.100
And they say at t equals seven,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.800
it's equal to negative three.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.270
So this, which is the
same thing as the slope

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.580
of tangent line, slope
of tangent, tangent line.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.520
And they tell us that v prime

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.930
of at time equals seven minutes,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.920
our rate of change of volume with respect

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.450
to time is equal to negative three.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.330
And so you could say if
we were to write out,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.533
this means that after,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.500
after seven minutes, seven minutes,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.540
the tank is being drained
at an instantaneous,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.260
instantaneous, that's why we need

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.750
that calculus for that instantaneous rate.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.150
An instantaneous rate of,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.530
now you might be tempted

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.910
to say it's being drained
at an instantaneous rate

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.540
of negative three liters per minute.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.820
But remember, the
negative three just shows

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.210
that the volume is decreasing.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.390
So one way to think about it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.050
is this negative is
already being accounted

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.530
for when you're saying it's being drained.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.490
If this was positive, that
means it is being filled.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.210
So it is being drained
at an instantaneous rate

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.960
of three liters per minute.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.347
Three liters per minute.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.810
And how did I know the units
were liters per minute?

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.430
Well, the volume function
is in terms of liters,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.290
and the time is in terms of minutes.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.780
And then I'm taking the
derivative with respect to time,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.033
so now it's gonna be liters
per minute, and we are done.
