00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.060
So we went from a bunch of shorts to just two, to a bunch of shorts to just two again.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.220
Only this time, there's a feeling that the stories they picked were much more out of the norm.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.340
These weren't really fairy-tale; they were sort of classic stories.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.960
Both had their funny upbeat moments, but both had this very underlying dark tone throughout the whole thing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.920
Even the setting for the narrators is a little off.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.020
It's just this dark, dark library.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.980
You don't even see the narrator.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.820
It's just these books sort of floating and a stained-glass window with a candle in it.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.920
When I was a kid, I loved it. As an adult, I still love it.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.220
But heck, let's talk about them individually.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
You got "The Wind in the Willows," which, when you get down to it, is another very strange book.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.900
Not that animals are walking and talking; that's not the weird part.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.520
It's the fact that everybody else in the world is human!

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.860
And not just that, they're to scale.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.460
The rat is literally the size of a rat; that just looks so odd.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.800
But the rest of the story seems to follow pretty closely to the book.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.380
You got Toad, who's an extremist with anything.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.300
Anything that's new, anything that's hot--he's all over it.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
Mania, as the Brits like to call it.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.000
And he suddenly gets obsessed with motor cars.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.660
So he makes a really stupid deal with a guy named Weepy, who--I don't know, I'm sure is some sort of ethnic stereotype--

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.860
in that he hands over Toad Hall in exchange for the car.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.680
But in court, Weepy tells a different story and says that Toad stole the car, which gets him thrown in jail, and only his friends are able to save him.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.320
Moley and Rat are a lot of fun, Toad is enjoyably crazy, and even that horse gets a few good one-liners.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.160
-"Then how did he get a motor car?"

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.040
-"The only way a gentleman gets anything: the honest way."

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.920
-"And what is the honest way?"

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.780
-"Ha haaaa, I thought you wouldn't know that, guv'nor."
-[laughter]

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120
-I f**king love that line.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.980
Next, you have "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," which in terms of story layout, even to the original book,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.860
is so odd to me, but I really love it because of that.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.680
Most of the short is just Ichabod Crane and how he interacts with the people in the town.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.540
He has a bully, he has a girlfriend, there's a little bit of a love triangle.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.440
And most of it is done through mime.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
You have Bing Crosby narrating it, but for the most part, people don't really talk.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.700
And yet so much character still comes out of them.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.360
Including the fact that--something I never noticed as a kid--Ichabod is kind of a dick.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.560
I mean, we look at what he wants to do, he wants to marry this woman, and mainly get her money.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.700
I mean, he's already fantasizing her father being out of the picture.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.600
- "Ah, the old gold cat take it with him, and when he cuts out, that's when I cut in."

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.260
-I think a lot of people, when they look back, think of Ichabod Crane as just this innocent that gets killed by the Headless Horseman, but no.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.060
He was actually sort of a bastard.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.860
Which, for Disney, is kind of interesting.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.480
It's one of the few times where you actually have sort of a jerk be your lead.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.220
In fact, you could make the argument that Brom Bones, though he's bit of a bully, is much more of a good guy.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.560
I mean, he doesn't do anything really wrong, or at least not as wrong as Ichabod.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.740
And for all we know, maybe he'd make a better boyfriend. Who knows?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.600
But of course the part everyone remembers is the built-up appearance of the Headless Horseman.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.920
-"Yaaaaahahahaha!"

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.100
-By god, that laugh is cool.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.880
I think it's one of those rare times that a lot of kids found themselves both scared and laughing at the same time.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.220
The climax is a lot of fun that way. It's sort of like "Evil Dead 2."

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.820
In fact, I'd be shocked if director Sam Raimi didn't take a lot of the atmosphere and tone directly from this cartoon.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.960
-[perilous music plays through "fwoomp" sound effect]

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960
-"Yaaaahahaha!"

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.080
-It's just your classic ghost story with a classic ghost-story ending.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.060
And the two seem to go actually pretty well together.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.740
Both take advantage of that fact that it's cinematic and they can get a lot of fun angles.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.840
And they also stick true to their stories, as well as taking some creative liberties.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.180
Whenever anyone thinks "Wind in the Willow" or "Sleepy Hollow," these are the usually the first two versions that come in mind.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.400
And that's probably not so bad.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.440
It's good to read the originals, of course, but these are pretty good adaptations.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.120
It's heavy on the dark, but also big on the laughs.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.800
Either one is great on its own, but back to back, they work just as good.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.680
-[singing] "You can't reason with a headless man!"

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.240
-"Man I'm gettin' outta here."
