like maybe the father is the warden but
I'm<00:02:29.160><c> thinking</c><00:02:29.520><c> some</c><00:02:29.790><c> prisoner</c><00:02:30.210><c> okay</c><00:02:30.900><c> I</c><00:02:31.650><c> don't</c>

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking some prisoner okay I don't
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.490 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking some prisoner okay I don't
know<00:02:32.430><c> that's</c><00:02:32.610><c> just</c><00:02:32.760><c> my</c><00:02:33.000><c> guess</c><00:02:33.060><c> but</c><00:02:33.540><c> so</c><00:02:34.380><c> they</c>

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
know that's just my guess but so they
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.810 align:start position:0%
know that's just my guess but so they
had<00:02:34.620><c> so</c><00:02:34.860><c> they</c><00:02:34.890><c> had</c><00:02:35.070><c> to</c><00:02:35.160><c> figure</c><00:02:35.310><c> out</c><00:02:35.460><c> how</c><00:02:35.580><c> to</c><00:02:35.610><c> get</c>

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
had so they had to figure out how to get
 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.850 align:start position:0%
had so they had to figure out how to get
there<00:02:36.060><c> I</c><00:02:36.090><c> tell</c><00:02:36.330><c> it</c><00:02:36.480><c> if</c><00:02:36.990><c> he</c><00:02:37.200><c> makes</c><00:02:37.380><c> the</c><00:02:37.620><c> guess</c>

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
there I tell it if he makes the guess
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 align:start position:0%
there I tell it if he makes the guess
it's<00:02:38.160><c> always</c><00:02:38.370><c> gonna</c><00:02:38.520><c> be</c><00:02:38.700><c> like</c><00:02:38.880><c> the</c><00:02:39.000><c> opposite</c>

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 align:start position:0%
it's always gonna be like the opposite
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.210 align:start position:0%
it's always gonna be like the opposite
what<00:02:39.720><c> is</c><00:02:39.900><c> usually</c><00:02:40.380><c> well</c><00:02:40.530><c> maybe</c><00:02:40.740><c> he's</c><00:02:41.010><c> this</c>

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
what is usually well maybe he's this
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.630 align:start position:0%
what is usually well maybe he's this
it's<00:02:41.580><c> gonna</c><00:02:41.760><c> be</c><00:02:41.880><c> the</c><00:02:42.150><c> opposite</c><00:02:42.630><c> usually</c><00:02:43.200><c> so</c>

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be the opposite usually so
 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.620 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be the opposite usually so
that's<00:02:44.640><c> my</c><00:02:44.790><c> guess</c><00:02:45.030><c> I</c><00:02:45.150><c> could</c><00:02:45.360><c> be</c><00:02:45.450><c> wrong</c><00:02:45.570><c> maybe</c>

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I could be wrong maybe
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.810 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I could be wrong maybe
I'll<00:02:45.870><c> surprise</c><00:02:45.990><c> me</c><00:02:46.350><c> be</c><00:02:46.560><c> exactly</c><00:02:47.340><c> what</c><00:02:47.580><c> they</c>

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'll surprise me be exactly what they
 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.460 align:start position:0%
I'll surprise me be exactly what they
say<00:02:48.000><c> it</c><00:02:48.120><c> is</c><00:02:48.150><c> it'd</c><00:02:48.630><c> be</c><00:02:48.780><c> weird</c><00:02:48.840><c> surprise</c><00:02:49.170><c> but</c>

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 align:start position:0%
escape from the Citadel yeah my guess is
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
escape from the Citadel yeah my guess is
he<00:04:07.560><c> made</c><00:04:07.709><c> it</c><00:04:07.890><c> um</c><00:04:08.959><c> so</c><00:04:09.959><c> yeah</c><00:04:10.140><c> it's</c><00:04:10.470><c> uh</c><00:04:10.620><c> I</c><00:04:11.100><c> think</c>

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 align:start position:0%
he made it um so yeah it's uh I think
 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 align:start position:0%
he made it um so yeah it's uh I think
it's<00:04:12.209><c> a</c><00:04:12.299><c> pretty</c><00:04:12.450><c> solid</c><00:04:12.600><c> start</c><00:04:13.019><c> I</c><00:04:13.140><c> think</c><00:04:13.200><c> it's</c><00:04:13.500><c> a</c>

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 align:start position:0%

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.050 align:start position:0%
that's right no your idea
so<00:13:57.300><c> maybe</c><00:13:58.079><c> of</c><00:13:58.500><c> all</c><00:13:58.709><c> the</c><00:13:58.920><c> primes</c><00:13:59.250><c> it</c><00:13:59.699><c> still</c>

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
so maybe of all the primes it still
