00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To get the entry for China, we need to select

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the first element of countries that's indexed at position 0.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
To get the population, well, that's the third element of that list,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so that's the entry at position 2.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
To compute the multiple, we need to divide that by the same value

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for the entry for Romania, and when we run this,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we see that the population of China is approximately 64 times

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the population of Romania, and I should point out

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that this is integer division, so this is not the exact result.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If we looked at actually multiplying 21 by 64,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the result that we get is 1344, so 1 billion 344 million.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But the population that we get for China was 1 billion 350 million.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If we wanted a more exact answer, we need to use floating point division.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We could do that by changing the values in our list

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to make one a floating point number.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Adding a decimal point would be enough.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now when we run it, we get a more precise answer.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Of course, these populations are just estimates,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so the answer of 64 would probably be a better answer to the actual question.
