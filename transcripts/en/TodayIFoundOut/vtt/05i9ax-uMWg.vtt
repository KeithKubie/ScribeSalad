00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.960
Becoming a Background Actor, or “extra”
as they are more widely known, is a fairly

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.309
simple process that usually involves little
more than responding to an ad.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.370
Depending on the scope of the project and
the kind of extras needed, this ad could appear

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.460
anywhere from a dedicated website to Craigslist-
we even found examples of casting directors

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
using Facebook and Twitter to round up extras
quickly in a pinch.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.129
For the professional extra (and yes, these
are a thing), they may even have an agent

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.879
who helps them book gigs to sit, stand, or
walk in the background of some scene in a

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.559
movie for barely more than minimum wage in
some cases.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.130
Of course, if they are a career extra, they
tend to be members of SAG-AFTRA and earn a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.620
much more respectable amount, on the order
of around $175 per work day, plus more if

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.170
a given shoot lasts more than 8 hours, which
isn’t uncommon.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.530
There are also a slew of other ways money
can be tacked on in a given day’s work,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.760
like letting the filmmakers use your car in
a scene or maybe bringing your own needed

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.829
props, like a baby stroller.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.599
Similarly, if you are required to smoke during
a scene, required to get a certain haircut

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:38.399
or wear a substantial amount of body makeup,
if there is a delay on a meal break, etc.,

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.609
you get additional pay bumps.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.599
On top of this, if you have a special skill,
for example are good at tennis and a given

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.829
scene needs people competently playing tennis
in the background, you can expect a small

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.000
pay bump for this.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.060
(For a full list of the many and surprisingly
specific ways you can get pay bumps, and exact

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.459
dollar amounts, do go read, as we did in all
its glory, SAG-AFTRA’s absolutely riveting

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.950
56 page “Handbook for Performers Working
as Background Actors.”)

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.940
Moving on from pay, it’s almost universally
true that the food provided on sets is amazing.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.069
As one veteran extra, Dawn McHargue, noted
of the fare on the set of Iron Man 3- “We

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.819
had anything you could think of: the best
steak, shrimp, lobster and crab.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.350
The buffet table, you couldn’t see the end
of it.”

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.560
That said, as in all things on the set, even
when the extras’ buffet table looks like

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.200
something from the most opulent of aristocratic
parties, the talent get the best food of all,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.740
and an extra trying to eat from that table
is likely to get a swift, and occasionally

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.020
harsh, rebuke.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.620
As for how easy or hard it is to get a gig
as an extra, if you’re patient and have

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.590
a flexible schedule, this doesn’t seem terribly
difficult from all accounts we’ve read.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.200
What is difficult is getting enough work to
make a career out of it, though there are

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.060
a select few who’ve managed this.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.400
For most, however, it tends to be more of
a hobby.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.950
For others, they try to use it as a way to
break into the industry.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.250
However, it’s noted that this almost universally
won’t get you far, other than the value

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.110
in getting to observe the film making process
up close and personal.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.660
The most important thing about landing a gig
as an extra invariably is your look.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.820
As such, good, representative photos are generally
needed when applying for a given gig, along

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.260
with your body measurements and the like.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.380
As different productions have different requirements,
what look is being sought out can vary wildly.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.530
That said, a running theme is that most films
and TV shows are looking for decidedly nondescript

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.670
looking people to fill out scenes.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.370
The reasoning being, of course, that a person
who stands out in some significant way could

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.870
prove to be distracting.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.260
Another thing that might get you passed over
as an extra for a certain scene is if you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.920
happen to resemble one of the principal actors.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.790
As one pro extra, Amy Rogers, stated “On
Homeland, you’ll never see them place anyone

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.080
near Claire Danes who has the same hair color
as her.”

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.100
Of course, if you’re an established extra
with a good reputation and you happen to resemble

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.150
a given lead actor in various body features
and the like, you may ultimately leverage

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.470
that to being used as a stand in- the people
who are used in place of an actor for the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.060
purposes of setting up the scene.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.120
The great thing about these gigs is that they
pay a lot better and, for example when talking

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.280
a TV show, if you do a good job might mean
a regular gig you can do for potentially several

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.330
years for a nice steady paycheck.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.810
Going back to people who have a little more,
shall we say, “unique” look, a silver

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.739
lining of standing out is that you could potentially
still be a bit actor, as films and TV shows

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.349
are occasionally in need of people with a
specific “look”.

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.530
Of course, the problem here is that such casting
calls are seldom kind or tactful- they know

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.990
what they want, and they are looking for someone
who doesn’t mind unabashedly flaunting what

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.919
they’ve got in that way.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.030
So, for example, if you’re extremely overweight
or grotesquely ugly by conventional standards,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.890
the best advice of others in this position
is to grow very thick skin if you also want

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.890
to make it in the industry.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.550
That said, while there are exceptions, this
doesn’t seem to be much of a problem for

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.730
the type of people who apply for these roles,
as one such individual, Jesse Heiman noted,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.880
“I’m never going to be the prom king,
I’m not going to be the quarterback of the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.200
football team, I’m the lovable loser…

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.620
Maybe you get on the underground over there,
or you get on the bus, and there’s some

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.810
strange person who you wouldn’t want to
talk to – I get to play that guy….

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.700
In this town, even if you’re being talked
about in a negative way, it’s better than

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.650
not being talked about at all.”

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.490
On the other end of the spectrum, contrary
to what you’d expect, being extremely attractive

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.700
won’t usually bolster your chances of scoring
a gig as an extra.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.930
Again, they don’t want someone who will
distract the audience watching at home.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.754
As with all things, there are exceptions to
this, of course.

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:29.690
For example, a scene in, say, a strip-club,
will likely feature a handful of very scantily

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.090
clad extras of the extremely attractive variety.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.830
Again, the running theme here being horses
for courses.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.949
Speaking of animals, this all brings us around
to what it’s actually like being an extra

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.430
on a set.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.420
In a word- boring.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.880
In three words- mind numbingly boring.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.860
In six- mind numbingly boring and occasionally
degrading.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.250
You see, among the lowest on the hierarchy
of a set is almost always the extras.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.000
While, as ever, there are plenty of exceptions,
with the likes of George Clooney having a

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.720
reputation of doing his best to combat the
poor treatment of extras on set and otherwise

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.440
embodying the “good guy” persona, in the
general case you can expect to be treated

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.110
as disposable cattle most of the time.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.390
In regards to the filming process itself,
extras, like children in a stereotypical British

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.360
household, are expected to be seen and not
heard.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.650
Beyond it being strictly forbidden to talk
to the talent or distract them in any way,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.990
even in off time, in order to keep the various
sounds in the film as isolated from other

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.740
noises as possible, the mics are usually targeted
at only recording the voices of the talent.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.310
Virtually all background noises are then added
in post-production.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.310
In addition to background chatter, this includes
noises you aren’t even expected to notice,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.540
like the ruffling of the main character’s
clothes as they walk or the clink of a cup

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.320
being placed on a table.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.060
This is generally one of the more difficult
things for extras to get good at as many people

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.270
find it unnatural to make silent vocalisations
without overcompensating by moving their eyebrows

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.590
too much or otherwise trying to use body language
to make up for the fact that they aren’t

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.860
making any noise when fake talking.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.460
To avoid this, beyond being conscientious
of body movements, some extras practice nonsense

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.450
phrases they can repeatedly mouth to one another.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.320
For a little fun, pay attention to talking
extras in the background next time you watch

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320
a movie.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.800
You can almost always spot the newbies from
the veteran pro extras because of things like

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
this.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.419
On that note, because most sounds are added
in post-production, scenes involving parties,

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.250
dancing, or cheering crowds are an especially
surreal experience for extras, as the set

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.500
is almost always completely silent while filming,
other than the talent doing their thing.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.389
This poses another unique challenge for extras
who are required to dance to a song they can’t

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.979
hear, in time with other people listening
to the same, non-existent song, all while

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:46.979
pretending to ignore whatever the main actors
are doing.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.449
And with cheering crowds, extras must be extremely
careful not to actually make any clapping

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.750
noises while they clap and otherwise raucously
cheer silently.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.000
For those attached to their phones, it should
be noted that smartphones and other such devices

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.310
are largely banned from TV and movie sets,
at least when talking about extras.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.040
Extras also are generally required to sign
non-disclosure agreements right off the bat,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.360
barring them from talking about what they
saw on the set at all, particularly on social

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360
media.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.610
Ironically enough, that means this was almost
literally the first rule on the set of Fight

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.610
Club.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.750
It’s also important to note here that a
given shoot might easily last 10-15+ hours,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.400
during which the extras are mostly to be found
waiting around for someone to tell them what

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400
to do.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.449
This could mean sitting or standing quietly,
sometimes for hours at a time, and, at best,

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:34.029
whispering with other extras, or in many cases
required to keep completely silent.

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:37.490
When not required to be in a given place,
extras generally congregate in some designated

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.029
area away from the important people, where
they read, chat, play cards, or otherwise

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.719
find any way possible to stave off boredom.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:48.430
Beyond being boring, in some cases the life
of an extra can also be extremely uncomfortable.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.580
For example, if a scene is supposed to be
in the winter, but it’s actually the summer

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.070
and 100 degrees outside in balmy southern
California, they’ll nonetheless require

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.300
you to wear appropriate winter clothing and
jackets for outdoor scenes, and vice versa

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.480
in the winter when a scene is supposed to
be in the summer.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.630
Speaking of clothing, while certainly period
pieces with large budgets may provide the

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.339
necessary wardrobe, in most cases extras are
required to bring their own clothing appropriate

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:13.470
for a given scene.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.559
A savvy veteran extra may even bring a suitcase
with a variety of clothing just to make sure

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:20.730
they have exactly what’s needed to get in
a given scene

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.870
Going back to the general case, extras are
usually expected to wear mostly unremarkable

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.660
clothing featuring muted colors that won’t
stand out on camera.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.120
Also important here is that the clothing must
be devoid of visible logos or branding.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.240
This is mostly due to the fact that showing
brands or logos on screen usually requires

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.980
someone, somewhere to sign off on them appearing
on screen, but can sometimes be because the

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.980
production has a deal with a specific brand
or manufacturer.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.819
To maintain continuity between shots, extras
could, and in most cases will, be expected

00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.699
to wear the exact same outfit multiple days
in a row if a scene takes multiple days to

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:59.540
shoot, with some directors going as far as
to have pictures taken of individual extras

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.440
to ensure their outfit and hair remains the
exact same between takes.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.639
In the end, if you don’t mind crappy pay,
uncertain and irregular work schedule, long

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:12.560
hours of mind numbing boredom, repetitively
doing the same thing over and over and over

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.490
again, and generally being treated like something
the directors found stuck on the bottom of

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.949
their shoes, you too can enjoy the benefits
of amazing catering and potentially being

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:26.939
barely visible in the background of a given
scene of a movie for a few seconds.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:32.009
Or, if you’re really lucky, as one Jon Porter
noted of the pinnacle of his Background Acting

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:36.499
career, in which he got to play a dead German
soldier who the protagonist of the film had

00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:37.499
killed,

00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:40.660
It’s inevitably the stunt guys who have
the fun of actually getting into a fight.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.579
The moment they die, however, it becomes the
humble extra’s job to lie on the ground

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:47.790
and play their corpse for the rest of the
shots in the scene.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.230
So that’s what I did for two weeks of my
life.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.959
I [laid] on the ground, outside, in the middle
of February playing a corpse in a major motion

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:55.959
picture.

00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:00.620
It was simultaneously the least and the most
glamorous thing I’ve ever done in my life.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.230
Still, we guess there are worse ways to spend
an afternoon than eating phenomenal, free

00:11:05.230 --> 00:12:44.569
food while occasionally catching a distant
glimpse of Ryan

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:57.149
Reynolds

00:12:57.149 --> 00:13:44.769
who is, of course, dreamy.

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:48.749
Because of the high price of paying a crowd
of thousands of extras, for most films and

00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:54.699
TV shows where such is required, these are
almost always digitized audiences or a group

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:58.499
of extras shot such that they can be overlayed
to fill out a stadium.

00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:02.699
Cardboard cutouts are also commonly used interspersed
with real people, though tend to stand out

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:05.029
if the camera is moved during the shot.

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:08.550
For these cases, another option available
for the director wanting something particularly

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:15.499
realistic looking are inflatable extras which,
yes, are a thing and if you watch closely

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:43.559
can be occasionally spotted interspersed with
real people

00:14:43.559 --> 00:15:02.769
in crowd scenes.
