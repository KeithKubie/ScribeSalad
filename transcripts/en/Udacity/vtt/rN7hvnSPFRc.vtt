00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.073
To answer this you had to remember that 8 of squared is the proportion of

00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:08.026
explained differences and this is the sum of squares for between group

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:15.110
variability divided by the total sum of squares. Which is just summing up these

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:27.674
two. This gives us 5.45 divided by 5.45 plus .836. This is about .87. 87% of

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:32.744
the differences between tumors reductions can be explained by the different

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:34.660
treatments.
