1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,620
Okay. So then if we can introduce this,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,430
how would you convince the many
people listening to stay listening?

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,160
Cause it's a great story. It doesn't
matter that it's figure skating.

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:14,760
It's like a really good story. It's
a good story that like pops off of.

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:18,810
It's like, Hey, I'm Jad, I bring Ron,
I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and La.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,510
I've never been a huge
fan of figure skating.

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,480
But like this story I think asks
a really interesting question.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,680
The question would be,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,270
what if you with all your heart
wanted to be the best at something,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,020
but the persons who judge, what's the
best at this? Something you want to do,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,720
don't share the best with
your sense of business.

12
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,960
So you do your best and their best and
your best are different and now you can't

13
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,290
best it out. What do you do? What do
you do? Story comes from our producer,

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,850
Latif Nasser and also producer
Tracy Hunt. Okay. Okay. Okay.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,880
All right. Okay, so let's
start then. So okay,

16
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,881
so we're starting in 1998 we're at
the Olympics in Nagano in Japan,

17
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,950
Japan. And so we've seen
warming up on the ice.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,990
You have this woman, this figure Skater
Serea Bonnelly how do you spell? Yeah.

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,970
S. U. R. Y. A. She's French,
24 years old. She's flat

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,940
less than five times European
champion, but all sorts of problems,

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,220
particularly injury problems.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,790
She's got an Achilles tendon that's
been stitched together, hold a muscle.

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,010
He's on painkillers and [inaudible]

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,660
he did for France in 1994
and just missed the podium.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,650
Never metal with the
Olympics before. This is her,

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,210
probably her last go, um,
in, in front of the world.

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,283
But France,

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,810
there is Suria bodily and it was during
this performance that's [inaudible]

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,250
fondly did something that had
never been done by anyone.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,180
Anyone ever. And you
could either see it as a,

31
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:53,010
as a kind of middle finger to the
establishment, like this huge SFU

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,113
or

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,240
just this beautiful moment
of self affirmation.

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,110
[inaudible]

35
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,030
what'd she do? Uh, we'll get there. Hello.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,410
Hello. How are you doing? Pretty good.
Thanks. I laughed out loud when I,

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,020
when I heard you say that you would
call me on your Zamboni break.

38
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,940
I know it was like this.
The only time. Okay.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,550
So to really understand just the context
of all this and the stakes of that,

40
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:30,710
that moment, we got to go all
the way back. So. So how did you,

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,260
how did you first get into skating? Well,

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,400
I did start skating
because of my mom actually.

43
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,590
So Suria was actually adopted as a baby
by this white couple in the south of

44
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,670
France. She grew up in Nice.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,940
My mom was a sport coach
and she was able to be a,

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,880
like a volunteer for a
gymnastic club and skating club.

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,160
So even though I was
small, tiny, tiny, um,

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,070
she just put me on the eyes
and say, hey, just hang around

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,020
and chill on the ice and you know,

50
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:07,021
and I spend lots of hours there just
waiting for my mom and one day I go find

51
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:08,630
out that's a hat, you know,

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,810
some skidding boots who fit
me. And she started skating.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,510
Yeah. Fortunately I was good at it.

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,480
Pretty soon she had a
coach from the local ring,

55
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,360
I guess a coach can have called and
having a meeting with your parents. Say,

56
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,330
Hey, you know, it'd be nice if you
could come like two times a week,

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
probably may now. We'll be nice. We'll
do maybe four times a week. Well,

58
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,800
how about every day it was
like, okay, here we go.

59
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,590
And so by the age of 10 she decides she
wants to spend her life figure skating.

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,480
It was my dream to, you know,
to do it. And I know I can.

61
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,030
So she would go to these ice
shows like holiday or nice.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,740
So when this is a show, I love
being, I love showtime and just,

63
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,810
you know, those fantastical students,

64
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:56,190
she would see all these famous skaters
dotting my i's guru on those skaters.

65
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,340
They would just be flying through
the air. It was like amazing.

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,120
And she would go to practice and she
would practice all of the things she saw,

67
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:03,470
all the,

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,980
the double axles and the triple pill loops
and speed jumps and that sal cows and

69
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:12,560
the double sal cows and the, you know,
quadruple double the triple action.

70
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,550
Do you have any idea what you're
saying right now? No, no, no.

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,600
These are all just words to me.
It was very fast that every week,

72
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:24,050
every month you can see a difference.
And speaking of difference, you know,

73
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,690
if we fast forward a little bit

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,360
and here she is on the world
stage, sorry, urban la in 1989

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,540
when she appears at the world champion,

76
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,630
the thing that becomes
really apparent is that

77
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,580
she is different. Yeah.

78
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,740
Because I was black so I was like
people like what? Oh, French black.

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,800
So I'm black and I definitely
remember when she was a baptist skate,

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,330
my mom would be like, the
black girl was skating.

81
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:57,260
So we all had to like pay
attention. And so people saw to whom

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,250
you can of curious, this girl is
very different than Oh, it was, um,

83
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,220
it was arrested. That's done at Howard.

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,340
He new writer for espn.com Obama Lee is
a striking and exotic figure on the ice.

85
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,220
She, you just arrested your
eyes when she skated. The,

86
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,510
the contrast of her skin
on the ice was beautiful.

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,590
[inaudible]

88
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,790
and then there were these fanciful stories
that sprung up about where she came

89
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,180
from.

90
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,750
We are now taking you about as far away
from the skating world as possible.

91
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,470
Pretty much as soon as she hit the scene
and you started hearing these rumors

92
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,471
that she had been adopted from a coconut
strewn beach in reunion island off the

93
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,730
coast of Madagascar

94
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,450
and unlikely place to find it.
World-Class figures, candor. Right. And

95
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,630
that she had, um, that she,
what was it though to us here,

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,300
here that she never cut her hair,
cut her hair since her birth,

97
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,390
that she existed on a diet of bird seed
and you know, all these things. Yeah.

98
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,430
Id like 60 some kind of black
forest princess or exactly. Exactly.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,230
Yes. Suria says, you know,

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,420
at that age she really didn't know
too much about what was going on.

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,040
I know as a kid I was like, whatever
my coach deal, it's, you know,

102
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,470
he's the one who speak English.
See, you're barely speak English.

103
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,120
She was barely 16. She wants to
live a young baby. I, you know,

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,760
I did talk to the Guy who
was coaching her at the time,

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,670
this guy named DDA Guy Gay and,

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,740
and he told me he planted these stories.
We use the press very well. Wait, what?

107
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,870
He said that he made up the beach thing.

108
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,980
He made up the hair thing because
he was trying to, she was a star.

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,510
And what are you willing to hear
stories, right? So we made some stars,

110
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,460
some good ones. Do you know what I mean?

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,150
I'm just saying that we making up
stories because you want to hear them.

112
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,540
That is just creeped out. Yeah, you're
absolutely right. It's Shitty as hell.

113
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,230
I can kind of see where he
was going because what he
was trying to do with that,

114
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:55,010
he was trying to present her to the
world as this like radically new kind of

115
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,310
skater because female
skating at that moment

116
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,760
where Nice, cute girls,
especially for ladies,

117
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,470
they like to keep the girls
parading hours for Catarina.

118
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,660
So it's famous skater like Katharina
with the ravishing Karina or Sonya Haney

119
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,980
is, we're like totally like
woman, you know, pretty graceful.

120
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,120
Who makes those men's, you know crazy.
When you were watching it's, you know,

121
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,200
they were also,

122
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,520
why would I say they?

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,910
They had a certain
conception of females. Katie,

124
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,010
we didn't have the same one and it
wasn't just that she looked different.

125
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,240
She also skied it different. Lee,

126
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,870
it was a totally different
approach. Suria was always very like

127
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,880
[inaudible] explosive
ladies and gentlemen. Elvis
Stojko is in the building,

128
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,720
retired world figure skating champion
and met three at junior's 1990 for me it

129
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,050
was sort of a new, a new face on

130
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,210
same part is the the like the fresh
stick of Yom tiny 15 year old French girl

131
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,730
who's captured everyone's
imagination here.

132
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,780
Say a Tonya Harding style skating.

133
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,380
She was just so exciting and there
was just no boundaries for her.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,210
This is Tonya Harding and she and surreal,

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,230
the strength and the power.
She'd step on the ice and yeah,

136
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
people were crazy too. Yeah.

137
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,630
She strike a pose and then just take off.

138
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,320
Suria would go from one end to the other
speed across the ice line across the

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,520
room with powerful stroking, her opening
at triple lights in a triple tall.

140
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,990
She comes early into these jobs,

141
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,950
soaring through the
air with powerful spin,

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,920
NTT jump back jump.

143
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,550
That really was a cool combination
after combination other dreadful,

144
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,100
I prefer to hit a triple, triple jump.

145
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,800
Then just to do a pretty spray goal
and she would attack everything.

146
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,220
That's a very first step.
Secrets she had the stepping,

147
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,110
the gliding through running. Okay.

148
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,970
She had an all talent and the crowd here.

149
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:06,804
I appreciate it

150
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,800
is such jumping ability and there's
no end to what she might achieve.

151
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,020
Side of competitions. You could
do these ice shows and exhibitions

152
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,470
and that's when you would see
like what she can really do.

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,370
Just do all kinds of other jumps that
weren't even allowed in competence,

154
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,060
you know, didn't backflips
she would do that. Yes.

155
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,930
That slips very first time that I ever
saw her do a back flip. I mean I just,

156
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:33,830
my mouth just dropped open. That's
tiny Harding again. I was like,

157
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:36,530
how did you do that? Because
it's really dangerous.

158
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,890
Elvis Stojko told us that one time
he tried it and it did not go well.

159
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,630
I came down right on my face and I split
my eye open and almost broke my neck

160
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,580
and I was just like, you know what?

161
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,890
I don't think this is going
to be a good thing. You know,

162
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,340
this little teenage girl
cerea bodily, no problem.

163
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,690
Just doing it like it was
nothing. Absolutely fearless.
And the crowd loved it.

164
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,713
People like

165
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,890
Dunlop is south making noise and
tubs or fits into the ground.

166
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,940
I can feel the lugs, a whole
grueling building. I'm like,

167
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,800
I swear it looks like an earthquake, but

168
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,231
here's what happened.

169
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:13,280
And this is where things kind of get
confusing as Syria blows up and all these

170
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:18,281
people who never liked figure skating
fall in love with her over and over,

171
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,120
the judges don't artistic impression.

172
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,680
And you just see disparity
from the judges and the crowd.

173
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,593
You're not like the mark

174
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,360
subset. No doubt. Even when
she doesn't get high scores,

175
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,710
no tears begin to flow happen
all the time. I escaped. Good.

176
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,020
But somehow I, it's not for me.

177
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,043
[inaudible]

178
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,060
so the judging system and figure skating
goes from zero to six and on Syria's

179
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,330
artistic marks,

180
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,980
she would get scores like five
zero five zero five ones. Yeah,

181
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,650
you get your low fives, which
like sounds like it's a good mark,

182
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:58,484
but that's not a good,

183
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,720
there he is. What did
you think of those Meyer?

184
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,780
Very, very disappointed.
[inaudible] never mind.

185
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,860
What'd you say there? She said,
nevermind. That's life. I'm used to it.

186
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,880
I fought it. Sue Sports sports
mean challenge every day.

187
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:21,050
I try to do the best that I could
do. You do your best is fine,

188
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,710
but clearly there were some
times where I got hurt.

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,790
There was this one time we
found on youtube where she,

190
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,140
she boozed the judges after she
gets her score crowd is bullying.

191
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,510
Well we said why was she getting bad
marks to begin with? What was the,

192
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:39,530
what was the problem? Well, that's the
question and it's kind of complicated.

193
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,370
I think there's several things.
I'm Janet Howard, that ESPN writer.

194
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,030
She says, the first thing you got to know,

195
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:51,770
and just to take a quick little dive into
the Weirdo world figure skating bucks

196
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,040
dive, is that there's this

197
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,700
fundamental tension in the sport of figure
skating between artistry on one side

198
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,430
in athleticism on the other and
powerfulness [inaudible] readiness.

199
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,190
They want these people to
look like little ballerinas,

200
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:11,020
but leap into these jumps like
predators. And at the time,

201
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:16,000
skating was sort of locked in this loud
and fractious debate about what do we

202
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,860
want to be. And Suria was sort of
the epitome of almost the end point.

203
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:25,861
What could happen if somebody
with unrivaled athleticism
and no aversion to risk

204
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,420
was willing to go after it.

205
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:31,090
And I think there were a lot of
people in skating that didn't want it.

206
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,880
I went through it. I know all about it

207
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,690
now. Tonya Harding, she said
that she had this issue.

208
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,740
I didn't want to skate like what they
wanted skating to look like Elvis Stojko

209
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,810
to butt. In Maria's case,

210
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,690
there's a lot of work to be done on the
choreography yet there's a lot of work

211
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:49,200
to be done on the grace. Oh those
words used to criticize her skating.

212
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,670
There's a lot through to who fixed.

213
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,740
I'd like to see your stop jumping
for six months in women's escape.

214
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,150
We're just a little bit more loaded.

215
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,070
They would say things like, oh,
we're all tied up in a different,

216
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,550
it's a lot of raw talent but it's not a,

217
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,440
it's not fully kind of
hasn't been refined and,

218
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,580
and it's for us like non skaters.

219
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,330
Like that's been one of the challenges
of this story I guess is like trying to

220
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:15,420
see like is that a legit criticism?

221
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,840
Alright. Is this just a way
of saying that sees black?

222
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:25,130
They chose racism. I have the courage
to say it because she was black.

223
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,550
So this is Marie Ren Laguna and she is
a former French figure skating official.

224
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,360
And She was part of a team whose job
it was to decide which girls to send to

225
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,400
the, uh, world junior championship.

226
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,190
And then we have to choose to only two
girls. And we had three possibilities.

227
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,250
She said that she backed serea and
the majority of the people didn't,

228
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,490
didn't want them. Black Skaters. Um,

229
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,820
were they saying it out loud?
Look, we don't want somebody,

230
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,320
we don't want her because she's black.
It was very [inaudible]. In fact,

231
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,450
according to her, what
they would say, she,

232
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:02,570
they would say the kind of things like
she was too muscular or she wasn't

233
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,140
elegant enough. Oh yes. I have
to say that's word. Elegance.

234
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:09,830
Many times I have heard that
word and she's got to elegant.

235
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,460
Marie [inaudible] is an outsider in the
figure skating world these days because

236
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,050
of an unrelated scandal.

237
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,020
And so we weren't totally sure
what to think about that. But wait,

238
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:20,960
how did Ceria feel about
all this? Well, I asked her,

239
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,800
did you feel like any of the difficulty
was because you're black? No,

240
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:29,510
I feel like any of it was about
race. No, no, no, no, no, no.

241
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,100
But then moments later she said,

242
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,570
well, you know, when you block, you know,

243
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,040
everybody knows that you have to do
better than anybody else who's white.

244
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,250
Well, I think the idea that
she was held back in Martin,

245
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,970
her marks for any other reason other
than the quality of your skating,

246
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,040
I think is incorrect.
That Sandra, I'm been

247
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,910
involved in the skating world my whole
life as a competitor, as an Olympian,

248
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,840
a commentator,

249
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,230
and actually as a commentator I'd like
to see him stop jumping for six months

250
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,910
and living to skate. She was
kind of hard on Syria. Yes.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,490
And when we asked her why,
this is what she said,

252
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,970
everything about skating
is built on circles.

253
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,350
The radius could be huge,
but it's still a circle.

254
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,150
Everything is about edges and leaning
into those edges and leaning into the

255
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:25,140
turns and and carving
massive circles on the ice.

256
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,940
And that is our sport,
which leads to Syria.

257
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,430
I mean if you watch your jumps there,

258
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,050
they were on straight lines and
if a jump is on a straight line,

259
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:42,051
then it can't land with flow because the
idea is to land your jump with as much

260
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,120
speed and flow as you had going into it.

261
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,440
And that's something that she couldn't
do because she was jumping on straight

262
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,250
lines.

263
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,330
And then the other thing about skating
that you don't necessarily get on camera

264
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,690
is the sound of the edge,

265
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,160
the sound of, of a beautiful
skater going from edge to edge,

266
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,880
from lean to lean. What
does that sound bad? It's,

267
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,500
it's a beautiful sound. It's a
sound that we all love. It's a,

268
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:20,740
it's a, it's a gentle carving. Um, image.

269
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,190
Clean sound in my head is
like, like a hockey stock.

270
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:27,030
But that's probably not the, no, no,
no, no, because there's no there.

271
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,780
I can tell you there are
no scratches. It's a glide.

272
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,140
It's just a, it's a ham. I, Gosh,

273
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:42,430
I wish I had a good word to describe it.
And there are different sounds. I mean,

274
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:46,060
like there's the sound of Brian Boitano,
his back crossovers that, you know,

275
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,150
used to like excite me when
I was in the rink with them.

276
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,960
But then there's also sort of
the gentle, almost soundless,

277
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,870
um, quality of say a UK Asato
or a Katia Gordeeva, um,

278
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,300
where they're like a whisper across
the ice. And yet they're, you know,

279
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:09,190
flipping from one edge to another
edge. Um, and, and forward to backward.

280
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,940
And it's almost,

281
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,190
it's just that this glide, um,

282
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,070
I haven't got a good word for it.
Yam. So when, when Suria was skating,

283
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,880
would she have that
sound? No, she would be

284
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,433
scratchy

285
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,741
male, we should say.

286
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,890
That wasn't the sound of Ceria
skating or any of those other people.

287
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,030
We just like miked up a whole bunch
of like pretty good finger skaters.

288
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,160
Were they professional
skaters? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

289
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,470
These are legit scares figure skaters.

290
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:46,040
And we sent the clip to
Sandra and she was like, yes.

291
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,130
So she gave you the thumbs up that
we get it right? Yep. Let's see.

292
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,370
I don't necessarily hear whatever
it is she is hearing and think. Yes.

293
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,610
I mean they sound different but
not even that different really.

294
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,060
So that's exactly the problem.
Uh, ice skating is largely

295
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,430
about aesthetics. So as
far as sports go, it's,

296
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:05,420
it's like kind of in its own category.

297
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,260
Like if you're talking about Serena
Williams who's facing a lot of these same

298
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:11,870
kinds of criticisms, it doesn't matter.

299
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:16,100
There's a line on a court and it's either
inside or outside, there are rules,

300
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,970
whereas there aren't these rules.
When it comes to beauty, it's,

301
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,470
it's super slushy

302
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,680
and that makes someone like
Sareah much more vulnerable.

303
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,980
So. So what ended up happening?

304
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,630
Well after a couple of years of getting
these kinds of marks, does she eat,

305
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,700
does some soul searching?

306
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,850
I mean I was a bit more mature in 1992
at the age of 18 I had new curl grad

307
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,890
changed my whole skating walls, you know,

308
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:46,430
I change cultures and she
decides to take the note.

309
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,270
She actually travels to California and
works with Frank Carroll who's like this

310
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:54,650
legendary American coach. And what
she's doing is that she's trying to,

311
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,930
you know, be more graceful,
more beautiful, more elegantly,

312
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,220
more circley. Yeah.

313
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,090
And after that you kind
of see a difference.

314
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,730
You can watch the youtube
videos from that period and it,

315
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,000
it's like she's a different skater,
Huh? Yeah. Does it work yet?

316
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,220
In 1993 in the world championships,

317
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,140
she comes in second and then by the time
1994 rolls around, she is a favorite.

318
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:22,160
She is, she is probably gonna win.

319
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,530
And what happens? Things
take a really strange turn.

320
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,520
We'll be back right after
the same buddy break.

321
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,370
[inaudible] [inaudible]

322
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,370
hi there. This is Kirsten
recording from Orlando, Florida.

this is Radiolab. Uh,

327
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,760
let's get back to our story about Suria
bodily or Bernali as it said in French

328
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,230
from producers, Tracy Hunt and
lot of Nasser. I, I was, I was,

329
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,910
I'm really curious what,
what happened at that,

330
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,900
at that metal ceremony in 1994, um, oh,

331
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:33,670
as a Walsh in between the world champion,
not the Isaacs. Yeah, no, no, no, no,

332
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,130
no. Well, we had this water
and been shipped in Japan,

333
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,680
seven Olympic titles,
17 world championship.

334
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,743
Just to set this up,

335
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,860
the world championships or the second
most important event in figure skating

336
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,230
after the Olympics and
at the Olympics. Richard,

337
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,540
just a month before the top three ladies,

338
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,070
16 year old Oksana Baiul Oxana
by Yoga Gold Nancy Kerrigan.

339
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,350
It's just fancy care. Again, got silver.

340
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,540
10 Lou got the bronze and
fourth plays with Ceria.

341
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,350
Now those top three ladies, Oxana,
Nancy Lou out of the picture,

342
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,970
out of the picture for various reasons
and juries and some turn pro and stuff,

343
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,920
but whatever the point is at these
rural championships, the the,

344
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,800
the highway had been cleared for
Maria. She was going to take it.

345
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,563
It was hers.

346
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,240
Take us through her winning
season. Will it be gold? So jumping

347
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,570
forward to the final day of the
championship, Suria is in second place.

348
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,800
She takes the 80 years old from
Nice in the south of France,

349
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,910
starts their program.

350
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,070
[inaudible] immediately starts with
this double axle that's very incredible.

351
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,400
After that is just triple,
triple, triple, triple, triple.

352
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,740
And that man was still [inaudible].

353
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,560
It was just one of the best skates
of her life. I knew I did my best,

354
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:55,470
I did everything.

355
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,480
It was not perfect because
nobody's perfect but pretty
good come to competition

356
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,730
overall. Eventually after
about four and a half

357
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,933
minutes,

358
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,220
she finishes her skate or you're going
to lay the ball days for seasons loads

359
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:11,860
and loads of technical difficulty.

360
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,540
The question is how will I see
her artistic effort goes over,

361
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,620
ah, off to the side, to a bench with
her coach, um, to await her result.

362
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,740
[inaudible]

363
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,380
technically called narrow and
some five nines at plays or

364
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,650
those are as high as any we've seen.

365
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,300
When she gets her marks, she
jumps into first place and, and,

366
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:43,980
and there's only one skater left.

367
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,070
It's a skater who usually
finishes below I in competitions.

368
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,350
You could sato again, that's Sandra
Bezac. We all know you could skate it.

369
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,350
She's the kind of scary that puts a smile
on your face. And UCO was, you know,

370
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:02,370
one of these really lyrical
skaters making his return.

371
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,620
Elvis Stojko and Yuca had it had this

372
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,410
very beautiful style and
grace give her skating

373
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,830
gentle, almost soundless quality
like a whisper across the ice.

374
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,450
Basically heard skating style was the
exact opposite end of the spectrum from

375
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,823
Syria's

376
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,170
Todd, the 21 year old from Tokyo. This is

377
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,350
so she gets up

378
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,760
[inaudible]

379
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,120
what does her final skate
in front of the home crowd?

380
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,940
You guys, one of my favorite skaters,

381
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,470
but she doesn't have the
combination jump like finally did.

382
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,020
So she's going to need all her jumps
opening up in their triple lips and she,

383
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:41,660
it's

384
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,230
first gen crowd loves
it. Should it go? She,

385
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:48,800
she had maybe less triples than me,
but she was maybe poor, prettier,

386
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,070
and in her routine there were these
moments where it just looks like she was

387
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,590
just sort of skipping across the ice.

388
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,480
Just very balletic moves.
I know she's good and all

389
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,960
they stand as one here at Mako Hari
Events Center for the local favorite Yuca

390
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,543
Sato.

391
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,520
Now it's down to the judges as to
whether the gold metal belongs to Sato of

392
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:18,500
Japan or Bono. Leo France.
You could, you know,

393
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,590
get off the ice. She goes to wait for
her marks. First marks, of course,

394
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,450
her technical merit bone Elise

395
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,250
soco stated in jumps so well and every
one of those marks except the finish

396
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:35,600
judge goat Juke Bona. She wins
eight out of nine technical merit.

397
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,510
But when it came down
to the artistic mark,

398
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,710
it's just the opposite.
Then the technical marks,

399
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,090
eight or nine judges all but the
French judge giving her higher marks.

400
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,500
Those go to you. Casada
this is going to be close.

401
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,750
It actually ends up being a tie.

402
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,670
So it goes to being a
tiebreaker and that's been the,

403
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,410
the judges basically pick first,
second and third. And in a five,

404
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,244
four decision,

405
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,433
she's

406
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,730
[inaudible] world champion for sure.

407
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,280
The trues Hearn ought to the dressing
room or the new champion, she'll be back.

408
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,720
And so will we.

409
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,090
What happens next is one of these moments
that really defines serious story for

410
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:25,300
a lot of people. So what happened was that

411
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,543
right,

412
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,570
right after all the results were
out, they set up the medal ceremony.

413
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,010
They called out the skaters,

414
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:37,480
they first called out Yuca she comes
out from this tunnel backstage onto the

415
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:38,314
ice.

416
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,240
What a moment wades smiles at everybody.

417
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,640
And then after about a minute,

418
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,530
we had one about the silver medalist.
He called out Syria [inaudible]

419
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,930
and where is the European champion? All
the cameras crowding around. And uh,

420
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,110
she didn't come out, not
immediately, a late arrival.

421
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:05,070
And here she comes,

422
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,680
she skates out onto the ice. She
waves but her face isn't smiling. No.

423
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,590
And then when she gets to the
podium, she congratulates you.

424
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:19,591
Casado but then finally has
chosen not to stand on the podium.

425
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,990
She just stopped before
getting on the podium.

426
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:25,630
She just stood right next to the podium.

427
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,850
I think this is a form of protest.

428
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,740
I really hope she doesn't go
to with this. You wouldn't

429
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,610
stand on it. She was crying. Elvis
actually was in the crowd watching.

430
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,960
I felt bad for her cause I know what
she was going through where you know,

431
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:44,190
you out skated your competitor and
they just wouldn't give it to you.

432
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,540
And I was like Sareah just get
on the podium. Take the metal.

433
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,750
The international skating union
presidents hold off the a ticker skating

434
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,020
official who's giving up the
metals he gives you good.

435
00:26:57,021 --> 00:27:01,410
The gold puts it around her neck,
but then when he turns to, yeah,

436
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,760
he just sort of stands
there. Looks at her.

437
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:09,930
He says something but you can't hear
what it is. She shakes her head.

438
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,890
He puts the metal around
Sabrina's neck, shakes her hand,

439
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:18,030
and then he holds onto her hand and just
kind of like, he's her onto the podium.

440
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,450
This is a first

441
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,510
she takes off the metal. Yeah,

442
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,150
sure. She, she takes the
silver metal off of her head

443
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,290
like, oh my God, Holy Shit, he's
actually doing this. It was huge.

444
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,060
It was a huge, it was a huge deal.

445
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,640
The camera zooms in on her face
and she is just weeping. Oh,

446
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,200
what's going on inside that young man?

447
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,293
Yes.

448
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,400
[inaudible] so after the
medal ceremony is over,

449
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,640
she just gets mob

450
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,440
by report. Why did you not accept
the metal? What was the problem?

451
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,210
Because men, my face

452
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,010
[inaudible] they unfair
to use sir. Yeah. What I,

453
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,110
the judges unfair to you today?

454
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,490
Do you feel you were robbed
tonight? Is that what you're saying?

455
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,730
Did you deserve the gold medal? Syria.

456
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,120
And eventually what she says is,

457
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,660
I'm just not lucky.

458
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,930
I'm just not lucky.
What, what was going on?

459
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:38,230
Like what happened? You had a feeling
it was more like a point I'll say,

460
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,680
is this, is it? Stop now. You know,
and you put your, your face on, on a,

461
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,330
on a table. Is it okay? No enough
is enough. That's it. And say, Hey,

462
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,930
you know, I'm not dumb and I'm just
getting sick and now I'm sick of it.

463
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,790
I keep my eyes open is that it's not
fair. We has asked has to stop. I know.

464
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,820
It was just so depressing
and it was so not fair.

465
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,300
Mostly it was not fair
and about, it felt unfair.

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,400
Joseph Suno up and over and over
so many times. That's every time.

467
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,880
It's never me because whatever I can
do, how many triple I can be pretty.

468
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,360
It can have as the best choreographer I
can show everything was made to be on a

469
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:16,440
top and still I'm like, what do you
need more of me to do at this point?

470
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,800
You know how many troubleshoot all you
want me? If I don't, do you kill me?

471
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,150
And if I do, you don't care
in any way. You took somebody,

472
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,210
you choose somebody else.

473
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,550
Don't you think that that's a little
unsportsmanlike? Yeah, totally.

474
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,980
Absolutely. Yeah. But if she,

475
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,170
all these other girls have been worked
just as hard as she has one presumed.

476
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,930
Sure. But okay, so picture yourself.
If you're at that position, you're,

477
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:42,130
you're in that position. You
find yourself second second.

478
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:45,540
You feel like you're not, you're not.
She came in second. That's always,

479
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,520
so the margin was so close. It
was so close. I think it is close.

480
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,300
Yeah.

481
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,630
Can I like it? Yeah. Yeah. Google. Um, I,

482
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,480
I just more like felt
empathy for her, for her.

483
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,460
I can't imagine what
it must be like. Well,

484
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:06,300
I can't imagine what it must be like,
but I, you know, in that kind of,

485
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:11,301
on that scale to be the
only one and there is this,

486
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,280
um, I think for, you know,

487
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,960
a friend of mine once told me that
racism can make black people crazy,

488
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,313
which is very,

489
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,090
very broad way of looking at it in the
sense that you kind of almost never know

490
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:31,470
why people are reacting to you
the way that they do. And it's,

491
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,310
and it's kind of, you're
always sort of second guessing,

492
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,220
you know, was that, you
know, did, did, did they, oh,

493
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,540
that guy just came in and he
said hi to everybody in the room.

494
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,790
But he did say to me, what
does that, what was that about?

495
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,250
And so there's no obvious
thing about it, but it,

496
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,160
it can make you feel a little
paranoid, a little crazy.

497
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:56,980
Now, I cannot put myself, I can't
imagine what, how, you know,

498
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,400
Suria felt in that moment, but I didn't
necessarily like think that, you know,

499
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:06,450
these prejudice people had denied her
this. If anything, I felt more like,

500
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,890
man,

501
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,890
it Maly must suck to be the only black
woman skating at that kind of level and

502
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:18,561
not really understand why things are
happening or maybe it must be like a very

503
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:25,000
confusing situation to
be in. And that is, and,

504
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,930
and it was more like empathy.
I don't know, you know, if, if,

505
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,820
if it, there was racism, quite frankly.

506
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,210
UCO Saddo is an amazing skater. Yeah.

507
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,520
Well I think you're right.
It's very legitimate

508
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,630
to feel like you can't quit
your finger on this feeling,

509
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,160
which

510
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,100
never goes away. No. And never

511
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,200
resolves and is always there
and always makes you feel weird.

512
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,240
Happens. What happens after the A,

513
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,430
that's our producer Matt Kielty after
the ceremony. I think the, I think the,

514
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:00,781
the,

515
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:04,910
the rep that she got after this moment
was that she was a sore loser and that

516
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:09,830
she was defiant, that she had
a bad attitude. And does she,

517
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,890
uh, quit at this point or
no, she keeps going. She,

518
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:16,380
she competed again in the real
championships in 1995 the very next year.

519
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,960
And she came in second again,

520
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,470
again for three years in a row in
a similar pattern. Was there like,

521
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:24,500
just the one sort of,
that one wasn't as close,

522
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,990
but she was second again
for the third year.

523
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,300
She's getting a lot of other
competitions after 95 or

524
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,610
I think the various, you know,
European championships, you know,

525
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,813
Skate America. So

526
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,040
yeah, she was doing a lot or she never
wins. Not The Olympics. Not at the world

527
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,410
championships. No. So she
never gets first. Oh, what?

528
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,180
I guess it depends on how you define
first. What do you mean? Oh, you'll see.

529
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,200
So that actually takes us
right back to the beginning.

530
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,220
We're here

531
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,210
live at 10:00 AM on Saturday
morning in Japan. So to be forward,

532
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,710
rewind, we're in Nagano,
Japan, 1998 Winter Olympics.

533
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,550
I knew he was my last
Olympics, last major, major,

534
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:12,530
big competition and everything was fine
until the day before the short program.

535
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,050
I, uh, I pull a muscle,

536
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,400
her left leg, and I couldn't
lift. I couldn't do anything
to make matters worse.

537
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,510
Ceria at that moment was
already recovering from a
ruptured Achilles tendon.

538
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,250
People had to leave to carry me to walk
stairs because I couldn't get stairs.

539
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,500
So they'd have to lift me to go
to my room because, you know,

540
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,160
at the Olympic village I couldn't
walk. You know, even I'm broken,

541
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:42,030
I'm damaged. I'm like, used cars as
ready. Good. Good for like for trash. Oh.

542
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:46,490
Like, you know, Raleigh, I was so messed
up between my legs and my Achilles.

543
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,300
I was like, no, it's the
disaster. And the doctors say,

544
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,110
maybe we should withdraw. I'm like,
no, I'm already here. You know,

545
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:58,070
I don't want to dress. Maybe retires.
My, probably my last completion.

546
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,310
I don't want to just retire like that.
Just to give them anything you can. Yeah.

547
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,810
I have to keep going. And so on the
final day, she says that she, you know,

548
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,790
between Medici massage, acupuncture
appeals, she goes back out on the ice

549
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,440
that is now getting ready
to skate for her country.

550
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:19,090
She's in this golden blue sequined
outfit and she starts her routine.

551
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,770
You can tell she's favoring one
leg, but she manages to land.

552
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,190
The two jumps didn't work.
Can you say, okay, then

553
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,273
false.

554
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,910
She gets back up, keeps
going through her routine.

555
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,270
There's the triple sale
code, and then she says,

556
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,360
she just got to this point where
she just knew she couldn't do it.

557
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,100
It was so much in pain and
Josie and I was a program.

558
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:50,850
I was supposed to go to more triple
and I say, no, what? I'm not good.

559
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,690
I don't feel it. I know I'm gonna
crush. Um, I can do, I'm not capable.

560
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,640
My leg is not with me anymore.

561
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,660
And then what comes to her is that
there is this move that she has in her

562
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:03,300
repertoire that you can
do, but it's illegal.

563
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,020
[inaudible] a special thing in my
backpack and say, Hey, I can't do it.

564
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,393
It's my last,

565
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,270
it's my last come to show this all going
through your mind as you were skating.

566
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah. Oh yeah, totally. You know me,

567
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:17,070
it's like a computer who know if I would
have missed something or jump as, okay,

568
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:20,730
here I can fit a triple here. Obviously
I can do a combo triple, triple.

569
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:23,010
I know I need to fit something.
You're like the GPS lady.

570
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:26,130
You're like recalculating. Yeah,
totally rerouting. Okay. Renewed.

571
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,560
Do we have to know right
now? So in her rerouting,

572
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,750
she turns around from skating forwards.

573
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,490
The skating backwards picks up speed
just like she's about to do a triple. But

574
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,053
yeah,

575
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,490
she does eat backflip but
not any old back flip.

576
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,490
She's swings one leg over.

577
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,360
Does the splits in the air
upside down? Yeah. And then

578
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,650
lands on one foot.

579
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,450
[inaudible] stop. When you do

580
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,680
the backflip, do you go, do your skates,

581
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:06,430
go up towards the ceiling and then
come back down underneath you?

582
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,770
[inaudible] why? Why was it illegal? Well,

583
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,380
it's illegal because
it's so dangerous. Um,

584
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,100
also she says you're supposed to
land all your jumps on one foot,

585
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,060
but she did that here. Oh. Like, oh well
good. You did. I don't want full toll.

586
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,820
Just hold, hold on. Just one. Just hold.

587
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,320
And she couldn't be like totally illegal
because say as long as land on one

588
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,140
foot, maybe we'll be, we will finger about

589
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,740
[inaudible] the program
with your back to the judges

590
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,180
and you know, usually is
it you skate, you perform,

591
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:47,890
you can smile in front of the camera.

592
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,890
But what it gives you as a mark next
scary for me took like 10 minutes.

593
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:54,480
Seriously. 10 minutes. People feel
about what should we do? I was like,

594
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,090
oh my God, they didn't know what to
do with me. And I'll say whatever.

595
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,930
Just put a zero and so
we can move on. Yeah.

596
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,830
Here are the marks that you
get mailed. Absolutely. Four,

597
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,370
eight, five two she knew.

598
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,580
How do you get noted and Olympic
competition do a backwards.

599
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,650
So they didn't change their mind
about the back flip in the end. Nope.

600
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,090
So she ends up finishing 10th I'd
like, yeah, I finished in. That's okay.

601
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,553
You go here

602
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,880
now afterwards,

603
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:26,881
a lot of people interpreted that backflip
as a big fat middle finger to the

604
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:32,760
entire skating world. I know
you don't want me to, uh,

605
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,300
but I'm going to do this anyway.

606
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,160
But when I asked Ceria if
that's what was happening, she,

607
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,930
no, I don't know why people keep
saying [inaudible]. You know,

608
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,020
I was just trying to be happy.

609
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,150
She said she just wanted something
that was hers. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

610
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:54,090
Had anyone ever done this back?
Flip onto one blade before? No. No,

611
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,100
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm the one who created this one.

612
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,520
That's why he's calls
a Bonelli. Oh, that's

613
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,260
[inaudible] anyone who did it. Wow. Yeah.

614
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,780
You're the first person in the history
of the human race who has done that.

615
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:11,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So
knock on wood, I hope, you know,

616
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,120
I'll be able to die in peace. Don't
steal my backflip is mind my bad. Yeah,

617
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,780
let's, yeah, it's mine.
So I'm just curious,

618
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:24,290
like what has happened since
this story ended? Well, uh,

619
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,590
she retired from figure skating
after the 98 Olympics. Um,

620
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,560
she continues to do ice
shows like occasionally,

621
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,130
but right now I think the main thing
that she's doing is she's coaching.

622
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,550
She lives in Minnesota and she's
coaching skaters. Yeah. But,

623
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,600
but like when we asked
people like, oh, did she,

624
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,200
did she change the sport? Did
she change figure skating?

625
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,310
The answer they would keep
giving to us was no, no,

626
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,040
she did a lot of you were like, you
know, it's not like all of a sudden,

627
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,190
you know, figure skating
rinks across the country,

628
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,390
across the world are flooded with little
black girls learning their sock howls

629
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:05,590
in their letters and things like
that. I will say from my, from,

630
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,250
from what I can tell for the
first time that there are,

631
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,730
there's more than one black
skater competing at the
same time internationally at

632
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,790
least, uh, backflips or their back
lips. They no, no back, no back. Sadly.

633
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,960
Are they still illegal? They are
still illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

634
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,520
So, um,

635
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,760
she was just this sort of like almost
this sort of blip on the skating scene

636
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,650
where she was just, you know,

637
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:40,651
no one was like her before and there
hasn't really been anyone like her since.

638
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,020
But, but there is this kind
of ironic thing I guess,

639
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:47,650
which is that if you took her and, and,

640
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,960
and you put her in competition today,

641
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:53,200
if she was competing on
the world stage today,

642
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,310
she would probably do better
than she did back then.

643
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,930
They've changed the, the, the,
the scoring system. So, so now,

644
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:02,590
um,

645
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,000
you get points for doing the kinds of
power moves that she was doing way back

646
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:11,110
when and, and even if you, if you
spill, even if you fail at those moves,

647
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,140
you still get points. You get
points for trying. Yeah. Just for,

648
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,170
for daring and surreal
was uh, was, was daring.

649
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,880
She was a Derrer

650
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,310
pretty sure lots of Nasser

651
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,020
and Tracy Tracy spent the last few months
with us producing that story as part

652
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:42,870
of the deputy NYC fellows program.
Tracy, we won't miss a lot.

653
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:49,810
[inaudible]. The piece

654
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,030
was produced by Matt Kielty, original
music from Matt and also from Dylan Keith.

655
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,830
Special thanks to Vanessa Riley,
