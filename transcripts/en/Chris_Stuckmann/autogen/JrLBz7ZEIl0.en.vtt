Neeson's character I thought it was an

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
Neeson's character I thought it was an
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670

felt like a human being for various
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950
felt like a human being for various
reasons and for that reason I latched

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
reasons and for that reason I latched
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840

of their wrong ways but it has the
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.860
of their wrong ways but it has the
serious dramatic

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
serious dramatic
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.960
