00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.630
So far, we have two methods in our class. We have add friend, and un-friend.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.480
Now, since John and Maria are no longer friends, John went on a friend adding

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.090
binge. He forgot who was in his friends list because there were so many of

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.390
them. We need a method to get all the friends in John's friends list. For

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.170
example, it might return Ann, Fred, Barney. What is the public interface for

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.020
the method that lists friends? If you need a hint, think about what the method

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.805
call would look like.
