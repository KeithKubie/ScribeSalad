00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.072
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:04.021
we started to construct
a space-time diagram

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.994
for my frame of reference

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:08.061
and I'm just drifting through space

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:10.569
and I'm assuming that I'm in
an intertial frame of reference

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:12.496
which means I'm moving
at a constant velocity

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:15.027
relative to all other frames of reference

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.348
and we set up a situation where

00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:19.995
I emitted a photon right at time zero,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.714
so after one second, it would have moved

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:23.409
3 times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.570
After two seconds, it would have moved

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.543
6 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:27.913
and then we had a,

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:30.305
we added a little bit of flavor

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:31.930
to our little scenario

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.647
where right at time zero,
a friend passes me up

00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:36.713
in her spaceship and she is traveling

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:39.732
relative to me in the positive-x direction

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:41.728
at half the speed of light,

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.352
and so we plotted her
path right at time zero.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:45.606
Her spaceship is right there.

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:46.906
I could draw the spaceship.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:48.207
It's at the origin.

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:49.901
Then after one,

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:51.341
after one second,

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.937
she would have traveled

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:56.168
1 1/2 times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:57.654
After two seconds, she would have traveled

00:00:57.654 --> 00:00:59.465
3 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:00.881
so this blue line in the last video

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.414
was her path.

00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:03.993
But now I want to make
it even more interesting.

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:05.873
Let's assume that we have
actually a whole train

00:01:05.873 --> 00:01:09.496
of spaceships, all traveling
in the positive-x direction

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:11.887
at the same velocity as her spaceship.

00:01:11.887 --> 00:01:13.884
So this is her spaceship right over here,

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:16.067
at time equals zero,

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:18.389
she is exactly where I am,

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.105
but let's say that 3 times
10 to the 8th meters in front

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.218
of her, there's another spaceship,

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:26.051
traveling at exactly

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.952
1 1/2 times 10 to the
8th meters per second,

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:34.085
so they're traveling at the
same relative velocity to me,

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:35.849
but if you think about it, from
each of their point of view,

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.591
they would seem to be stationary,

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.077
because the distance between them,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:41.213
in this x-direction is
going to stay the same.

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:43.372
So this person, at time
zero, is going to be

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:46.437
3 times 10 to the 8th meters
in the positive-x direction

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:47.343
from me.

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.990
Now, if I were to wait two seconds,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.197
they are going to be,

00:01:51.197 --> 00:01:54.192
so if I were to wait two seconds,

00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:55.214
they are going to be,

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:59.161
they are going to be 6
times 10 to the 8th meters

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.413
away from me, because they're going half

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.271
the speed of light,

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.059
and so I could draw their path

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.845
and I'm going to do it
in a slightly more muted,

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:10.562
thinner color, so that we,

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:12.558
what I'm essentially
going to be doing here

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.484
is I'm setting up gridlines for

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:19.431
my friend's alternate frame of reference.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.241
I'm going to put that on
top of my frame of reference

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.727
and to be clear,

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.025
I'm not assuming special relativity.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.813
I'm assuming a Newtonian world,

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.183
classical mechanics.

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:31.157
Just to get familiar with these ideas

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:34.825
and to see where the Newtonian
world is going to break down

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:36.288
but let's say that's not the only ship,

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.356
let's say there was another ship,

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:40.491
that at time equals zero is
6 times 10 to the 8th meters

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:42.697
away from me in the positive x-direction.

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:44.415
Well, where are they going to be?

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:47.782
Where are they going to be after

00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:49.105
two seconds?

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:50.104
Well, after,

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.566
let's see, after one second,

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.469
they're going to be 1 1/2
times 10 to the 8th meters

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.723
further.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:03:00.499
Then after two seconds,
they're going to be

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.616
3 times 10 to the 8th meters further,

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.891
and then after three seconds,

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.724
after three seconds,
so they're going to be

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:12.718
1 1/2 times 10 to the 8th
meters further than that,

00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:15.481
so their path is going to look like,

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:17.710
so let me draw this.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.146
I'm really just doing these
to show what stationary

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:23.584
objects in my friend's frame of reference,

00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:25.442
how they actually look to me,

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.647
and these should be parallel lines.

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.157
These should be parallel lines,

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:31.780
so that's a pretty good attempt,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.407
and so I'll,

00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:35.054
let me, and so let me actually just set up

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:37.028
that alternate frame of reference,

00:03:37.028 --> 00:03:40.209
so this is going to be not only my x-axis,

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.693
I'm also going to call
this my x-prime axis

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.644
and I'll do it in a
second of thinking about

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:46.455
how we can read this.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.589
So, I can color this
in with the blue color.

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.308
Actually, let me do it
in that light blue color

00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:53.955
that we're going to be
using for my friend's

00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:54.907
frame of reference,

00:03:54.907 --> 00:03:56.323
so this is also,

00:03:56.323 --> 00:04:00.224
this is also going to be
our x-prime axis overlaid,

00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:03.428
and this one, let me call
this the t-prime axis,

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:04.891
so my friend's frame of reference,

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.702
I'm going to call that the
prime frame of reference,

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:07.607
or if I called,

00:04:07.607 --> 00:04:10.881
if I called my frame of reference
the S frame of reference,

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.551
I can call my friend's frame of reference

00:04:13.551 --> 00:04:18.311
the S-prime frame of reference,

00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.074
and so, let me draw
horizontal lines to show the

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:23.327
passage of each second,

00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:26.995
so, that's one second,

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.271
two seconds,

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:31.314
three seconds,

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.543
so on and so forth.

00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:36.352
So let's make sure we're
comfortable with reading

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.373
what's going on here.

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:40.137
So, a point,

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:41.693
let's say this point on our diagram.

00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:42.436
Let me just see.

00:04:42.436 --> 00:04:45.361
This point on our diagram,

00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.705
from my frame of reference,
in the S frame of reference,

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.514
this is the point time is,

00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:52.745
or space,

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:54.045
or my distance,

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:57.342
my distance from the origin
in the positive-x direction

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:59.107
is going to be,

00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:00.570
I just drop a,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.961
I just go parallel to my vertical axis,

00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:04.308
so I'm just going to do that,

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:08.604
and I get 4.5 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:11.715
so 4.5 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:13.364
and what is our,

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.128
so I can write the units there if I want,

00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:17.636
and our time is at one second,

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:18.286
one second.

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.190
So this is our coordinates from,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.883
this is the coordinates
from my frame of reference,

00:05:22.883 --> 00:05:24.346
from the S frame of reference,

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:25.670
I guess S for Sal,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.202
and so, what would be the frame?

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.549
What would be those same coordinates

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:30.313
from my friend's frame of reference?

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:33.587
Let's say her name is Sally, or S-prime.

00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:35.515
Well, from her frame of reference,

00:05:35.515 --> 00:05:37.581
our time is still one second.

00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:39.044
We see the horizontal line there.

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:42.016
We're just going parallel
to our horizontal axis

00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:43.084
or our x-axis

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:46.172
so the time is still one second,

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:47.263
but her,

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.632
the distance that the,

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:53.765
or the x-coordinate is 3
times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:57.131
3 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:05:57.131 --> 00:05:59.453
and I really want you to
sit and think about this

00:05:59.453 --> 00:06:01.752
and even take out a ruler
and draw this on your

00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:04.167
own paper and feel good about this.

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:05.978
Now, why does this make sense?

00:06:05.978 --> 00:06:09.182
Well, this, you could
view this point as where

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:10.598
that second spaceship was

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:14.453
after a second, and from
Sally's point of view,

00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:16.241
from the S-prime frame of reference,

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.564
at time equals zero,

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:20.379
that person, that ship was
3 times 10 to the 8th meters

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.351
in front of her, and after a
second, that spaceship is still

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.603
3 times 10 to the 8th
meters in front of her.

00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:26.764
After two seconds, it's still

00:06:26.764 --> 00:06:29.806
3 times 10 to the 8th
meters in front of her,

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.522
and so from her point of view
and her frame of reference,

00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.542
it is stationary,

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.539
so the way to read this for any point,

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.234
if you want my frame of reference,

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:40.092
you, the time is easy,

00:06:40.092 --> 00:06:42.158
you just go horizontally to either one,

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:45.246
so on her axis, we've essentially
just taken the coordinate

00:06:45.246 --> 00:06:47.545
axis and sheared it and skewed it.

00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:48.961
This is still one second,

00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:51.097
this is two seconds,
this is three seconds,

00:06:51.097 --> 00:06:53.768
but it turned all of these kind of a grid

00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:57.459
of squares if I were to draw
a grid for my coordinates

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.969
into a bunch of,

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.243
into a bunch of parallelograms

00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:04.054
which we see right over here,

00:07:04.054 --> 00:07:06.840
and so for any given point in,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.255
remember we're thinking of Newtonian space

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:11.089
and time,

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.504
to read it, we go horizontally for time,

00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:14.990
in either case,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.149
but for me, you would go straight down

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.239
because my time axis is vertical.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.120
You go straight down and
you read where it intersects

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.442
the x-axis to figure out our position

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.835
but from her frame of reference

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:28.294
we move parallel to her t-axis,

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:30.036
or her t-prime axis, I should say,

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:32.334
to get what her x,

00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:35.144
I guess we could say what
her x-prime coordinates

00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:38.464
are going to be, so this
is x-prime, t-prime.

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:41.552
This is x and this is t.

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:43.619
Now, what's clear, at any given point,

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:45.244
at any given point,

00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:49.424
t is going to be equal to t-prime,

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:52.419
or we could say t-prime is equal to t,

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:53.324
either way,

00:07:53.324 --> 00:07:56.830
but what's the relationship
between x-prime and x?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.851
Well, let's think about that for a second,

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.285
so when x is 4.5 times
10 to the 8th meters,

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:07.047
x-prime is 3 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:08.626
and so it looks like,

00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:12.712
it looks like x-prime
is going to be equal to

00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:16.311
x minus, well what's it going to be minus?

00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.867
It's going to be minus

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:22.867
1.5 times 10 to the 8th meters

00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:28.641
but that difference is going
to grow as time goes on,

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.729
meters per second times,

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:34.956
times the amount of
time that has passed by,

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:36.071
and you should see that

00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:37.951
because after one second,

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:42.061
after one second, the difference
is 1.5 times 10 to the 8th

00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:44.592
meters, after two seconds,

00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:46.403
after two seconds, so
let's look at this point

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:47.703
right over here,

00:08:47.703 --> 00:08:51.372
in my frame of reference,
that person is sitting at

00:08:51.372 --> 00:08:55.691
6 times 10 to the 8th meters
in the positive-x direction,

00:08:55.691 --> 00:08:57.455
but in Sally's frame of reference,

00:08:57.455 --> 00:08:59.104
in the S-prime frame of reference,

00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:03.051
they're still at 3 times
10 to the 8th meters

00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:04.816
in the positive-x direction,

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:06.929
so we'd multiply two seconds

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.436
times 1.5 times 10 to the 8th

00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:12.664
so we have 3 times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:14.777
so we take 6 times 10 to the 8th

00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:15.798
which would be that.

00:09:15.798 --> 00:09:18.097
We subtract out 3 times 10 to the 8th

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:20.581
and we get the coordinates in S-prime,

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:22.346
so this might get a little bit confusing

00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:25.550
and the key here is really
try to draw this yourself

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.083
and really try to plot points

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.335
and think about how they
are different coordinates

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.980
in the different frames of reference,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.513
or different time-space
coordinates in the different

00:09:34.513 --> 00:09:36.481
frames of reference.
