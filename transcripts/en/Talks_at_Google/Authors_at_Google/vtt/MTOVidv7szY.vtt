00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.724
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.172
AMY GALLO: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:11.630
And thank you so
much for everyone,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.780
for making the time, both in
the room and on the livestream.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.210
So as Rachel said,
this is my book.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.710
I wrote it.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.030
It came out, actually, the
same day as Rachel's book.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.922
Our books are twins, I
like to think of them.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:26.630
And I'm going to tell
you about the book,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.800
main concepts in the book.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.440
But before I do that, I want
you all to do something.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.420
I want you all to think.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.630
Think about the time that you
had a conflict with someone.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.110
Maybe it was at work.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.540
Maybe it was your boss.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.790
Maybe it was your
parent, or your spouse,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.650
or your teenage kid.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.930
And maybe it was this
morning, or maybe it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.750
was last week or
maybe last month.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.130
Now I want you to
think about how

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.379
that conflict made you feel.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.420
And I want people to shout
out just the one word.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.019
What's the one word that
describes how you felt?

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.310
AUDIENCE: Stressed, frustrated.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.750
AMY GALLO: Stressed, frustrated.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.680
AUDIENCE: Unheard.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860
AMY GALLO: Unheard.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.090
Irate.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.039
Did I hear that right?

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.319
AUDIENCE: Angry.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.027
AMY GALLO: Angry.

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:10.530
OK, I tried to beautify
it up a little bit, irate.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.250
Anything else?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.750
AUDIENCE: Dismissed.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.687
AMY GALLO: Dismissed.

00:01:14.687 --> 00:01:15.270
AUDIENCE: Sad.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.500
AMY GALLO: Sad.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.294
I did this talk once and
someone said strangled.

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:21.710
And I was really concerned
about how they handled conflict

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.110
at their organization.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.580
What I've never heard when
I've asked people to do this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.930
is energized, excited,
invigorated, respected.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.380
And that's because this is the
natural human response when

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.560
we get into a conflict.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.250
Conflict is when we feel
threatened, our identity,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.260
our resources, our needs.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.990
We're having needs and
wants that aren't being met.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.970
And we have a natural
of stress response.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.380
So we end up having
our heart rate go up,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.140
we have higher levels of stress.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.490
We lose access to the
prefrontal cortex.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.330
We go into what Dan Goleman
calls amygdala hijack.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.070
And we're just not making
good, rational decisions.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.640
Now I believe that it
doesn't have to be that way.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.669
I believe that organizations
should and need

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.740
to have disagreements
and conflicts,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.140
but most often,
they're handled in ways

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.990
that are unprofessional
and unproductive.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.440
And that's because we don't
have the skills to have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.550
productive disagreements.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.580
And more importantly,
we've gotten to this place,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.700
both in our organizations,
but in our country,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.640
certainly, at large, that
disagreement actually

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.520
equals unkindness.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.390
And this is something
that's really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.160
detrimental to
human interaction.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.620
So I'm on a personal mission.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.540
Why I wrote this
book is that I want

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.030
people to think of
conflict and disagreement

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.260
as a normal, healthy,
productive part of interacting

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.770
with other human beings.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.130
And when we disagree
with compassion, empathy,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.350
and kindness, it has lots
of positive benefits.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.200
But unfortunately,
what's happening

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.110
is the exact opposite.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.100
People are becoming
meaner to each other.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.330
This is a chart that
comes from Chris Porath.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.790
She wrote a book called,
"Mastering Civility."

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.900
I highly recommend it.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.720
She studies uncivil
behavior at work.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.700
What she's seen is that over
the last 20 or so years,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.160
people are reporting more
and more rudeness at work.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.620
So this is a number
of people who

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.160
report someone being rude
to them at work in the last,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.590
at least once, in
the last month.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220
So we're getting
meaner to each other.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.830
And this has its costs.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.710
A 2008 study done by CPP,
which is the people who

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.790
create the Myers-Briggs
test, a study that

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.020
showed that on average we're
spending 2.8 hours a week

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.670
dealing with conflict at work.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.200
Now that's a lot of time.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.410
And I imagine, since the study
was done, about 10 years ago,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.560
that it's actually gotten worse.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.250
And that same study equated
this with $359 billion

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.780
in paid hours.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.820
It's even worse if
you're a manager.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.670
A study by the American
Management Association

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.570
showed that the average
manager is spending 18 to 26%

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.620
of their time.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.090
Now full disclosure, this
was a study done in 1976.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.060
This is the study that's
most cited around how much

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.230
managerial time.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.920
I would posit that we
actually spend even more.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.760
And I've seen more
recent surveys

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.980
that show some managers
report spending up

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.000
to 40% of their time
dealing with conflicts.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.860
This also leads to
performance issues.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.460
So 65%, a study by the
Penn Behavioral Corporation

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.420
found that 65% of problems,
performance problems,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.410
are linked to strained
relationships.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.820
So it's most often what's
happening between people

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.720
that's causing these problems.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.330
So we're being mean to each
other, It's taking up our time,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.430
it's costing us
money, it's leading

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.080
to performance problems.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.780
What are we to do?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.310
Now first and foremost,
we have to embrace

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.320
conflict as not a negative.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.890
If you said to me I work
in a conflict free office.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.900
I would say that
sounds pleasant,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.240
but probably not
very productive.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.000
So we have to embrace conflict
as a normal, healthy part

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.880
of organizations.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.790
Now all of these stats that
I've just reported show that--

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.830
have led to what Bill
Fisher and William

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.530
Ury, who wrote "Getting to Yes,"
they're the Harvard Negotiation

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.380
project, said conflict
is a growth industry.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.830
This is a quote from their book.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.140
Now this is great news for
me as a conflict expert.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.960
This is bad news for
the rest of the world.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.450
So what we need to
think about is, first,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.050
like I said, embrace conflict
as a normal, healthy part

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.970
of interacting with people.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.070
And think about the
positive outcomes

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.700
that come from conflict.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.600
First and foremost, more
successful work outcomes.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.300
If I see a project one way,
and you see it another,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.980
and we have to discuss our
different opinions to come

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.190
to a solution, chances
are the work outcome

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.630
is going to be better.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.520
If marketing is
pushing for one thing,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.710
and sales is for another,
that natural tension

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.040
in organizations is going to
make the end product better,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.200
even if it's slightly
uncomfortable, or very

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.450
uncomfortable for the
people in the process.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.300
Second of all, you
have the opportunities

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.680
to learn and grow.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.100
The more that you are forced
to think about your position,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.499
to articulate why you
disagree, what your points are,

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:32.040
the more you're going to learn
about what's important to you,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.530
the more you're going
to expand as a person.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.650
Third, you're going have
improved relationships.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.000
Now I have a
10-year-old daughter.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.090
She understands
this intuitively.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.980
She came back from a sleepover
a few weekends ago and told me,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.250
she had the best time.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.333
And I said, great, why did
you have the best time.

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.584
She said Sophie and I
fought the entire night.

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:54.000
We fought about
what movie we were

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.030
going to watch, we fought about
what time we should go to bed,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.917
where we were going to sleep.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.750
I said that doesn't
actually sound that fun.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.900
She said, no, but
now, we're back BFFs.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.470
So she understood when you
go through a tough situation

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.230
with someone, when you have
to do all that negotiation,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.190
you end up having
a stronger bond.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.640
And the research shows this
is true at work as well.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.960
And lastly, that leads to
the last positive outcome

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.430
that I'm going to talk about,
which is job satisfaction.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.150
So if you feel like you can
disagree with your colleagues,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.520
if you're not walking
on eggshells, worried

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.010
that a disagreement
is going to come up,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.070
you're much more
satisfied at work.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.770
Now how do we get these
positive outcomes?

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.150
That's what my book does.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.630
It takes research from
neuroscience, emotional

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.960
intelligence experts,
management science,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.120
and makes, sort of
boils it down to a very

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.760
practical,
straightforward approach

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.440
into how to handle conflict.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.630
So what I want to share
with you today from the book

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.210
are some tools and concepts
that will hopefully

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.850
make conflict less
stressful for you

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.400
and help you reap these
positive outcomes that I just

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.124
talked about.

00:08:01.124 --> 00:08:02.790
And that's because
dealing with conflict

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.490
is an essential skill in
today's organizations.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.950
Just chatting with a few
of you at the beginning

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.110
here before we got
started, it's clear

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.660
you all know that there are
conflicts on the horizon

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.850
or that you're
experiencing conflicts.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.640
In order to function in
today's organizations,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.230
you must have these skills.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.040
So the first concept I
want to talk to you about

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.300
is that most of us self-select
into one of two categories.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.020
We either tend to avoid
conflict or we tend to seek it.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.350
So avoiders, that's
exactly how it sounds.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.049
Avoiders are people who probably
want to hide under the desk

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.260
when a disagreement comes up,
they really value harmony.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.840
They value relationships.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.470
Anytime things get tense, they
want to back away or placate.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.610
They want things to go smoothly.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.270
Seekers, on the other
hand, are people

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.090
who really lean into
conflict when it comes up.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.670
They're the ones whose
body language is perhaps

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.870
a little more aggressive when
things happen in a meeting,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.590
or in the hallway with someone.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.970
And oftentimes, they care most
about directness and honesty.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.580
Now I self-select as a seeker.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.950
I was the kid on the playground
that when a fight erupted,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.600
I would scream "fight," and try
to get as many people to come

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.100
observe what was
happening, partly

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.180
because I knew that I could
then broker the disagreement

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.740
and see if we could
get to a solution.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.030
But also because I find
uncomfortable situations

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.500
and fights really interesting.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.280
I don't know if anyone's been
listening to the new Esther

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.290
Perel podcast.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.030
She's a couples therapist.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.000
So she's doing-- she
somehow got couples

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.997
to do live or recorded
therapy sessions with her.

00:09:46.997 --> 00:09:49.080
My husband and I tried to
listen to this together.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.050
And my husband, who is
an avoider at his core,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.180
was so uncomfortable.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.070
He was like, how can
you listen to this.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.130
I was like this is fascinating.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.180
I couldn't get enough of it.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.802
I highly, highly recommend it.

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.260
Even if you're an
avoider, it would

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.650
help you maybe do a little
bit of aversion therapy there.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.109
So quick question-- yeah?

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.650
AUDIENCE: What is
the podcast called?

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.584
AMY GALLO: It's called,
"Where Should We Begin?"

00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:15.750
And it's actually, I think
it's just an audible now.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.270
It should be on iTunes soon.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.620
But so I just want
to get a quick survey

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.421
in the room of how many
avoiders and seekers.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:24.045
How many people think
they're avoiders?

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:27.860
I would say about half the room.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.010
And how many people
think they're seekers?

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.520
About half.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.853
And how many think they're both?

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.490
Or neither?

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.150
So it's of course normal
that we would sometimes

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.590
seek and sometimes avoid.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.080
You might be an
avoider with your boss

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.720
and a seeker with your mother.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.470
You might be an avoider
with your friends,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.910
but a seeker at work.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.890
And that's what you want,
that's what you want to do,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.990
is be able to figure
out when which

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.860
style is going to work for you,
and understand your default

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.360
style.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.050
So if you have a style
that you tend to avoid,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.880
and every time a
conflict comes up,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.280
you're hiding under the
table, you have to think about

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.410
how can I compensate
for that, how

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.340
can I make this a little
bit more palatable for me.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.220
Or if you tend to seek, and you
notice that people around you

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.480
are leaving the room, or
scared to interact with you,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.450
then you need to figure out
how do I compensate for that.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:29.440
Now in order to have a
rational approach to conflict,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.350
to make those good choices,
to know what your style is

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.330
and to compensate
it, it really helps

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.320
to put a little bit of distance
between you and the situation.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.660
And to get out of what
I was describing before

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.880
as amygdala hijack, where
you don't have access

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.920
to your prefrontal cortex.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.630
In order to do that,
what I recommend,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.129
and what a lot of
the book is about,

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:51.710
is how to analyze each
conflict that you're in.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.110
So you want to take--

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.540
there's four steps that
I describe in the book.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.120
Number one you want to
understand your counterpart.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.930
Now, we are naturally
narcissistic.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.880
And when we feel
threatened, we think

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.500
about how we are suffering.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.690
We think about what's
happening to us,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.060
what's our perspective
on the situation.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.207
It is incredibly helpful to
think about the other person.

00:12:14.207 --> 00:12:15.790
What is it that
they're going through?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.123
Are they a seeker or an avoider?

00:12:17.123 --> 00:12:20.710
What could be causing
this behavior?

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.770
Second, you want to identify
the type of conflict.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.290
I talk to people about
conflict all the time.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.720
When people find out
I wrote this book,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.670
they want to tell me
about every fight they've

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.440
had at work in the last week.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.190
Most people assume that
the conflict they're in

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.110
is a relationship
conflict, meaning

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.140
that it's a personal
issue between two people.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.330
They feel disrespected,
or someone

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.950
has said something snarky.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.930
But most conflicts
at work actually

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.320
start as one of
three other types.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.310
And I'll go over these.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.310
Like I said, most of us assume
that there's a relationship

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.360
conflict going on.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.850
But more often than
not, it actually

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.630
starts as a task conflict.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.570
So this is a disagreement
over the goal

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.300
of a project or the objective,
what you're trying to achieve.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.140
So I think the goal of a
project is to increase revenue,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.900
you think it is to improve
customer satisfaction.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.840
The second, is process.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.360
So you we may agree that the
goal is to increase revenue.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
But I think we should
do that by rolling out

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.810
to our entire group of
markets at one time.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.017
You think we should
pilot it first.

00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:27.100
So it's a disagreement
over the how we're actually

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.430
going to get there.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.900
And then last, there's
conflicts over status or power,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.610
who gets to make the call.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.180
And this is extremely common
in flat organizations,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.630
where there's teams that
are shaping and reshaping

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.430
all the time.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.310
Now of course,
conflicts rarely fall

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.230
into one discrete category.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.260
More often than not,
they're actually

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.830
a combination of these things.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.890
And what I see most
often is something

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.470
that starts as task
or process, quickly

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.750
devolves into a
personal conflict.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.490
So you and I are
disagreeing over what

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.930
the goal of the project is.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.750
I start sending you
late-night snarky emails

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.370
and it quickly becomes
a personal issue

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.480
Now the third step--

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.330
so when you enter a conflict
you want to ask yourself,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.200
what type of conflict
are you having.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.240
That is an important
step, because once

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.440
you know that you
can begin to dig

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.442
into how to actually solve it.

00:14:24.442 --> 00:14:26.400
Because if you assume
it's a personal conflict,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.010
those are the hardest
conflicts to actually resolve.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.530
But if you can actually
solve the task or the process

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.330
conflict, the personal
stuff is going

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.180
to be much more easy to resolve.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.210
So now the third step is
to determine your goal.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.120
And I like to say if your
goal in the situation

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.530
is to prove your counterpart
wrong, find another goal.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.230
Now that might feel
good in the near term.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.410
It might feel good to say I
was right in this situation

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.340
and you were wrong.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.140
Or what I hear most
often these days

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.600
is his behavior
was unacceptable,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.830
and until he accepts his
behavior is unacceptable,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.500
we can't move on.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.960
If your goal is just to
prove someone's behavior is

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.660
unacceptable, you're not
going to solve that conflict,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.210
because no one wants to
admit that their behavior was

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.200
unacceptable.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.960
If you can actually
decide, OK, my goal here

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.630
is to save this
relationship, or my goal

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.750
is to get this project
done as quickly as possible

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.460
so I never have to
work with this person

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.710
again, that's a
goal that's going

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.380
to help serve you much better.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.780
And that's a goal you're
going to be able to achieve.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.590
And that will lead
to the fourth step,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.230
which is to pick your option.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.500
Now in most US companies
that I talk to,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.380
they think of having a
discussion about conflict

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.110
as sitting down and
hashing things out.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.850
And that's the direct approach.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.770
But you actually have
several other options

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.950
for handling the conflict.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.730
And you use them all the
time and may not even know.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.390
So number one, you
can do nothing.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.080
We do this all the time.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.230
Jean Brett, who runs
the Dispute Resolution

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.910
Center at Northwestern
University,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.385
calls this lumping it.

00:15:58.385 --> 00:15:59.010
And we do this.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.100
You get the snarky email, or
someone raises their voice

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.110
in a meeting, or
someone says something

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.990
that's completely off base
and undermines your authority,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.030
and you just sort of
ignore it and move on.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.920
And it's a great option.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.540
It's a great
option, particularly

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.030
if you don't have much
power in the situation,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.580
if you're dealing with
someone who's unreasonable,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.880
or if you realize
making a big deal of it

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.240
is going to make things worse
rather than just move on.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.960
Now there's a caveat about
the do nothing option.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.790
If you are an avoider,
and you're like,

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.450
oh, I love the do nothing
option, I do that all the time,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.240
you need to check yourself,
because you're likely doing it

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.540
because you're afraid to
have some conversations,

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.680
some difficult conversations.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.135
The other caveat
is doing nothing,

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:46.620
then going back to your desk
and stewing, and not getting

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.190
your work done, and gossiping
with another friend about how

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.430
awful that person is, is not
doing nothing, that's actually

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.610
doing something.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.790
So in order to
exercise this option,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:02.190
you really have to be willing to
let it go, and truly let it go.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.859
Now of course you might try
to do nothing and realize

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.784
it's not working.

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:07.200
You're losing
sleep, you're having

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.690
the conversation in your
head on the car ride home.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:16.359
But that's OK, you can then move
to one of the other options.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.240
There's no harm in that.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.210
Another option is to
address it indirectly.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.790
I often talk to
organizations, particularly I

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.700
notice in financial service
organizations, I bring this up,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.116
and they're like,
oh, yeah, that's

00:17:28.116 --> 00:17:29.670
the passive aggressive option.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.128
That's where you try to get
your needs met without actually

00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:33.180
having to talk about it.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.880
But this is a
perfectly good option

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.442
in situations where addressing
it directly-- again, maybe

00:17:39.442 --> 00:17:41.400
you're dealing with
someone who's unreasonable,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.620
or with an extreme
conflict avoider,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.810
so talking to a third
party who can maybe

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.110
intervene on your behalf
is completely appropriate.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.350
This is also inappropriate
option in cultures

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.380
where saving face
is really important.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.990
In a previous career as a
management consultant when

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.270
I was staffed on
a project in Korea

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.020
for four months with
this Korean conglomerate.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.390
We had three different work
streams for the project.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.210
And at one point we
came to an impasse

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.584
with our Korean counterparts,
where they said,

00:18:11.584 --> 00:18:14.000
OK, we really need to figure
out which of these three work

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.080
streams we're going
to prioritize.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.480
Things got really
heated, really tense.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.420
And finally, they said we're
going to meet with the, CEO

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.120
and the CEO is going to help
us decide which of these we

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.380
should prioritize.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.540
Me and my American
counterparts are like great,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.310
let's get in the room,
let's hash it out,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.514
we know what we
think should happen,

00:18:31.514 --> 00:18:33.180
they know what they
think should happen.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.920
We're going to be able to
sort this all out together.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.090
We get in the room,
and the CEO starts

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.360
telling this long story about
the founding of the company.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.950
And why it was all about
the people, and his family,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.856
and providing for the
people who worked there.

00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:51.480
And after about 20
minutes-- of course,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.202
we're listening to all
this through an interpreter

00:18:54.202 --> 00:18:56.160
and looking at the
interpreter sort of confused

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.720
like this is really
what he's saying?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.261
Weren't we going to
decide which work

00:18:59.261 --> 00:19:00.630
stream we're going to focus on?

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.979
After about 20 minutes,
he ends the story,

00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:05.270
and everyone gets up, and
the meeting seems to be over,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.167
and we walk out.

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:08.750
And my American counterparts and
I are standing around saying,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.400
like what just happened?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.910
And our Korean counterparts
are like did you not hear?

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.630
He told us we're prioritizing
the HR work stream, because it

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.860
was all about people.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.087
And he had used the
metaphor and the story

00:19:21.087 --> 00:19:23.420
of the founding of the company
to put us in a direction,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.630
without ever having to discuss
the conflict we were having.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.060
And that was a very
appropriate way

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.820
to solve the conflict
in that organization.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.540
And it worked.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.030
Because we had the
direction we needed

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.410
and we were able
to move forward.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.820
And again, I've seen people
do this very skillfully, where

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.740
they will have a
conflict with someone,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.260
and rather say we're
having a conflict,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.180
let's discuss what's
going on, they'll

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.040
say I once had a previous job
with someone where we weren't

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.800
getting along, and I did
this, and he did this,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.560
and in it's sort of just
dropping hints of this

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.070
may be a way we can move forward
without directly addressing

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.290
what's happening.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.850
Third is address it directly.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.150
We'll talk a lot about that
in the rest of the talk,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.890
about how to
actually prepare for

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.970
those difficult conversations,
and how to have them.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.680
And the fourth option is
to exit the relationship.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.330
Now, this is what I call
the last resort option.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.890
Very difficult to do
in most organizations.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.740
Often hard to get a new boss.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.620
Often hard to get
a new teammate.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.720
So really this is a last resort.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.990
If you've tried the other three
options, and it's not working,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.980
you may need to
find a way to stop

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.510
interacting with this person.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.600
I talked to someone whose story
is featured in the book, who

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.480
eventually went, after a
really difficult situation

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.400
with her boss,
eventually went to HR

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.130
and was able to sell HR
on getting her to report

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.670
to someone else, without
actually having to lay out

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.270
everything that was going on.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.780
So it takes a lot of skill
in most organizations

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.690
to make this happen.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.030
But I like to lay
it out as an option.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.100
So those are the four steps
to analyze a conflict.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.680
And this, again, the
point is, to help

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.490
you put distance
between your reaction

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.330
to the situation,
which is likely

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.880
going to be narcissistic and
emotional, and your action.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.390
So the idea is to give
yourself some space before you

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.520
decide exactly what to do.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.370
Now, I'm talking about this
as if you have all the time

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.760
in the world, as if you can say,
oh, you just sent me an email,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.570
I'm going to take a half an hour
to go through these four steps.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.810
More likely, you'll need
to buy yourself some time.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.290
And in time pressured,
fast moving organizations

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.540
this can be difficult,
and I acknowledge that.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.780
But there are ways that you
can give yourself a little bit

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.344
of space to do this work.

00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:50.010
Eventually, you'll be able to do
those four steps really quickly

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:50.640
in your brain.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.270
It won't take a half an hour,
sitting down, opening my book,

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.560
and looking through each step.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.340
But in the moment,
and when you're first

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.660
getting used to this, you really
want to take the time you need.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.160
So first, if someone is yelling,
if things are really heated,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.920
it is OK to walk away.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.240
What you need to do is actually
own the need to do that.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.450
So you never want to say,
you're being unreasonable,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.110
or you're screaming, I'm
going to take five minutes.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.880
People do not like to be
assigned emotions or reactions.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.000
Instead own it I need a few
minutes to think this through,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.920
or I really need
to calm down, can I

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.190
come back to you tomorrow, or
can I send you an email later.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.950
You can ask for a break.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.990
So even if you've
started the discussion,

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.020
and then you realize I'm
not being rational here,

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.320
or he's not being rational
here, you can say,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.450
you know what, again,
can I take five minutes,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.360
and come back to you, or can we
take a walk around the building

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.250
and talk about this later.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.880
Find a way to give yourself
the space you need.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.490
And then lastly, don't hit send.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:05.220
I cannot tell you how many times
an email completely implodes

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.840
a conflict situation.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.190
We cannot read tone on email.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.120
There's amazing
studies about this.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.450
We cannot read tone.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.080
We assume the worst intention.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.050
When we send an
email, we assume we're

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.840
being completely clear,
transparent, and benevolent.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.780
When we receive an
email, we assume

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.130
people are being completely
unclear and rude.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.840
So email is a horrible
place to have a discussion

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.270
or a tense conversation.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.590
So especially if you've written
a really long email in response

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.140
to someone who has sent you
something that you are not

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.050
happy about, don't hit send.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.220
Delete the draft.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.840
Put it into a document.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.760
Save it for later.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.130
Allow yourself to
vent, but really

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.420
make sure that you're
not engaging over email.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.890
Now, how to prepare
for the conversation--

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.410
so once you've decided, OK,
we are going to sit down,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.990
I need to talk to this person,
I need to stop by their desk,

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.780
how do you actually get ready?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.100
I talk about three different
types of preparation, mental,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.410
strategic, and logistic.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.250
So first, mentally, if you
are going into a conversation

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.450
that you think is going to be
difficult and uncomfortable,

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.090
guess what, it is going to be
difficult and uncomfortable.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.060
So you have to
change your mindset.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.780
Think about if I went
into this conversation

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.390
with a positive attitude,
with thinking about something

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.370
I could learn,
what am I actually

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.910
curious about, what don't I
know about my counterpart's

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.310
perspective, or the
assumptions that she's

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.550
made that I can learn
in this conversation.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.820
Instead of thinking about I have
to give this teammate of mine

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.710
this really negative
feedback, think

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:52.570
about I'm really doing tough
work to help my teammate grow.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.980
Really put a positive frame.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.780
And this is not sugarcoating.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:01.390
This is not-- it should be
a genuinely positive take

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.850
on the situation.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:08.500
But it helps so much to go into
a conversation with a much more

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.456
curious, open attitude.

00:25:10.456 --> 00:25:12.830
Because you're going to project
that to the other person.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.980
And so much about
resolving conflict

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.130
is about the energy you both
bring to the conversation.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.920
If you come in, slumped
shoulders, really

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.140
nervous about what's
happening, fidgeting,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.320
that's going to cue the person,
because of our natural instinct

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.170
to mirror another person's
behavior, that's going

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.440
to cause them to do the same.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.847
Second, you want to take your
counterpart's perspective.

00:25:34.847 --> 00:25:37.430
So hopefully, you've done this
when you analyzed the conflict.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.310
But also think more deeply.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.280
What is it that is
motivating this person?

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.340
What could explain the way
that they've reacted so far?

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.420
And granted, sometimes
you might want to be well,

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.970
he's just a passive
aggressive jerk.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.710
If you come up with
that explanation,

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.510
try to come up with three more.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.580
Could it be that he's
under extreme pressure?

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.980
Is she afraid of losing her job?

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.010
Is there something going on
in this person's personal life

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.530
that would better
explain what's happening?

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.920
Lastly, you want to vent
so find your most trusted

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.190
colleague, a friend
outside the organization,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.170
and just get it all out.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.960
Because if you have all of those
negative thoughts and feelings

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.120
about this person,
about the situation,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.790
and you bring them
into the conversation,

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.295
again, you're going to really
make things uncomfortable

00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:27.290
and you're going to set
yourself up for failure.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.260
So instead, if you
can get that all out,

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.590
say it to the person,
this trusted person,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.500
then you'll be much more
calm and collected when

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.370
you go into the discussion.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.830
Now strategically,
how do you get ready?

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.630
One, you want to
plan your message.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.630
So think about what you'll
say and what you won't say.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.520
What will be helpful
to the conversation?

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.279
And what will be likely
to tick the person off?

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.570
You don't have to write it out.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.400
You don't have to know exactly
everything you're going to say.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.608
Because remember, you're in
conversation with another

00:26:56.608 --> 00:26:59.170
person, you cannot
predict how they'll react.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:04.000
But have a good sense of the
main points you want to make.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.640
And jot those down,
have them ready.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.220
Trust me, if someone comes into
a tense conversation looking

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.950
prepared, I am
nothing but grateful.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.100
No one's going to say, you
wrote your main points down?

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.650
It's incredibly helpful to
have those at your ready,

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.930
especially if things
start to get emotional.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.890
You also want to prepare
for multiple scenarios.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.480
So think about what
happens if I start

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.680
to cry, what happens if he gets
up and walks out of the room.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.270
What happens if
we get interrupted

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:35.020
and we only have 10 minutes
to have this conversation,

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.850
how will I react.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.310
And the goal, again,
is not to map out

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.870
everything you'll say and
do in those situations.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.650
But it's to make sure
that you feel prepared,

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.420
and that you don't
get blindsided.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.980
So when something
happens, you think,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.710
OK, I thought something
similar like this through,

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.530
and I'm ready, I'm ready for
this unforeseen situation.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.790
Now logistically, where and
when you have this conversation

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:01.900
really matters.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.440
And people often ask me, how
soon after an incident do

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.180
I want to have the conversation?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.040
And what I always say
is as soon as possible,

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.910
but when you're both
ready to have it.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.220
So you don't want to push
forward a conversation

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.320
if you're not
feeling like you've

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.950
done the right work, that you're
not in a good frame of mind.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.040
If you go into the
conversation feeling hyped up,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.910
uncomfortable, again, it's not
going to set the right tone.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.850
So choose a time
after you've had time

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.990
to calm down, make sure you
have more than enough time

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.930
to have that discussion,
and then also choose

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.510
a good place to have it.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.130
I often say,
especially if there's

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.420
a status conflict going
on, that you want to not

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.040
be on anyone's territory.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.120
Go outside.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.130
Take a walk.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.470
If you're dealing with a
seeker, half the conversation

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.320
in a public place, where they'll
be on their best behavior,

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.970
less likely to yell.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.860
If you know you're
a seeker, and you

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.170
think that the comfort
of a conference room

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.530
is going to make you misbehave,
take yourself outside.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:10.450
Ask the person to meet
you in a neutral spot.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.550
So once you've gotten
ready, let's talk

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.130
about how you actually have
a productive conversation

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.020
once you're in the
room, or on the phone,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.990
or however you're having
this conversation.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.340
First you want to
frame your message.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.980
So there's three things you
do to frame your message.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.840
One, you talk about a shared
goal that you both have,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.590
something that you
have in common.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.770
So you might say
we both really care

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.650
about getting this
project on time,

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.660
or we both really care that
this project comes under budget,

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.950
whatever shared goal you
have, or we both really care

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.260
about what's best for the team.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.080
Second, you want to identify
the type of conflict.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.720
So you don't have to use the
words task, process, status.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.110
But make sure it's
clear that this is not

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.330
about personal issues.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.900
Talk about what's the underlying
business cause or business

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.470
issue that's happening there.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.940
And that will help
depersonalize the discussion.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.120
And then third, you
want to ask that person,

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.700
well you want to set a
collaborative intent.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.340
You want to make sure the
person knows that you're there

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.310
not to prove your point,
not to prove them wrong,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.080
but to actually work
it out together.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.470
So you might say I'm
really excited we're

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.630
having this conversation,
because success

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.900
in this situation is going to
depend on us working together.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.860
Or you might do what Adam
Galinsky at Columbia University

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.350
has found really works in a
of these situations, which

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.902
is to ask for advice.

00:30:33.902 --> 00:30:35.860
That will show that you're
being collaborative.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.550
So it sounds a
little bit like this.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.600
You might say, we
both really care

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.340
about getting this
project done on time.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.750
I think what's really at issue
is a process conflict about how

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.320
we actually solve it.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.410
I'd love to get your
advice on how we

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.090
can work this through together.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.340
And that really enlists
the other person.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.190
It shows them I'm not here
to just prove my point,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.730
but I'm here to work
collaboratively with you.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.040
Second, you want to
manage your emotions.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.410
As I mentioned, we have
a natural human instinct

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.080
to want to mirror another
person's behavior.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.120
So if you're getting
red in the face,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.580
if your heart rate is
rising, your breathing

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.440
is getting faster,
the other person

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.570
is going to likely
react in the same way.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:22.510
So what you want to do is use a
lot of mindfulness techniques.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.010
Focus on your breathing.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.110
Try to imagine that
you're a fly on the wall

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.570
and you're just observing
the conversation

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.160
and what's happening.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.510
Or really narrate to
yourself in your head.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.260
Try to give yourself some
distance from those emotions,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.090
and narrate in your
head what's happening.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.420
That will take you out of your
body reaction and the stress

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.920
response, and really
ground you in being there

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.270
and being present.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.450
You can also use what a lot
of mindfulness experts--

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.690
Leah Weiss at Stanford has done
a lot of interesting research

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.390
about this, which
is called anchoring.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.800
And it's trying to ground
yourself in your body.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.200
So you're either
focusing on your feet

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.160
touching the ground, your
hand on the table, anything,

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.980
again, to get yourself
present in your body

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:14.580
and out of the rumination
going on in your brain.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.110
Now your main job in any
difficult conversation

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.650
is to listen.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:24.080
And this is not because you're
being altruistic or generous

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.280
to your counterpart.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.140
This is because it is strategic.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.380
The more information you
have about what the person's

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.460
interests are and what they
want out of the situation,

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.020
the more likely
you're going to be

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.300
able to propose a
solution that meets both

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.670
your needs and their needs.

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.130
So you want to ask
a lot of questions.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.260
Ask what made you think that?

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.560
What are the assumptions
going into that?

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.530
Tell me more.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.480
Tell me more is a fantastic
phrase, especially when someone

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.160
says something that
you immediately

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.620
want to react to negatively,
and say that's not true,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.750
that's inappropriate.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.240
Try saying tell me more
instead, because you're

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.030
going to find out a
lot more information,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.920
rather than shutting
the conversation down.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.880
And lastly, you also want to
make your viewpoint heard.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.510
The avoiders of the world will
spend a lot of time listening,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.180
if they've even managed
to stay in the room.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.920
But you also want to
make sure that you

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.620
get your viewpoint heard.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.620
And you might say to someone,
I really hear your perspective,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.250
repeat back what they
hear, but then say,

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.140
I would like to tell you
my take on this situation.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.750
Help transition that you've
gone from listening mode

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.650
to talking mode.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.670
Help them understand you're
about to make your point.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.160
And it's important.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.670
Sometimes we assume people
understand what our interests

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.530
or needs are in a situation.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.750
And very often they don't.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.610
So making your viewpoint
heard, make sure

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.160
that your interests
are on the table.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.090
Now in the process of doing all
this, sometimes, even actually

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.860
in the process of
analyzing the conflict,

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.580
sometimes a natural
resolution just

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.130
sort of evolves in
the conversation.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:08.810
And you'll notice a resolution
because it has three hallmarks.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.090
Number one, it
satisfies interests.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.310
So it satisfies as many
interests as possible.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.230
It has to meet some of yours
and some of your counterpart's.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.909
It doesn't have to
meet all of them.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.610
But for it to be a resolution
that's going to stick,

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.889
that's going to keep
the relationship intact,

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:28.340
it has to meet at least
some of each of yours.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.340
Second it has to be
fair and reasonable.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.760
Now what's fair to one person
and reasonable to another

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.420
is very different, those
are very subjective terms.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.130
So you might think about
how would this be observed,

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.260
or how would this be
interpreted by other people.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.710
So if we had to write this
agreement, the disagreement

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.510
that happened, the
resolution we came to,

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.310
and we had as distribute
it to everyone on our team

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.660
or our organization, would
everyone look and say, wow,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.620
Amy really got the
deal in that situation.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.040
Or would they think, oh,
that's fair and reasonable?

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.260
And you might even
invoke those words

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.270
in your discussion
of a resolution.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.880
You might say, I understand
why you're proposing that,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.520
but I can't imagine having
to pitch that to my boss.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.140
I think my boss would not
think that's reasonable.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.370
So bring in sort of
third party perspectives

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.010
to establish what what's
fair and reasonable.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.960
And lastly, it has to leave
the relationship intact.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.560
So if you have gone
through all of this

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.370
and you come to a resolution,
but you hate each other's guts,

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.100
that's not going to give you all
those positive benefits that I

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.509
talked about at the beginning.

00:35:35.509 --> 00:35:37.550
You're not going to have
a stronger relationship.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.160
You're not going to be
happy to come to work.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.890
So it has to make sure that
the relationship stays intact.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.630
And there's a whole
chapter in the book

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.820
about how to repair the
relationship after a conflict.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.580
So you might want to
check that out as well.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.300
So how do you get
to that resolution

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.220
when you're having
the conversation?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.400
A couple things.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.200
One, be creative.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.770
So rather than saying, I
believe we should do this,

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.800
and your counterpart
coming back and saying,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.720
no I think we
should do this, try

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.890
to build on each other's ideas.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.340
So if your counterpart throws
out a potential resolution,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.940
say yes, and I think
we could also do this.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.810
Build on it.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.009
Try to create more options.

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:18.800
Even throw out options
that you don't think

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.383
will really work,
because that's going

00:36:20.383 --> 00:36:23.330
to give you more information
about their interests.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.480
Because if you throw out
something that's completely

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.294
whack a doodle,
they're going to say

00:36:28.294 --> 00:36:30.710
that would never work because
of this, and this, and this.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.780
And then you get
more information

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.480
about what matters to them
and what they care about.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.690
You also want to collaborate.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.380
You cannot just criticize
each other's ideas.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.410
Think about what can
we propose together,

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.800
what additional
information do we need?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.520
What other stakeholders do
we need to get interest from?

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.354
Work on it together.

00:36:53.354 --> 00:36:54.811
You want to make
sure that it feels

00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:56.600
like you're on the
right side of the table

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.080
together, not on opposite sides.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.810
And then lastly, consider
what you have to offer.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.850
So oftentimes, in a
difficult conversation

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:10.160
we are trying to sort out
what each person can give.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.260
If you're asking
your counterpart

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.920
to give up something
really important,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.680
some interest that's that
really matters to them,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.320
consider what you have
to offer in return.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.030
Maybe it's on something
you can help out

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.730
on another project
at another time.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.900
Maybe you do you can do
them a favor down the road.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.530
Whatever it is, that's
going to be invoke this sort

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.210
of natural law of reciprocity.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.580
They're going to be more
likely to be willing to give

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.160
if you've offered something up.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.710
So of course, I'm
talking about this

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.450
again as if you have all
the time in the world.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.130
But most of us, in time
pressured organizations,

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.950
are dealing with conflicts
that happen very quickly.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.960
Something comes up in a
meeting, something needs

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.752
to be decided today, we
need to tell our bosses how

00:37:55.752 --> 00:37:56.960
this is going to be resolved.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.400
So I just want to
give you a few points

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.480
of what you can do on the fly.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.820
And then I'll take you
some of your questions.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.640
So first, know your type.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.490
Know whether you tend to
seek or whether you avoid.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.070
That's going to give you
really important information

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.960
when you start to react
to conflicts that come up.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.350
So if you tend to be an
avoider, and something

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.640
happens in a meeting,
you'll recognize,

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.870
OK, this is how I always
react in these situations.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.430
I need to watch myself.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.320
Know the four types of
conflict and name them.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.350
Again, you don't have to use
the terms task, process, status.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.280
But really try to
depersonalize what's happening.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.070
Because when someone
disagrees with you,

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.440
as I've mentioned, we start
to think that it's unkind,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.180
that person doesn't
respect me, they

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.280
don't think I'm
qualified to be here,

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.650
they don't think
I'm good at my job.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.960
And if you can really
focus on actually

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.810
we're disagreeing over how
to get this project done,

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.310
it's going to help take
some of that emotion

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.260
and the personality
out of the situation.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.000
Make smart choices
about your option.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.050
don't just default to hashing
it out or doing nothing.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.360
Really think through, OK,
of these four options,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.370
which is the best here.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.870
And be ready to pivot.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:15.300
If one option's not working,
be willing to move to another.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.520
And of course,
control your emotions.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.290
You want to make sure--

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.870
I cannot tell you how many
conversations I've seen

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:25.350
completely go off the rails
because someone starts to raise

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.800
their voice or gets
red in the face.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.380
And it just causes so much
tension and discomfort,

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.050
the more you can be calm,
cool, and collected,

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.740
even if the other person
isn't, the much more

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.500
you're going to set that
conversation on a path

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.720
to success.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.630
And it does not
matter the content

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.610
of the conversation,
the person who

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.890
feels in control
of their emotions

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.842
is most likely the person is
going to get what they want out

00:39:52.842 --> 00:39:53.550
of the situation.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.950
It's what I observe
all the time when

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.870
I'm doing coaching
or consulting,

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.390
the people who feel
in control and feel

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.820
like they're making
rational decisions always

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.501
have the upper hand.

00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:06.000
So I'm going to
take some questions.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.890
If I leave you with
one thing today,

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.020
I really want you
to remember this,

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:15.310
which is that it is your
job to disagree with people.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.000
It is your job to have opinions
that differ from people.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.450
It is what makes work good
and what makes it sort of fun

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:22.950
to be at.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.460
So do not think of
disagreement as unkindness.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.710
It's actually a kind thing to
do if you do it the right way.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.690
So thank you all so
much for having me.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.810
SPEAKER: That was really good.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.470
Thank you.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.730
And we'll take questions.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.807
So who has a question.

00:40:39.807 --> 00:40:40.890
I'm going to go over here.

00:40:44.995 --> 00:40:46.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
those kind of frameworks

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:47.640
are really helpful to me.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.514
So I appreciate that.

00:40:48.514 --> 00:40:49.540
AMY GALLO: Sure.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.760
AUDIENCE: Sometimes
conflict arises

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.790
because of the processes
in a large org.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.270
And a portion of that org
feels dismissed or diminished

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.550
because of it and those
conflicts happen over time.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.759
I'm curious about
how we translate

00:41:02.759 --> 00:41:04.300
these kind of
one-one-one experiences

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.680
to those larger kind
of conversations.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.930
AMY GALLO: Yeah, so
a couple of things.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.500
One of which is we all
work in organizations

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.930
where we don't have
a ton of control

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.100
over things, how things happen.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.500
So what I tell people is
focus on what you can control.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.320
It can be really easy to
think about the larger

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.780
cultural issues or the
larger process issues

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.760
and really focus on those.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.640
But if you were powerless
to change those,

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.280
you're going to feel nothing
but sort of depressed

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.540
and have a sort of
a lack of agency.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.880
So really focus on
the interactions

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.160
and the human to human.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.990
I think these
frameworks definitely

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.000
apply at a larger level though.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.450
So let's say your
department is interacting

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.150
with another department that
tends to feel dismissed,

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:56.500
you can really think
about can we really focus

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.420
on what the actual conflict is.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.970
If they come in with a
man down kind of attitude,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:05.740
how do we really
focus on what we're

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.770
trying to achieve, not
that interpersonal issue.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.100
Ultimately, at the end
of the day, all of this

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:18.350
gets played out in a one-to-one
or one-to-many interaction.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:22.180
So really focus on how you
can sort of compensate or undo

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.860
some of those myths or some
of those predispositions

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.930
in the interaction.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.550
And oftentimes, that
can sort of set--

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.350
Annie McKey, who
wrote a great book,

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.150
you guys should have
her actually-- called

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:39.050
"How to be Happy at Work" and
she talks about micro cultures.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.570
So we're all subject
to the larger

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.780
culture of our organization,
or our department, or our team,

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.050
but what she's observed is that
people create micro cultures.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.700
It might just start
with two people,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.270
or it might start with a segment
of a team, where you start

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.790
interacting the way you
wish people around you

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.080
were interacting.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.810
And it starts to set the
behavior, not necessarily--

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.830
sometimes it will impact
the broader organization,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.800
but more importantly,
it just protects you in

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.370
that moment, of I have the
safety of this micro culture,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.220
in which I know I can
behave, and live my values,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.672
and be happy at work.

00:43:14.672 --> 00:43:16.665
SPEAKER: Great,
another question?

00:43:19.945 --> 00:43:22.320
AUDIENCE: I had two questions,
but she asked one of them.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.960
So you took care of
the bigger one, which

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.220
was kind of the issue of larger
scales than just two people

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.460
having conflict.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.070
The probably easier,
shorter one, question

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:40.770
is, what you described
as a process conflict,

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.030
I was hearing more--

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.750
not process, I
meant task, what you

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.000
described as a task conflict--

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.290
I was hearing that more as
difference of objectives,

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.070
people having--

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.690
is that a fair characteristic?

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:52.530
AMY GALLO: Absolutely,
so it might

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.120
be we disagree about
what the goal is,

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.340
or it might be we have
goals and they conflict.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.630
Yeah.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.820
And I think those tensions
in an organization

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.950
are really good to have.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:09.600
It's OK when departments
or teams have

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.600
different goals that conflict.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.210
It's how you actually
resolve that conflict,

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.370
or how you resolve the
misalignment that matters.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.240
And that's the opportunity.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.250
I sometimes say that managers
have a responsibility

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.190
to create tensions
on an organization.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.280
If everyone in your
team sees eye to eye

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.550
and is really aligned,
you're not doing your job.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.160
People need to bring in
diverse perspectives.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.750
They need to see
things differently.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.750
They need to disagree with
the strategies or the goals,

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.700
because that's going to make
the work much more robust.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.130
SPEAKER: Great,
and next question.

00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:55.870
AUDIENCE: This might be a little
bit of a difficult question,

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.453
but I didn't know if you had any
advice you can give to women,

00:44:58.453 --> 00:45:01.080
who there's that existing
societal expectation that we're

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.670
supposed to be agreeable.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.230
AMY GALLO: Yeah,
I could do a whole

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.130
another talk about the gender
issues around conflict.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.570
There's some great research
about women in negotiation,

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.630
and exactly the
societal expectations.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.070
The research was done by
Hannah Riley Bowles, who

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.700
is at Harvard Kennedy School.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:25.420
And it shows that women tend
not to negotiate for themselves,

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.210
not because they don't know how
to or don't have the skills,

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.510
but because they are
penalized for doing so.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.980
So both men and women who
witness a woman negotiate

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.170
are far more likely
to say they don't

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.030
want to work with
her than if they

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.370
see a man do the same
exact kind of negotiation.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:48.030
Now I'm a big believer in you
control what you can control.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.020
If I knew how to change
that societal expectation,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.080
I would do that.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.560
That's what I would be
spending my life doing.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.950
But since we cannot
control that,

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.890
you have to think a little bit
about how do I deal with that

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.020
expectation and that risk,
that if I do negotiate.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.500
The answer is not
to not negotiate.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.390
What Hannah and
also a woman named

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.330
Debbie Cole at
Babson advise is what

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.040
they call the I-we strategy.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.550
So instead of negotiating
for I, or yourself,

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.560
you're negotiation for we.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.820
So how is what you want best
for the organization, or how

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.490
is what you want
best for the team.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.390
The classic example Hannah
uses is Sheryl Sandberg, when

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:37.560
she negotiated her salary
with Mark Zuckerberg

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.250
said, before the salary
negotiation said, as your COO,

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.260
you want me to be
good at negotiation.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.320
So I'm going to show
you right now how good I

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.910
am at negotiation.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.730
And she was negotiating
for herself,

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:55.140
but she pitched it as I'm
negotiating on behalf of you.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.530
It's an incredibly
tiresome mental gymnastics

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.770
to have to do.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.020
But it's the reality
that we live in.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.960
And I do think that
strategy of how

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.970
is this best for
the organization,

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.880
how is this best for my team,
that's another way women

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.320
tend to get away
with negotiation.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.520
My team really needs this.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.130
Again tiresome, wish we
didn't have to do it.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.890
But it is in an effective
way to get around that.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.060
Any other questions?

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.400
AUDIENCE: So during a very tense
moment, what kind of emotions

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.580
do you suggest portraying?

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.490
AMY GALLO: Well, OK,
that's a difficult--

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.400
I actually find that more
difficult than the gender

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:45.899
question.

00:47:45.899 --> 00:47:50.620
Partly because what you want
to portray is authentic.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.820
So if you're trying to portray
that you're calm and collected,

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.530
and you're actually
fidgeting, that

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.070
is much worse than actually
portraying your anger.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.640
Because what people
interpret is a dissonance

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.140
between what's happening.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.570
And that dissonance is
so confusing to people.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.080
And it makes things really,
really difficult to actually

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.410
have a conversation.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:15.340
So first and foremost,
portray the authentic emotion

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.870
you're having or what you
can truly portray as real.

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:24.070
So you're not communicating
that disagreement

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.680
with your body language
and your emotions.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:33.150
That said, I do think that it's
OK sometimes to express anger

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.410
in a disagreement.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:40.630
I had a colleague who had a
really difficult situation

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.920
with a colleague.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.470
She had been really
working hard to stay calm

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.754
in these conversations.

00:48:46.754 --> 00:48:48.670
Every time he said
something which she thought

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.970
was completely off base,
she did the deep breathing,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.770
the anchoring, and she was calm.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.690
And she lost it one
time and yelled.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.790
And he stopped after
the meeting and said,

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.310
I never knew that I
was frustrating you.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:01.600
And I was like, oh, no.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.580
She had spent all this
time remaining calm,

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.370
and she had actually
never conveyed to him

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.010
that he was driving her crazy.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:12.420
And so there are
appropriate moments.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.270
The difference between
what she did at that moment

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.420
and what most of us tend to
do is that she had control.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.080
So it wasn't a moment where she
felt like, she felt embarrassed

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.070
that she had yelled.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.690
She had really
reached a point where

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:29.200
she was like I have no
choice but to yell right now

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.000
and to make clear how I feel.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.940
And it was a rational
decision for her to make.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.150
So portray things
that are authentic.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.170
Be willing to portray
negative emotions,

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:42.940
especially if you feel like
your position's not being heard.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.250
For the most part,
being calm is great,

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.260
but only if you
genuinely feel it.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.116
AUDIENCE: What about smiling?

00:49:50.116 --> 00:49:52.405
What the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:52.405 --> 00:49:57.230
SPEAKER: The question is
about smiling, what do you do?

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.732
AMY GALLO: Is the question,
should you not smile?

00:49:59.732 --> 00:50:01.440
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess, because you said

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.600
disagreement is not unkindness.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.520
I'm just wondering if trying to
project more warmth and empathy

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.460
through smiling is either
helpful or unhelpful,

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.910
because potentially that could
also cause some dissonance.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.280
AMY GALLO: Yes, great, exactly.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.650
And I think that's
a great question.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:24.390
Because oftentimes when I'm
helping with a mediation,

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:29.700
what I see happen
is people will say--

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.410
this happens all the
time, where people

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:32.850
will have framed
their message, they're

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.558
ready for the
conversation, and then they

00:50:34.558 --> 00:50:37.110
try to spread their discomfort
over like a 2,000 word

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.320
monologue to start.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.110
It's like what's happening here.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:42.750
So they portray I'm not
feeling comfortable with this.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.990
They portray this is going to
be a really tense, difficult

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.010
conversation.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.800
What you want, because
disagreement shouldn't

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.710
be unkind, what
you want to portray

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.500
is I am comfortable
with the situation.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.200
I feel like it's OK to
have this conversation.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.140
Smiling, if you
feel good about it--

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:04.320
sometimes you have to
help people interpret.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.770
We always think we're much
more transparent than we are.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.870
And I say this around
crying, especially.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:12.960
If you cry at work, people are
going to just think you're sad.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.640
But people cry for
all sorts of reasons.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.181
They cry because they're mad,
they cry or they're frustrated.

00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:19.129
So if you're smiling,
or if you're crying,

00:51:19.129 --> 00:51:20.670
or if you're doing
something that you

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.220
can tell the other person
is not interpreting,

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.260
you can say I'm smiling
because I really

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.630
feel like this is an
opportunity for us to resolve

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.950
this disagreement
in a productive way.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:33.960
So really narrate why you're
doing what you're doing,

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.390
especially if
you're interpreting

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.320
a little bit of discomfort.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.710
But in that regard,
yes, smiling is great.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.990
If you can portray
I'm not uncomfortable

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.900
with this conversation,
I'm glad we're having it,

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.757
that's a great way to set up
the conversation for success.

00:51:49.757 --> 00:51:51.090
SPEAKER: Amy, thank you so much.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:52.530
Thank you for coming.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:56.480
[APPLAUSE]
