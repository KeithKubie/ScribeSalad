00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.950
As we mentioned so far we've only done
flow estimations and pairs of images.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.950
Now one way of thinking
about doing tracking is if

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.670
you had more than two images you could
do some form of optical flow or, or

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.740
some sort motion between one image and
the next and then you could just do it

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.270
between the second image and the third,
and the third image and the fourth.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.490
Basically you would just sort of
follow the arrows, connect the dots.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.600
So there are a couple of
challenges to just doing that.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.259
One as we saw, it's hard to
compute optical flow everywhere.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.610
You have to have just kind of
the right types of behavior for

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.090
the gradient, in terms of being
able to track these features.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.070
Second, there might be
large displacement so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.860
between one frame and the next
something may have moved a lot and so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.740
there's a lot of search
that has to be done.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.050
And so one way of doing that is you
might want to take the dynamics

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.680
into account.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.660
How is this thing moving?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.430
Make a prediction.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.670
And in fact that's what we're going to
spend a lot of time talking about

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.690
over the next couple of lessons.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.820
The other problem with sort of
connecting the dots is things

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.840
will drift.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.520
That is, you know, I make a little
mistake, and then a little more mistake,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.940
a little, and eventually,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.570
I'm no longer tracking the thing that I
had started wanting to keep track of.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.710
And then finally,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.792
another problem is what are called
occlusions or disocclusions, right?

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.900
Occlusion is when
something gets occluded.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.250
Disocclusion, maybe
unocclusion's a better word,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.990
basically it appears from something.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.840
So something appears, was it
something that had I lost before or

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.529
is it something new and
how do I do that kind of tracking?
