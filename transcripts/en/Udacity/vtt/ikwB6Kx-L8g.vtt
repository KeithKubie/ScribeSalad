The Context Management Specification, CMS, began at Duke University

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.290
as the Clinical Context Object Workshop or CCOW. It seeks to facilitate

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.300
the integration of diverse applications at the point of use. It does this by

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.330
managing issues such as, the identity of a patient. The user wants to view or

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.640
update, via these applications. The identity of the user who wants

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.340
to access the applications. A moment in time around which temporal data displays

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.710
should be centered by the applications. And a particular patient encounter,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.160
that the user wants to review. The details are highly technical, but you can

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.520
get the general idea from this illustration, where several different ideas from

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.340
different vendors are all centered around the same patient at the same time for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.180
the same clinician. This is and ambitious but potentially very important effort.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.270
Since clinicians commonly complain about the time and effort involved to use

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.480
many different systems, that work in different ways to manage their patients.
