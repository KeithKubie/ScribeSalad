00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:04.527
 We usually believe that the life we ​​live in is similar to that of others in general. 

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:09.628
 But did not you realize that most people in this world do not have Internet? 

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:15.184
 About 3.5 billion or just 40% of the world's population have an Internet connection today, 

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:20.826
 What makes this virtual reality that we live limited to a minority of people in the world. 

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:24.605
 And what about the fact that the majority of people in this world live in this circle? 

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:31.269
 In fact, it includes 22 out of 37 major cities, each containing at least 10 million people. 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.227
 Only two cities in America are in this category: New York and Los Angeles. 

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:39.116
 On this basis, the majority of the world's population lives in developing countries. 

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:44.979
 Modern language, therefore, seeks to change terms such as "third world countries" to "the world's majority countries" 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.892
 To accurately reflect the fact that these States are the majority of the human race, 

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:54.168
 Although the G-8 countries are making decisions that affect the majority of people on this planet. 

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:59.722
 As 70 to 80% of people earn less than $ 10 a day. 

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:05.840
 Even in a country as rich as America, more than 50% of its population earns less than $ 30,000 a year. 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.251
 It is good that the global poverty rate has halved over the past decade. 

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:14.898
 But we still live in a world where people have more mobile phones than toilets. 

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:19.924
 When they talk about those phones, most do not speak English as a mother tongue. 

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:22.069
 The majority is not Christian as well. 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:28.285
 According to the November 2016 census, males constitute the majority, with 55 million females missing. 

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:32.002
 The majority are under the age of 30 in our state. 

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:37.073
 In America, when it reaches 37, it officially becomes more than half the population. 

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:39.953
 What about the most common age globally? 

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:46.615
 Zero, followed by one year, two, three and four years, and then 26 years? 

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:51.331
 Most adults around the world weigh about 61 kilograms or 135 pounds. 

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:55.240
 While the vast majority in North America are obese. 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.680
 While the majority of North Americans prefer coffee on tea, 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.087
 We find that three cups of tea consumed for one cup of coffee globally, making it the most popular drink. 

00:02:05.087 --> 00:02:10.676
 Speaking of North America, the majority of the Canadian people live south of Seattle. 

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:18.466
 In terms of energy consumption, the majority of the world consumes less than twice as much as the American or Canadian individual. 

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:24.545
 If we look more broadly, we will find that the basic component of the universe is 68% dark energy, 

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:30.883
 Dark matter accounts for 27%, and the rest includes everything on the earth and everything monitored by machines; 

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:35.403
 Which is called the ordinary matter, constitutes only 5% of the universe. 

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:42.881
 Since the atoms are made of 99.99% of the empty space, most of you is ... nothing. 

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.514
 Special thanks to Bill and Malinda Gates for taking care of this episode. 

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:50.564
 Did you know that child mortality has halved over the past 15 years? 

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:55.286
 And that the lives of 122 million children have been saved since 1990? 

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:59.750
 Sometimes you may feel that the world is heading for the worst, but global medical intervention changes that. 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.571
 In their annual message, Bill and Melinda Gates seek to highlight this remarkable progress, and obstacles as well. 

00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.255
 Such as the fact that 45% of child deaths are due to malnutrition. 

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:15.565
