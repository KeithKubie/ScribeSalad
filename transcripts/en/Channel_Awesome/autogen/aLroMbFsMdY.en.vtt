to me like when you have a show you want

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.010
to me like when you have a show you want
 

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.820
to me like when you have a show you want
to keep going you can't just do the same

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:20.830
to keep going you can't just do the same

Family Guy or something like that you

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.650
Family Guy or something like that you
 

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.770
Family Guy or something like that you
have to do something different yet to do

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:25.780
have to do something different yet to do
 

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.170
have to do something different yet to do
it from a different angle and it seems

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.180
it from a different angle and it seems
 

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.640
it from a different angle and it seems
to me like this is a show they want to

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.650
to me like this is a show they want to
 

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.800
to me like this is a show they want to
keep it going for a while so the best

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:31.810
keep it going for a while so the best
 

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.330
keep it going for a while so the best

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.340
way to do it is like you said just go
 

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.940

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.660
this background and my guess would be
that they probably did have like the

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:39.670

there's not much more you can really do
 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.300
there's not much more you can really do
with it with like Adventure Time at

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.310

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.160
each character not season at least
together webisodes and it would still be

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.170
together webisodes and it would still be
 

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.290
together webisodes and it would still be
fresh for a few seasons well I think

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:55.300
fresh for a few seasons well I think
 

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.970
fresh for a few seasons well I think
with like with something like Simpsons

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:56.980
with like with something like Simpsons
 

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.050
with like with something like Simpsons
or all these sort of shows it's like

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.060

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959
character what's his story what's their
 

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:03.900
character what's his story what's their
background and in this you have their

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:03.910
background and in this you have their
 

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.660
background and in this you have their
personalities and their abilities but

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:06.670
personalities and their abilities but
 

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.710
personalities and their abilities but
you don't know their back or you don't

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720
you don't know their back or you don't

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.640
you have the background of the world and
so it's very slowly revealed and I think

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.650
so it's very slowly revealed and I think
 

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.070
so it's very slowly revealed and I think
by starting off really goofy ZAR this

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.080
by starting off really goofy ZAR this
 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.620
by starting off really goofy ZAR this

with some deep storyline that started
 

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.019
with some deep storyline that started
off with bizarreness and then they're

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.029
off with bizarreness and then they're
 

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:38.820
off with bizarreness and then they're
slowly bringing in the deep storyline
