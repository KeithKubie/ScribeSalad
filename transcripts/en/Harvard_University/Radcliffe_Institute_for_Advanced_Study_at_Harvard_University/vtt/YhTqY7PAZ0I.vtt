00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:05.700
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.550
-Greetings.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.180
And welcome to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.750
My name is Dan Carpenter,
and the Free Professor

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.540
of Government at Harvard and the
Director of the Social Sciences

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.060
Program at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.470
We are here tonight
to experience

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.700
a reading of the play
Sliver Of A Full Moon.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.400
Tonight's reading is supported
by the Harvard University

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Native American Program, or
HUNAP, the Academic Ventures

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
Program at Radcliffe, the
Harvard Native Law Students

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.170
Association, Harvard
Divinity School, the Standing

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.140
Committee on Ethnicity,
Migration, and Rights,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.440
and the Donald T. Reagan
Lecture Fund, with support also

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.510
from the National Indigenous
Women's Resource Center,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.160
and the Office of the
President and Provost

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.910
at Harvard University.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.690
Tonight's event
also marks something

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.880
of a critical event in a
much longer drama, namely

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.240
a set of events and
programs for the discussion

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.310
of vital Native
American and indigenous

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.940
issues, a theme running through
the 2015-2016 academic year

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
here at Radcliffe, and a
theme chosen in partnership

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.670
with HUNAP entitled "The
Performance of Native

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.260
and Indigenous Politics."

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.880
Radcliffe has embarked upon
this series of conversations

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.690
and events not because
the Institute has

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.360
particular expertise
in this area,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.650
but because Radcliffe and
Harvard have clear needs,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.210
and indeed, obligations
to enrich our dialogue

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.060
on native and indigenous issues.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.240
A university is a conversation,
a highly bureaucratized

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.260
conversation to be sure, but
a vital dialogue nonetheless.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.620
And it is vital to
the future of Harvard

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.480
and in deep consistency
with Harvard's native past

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.450
that the voice of Native
American and indigenous peoples

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.080
here be amplified
and strengthened.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.940
I hope tonight's event can
play a part, even a small part,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.570
in that strengthening,
in that amplification.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.640
And it is with thanks
to HUNAP and associated

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.560
native and native studies
leaders at Harvard

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250
that this process
has been renewing.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.330
We at Radcliffe are
pleased and honored to play

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.490
a small collaborative part in
this much larger and longer

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.710
term dialogue.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.640
Previous events in
the series of events

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.190
that we're talking about
here included a talk

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.410
at Harvard Law School by
Professor Angela Riley of UCLA

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.430
on indigenous women,
violence, and human rights.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300
She is, by the way,
with us tonight.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.920
Also, a reading of poetry by
Anishinaabe poet and literature

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.680
scholar, Gerald
Vizenor and a lecture

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.640
last year by Yale
professor Ned Blackhawk.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.020
Future events will include
a poetry reading by Luci

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.550
Tapahonso, the inaugural poet
laureate of the Navajo Nation,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.370
a lecture by Native
Hawaiian writer,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.440
Kristiana Kahakauwila
a photographic exhibit

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.290
by Matika Wilbur
of her Project 562,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.800
surveying all federally
recognized Native American

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.060
tribes, and the conference
"Native Peoples,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.810
Native Politics"
on April 29, 2016,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.050
followed the next day by
the annual HUNAP Powwow.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.670
Everyone here is
welcome to these events,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.600
and I remind you that all of
these events I just mentioned

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.770
are listed in tonight's
program, and equally

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.170
on the Radcliffe website.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.200
Now, let me introduce Shelly
Lowe of the Navajo Nation, who

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.060
serves as executive director of
the Harvard University Native

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360
American Program.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.130
Native and indigenous
students at Harvard

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.860
can testify to the warm and
supportive home away from home

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.860
that HUNAP provides.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.800
They testify, in fact,
every day with their feet

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.716
as they hang out
in HUNAP's offices.

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:03.590
They're pretty comfy.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.500
I've been there myself.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.280
Shelly and her group
have demonstrated

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.500
amazing and energetic
commitment to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.570
the Native American
community at Harvard

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.080
and to the joint programming
year at Radcliffe.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.675
And I can speak for
everyone at Radcliffe

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:19.300
when I say that it
has been a privilege

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.410
to work with her and with
faculty chair, Doctor Dennis

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.000
Norman, community
coordinator Jason

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.790
Packineau, administrative
assistant, Samantha Hernandez,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.060
and the entire HUNAP community.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.670
We are honored, and
I am lucky, to call

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.530
them Harvard colleagues.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.394
Shelly.

00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:44.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.460
--[NON-ENGLISH] Dan, thank
you for those words.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:58.770
My name is Shelly Lowe.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.240
I'm Navajo from Ganado, Arizona.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.080
On behalf of HUNAP, I would like
to welcome everyone tonight.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.190
And along with the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.280
I thank you for joining us.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.620
I would like to acknowledge
the Wampanoag, Nipmuc,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.830
and Massachusetts people whose
homeland we are on tonight,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.420
and I want to thank you thank
them for their stewardship

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.870
and for their
continued leadership.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.980
As I was preparing
for tonight's remarks,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.010
I was struck by some
words in an article

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.890
about the young
Sicangu Lakota artist,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.700
Frank Waln who
will be joining us

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.920
in April at one of our events.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.690
The writer of the
article states,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.010
"We are born into stories.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.400
All of us.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.550
We must learn to address
the sins of the past

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.130
so that we can
break and transcend

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.780
those cycles of
trauma and abuse.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.690
These are the sorts
of messages we find

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.620
in art worth talking about.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.380
As native and
indigenous people, we

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.190
are each born into specific
and very purposeful

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.860
creation stories.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.474
We embody these stories, and we
continue to live in them today.

00:05:58.474 --> 00:05:59.890
Many of us were
told these stories

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.320
at a very young age in
order to educate us,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.400
or to teach us how to behave
in certain situations,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.510
or to explain to us the natural
and the spiritual world that we

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.770
live in."

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.040
It seems quite often, though,
some stories were reiterated

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.140
to us by older
brothers and sisters,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.640
or by aunties and uncles,
in order to scare us.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.690
Naturally, many of our stories
are about negative entities

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.920
that often prey on our
people, particularly

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.160
our women and our children.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
These bad entities
can take many forms.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.980
They can be earthly beings.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.080
They can be animal beings.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.940
They can be spiritual
beings, and they

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.210
can be other human beings.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.340
These beings can wreck
havoc on our people

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.196
in violent and deadly waste.

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:48.570
What our teasing family members
often neglect to tell us,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.260
however, is that our
stories almost always

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.680
end with a defeat of
these negative entities.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.200
Our stories give us solutions
and ways to defend ourselves.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.820
They explain challenges
we must overcome in order

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.670
to acquire specific
weapons or behaviors needed

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.840
to defend the young, the
old, our women, and our men

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.740
from beings that
threaten or hurt us.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.340
Our stories assure us that
we can be safe, healthy,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.864
and strong communities.

00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:21.780
Tonight, we are going
to hear a new creation .

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.930
Story the story is about a
threat to our communities.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.810
It is about finding a way to
defend our women and children.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.290
This story's being told to
us tonight to encourage us

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.530
and to remind us we can
overcome challenges.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.070
Tonight's story, however,
doesn't have a complete ending.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.620
In this story, we
are only beginning

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.340
to understand and gather
legal weapons needed

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.580
to defend our women.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.700
Tonight's story
provides only a sliver

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.320
of the solution needed
to protect our futures.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.050
Still, the message of tonight's
story are worth talking about.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.330
Because the more
we tell this story,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.460
the closer we'll come to
achieving a full moon instead

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.140
of a sliver of a full moon.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.870
I want to invite Aharon
Kaslow, and Esther Labrado

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.770
to come up and say a
few words on behalf

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.298
of the Native American Law
Student Association at Harvard.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:23.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.620
Hello and welcome.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.159
My name is Esther
Labrado, and I am

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.240
a member of the North
Fork Rancheria Mono

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.799
Indians, California, and a
descendant of the Morongo

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.164
band of Mission Indians.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:40.539
And as Shelly
mentioned, I'm also

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.650
the co-president, along
with Aharon Kaslow,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.520
of the Harvard Native American
Law Student's Association.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.680
And we are just so excited
to be here tonight.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.247
And we want to say thank
you to HUNAP, and Radcliffe,

00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:51.830
and to everyone else
who has worked so

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.720
hard to make tonight possible.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.270
Harvard NALSA works
hard to foster

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.060
an educational and social
atmosphere for Native students

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.720
at Harvard Law School, and to
raise awareness and encourage

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.040
dialogue about issues facing
the Native American community.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.340
We host and cosponsor events
throughout the school year

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.145
to further these
goals, which is why

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:12.630
we're so excited to be
part of this event tonight.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.470
The issue is
incredibly important,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.790
not just in the Native
American community,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.120
but it's also important, and a
good example of why we're here.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.080
The statistics about domestic
violence against Native women

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.450
are both staggering
and heartbreaking.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.940
And the fact that for so
long, so many of those crimes

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.304
went unpunished is even worse.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.720
As you will learn
through the play

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.700
and through the panel
discussion afterwards,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.010
it was a law that allowed those
offenders to go unpunished.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.100
And it is the law that has
attempted to change that.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.920
This event is important to me,
not just as a Native woman,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.639
but as a law student
and as a future lawyer.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.180
I came to law school
because I wanted

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.790
to be able to more
effectively help others,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.600
and to provide a voice for
those who so often go unheard.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.840
If I can use my logically
to in some small way

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.430
help Native communities
on the issues

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.960
that they will continue to
face, I'll be forever grateful.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.680
-As Esther said, my
name's Aharon Kaslow,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.750
and I'm a descendant
of Ione Band of Miwok

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.350
Indians in Northern California.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.530
And to echo Esther's
comments, I'd

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.710
like to think
Radcliffe and HUNAP,

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.960
and everyone else involved for
bringing this play to Harvard.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.560
To me, A Sliver of a Full
Moon represents, actually,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.190
a celebration of
Native communities

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.631
working and striving to improve
the lives of our Native women.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:34.130
I mean, this is
especially important

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.330
because in my community and in
Native communities in general,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.910
it's our tradition to honor
and respect our Native woman.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.372
And while I was thinking
about what to say right now,

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.080
I realized that at
this point in my life,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.970
I'm truly blessed to be honored
and surrounded by a bunch

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.960
of amazing Native women.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.570
My co-president,
Esther, who takes

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.400
the lion's share of the work,
because she can manage it

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.350
better than I can.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.750
Liz and Lauren are our
two 3L's who are extremely

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.540
successful at Harvard Law.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.070
Maggie McKinley, Climenko
Fellow at Harvard Law,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.160
who been an amazing mentor
and caring friend to me,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.330
and Visiting Professor
Angela Riley who's

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.027
opened my eyes to the world
of federal Indian law.

00:11:17.027 --> 00:11:18.610
I'm thankful to all
of you for helping

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.420
me continue to grow as a person,
a student, and a Native man.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.540
I also want to thank
my mother, who I

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.510
don't think is here right now.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.005
But she grew up
in extreme poverty

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:32.380
and faced conditions
that are too

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.870
common in Native communities.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.800
Yet as a single mother, who
first without a high school

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.120
diploma, and now is a
doctoral student at Harvard,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.210
worked her entire life to
ensure that I didn't experience

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.030
what she had to go through.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.710
To me, she's the perfect example
of why our Indian communities

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.080
honor their women, and why we
need to continue this practice.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.020
She and the other
native women I mentioned

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.619
work tirelessly for others
and for our communities.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.410
And now I'm excited to
watch a play written

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.380
by another native woman, Mary
Katheryn Nagle, and a play

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.580
that I believe honors
this tradition.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.864
Thank you.

00:12:08.864 --> 00:12:14.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.090
-And we now welcome to the
stage Mary Anne Hendricks

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.670
with a blessing.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.490
-Good evening.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.420
Creator, Almighty
Creator, hear me.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.630
First of all, I want to
acknowledge the Radcliffe

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.800
Institute and Harvard
University Native American

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.580
Program for giving
me this opportunity

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.460
to bless those who
have worked tirelessly

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.720
to bring about a very important
change in the Violence Against

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.490
Women Act.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.590
We pray that the reauthorization
of our 2013 brings

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.890
hope to many, that
finally there will

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.440
be justice for the
horrendous treatment

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.970
that Indian women have
endured on reservations

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.460
throughout this country.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.050
I also want to acknowledge
the first people on whose land

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.520
we stand and their ancestors,
and to bless the many tribes

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.150
represented here tonight.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.920
We pray for the survivors
of domestic violence

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.880
those nightmares, physical,
and emotional scars

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.340
are reminders of what
love meant to them.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.120
Yes, we know all too
well what PTSD is,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.970
and healing is a long process.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.180
We pray that children will
learn at an early age,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.370
through teachings and examples,
that love means respect,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.355
kindness, compassion,
and that it

00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:45.830
is important to love oneself,
to expect fairness and equality

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.460
in any relationship.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.470
We pray that Sliver
of a Full Moon

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.680
brings everybody
together with strength

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.740
to break the silence
of domestic violence.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.860
-Thank you, Sachem Hendricks.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.090
We will now begin the reading.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.950
I wish to note that Diane
Millich of the Southern Ute

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.720
Tribe is unable to be
with us this evening.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.960
And her role be occupied by
the playwright, Mary Kathryn

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.670
Nagle of the Cherokee
Nation of Oklahoma.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.531
And now we present
Sliver of a Full Moon.

00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:31.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.944
-[SINGING NON-ENGLISH]

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.070
-I remember where I was.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.450
-I remember what I was doing.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.800
-I remember what I was thinking.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.040
-And I will never forget.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.420
-I was on the
floor of the House.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.980
-At my home in Fairfax.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.940
-On my reservation.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.550
-In Cherokee.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.310
-In Alaska.

-Watching the vote.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.417
-Working for votes.

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:06.250
-I couldn't breathe.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.130
-I was so nervous.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.360
-All I could do was pray.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.070
-What's the vote?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.570
-30.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.460
-We got 30?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.419
-We need 218.

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:12.210
-We need your vote.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.010
-You got my vote.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.540

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.680
-My whole life.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.880
-I've dreamed of this.

-85.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.870
-I've prayed for this.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.770
-114.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.930
-You've got my vote, Tom.

-115.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.817
-Everything depends on this.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:24.400
-What if lose?

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.350
-We can't lose.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.050
-Not an option.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:26.550
-201.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.176

00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:28.760
-Oh, my god.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.400
-I just prayed to Creator.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.240

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.130
-Holy smokes.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.890
-216.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.690
-We got this.

00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:37.240
-Is this for real?

-218.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.570
-We did it.

-218.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.164
-218?

-They're still coming.

-More votes.

-I couldn't believe it.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.367
-Unbelievable.

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:53.200
-I had to call Jacks

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.370
-Terry texted me.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.590
-I just started texting.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.500
-I started crying.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.112
-I could hardly see who I was
texting, I was crying so hard.

00:16:59.112 --> 00:16:59.820
-I had to scream.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.830
-I scared my neighbors.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.270
-I did victory dance.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.620
-I prayed for my sister.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.660
-It just seemed unreal.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.819
-It felt like a dream.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:06.829
-It was amazing.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.670
-It was humbling.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.950
-It was a miracle.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.530
-What about Alaska?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.780
-Next time.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.569
-Why where we left out?

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:14.849
We were told--

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.060
-Everyone says--

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.320
-Alaska's different.

00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:20.650
-Why are we different?

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.770
When Violence Against Women's
Act passed, I was watching TV,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.410
and I started to cry.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.145
The rate of violence against
Native women in Alaska

00:17:34.145 --> 00:17:37.280
are higher than anywhere
else in the United States.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.640
And yet, however,
we're always forgotten.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.910
Violence like this in our
village did not always exist.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.140
There was a time before the
United States, Alaska, a state,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.730
a time when our tribal
government had authority.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.910
If a man mistreated a
woman in our village,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:00.010
our tribal government would
exercise its jurisdiction

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.510
and protect our women.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.960
But when the federal government
made Alaska a state in 1959,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.410
they took away our lands,
our culture, our language,

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.640
our jurisdiction,
and our safety.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.750
Tribal sovereignty in
Alaska is a dirty word.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.880
Most people want to
pretend we don't exist.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.800
But the truth is
we're still here.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.520
We'll always be here.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.400
We will never leave.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.230
Alaska, the state, has
a bit of dual mentality.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.550
First it was the Russians
and fur, then the Americans

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.500
and gold.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.480
Now, it's the oil
and the pipeline.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.120
But my people, we have been
here for thousands of years,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.990
from the time of the
glacier until now.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.820
We were here before
the Russians.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.000
We were here when they came.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.420
Our men gave them fur.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.270
And in exchange,
gave us the alcohol.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.790
And then they took our women.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.910
-This one.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.420
-We had no choice.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.220
-Just one night.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.830
I'll bring her back.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.520
-We had Columbus.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.610
We had the Russians.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.540
Tell me how is that different?

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.860
-This is my story.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.960
-This is my story.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.110
-This is my story.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.500
-The story of my sister.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.140
-My daughter.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.140
-The story of my mother.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.890
-And her mother.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.100
-And her mother's mother.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.950
-My grandmother.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.100
-My granddaughter.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.100
-This is the story of my life.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.800
-Of my path.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.880
-Of my people.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.420
-This is my story.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.340
-At first, it was
hard to share it.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.910
-I had to keep it a secret.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.890
-I was too ashamed.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.720
-Too embarrassed.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.440
-Too afraid.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.080
-Scared.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.840
-Forgotten.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.890
-I was silenced.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.030
-I thought I'd be judged--

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.610
-For something I never did.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.080
-But then we came together.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.180
-We stopped the silence.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.440
-If I wasn't Native, my
story would be different.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.370
-If I didn't live
on my reservation

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.120
-My story would be different.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.770
-If I wasn't a citizen of
a sovereign Indian nation.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.680
-My story would be different.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.720
-I live in Alaska.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.990
When it comes to
justice, that shouldn't

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.860
make my story any different.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.750
-This is my story.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.900
-And I'm here to share it.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.670
One sunny afternoon in May,
I was returning my daughters

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.250
to their father,
per our agreement.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.410
I dropped them off and
made sure he was home,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.650
and they were in the house
before leaving, as usual.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.820
But he walked out to
stand beside my car.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.600
I stayed in the car
with the door locked,

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.641
but the car windows were down.

00:20:21.641 --> 00:20:23.880
-[HUMMING]

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.720
-He was agreeable
enough at first.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.610
But then he became
angry because I didn't

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.370
wish him a happy anniversary.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.790
I stated that it
didn't seem appropriate

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.960
under the circumstances.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.660
He suddenly lunged in the car
window and snatched my bag.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.570
He got an address book, flipped
through it, and became angry.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.270
He reached in and grab my
car key from the ignition

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.670
and walked away with keys.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.430
And he was going
to throw the keys.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.190
I live in the mountains
of Western North.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.330
Carolina There are trees
and woods, things like that

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.690
all around everywhere.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.110
And that was the
only car key I had.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.630
And I thought, if
he throws that key,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.580
if I don't have a way
to get out of here,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.230
I don't know what I'll do.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.512
So I was trying to get
the key, and he turned

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:20.640
and he finally said, OK,
you can have your keys,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.550
and threw them on the ground.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.670
So when I leaned down to
get my keys, he kicked me

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.170
and I rolled down a little hill.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.250
At the time, my
youngest daughter

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.442
was standing beside my car.

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:33.900
I didn't even know
she was outside.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.180
And I thought-- I thought
she was in the house.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.590
But when I rolled down the
hill, I rolled role into her,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.250
and she fell.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.900
And he grabbed her.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.240
I was trying to comfort her,
but he grabbed her hands,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.645
and he pulled so hard, that I
was sliding across the ground,

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:56.020
so I let go.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.680
But he went immediately
to the police station,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.570
and he got there before me.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.345
-Can I help you?

00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:03.700
-I need to get a
protective order.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.220
-OK.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.790
Well, uh--

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.050
-Can you do that for me?

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.050
-We don't have jurisdiction
over non-Natives.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.810
-My wife's enrolled, and she's
a danger to our children.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.850
-Fill this out, and
we'll process it.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.390
-It was so humiliating to
be sitting at the police

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.350
department with leaves and grass
in my hair, dirt on my clothes,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.610
and clothes were torn.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:30.640
On my side, on my rib area,
within the next day or two,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.030
a bruise formed shaped
perfectly like his foot.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.440
There must be
something you could do.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.060
-He's enrolled.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.290
-He has my children.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.850
-And a protective
order against you.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.962
So whatever you do,
don't go near them.

00:22:49.962 --> 00:22:53.070
-He had my children, and all
I had was a bruise shaped

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.780
like his foot.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.640
Maybe you've never heard
a Native woman tell

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.290
her story of survival before.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.490
Maybe because you've seen movies
like The Last of the Mohicans

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.100
or Peter Pan, you think
at some point in time,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.160
we ceased to exist.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.090
But we're still here.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.410
Some of us live on reservations.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.490
Some of us live in suburbs.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.965
We even live in Washington, DC.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.910
-Hello.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.170
Hi.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.520
Excuse me.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.260
-Do you need something.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.890
-I'm Terry.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.620
Terry [? Henry. ?]

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.860
-OK.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.780
-Is this office on
Violence Against Women?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.930
-You're looking at it.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.610
-There's no carpet.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:42.910
-Is that a problem?

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.910
-No, I just thought
that there would--

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.450
-You thought 'cause
today is your first day,

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.320
we'd roll out the red carpet?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.520
-I thought there
would be carpet, yes.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.390
-You work for the
federal government now.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.940
You'll learn to do without.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.360
Here's everything you'll need.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.210
To start with, I want
you to draft the RFPs

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.870
that we sent to the tribes.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.740
VAWA provides for a
significant chunk of change.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.950
VAWA.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.190
You know what that is?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.520
-Yes.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.520
-Violence Against Women Act.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.770
-I know.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.880
-We work to stop violence.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.840
We don't promote it.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.220
-I get it.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.150
-Oh, and our
reports to Congress?

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.700
You'll be responsible
for writing those.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.860
Basically, you'll be
doing all of the policy

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.030
work for the implementation of
VAWA grants in Indian country.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.110
Any questions?

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.040
-Yes, just a few.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.402
-Good.

00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:34.950
And welcome.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.850
can We do so much work
with Native Americans.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.870
It's nice to finally
have one in the office.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.820
-My mother.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.220
She's a very beautiful
Indian woman.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.940
And my stepfather, well, he
is a non-native, a white man.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.630
And he's very abusive, ungodly.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.530
The earliest that I remember
is being four years old,

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.090
when we were in
this trailer house,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.760
and my mom was screaming.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.360
I'm under the table.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.520
I'm screaming.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.040
The lights are off.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.440
The lights are coming in
from the post from outside.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.680
The door is here.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.490
The couch is here.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.810
The TV is here, and the
gun rack is right there.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.880
And the table in the kitchen is
right here, and I'm under it.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.040
My mom is screaming,
no, David, no.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.725
And I see him grab the gun.

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.600
And he starts beating
my mother over the head

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.330
with the butt of the shotgun
until the only screams that

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.960
could be heard were mine, coming
from underneath the table.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.940
And I think he beat to what
he believed was to death,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.470
put the gun back on the rack.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.500
He called her a bitch,
walked into the bedroom,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.445
slammed the door, sat down on
the squeaky bed, and the thud,

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:49.820
thud of the cowboy boots
as they hit the floor,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.690
and he laid down in
the squeak bed again,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.510
and he went to sleep.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.450
So I crawled over to my mom.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.730
I'm crying so hard,
because I think she's dead.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.190
So I put my face
down to her mouth

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.225
to see if I could feel her
breath, and I can't feel it.

00:26:03.225 --> 00:26:05.490
And so then I
start crying again.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.320
And I'm only four.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.530
And I make myself stop crying.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.340
I put my head down on her
chest to see if I could

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.020
feel it rising, and it was.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.520
So I grab a blanket off the
couch, and I covered her up.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.910
And I sat by her all night.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.580
And if I fell asleep,
I'd get mad at myself,

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.670
because I'd hurry
up and check to see

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.670
if she was still breathing.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.690
It's not that I
could have saved her.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.970
It's just that I didn't
want her to die alone.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.400
-This isn't an actress.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.830
-Lisa set a survivor.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.000
-I'm a survivor.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.770
-We're all survivors.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.460
-There are times he
would be chasing us.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.280
And there was this field.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.405
And as I grabbed my mom I
said look at that, Momma.

00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.030
The moon is full.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.530
And we crawled across this
field until we got to the woods.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.210
And I took her to
my hiding place,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.254
where we'd listen to him, to
his screams that would echo.

00:26:57.254 --> 00:26:58.670
His screams about
how he was going

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.550
to kill us when he found us.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.800
And she'd lay down,
and she'd go to sleep.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.700
And if I thought I heard him
coming, I would wake her up,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.870
and I would take her
deeper into the woods.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.880
Because he had been in Vietnam.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.910
So when I'd reflect back,
he was afraid of the woods.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.840
He was afraid of the night.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.650
In the woods, the
night, we were safe.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.100
The moon was our sanctuary,
if we could make it.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.000
-I found a rat this morning.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.990
Yes, rat.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.300
Underneath my desk.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.910
And it ripped open
a bag of chips.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:42.150
-You want me to buy
you a bag of chips?

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.440
-Look, I really
need to talk to you.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.220
-About rats?

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.770
-About the grants
we're giving tribes.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.640
-What about them?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.880
-I'm not sure they're
making much of a difference.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.070
-So give them to
different tribes.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.340
-That's not the issue.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.090
-What's the issue?

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.780
-Our women are raped.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.890
They go missing.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.160
They're murdered.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.790
-And our office gives
tribes the money

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.590
they need to deal with that.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.130
-Yes.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.770
But after the fact.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.190
-The fact of what?

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.047
-We come in after the
violence has occurred.

00:28:15.047 --> 00:28:16.630
By the time the women
walk in the door

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.475
of one of our programs,
they're already a victim.

00:28:19.475 --> 00:28:21.650
-Oh, yeah, right.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:26.320
You're not a victim unless
something has happened to you.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.080
Listen here, Pocahontas.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.380
It's a miracle you can give
tribes any funding at all.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.240
A lot of us here in
DC worked hard in '94

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.680
to get the Violence
Against Women's Act passed.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.940
We don't have to ask for funding
for tribal domestic violence

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.580
programs, but we did.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.410
You should be thankful
for what you have.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.515
-Len Hootch and several
women opened day shelter

00:28:55.515 --> 00:28:59.440
in Emmonak, Alaska 27 years ago.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.830
It is still today
the only shelter

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.200
for Native women for the
entire state of Alaska.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.950
When we opened, our
women had nowhere to go.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.760
We'd find them hiding in
smoke houses and steam houses.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.940
They'd tell our tribe, we
don't have jurisdiction,

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.280
that we don't exercise
any kind of authority.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.950
When we call the state
troopers for help,

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.320
it takes two or three days for
them to arrive and to respond.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.740
Our villages are so remote
where I live in Tetlin,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.540
there is no road, so the
only way to come and go

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.290
is by airplane.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.540
For three decades, this
shelter has been the only place

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.840
our women can go.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.690
The state cut our funding.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.420
-I heard.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.110
-What's this?

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.560
-A grant from the
DOJ OBW office.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.110
Enough to keep you open.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.060
-I just put three
women on the street.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.630
-Tell them to come back.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.620
-One of the women, I just
asked her to leave her husband.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.790
Tried to kill her.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.670
-We'll get her a
protection order.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.620
-She has one.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.070
The tribe issued it last week.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.780
-That's great.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.700
-The state of Alaska
refuses to enforce it.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.819
-How can they refuse to
enforce a protection order?

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:21.360
-They say we don't
have jurisdiction.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.510
-What are you doing?

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.470
-What's it look like I'm doing?

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.820
I'm packing.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.650
-Did you ask for time off?

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.800
-No.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.545
-Our report to Congress is
due at the end of the month.

00:30:35.545 --> 00:30:36.670
And I'm going to need you--

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:37.720
-I'm not coming back.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.930
-What?

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.250
-I'm going home.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.590
To Cherokee.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.550
-I suppose the rats
were just too much.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.530
-I'm done applying Bandaids.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.860
-Our Bandaids make a difference.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.720
They provide your
people with funding.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.500
-My people don't
need your funding.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.130
-Tribes do.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.560
They want to provide shelter,
and food, and counseling.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.440
-We have to do more than
give women counseling.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.940
-Oh, you're right.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.930
Please stand back and
let me wave my magic wand

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.580
and make all the
violence go away.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.625
-We don't need your magic wand.

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:14.500
We need jurisdiction.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.030
-My people, the
Southern Ute, we're

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.200
the only tribe in Colorado.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.560
I've lived my whole life
here on our reservation.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.750
Our reservation is our
land, and our jurisdiction

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.480
comes from the land.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.890
Creator placed us here, so
we've been here since creation.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.990
And this stripping of our
jurisdiction, this taking it,

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.510
isn't real.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.480
But it almost cost me my life.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.470
When I was 26 years old, I
started dating a non-Indian.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.770
A white man.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.925
I was in love.

00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:52.760
Life was wonderful.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.380
And after the bliss of dating
six months, we were married.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.630
He moved into my house and
lived on my reservation with me.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.505
To my shock, just days after
our marriage, he assaulted me.

00:32:05.505 --> 00:32:07.880
I thought after the first
time, it wouldn't happen again,

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.130
but then it happened a
second time and a third.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.770
So I called for help.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.890
And then I called
for help again.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:15.390
And again.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.360
I called so many times, but
no one could ever help me.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.270
-If you're so upset, why don't
you make one of your calls?

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.950
It's OK, baby.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.200
I'll make it for you.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.930
-Tribal police.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.870
Is this an emergency?

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.360
-Well, not exactly.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.120
-Can I help you.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.850
-I just want to apologize.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.680
Because you see, I got a little
carried away this morning.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.640
And well, I hit my wife.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.680
-Are you enrolled?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.650
-I'm white.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.340
-So you're not enrolled?

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.200
-Is that a problem?

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.270
-You've called before.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.160
-Yeah, well?

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.070
-Nothing's changed.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.900
If you're not enrolled, we
don't have jurisdiction.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.650
-He says he doesn't
have jurisdiction.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.650
You want to talk to him?

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.290
Thanks for your help, Officer.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.710
When will you finally get it?

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.500
-He can do whatever he wants.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.910
-They can't touch me.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.730
-I picked up the phone.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.810
-I made a call.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.040
-I kept calling.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.110
-No one responded.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.611
-I must have called
a hundred times.

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:09.110
-Please.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.140
Can't you do something?

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.190
-The answer was always the same.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.950
-We can't.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.100
He's not enrolled.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.330
He's not Indian.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.890
-So we don't have jurisdiction.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:17.960
-But I kept calling.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.920
-I called the police.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.170
-Please help.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.450
-Every time.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.160
-911.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.080
-911.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.160
-911.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.090
-I need your help.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.950
-But every time I
called, no one showed up.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.510
-They would just sort of report.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.080
-They always let him go.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.640
-I remember looking back those
police reports in eight font.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.650
Years later, my mom asked
me to be her advocate,

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.230
so I pulled all of my
stepfather's police records.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.630
And there were pages,
all of those 911 calls,

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.080
in eight point font.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.860
Individual calls.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.170
There had to have been at least
seven to eight, nine pages.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.130
That's how many 911
calls we made for help.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.650
And he was never, ever once
ever convicted for anything

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.600
he ever did to her.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.410
-It wasn't always this way.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.812
-There was a time before.

00:34:01.812 --> 00:34:03.370
-Before 1978.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.230
-A time when we
had jurisdiction.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.270
-Before Oliphant

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.199
-I remember when
I read Oliphant.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.190
-I can't believe it.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.550
-My dad called me.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.110
-Tribal council convened
an emergency meeting.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.360
-Said you better read this.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.050
-The Supreme Court
issued a decision.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.469
-It's going to change our lives.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.260
-1978.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.530
-The Supreme Court
said we can't prosecute

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.840
non-Natives, non-Indians,
anyone that's not enrolled.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.770
-The Court said we
can't prosecute them

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.520
if they come onto our
lands and commit crimes.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.120
-1978.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.370
-My stepfather, my
husband, he's non-Native.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.070
-Not enrolled.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.489
-And after Oliphant--

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.900
-He began to realize.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.989
-After Oliphant--

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.060
-He figured it out.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.880
-After Oliphant, he knew.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.670
-It didn't matter
if I had bruises.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.409
-Or cuts.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.270
-Or bleeding.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.540
-Or a broken bone.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.800
-Because of Oliphant.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.765
-He could kill me, and
it wouldn't matter.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.100
-As soon as the Supreme
Court issued its decision,

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.680
our sisters from every corner of
Turtle Island went into action.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.110
Our sisters in South Dakota
opened the White Buffalo Calf

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.450
Woman's Shelter, the first
shelter for native women

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.739
in the country.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.280
The fight to restore
our jurisdiction

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.270
continued for several decades.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.510
And in 2003, I was honored
to be at the first meeting

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.780
of our tribal
coalitions in Arizona,

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.360
when we created the National
Congress of American Indians

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.820
Task Force in Violence
Against Women.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.170
We've come a long way since
that meeting back in 2003.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.990
But I know we wouldn't
be where we are now

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.720
if we as Native women
hadn't to stood up.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.640
If we hadn't demanded that our
tribal leaders listen to us.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.240
Many of our tribal leaders
took our messages back home

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.760
to their own tribes,
and we watched

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.720
as our native women gave
birth to a national movement.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.560
--[NON-ENGLISH], and thank
you for having me here today

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.440
to present.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.950
-[NON-ENGLISH]

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.090
-Sorry.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.380
-This is the Eastern Band.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.220
You say [NON-ENGLISH].

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.060
-You're not in Oklahoma anymore.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.142
-So how long will this take?

00:35:59.142 --> 00:36:00.850
-Well, with what I'm
prepared to present,

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.960
not more than 40 minutes.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.556
-No, I mean the campaign.

00:36:03.556 --> 00:36:05.430
How long will it take
to get the bill passed.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.330
Do you know?

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.480
With the tribal
jurisdiction provision?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.980
-Well, with the
Congress, who knows?

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.210
It could take quite a while.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.680
-Quite a while?

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.430
-Months?

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.370
Years?

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.770
-Nothing's guaranteed.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.380
-We've been working
on this for years.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.890
-I'm well aware.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.360
-We sponsored the Wiping
of Your Tears ceremony

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.502
with Senator Biden, prepared
the draft for VAWA 2005.

00:36:25.502 --> 00:36:26.210
-I remember that.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.700
-But you think the time is now.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.570
-We need them to act now.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.130
-You need them to act now.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.990
-This has nothing to do with me.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.260
-Terri here is co-chair
of the NCAI Task Force

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.490
on Violence Against Women.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.930
-We're proud of her appointment.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.260
-It has no effect on
my service to council.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.270
-Sure, it does.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.940
-You're sitting
here telling us we

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.320
ought to advocate for
jurisdiction for everyone.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.340
-Yes.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.150
-Why should Eastern Band
foot the bill for everyone?

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.570
-Because we need jurisdiction.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.570
-If I may interject--

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.860
-Please.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.290
-I know it's a lot to ask, but
you won't be the only ones.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.750
San Manuel stepped
up, and Chief Anderson

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.690
has promised the support of
the Choctaw, Tulalip Cherokee

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:07.370
Nation.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.290
Muscogee Creek?

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:09.780
-I believe so.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.530
-I hope so.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.800
We can't do this alone.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.030
-You won't be.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.364
Everyone is helping.

00:37:14.364 --> 00:37:16.030
See, we have to stop
thinking about this

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.862
as my tribe and their tribe.

00:37:17.862 --> 00:37:20.070
Divide and conquer's been
the other side's philosophy

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.881
since 1492.

00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:22.380
-OK.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.284
But what are we really facing?

00:37:24.284 --> 00:37:25.950
-Why, I'm not sure I
know what you mean.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.060
-If we put money
on this now, what's

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.630
the chance we actually walk
away with jurisdiction?

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.390
-Well, it's going to
be very difficult.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.750
-How difficult?

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.340
-Challenging.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.421
-But not impossible.

00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:38.920
-We couldn't get the Dems to
put it in the Law and Order Act

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.545
just last year.

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:40.570
-That wasn't a campaign.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.153
-Well, if we can't
win the Dems, we'll

00:37:42.153 --> 00:37:43.330
never reach the Republicans.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.160
-This is different.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.020
-Well, I'm being
honest with you, Terri.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.970
-Councilwoman Henry,
Mr. Whitehawk.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.410
And let me tell you something
about our tribal council.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.150
Our tribal council
doesn't do things

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.380
because they're possible.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.400
We do things because it's our
responsibility to do them.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.910
It's our job to protect
every man, woman,

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.040
every child in our community.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.150
And we know that if we
protect a woman in her home,

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.940
then we protect her children.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.130
And that protects her house,
and the house next to her,

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.800
and the house next to that.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.430
And so pretty soon, it's
the entire community

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.400
we're able to protect.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.100
-Yes, but we need to be
realistic about what we can do

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:26.790
in this--

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:30.000
-This isn't about
what we can do.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.190
This is what we should do.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.690
And what we should do is
fight for this Congress

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.670
to recognize the
inherent sovereignty

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.580
we have as a tribal government
to protect our people.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.210
-Put it to vote.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.160
-All in favor?

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.012
-Aye.

00:38:44.012 --> 00:38:44.895
-All opposed?

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.104
-Mr. Whitehawk.

00:38:49.104 --> 00:38:51.270
You've authorized the lobby
on behalf of the Eastern

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.360
Band of Cherokees for the
reauthorization of the Violence

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.280
Against Women Act,
specifically to advocate

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.220
for the passage of the proposed
tribal jurisdiction provision.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.180
Meeting's adjourned.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.650
We'll send you the contract.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.610
-Thank you.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:06.470
-[NON-ENGLISH]

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.390
-Do we expect a
full court press?

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.840
-You'll get nothing less.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.450
-Very difficult.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.440
-This will be difficult.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.690
-You know what's difficult?

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.870
Listening to women who've been
raped, abused, and battered

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.030
asking for help, and
having to tell them

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.090
there's nothing you
can do, because you

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.480
don't have jurisdiction.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.260
-Hey, I was tribal police
before I went to law school.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.950
Now, I'd get a call and
before I could help her,

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.680
I'd have to ask, where is she?

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.470
-Is she on land
that's tribal trust?

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.710
-Or land that's been sold?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.090
-She could be on fee land.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.970
-And you can't just
ask, where is she?

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.680
-You have to ask, who is he?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.610
-Is he Indian?

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.490
Is he enrolled?

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.440
-Because if he's not--

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.230
-Tribal police don't
have jurisdiction.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.320
-Heh.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.690
Makes you want to
never answer the phone.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.200
I'll get us two tickets
for DC for Monday.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.210
-Two?

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.050
You're going to walk
the halls with me.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.810
-I think you're confused.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:39:59.819
I hired you.

00:39:59.819 --> 00:40:00.860
Not the other way around.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.990
-Hey, I'll do the work.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.460
But I need you to be the voice.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.390
-Why me?

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.040
-You're a woman and
a tribal leader.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.880
You're Councilwoman Henry.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.930
-Please.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:10.830
Call me Terri.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:13.950
-I'll have my staffer get
started on this right away.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.844
-We really do think
now is the time.

00:40:15.844 --> 00:40:17.010
Before this year's election.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.970
-Of course.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.990
The Republicans desperately
need women voters.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.527
-And we can capitalize on that.

00:40:21.527 --> 00:40:23.860
-Is there someone you can
reach out to across the aisle?

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.719
-Crapo's agreed to cosponsor.

00:40:25.719 --> 00:40:27.510
-You're going to give
this to a Republican?

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.980
-Mike's good on Indian Affairs.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.840
-Trust me, Terri.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.970
No one's going listen to
a Democrat from Vermont.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.930
-We need him on this one.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.600
-OK.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.589
-I'll have my staffer send you
a draft of what we put together.

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:40.880
-And you're serious about this?

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.570
-We're 100% with you.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.760
-But are you really with us?

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.560
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.410
-When you can't get
the 60 votes you need,

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.640
what's going to be on
the chopping block?

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.870
-That's not how it works.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.280
-Don't get cheeky with me.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.280
-Terri.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.380
-If it's anything like
the last 400 years,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.860
do you know who will
be the first of all?

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.630
Not immigrants.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.350
Not LGBTQ.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:01.930
It'll be our Indian women.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.390
-That won't happen.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.320
This bill won't protect anyone
if it doesn't protect everyone.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.300
-I promise.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.820
We won't reauthorize VAWA
without the tribal jurisdiction

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.055
provision.

00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:15.180
-Well, we got the Chair of
the Judiciary Committee.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.080
That's a good start.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.030
-What next?

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.170
We're scheduled to
visit Murkowski.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:20.850
-What's wrong?

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.530
-I just got an email
from her staffer.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.900
She canceled our meeting.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.160
-Senator, thank you for moving
things around in your schedule

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.370
so you could speak with me.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.600
-What do we need to discuss?

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.340
-VAWA.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.420
-I made my position clear.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.800
-We know you intend
to vote for it.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.730
-There's not a woman in
the Senate who isn't.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.990
-The folks back in Juneau.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.680
-Your boss?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.780
-The Attorney General thinks the
tribal jurisdiction provision

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.824
could use some editing.

00:41:45.824 --> 00:41:47.490
-The committee's
agreed on the language.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.200
-What about a clarification?

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.110
-I think the language
is pretty clear.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.990
-Tribal jurisdiction
is only restored

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.690
to tribes in Indian country.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.850
-You want me to reference
the Supreme Court's decision

00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.630
on Venetie?

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.170
-What a great idea, Senator.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.300
I wish I'd thought
of that myself.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.660
-I told them to include Alaska.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.960
I can't tell the committee
I change my mind.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.899
-Tell them Alaska's different.

00:42:10.899 --> 00:42:13.440
You and I both know there's no
Indian country left in Alaska.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.710
-I was born in 1958.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.980
Alaska wasn't a state then.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.990
To me and to my family,
it was simply our home.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.730
Growing up, I didn't speak
English until I was 12.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.300
My first day at the
BIA school, the teacher

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.180
told me never speak Athabascan.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.120
You speak English.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.890
When I did speak in my language,
the teacher slapped my mouth

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.670
with a ruler, or my hands.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.440
Sometimes, she
would pull my hair.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.050
At first, I was
shocked, but BIA school

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.960
was the first time
I saw violence.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.610
One day, after I got my hair
pulled, I ran home to my mom

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:00.030
and I told her, I'm
never going back.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.450
They hit me if I
speak my language,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.920
and I don't ever
want to go back.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.800
She was silent for a long time.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.270
And then she said, you have to.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.860
If you don't, they'll
take you away,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.520
and I might never see you again.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.770
I learned at a very young
age that if I was quiet,

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.340
I was safe.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.950
As a child, they taught
us for Native Alaskans,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.780
silence was our only safety.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.480
-The Senator can't meet with
you today, so it'll be me.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.030
I'm sorry.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.350
And you are?

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.400
-Terri Henry.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.810
I serve on the Council of
Eastern Band of Cherokee.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.310
-She's the co-chair
for the National

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.510
Congress of American Indians
Committee on Violence

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.440
Against Women.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.620
-OK.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.362
-Now we're here to
discuss Leahy Crapo.

00:43:46.362 --> 00:43:48.070
If you've had a chance
to read the bill--

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.736
-Look, I'm going to
stop you right there

00:43:49.736 --> 00:43:50.760
and be honest with you.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.550
We're willing to stay
as late as we need

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.470
to tonight to work things out--

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.150
-And what's on the table?

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.660
-We'd like to propose
some language.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.390
We brought our pajamas.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.900
-Guess I forgot mine.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.430
-Wait.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.330
You removed jurisdiction.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.290
-We replaced with
federal delegation.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.410
-Well, that won't work.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:10.911
-It has to.

00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:11.410
-No.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.830
Congress needs to restore
jurisdiction, not delegate it.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.380
-Congress can't recognize
jurisdiction in Indian tribes.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.750
-Why not?

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.580
-It's unconstitutional.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.470
-No.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.260
It's pre-constitutional.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.440
We existed as sovereign
nations before you even

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.460
had this document you
call a constitution.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:26.960
-Terri.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.590
-The Supreme Court
was clear in Oliphant.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.440
Tribes don't have jurisdiction.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.430
I mean, over non-Natives.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.850
You, of course,
have jurisdiction

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:35.830
over your own people.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.240
-Just not your people.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.290
-If this is your attempt to
charm the Senator into voting

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.830
for the bill, you're failing.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.590
-Hey, we've got
the votes we need.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.450
-In the Senate,
not in the House.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.250
-I'm sorry.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.180
Does Senator Cornyn get
a vote in the House?

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.330
-Look.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.394
We're here to negotiate
a deal with you.

00:44:53.394 --> 00:44:54.810
And you want to
negotiate with us,

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.850
so you're going to have
to negotiate with Cantor.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:59.125
-I'd rather talk to Cantor.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.190
-Fine.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.140
-Thank you for your time.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.710
-You might pass in the
Senate, but you'll never

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:09.534
pass in the House.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.080
-We got to work on tone.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.517
-Tone?

00:45:15.517 --> 00:45:17.600
-We're asking people to
give us something we want.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.400
-We're asking them
to give us what

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.770
they should have never taken.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.850
-Well, I agree with that.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.932
But it's 2012, not 1877.

00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:25.265
We have to take what we can get.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:29.930
-There was a time.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.080
-Before now.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.650
-There was a time
when we were safe.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.020
-When we didn't have
this kind of violence.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.470
-Not like we do now.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.700
-Our men knew to view
women in the sacred manner.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.960
-Not to say that we lived
in a perfect society.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.660
-Because we didn't.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.420
But we certainly didn't
live in a society

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.280
where women are
treated like this.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.610
-It was never like this.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:49.840
-They introduced it.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.660
-When the soldiers
came to round us up.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.130
-To send us on the
Trail or Tears.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.200
-When they first put
us on the reservation.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.390
-When they forced us to
go back to their schools.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.890
-We had to hide.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.010
-We had to go to the fort.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.960
-To get our food.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.990
-To get our ration.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.890
-Our commodities.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.080
-From the soldiers.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.090
-And when we went to the
fort to get our food.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.896
-What's this?

00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:11.460
-I've come for my rations.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.030
-We're all out.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.350
-Please, sir.

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:15.360
I have children.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.870
-I said we're all out.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:20.390
-I have to feed my children.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.290
-Come in back.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.610
Are you deaf?

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.881
I said come in back.

00:46:25.881 --> 00:46:27.880
You don't get something
for nothing around here.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.215
You want to feed your
children, come in back.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.650
-My grandmother.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:35.830
-Our grandmothers.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.210
-Our grandmothers.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.507
-They were raped--

00:46:38.507 --> 00:46:39.590
-By the government agent--

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:40.340
-For food--

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.680
-To feed their children.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.060
-Raped by the soldiers.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.500
-Just because they could.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.420
-They had to run.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.550
They had to hide.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.630
-They had no choice.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.870
-Our grandmothers.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.300
-My grandmother.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.380
-They're survivors.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.660
-Survivors of war.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.230
-They weren't targeted because
of the color of their skin.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.480
-We aren't targeted because
of the color of our skin.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.810
-We're targeted because of
who we are, as Indian women--

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.620
as Native American women,

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.880
-As Alaska Native women.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.100
-Because we're citizens
of sovereign nations.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.990
-Because we're sovereign women.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.810
-It's been this way for 500
years, since the Russians came.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:14.990
-Since 1492.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.530
-Since 1978.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:17.790
-We're still sovereign.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.690
-I wish I could say
the war has ended.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.770
-But we live in
conflict every day.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.790
-It's time for a change.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.840
-That's awful.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.640
-It's the truth.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.990
-I had no idea.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.815
-Senator Brown.

00:47:27.815 --> 00:47:28.690
Do you have a minute?

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:29.924
-This is coming from Crapo?

00:47:29.924 --> 00:47:30.590
-I'm in no rush.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:31.230
-Yes.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.860
-Right.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.040
-OK.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.498
I'd like to talk
to you about VAWA.

00:47:33.498 --> 00:47:35.010
-Senator Heller
wants you to know--

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.530
-The tribal
jurisdiction provision--

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.600
-You have his vote.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.120
-Thank you.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.200
You have my vote.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.360
-For Leahy-Crapo?

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:40.910
-Yes.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.180
-Well, thank you.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.470
Senator Collins.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.370
-Yes?

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.990
Do I know you?

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.740
-Dennis Whitehawk.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.800
I represent the Eastern
Band of Cherokee--

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.940
-And you want to talk
to me about VAWA.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.830
-Yes.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:53.870
-I spoke to Patty.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.050
-We have some questions.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.260
-I like her answers.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.210
-The tribal jurisdiction
provision is very important.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.590
-You have my vote.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:01.180
-Thank you.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.750
-Senator McCain agrees.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:03.500
You have his vote.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.000
-Thank you.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.460
But he doesn't think
it'll pass the House.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.596
-Senator Snowe--

00:48:07.596 --> 00:48:08.720
-We'd like to discuss VAWA.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720
-Sure.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.010
-Jurisdiction is critical.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.950
Without it--

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.890
-You have my vote.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.170
-Thank you.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:18.950
-And the vote of every
Republican woman in the Senate.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.590
-That's great

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.125
-You look surprised.

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:25.350
We just-- I guess
I didn't you didn't

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.890
think a bunch of Republicans
would support you

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.080
on this let me
tell you something.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.840
We may be Republicans, but
first and foremost, we're women.

00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:38.250
-That's--

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.740
-A lot of Republicans.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.830
-I talked Brown.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:41.830
-I spoke to Snowe.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:42.690
-McCain's staffer.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.450
-And Heller.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.410
-They said yes.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:45.650
-We might have enough votes.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:47.595
-Senator Moran wanted
me to tell you--

00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:48.095
-Nope.

00:48:48.095 --> 00:48:50.730
- --that Senator Rubio,
with all due respect--

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.170
-He can't vote for this.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.700
-You won't change
my mind on this.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.580
-Did he say why?

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.340
-If you can't
negotiate with Cornyn,

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.246
you can't negotiate with him.

00:48:58.246 --> 00:48:59.370
-Let me get this straight--

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:00.820
-Big government
and inefficiency.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.090
-The tribal jurisdiction
provision restores jurisdiction

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.000
at the local level.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.605
-I'm sorry.

00:49:05.605 --> 00:49:07.720
-You're taking authority
away from the state--

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.950
-I don't believe this.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.840
- --and giving it to the Feds.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.530
-That is not at all
what we're doing.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.360
-I read the bill.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.440
Senator Shelby wanted
me to tell you--

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.812
-McCain's voting for it.

00:49:16.812 --> 00:49:17.520
-I'm Senator Lee.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.450
Not McCain.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.500
-His vote is no.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.600
-Does he understand?

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.090
-I'm late for a meeting.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.330
-Oh, Senator Toomey.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:24.140
-Yes?

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.640
-I'd like to talk
to you about VAWA.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.370
-Oh.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.180
-I have a meeting
with Senator Weicker.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.112
-He's not here.

00:49:29.112 --> 00:49:31.570
-Look, the tribal jurisdiction
provision is very important.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.434
-I understand your position.

00:49:33.434 --> 00:49:34.350
-When will he be back?

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.040
-But I've made up my mind.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.490
-We said we would discuss VAWA.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:38.600
-I discussed it with him.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.720
-My vote is no.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.780
-He's against it.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.630
-No?

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.930
-I'm sorry I can't help you.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:44.770
-We just don't agree here.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.160
-Thank you for your time.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.260
-I spoke to [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.160
-Where's the White House?

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.120
-Well, they're fully on board.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.703
-That's great.

00:49:51.703 --> 00:49:53.920
-Leahy says they're
voting this week.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.620
-Do we have enough votes?

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.650
-I don't know.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:00.360
-I'm worried we don't.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.945
-Senator Murray?

00:50:01.945 --> 00:50:03.070
-I hear what you're saying.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:04.670
-We have a right to this water.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.900
-Everyone says they have
a right to the water.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.151
-Yes, but this water is ours.

00:50:08.151 --> 00:50:09.150
-Let me see what I can--

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:11.570
-We signed a treaty with
you, your government.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.830
-Let me see what I can do.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:13.680
-Thank you.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.360
-Deborah, one more thing.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.200
-Yeah?

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:16.980
-VAWA.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.100
-OK.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.080
-I need to be honest with you.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.740
Sean?

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.790
I need you to tell Deborah
everything you told me.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:25.550
Everything.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.990
-The vote's most likely to
happen in the next day or so.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.840
-That's great.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.360
-The tribal jurisdiction
provision won't be in it.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.070
-What?

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.450
-It's been taken out.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:35.950
-What about the
immigrant provision?

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:36.740
-Still in there.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.030
-LGBTQ?

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.550
-Still in.

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.351
-You realize we have tribal
members who are LGBTQ.

00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:41.850
-Sure.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.660
-They won't be protected.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.760
Without jurisdiction,
VAWA will do nothing

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.880
to protect them on tribal lands.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.950
-We don't have the votes.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.790
-If we fight for tribal
jurisdiction now,

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:52.170
we'll lose the whole thing.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.730
-We can't afford to
lose the entire VAWA.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:56.170
-What about my women?

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.140
My citizens?

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.310
The women that I represent?

00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.010
-We're so sorry.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:50:59.760
-We wrote letters.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.690
We came here to speak.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.976
-It's been decided.

00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:03.600
-I could hold--

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.141
-There must be
something we could do.

00:51:05.141 --> 00:51:06.570
-I could hold a
press conference.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.236
-You think that would
make a difference?

00:51:08.236 --> 00:51:10.000
-It would if you
agreed to speak.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.530
-I'm not a policy analyst.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:12.830
-You're a tribal leader.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.270
-Yes, but--

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.370
-You're in here talking me
about your treaty rights.

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:19.935
Isn't that what VAWA's about?

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:28.260
It's really my honor to
introduce to Vice Councilwoman

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.020
Deborah Parker, very courageous
in coming forward today

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.970
to talk personally
about why this

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.270
is so very important
to her and to so many

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.930
other Native American women.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.030
-Thank you, Senator Murray,
Senator Boxer, and Senator

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.110
Klobuchar Good morning.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.320
My name Deborah Parker.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.600
I am an enrolled member
of the Tulalip Tribes

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.380
of the State of Washington.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.760
I'm currently serving as the
Vice Chair of the Tulalip

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.960
tribes.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.710
Yesterday, I shared
with Senator Murray

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.750
the reasons why the
Violence Against Women

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.050
Act is so important to
our Native American women.

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:05.720
I did not expect to be
sharing my own story.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.950
I am a Native
American statistic.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:11.210
I am a survivor of sexual
and physical violence.

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.130
My story starts in
the '70s as a toddler.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.440
You may wonder, how do I
remember when this occurred?

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.760
I was the size of
a couch cushion,

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.960
a red velvet, approximately
2 and 1/2 feet couch cushion.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.550
One of the many girls
violated and attacked

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.710
by a man that had no boundaries
or regards for a little girl's

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:32.140
life, or my own.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.330
The man responsible
was never convicted.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.100
In the early '80s,
at a young age,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.900
I was asked to babysit
my auntie's children.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.360
During a late hours
of the evening,

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.870
she arrived but was not alone.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.820
Instead of up packing
my things to go home,

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.280
my sense was to quickly
grab the children.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.760
The four or five men that
followed my auntie home

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.920
raped her.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.600
I had to protect the
children and hide.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.390
I could not save my auntie.

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.640
I only heard her cries.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.470
Today is the first time that
I have ever shared this story.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.260
She died at a young age.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.340
The perpetrators were
never prosecuted.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.180
A majority of our
girls have struggled

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.100
with sexual and
domestic violence,

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.050
not once but repeatedly.

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:19.090
My question for Congress
was and always has been,

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.690
why did you not protect me?

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.530
-Why didn't you
protect my family?

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.390
-My auntie?

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:26.140
-My mother?

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:26.850
-My daughter?

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.350
-Me?

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.780
-I am urging Congress to
uphold the US Constitution.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.540
-Honor our treaty agreements.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.470
-Recognize our sovereignty.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.310
-Restore our jurisdiction.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:37.010
-Thank you.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120
-What do you need, Deb?

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.070
-Me?

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.160
-You had anything to eat?

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.919
-I'm fine.

00:53:44.919 --> 00:53:46.460
You've been at it
for days now, and I

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.668
haven't seen you eat a thing.

00:53:47.668 --> 00:53:48.720
-I'm not hungry.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.600
I brought you a sandwich.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.370
-What do you think
of this sentence?

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:53.970
The tribal
jurisdiction provision

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.530
and the reauthorization
of VAWA 2013

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.430
recognizes the rights to
our native women to be free

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.010
of violence and
abuse, as well as

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.890
the inherent sovereign
authority of tribes

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.730
to protect their own citizens.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.910
-Sounds good to me.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.500
-Too many comments.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.640
-I think it's fine.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.980
-People stop listening when
you use too many commas.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.140
-I don't think
people hear commas.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.310
-I hear commas.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:19.860
I hear commas all the
time, and they bother me.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.610
You're a lawyer.

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.160
Didn't you spend years
studying where to place commas.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.290
-I was tribal police
before law school,

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.165
and we never used commas.

00:54:27.165 --> 00:54:28.380
-[LAUGHING]

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.680
-Now my dad, he was
obsessed with commas.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.610
Whenever he wrote an
opinion or an order,

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:36.820
he'd spend hours revising,
deleting commas, adding commas.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.530
He always said judicial
orders must command respect.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.610
-He was a tribal judge?

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:43.570
-I never got to sleep
in on a Saturday morning

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.100
because he would drag me out
of bed and throw me in the car.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.860
He would take me with to court.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.260
And on the way,
he'd make me read.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.270
Back then, to have a legal case,
it was a printout of a book.

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.890
So we'd drive, and sometimes
it was several hours.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.647
And he'd say, OK,
read this to me.

00:54:59.647 --> 00:55:01.230
And I'd read the
case to him, and he'd

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.880
say, what do you
think that means?

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.960
He was teaching me at a very
young age to respect the law.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.800
-I thought about
going to law school.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.400
-Don't.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.220
-You went?

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.220
-I had to.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.260
-Your dad made you go?

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.410
-You all don't have the TV on?

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:18.090
-What the heck are
you doing in here?

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.185
-We're talking.

00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:20.779
-For crying out
loud, turn on C-SPAN.

00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:21.320
-In a minute.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.236
I need to concentrate.

00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:23.130
-They voted.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:23.630
-What?

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:24.350
-We won.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:25.296
-Oh, my god.

00:55:25.296 --> 00:55:26.170
-We got 68.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.730
-We just passed the Senate.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:28.530
-Thank you.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.320
-OK.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.052
We're hugging.

00:55:31.052 --> 00:55:31.900
-We won.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.630
-We still have to
pass the House.

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.692
-I gotta call my
husband and my kids.

00:55:35.692 --> 00:55:36.900
-You didn't think we'd do it?

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.274
-I didn't think
we had the votes.

00:55:38.274 --> 00:55:39.970
-We didn't until
the last second.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.100
-How long did it take
for me to convince you

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.540
this campaign would be worth it?

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.620
-I didn't need any convincing.

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.790
You had me at OCO.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.600
-They removed Alaska.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.420
-What?

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.470
-Alaska's been carved out.

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.670
-Section 904.

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.400
-Jurisdiction is
limited to crimes

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.570
committed in Indian country.

00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.390
-What's that mean?

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:59.800
-It's a reference to Venetie.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.220
-Supreme Court case.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:04.790
-In 1998, the Court declared
that Indian country no longer

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.990
exists in Alaska.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.540
-OK.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:11.730
But there are 229 federally
recognized tribes in Alaska.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:13.640
-And now none of them
have jurisdiction.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.740
-Well, except Metlakatla

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.650
-One tribe.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:18.610
-The other 228 are out.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.800
-Leahy told me they were in.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.424
-Murray said they
wouldn't be left out.

00:56:21.424 --> 00:56:22.566
-Someone lied to us.

00:56:22.566 --> 00:56:23.480
Murkowski?

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.400
-Talk to Begich.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.420
-Unbelievable.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.420
-I have to call Nettie.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.840
-I remember when the Supreme
Court decided Venetie.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.730
I was devastated.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:37.570
How can the Supreme
Court say there's

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.780
no Indian country in Alaska
when I'm standing right

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.360
here on the same soil that
my grandparents stood on,

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.500
and their grandparents, and
their parents before them?

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.720
This has always
been our country.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:51.990
We are still here.

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.870
But according to the United
States Supreme Court,

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.850
we don't exist.

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.080
My family has always
lived in Tetlin.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.910
I was born in Glen Allen.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.070
And I was almost
put up for adoption

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:05.610
because I was half white.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:08.760
A Christian family in Wasilla
took me into stay with them

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.590
until I was one-year-old,
and then my grandfather

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.230
fought to bring
me back to Tetlin.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.680
I am the very first
half from Tetlin,

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.290
so in the eyes of the
whites, I can't be native.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:23.550
They are always looking for
ways to make us disappear.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.020
But I know who I am.

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.560
I am Athabascan from
the village of Tetlin,

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.030
just like my grandfathers and
their grandfathers before them.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.240
I fish grayling, I hunt Caribou.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.170
I pick berries from
the same field.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.190
I speak the same language,
just like my grandmothers,

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.420
my mother, and my relatives.

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.440
I have the right
to seek protection

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.220
from my tribal government.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:50.410
I started doing
this work in 1978.

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.150
My mother died as a result
of domestic violence,

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.620
and her husband
got away with it.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.620
Our representative
in Congress, they

00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.550
tell us the Supreme
Court has stated legally

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:03.710
there is no Indian
country in Alaska.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:07.000
But for Native women in
Alaska, Indian country

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.160
isn't a legal or even
a academic question.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.640
It's a matter of life and death.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.957
-Murkowski says it
was a drafting error.

00:58:15.957 --> 00:58:17.040
-It's definitely an error.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.414
-Then why didn't
you take it out?

00:58:18.414 --> 00:58:18.999
-I couldn't

00:58:18.999 --> 00:58:20.040
-You're on the committee.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.460
-The state lobbied hard on this.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.752
-What was their position?

00:58:22.752 --> 00:58:24.210
-We need to protect
states' rights.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.580
-You meet Alaska's rights.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.970
-Look, I tried to get it out,
but we didn't have agreement.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.480
-We?

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.200
-I'm not the only
senator from Alaska.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.740
-I'm not talking to the press.

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.660
-Just one comment?

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:37.650
-I said no.

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:40.820
-Senator Murkowski
refused to comment.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:41.750
-Off the record.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:42.560
-Fine.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.720
-It was a drafting error.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.434
-Drafting error?

00:58:44.434 --> 00:58:45.600
-I didn't know it was there.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.690
-Who put the Indian country
reference to Venetie in there?

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:49.880
-I'm not sure.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.210
-You didn't know the bill
contained a special carve out

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:52.920
for your state?

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:57.040
-Hi, Terri.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.790
-I told you I don't know.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:58:59.850
-Nettie.

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:01.160
-Do you plan to fix it?

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.610
-Alaska's not included.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:04.110
-It's not that simple.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:04.870
-Not included?

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.510
-They carved you out.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.340
-Why?

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.730
-Alaska's different.

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:13.290
We all know there's no Indian
country left in Alaska.

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:14.220
-Tom.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.110
It's good to see you.

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:16.500
-Congrats on passing the Senate.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.710
-Oh, thank you.

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.840
-I hear you're representing
the Eastern Band.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.380
-Yes.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.099
-You forget your from Oklahoma?

00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:22.640
-Don't worry.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.010
I still got my twang.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:25.820
-That's good to hear.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.990
-So how do we get
Leahy-Crapo through the House

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:29.700
with tribal jurisdiction?

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.716
-I'm not sure we can.

00:59:30.716 --> 00:59:32.340
-Now, that's not what
I wanted to hear.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.070
-Boehner assigned
Cantor to VAWA,

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.750
and he's opposed to sovereignty.

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:36.850
-Based on what?

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:39.350
-I think the Constitution.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.410
-Where in the Constitution
does it say tribes

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:42.960
no longer have jurisdiction?

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.510
-You don't have to convince me.

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.270
You have to convince Cantor.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.490
-So what does he think?

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:50.230
-Well, it's going
to be difficult.

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:51.460
-But he thinks we can do it?

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.185
-He's a Congressman,
not a prophet.

00:59:53.185 --> 00:59:54.570
-Someone needs sleep.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.665
-Or a Red Bull.

00:59:55.665 --> 00:59:58.760
-We need to go where
we're most powerful.

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.062
-Our survivors.

01:00:00.062 --> 01:00:02.270
-Hard to tell a survivor
she doesn't deserve justice.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.085
-Our stories are powerful.

01:00:04.085 --> 01:00:05.210
-Do you think they'd agree?

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.280
-To come up here.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.150
-Lisa Brunner would.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.840
-Yes.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.250
-She stood up and spoke out in
'03 when McCain and the Senate

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.720
Committee on Indian Affairs
wanted to ignore this issue.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.760
-What about Sarah [? Giles ?]?

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.260
-Yes.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.110
-Melissa [? Merrick. ?]

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:16.840
-Diane Millich.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.030
-Her story's very powerful.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.210
-They all are.

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.867
-Well, how do we get them here?

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:21.950
-Let me see what I can do.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.370
-At first I wasn't sure.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.250
What would my
family think of me?

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.930
-What would my
tribe think of me?

01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:31.820
-Why me?

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.840
-Shouldn't they be
asking someone else?

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.350
-And so when she asked me--

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:36.560
-When Terri said--

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.480
-Will you come to DC?

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.860
-Will you speak out?

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.710
-I really had to think if that
was going to be right for me.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.160
-Would I be
comfortable doing that?

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.010
-I was mainly thinking about
protecting my three daughters,

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.130
especially my youngest one.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.690
She had no idea
that I'd ever had

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.980
to live my life in such a way.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.455
Maybe she's seen these kinds
of things on TV or in movies,

01:00:57.455 --> 01:00:59.080
but she didn't know
these things happen

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.040
in real life to real people,
to real people that she knows.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.200
-I wanted to protect her.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.990
-Shield her.

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.894
-I didn't want to know.

01:01:06.894 --> 01:01:08.560
-But I can't shield
her from everything.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.120
-She's already dating.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.340
-She could end up in a
relationship with a young man

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.300
who's not enrolled.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.180
-A non-Indian.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.050
-And if he were to
mistreat her, would I

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.060
be OK knowing that
I didn't do whatever

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.850
I could to help keep her safe?

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:20.530
-No.

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:22.070
So I said yes.

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:23.910
-I agreed to go to DC.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:25.780
-I agreed to share my story.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.910
-But I was diagnosed
with lupus last week,

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:30.190
and I start chemotherapy
in just a few days.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:31.769
-Oh, Diane.

01:01:31.769 --> 01:01:32.810
I don't know what to say.

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.120
-I'm not asking for sympathy.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.430
-If you can't come--

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.570
-I'm coming.

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:39.440
I have a serious illness,
but this is important.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.830
-Thank you.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.500
This will make a difference
for all Native women.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.160
-I never told Terri
this, but I didn't

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.620
agree to share my story for her,
or even for the other women.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.050
-I did this for my family.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.415
-I did this for my auntie.

01:01:52.415 --> 01:01:54.890
-I did this for the
next generation.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.450
I did this for my daughter.

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.550
-My daughter was raped
this past summer.

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:06.000
Even though they wore
bandanas, my daughter

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.630
recognized their white
skin and their blond hair.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.360
They were doing what I call
hunting on our reservation.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.235
Non-natives know they
can come onto our lands

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:17.384
and rape us with impunity.

01:02:17.384 --> 01:02:19.800
My daughter was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

01:02:23.446 --> 01:02:27.667
She didn't come and
tell me right away.

01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:28.750
She washed and she hid it.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:34.420
That summer, we had another
little girl who was raped,

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.270
and nothing was done.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:39.950
The state did nothing.

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:42.380
So she hung herself.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.050
Our suicide rape
on our reservation

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:48.940
is quite huge, as it is
in all of Indian country.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.690
Still my daughter.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:01.530
Hearing all of the stories about
this little girl being raped

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:06.410
and her death, she finally
broke and told me what happened,

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.850
what happened to her.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.970
My daughter's no better.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.520
They don't go try and party.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.370
We know the dangers
of our environment,

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.027
and they know that.

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.860
And they know that we're
walking bulls eyes.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.160
We're not just targets.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.245
We're walking bulls eyes.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:26.800
And so she went out in
the middle of the night

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.160
to go find my niece.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.200
She didn't want my niece to get
in trouble for being out late,

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.180
because she would have.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.690
And as my daughter
walked down the road,

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:42.470
four white guys in a black
SUV with tan leather interior

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:45.280
were trying to get
her into the vehicle.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.615
And she said no.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:48.866
She just kept walking.

01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:50.240
And this is the
only biggest town

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.390
that we have on our reservation,
population maybe 1,400.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.270
And as she's walking, they're
getting more persistent.

01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:00.400
She takes off running.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.140
They chase her down.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.835
Two guys, they jumped
out of the vehicle.

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.770
They drug her to it.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:15.840
And as one was driving,
two held her down,

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.400
and the fourth one raped her.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.200
And they had bandannas
on over their faces.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.980
And she seen their white
skin, and their blue eyes,

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.470
and their blonde hair.

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:28.940
And when they were
done with her,

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.670
they threw her
out by the bridge.

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:36.160
As a mom, that more than
took the wind out of me.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.582
That slammed me to the Earth
with such ungodly speed.

01:04:39.582 --> 01:04:43.985
And all the measures that I
had tried to protect them,

01:04:43.985 --> 01:04:46.260
they didn't it work.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.080
My daughter isn't an
animal that is hunted.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.290
She's a human being.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.940
-Well, if it isn't the
gentleman from Oklahoma.

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.220
-I hope I'm not intruding.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:00.750
-No, no, no.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.630
My 3 o'clock was canceled.

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:03.160
-Sit down.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.640
-Oh, it won't be long.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.000
-VAWA's making me a popular man.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.980
Joe Biden's beating
down my door,

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.780
and every woman in the House
wants tell me what she thinks.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.890
-Well, they're for it.

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:14.730
-Well, not all of them.

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.080
-You know where I stand.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:16.610
-I do.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.930
And I wish I could
help you, but I've

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:21.160
got two company chairmen
blocking the Senate bill,

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.350
and they won't budge.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.050
-Hastings.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.220
Yeah, well.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.185
-I'll tell you this.

01:05:28.185 --> 01:05:31.585
If you can convince Hastings to
vote for tribal jurisdiction,

01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:33.700
I'll send it to the floor.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.280
-Well, you and I both know
that will never happen.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.140
-Feel free to come
back to me if it does.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.420
Cantor's bill removes
jurisdiction and replaces it

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.620
with federal delegation.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.578
-Well, that won't work.

01:05:44.578 --> 01:05:45.400
-But it will pass.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.641
-What if you drafted a bill?

01:05:47.641 --> 01:05:48.140
-Me?

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.477
Well, you're a popular guy.

01:05:49.477 --> 01:05:50.560
People take you seriously.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.934
-Not on Indian issues.

01:05:51.934 --> 01:05:54.100
Folks will just say that's
another one of Tom Cole's

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:54.890
Indian bills.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.039
-No, I disagree.

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.080
-If I draft the bill,
it'll be dead in the water.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.871
-Well, we don't have
a lot of options here.

01:05:59.871 --> 01:06:02.670
It's not like you can ask
a Democrat to draft this.

01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:04.410
-Ask Issa.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:05.700
-Darrell Issa?

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.175
-He's Lebanese, not Chickasaw.

01:06:07.175 --> 01:06:10.200
It's like, a whole
different tribe.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.215
-Well, seriously, why Issa?

01:06:12.215 --> 01:06:14.090
-Well, he's a strong
supporter of the tribes,

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.280
and he's chair of the
oversight committee.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.113
-That committee has
nothing to do with this.

01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:19.850
-Exactly.

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.707
That committee exists purely
to torture the president.

01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:25.040
I mean, he's overseeing all
the investigations that look

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.510
into Obama, including Benghazi.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:31.270
So we got ourselves a bona fide,
respected Republican partisan.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.370
If Darrell Issa's name
is first on the bill,

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:34.700
folks will look at.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.510
-OK.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:36.022
Fine.

01:06:36.022 --> 01:06:37.480
Well, could you
just check with him

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.979
and see if he'd be
willing to do it?

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:40.430
-I already did.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.600
He said yes.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.960
-Did you have a nice Christmas?

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.300
Hard to believe it's 2013.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.350
-Time goes by fast around here.

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.880
-I didn't go home
for the holidays.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.780
Stayed here and just
worked straight through.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.060
I figure I'll go home and see
my kids after we win the House.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.390
There'll be plenty of time
for family when we win.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.260
-Cantor refused
to put it to vote.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.230
-What?

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.120
-He let the bill expire.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.530
-The bill's dead?

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:09.200
-We'll reintroduce it.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.060
Leahy already has a draft going.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.220
-What good will that do?

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.660
-If we can pass it before
the end of January,

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.660
it'll be back in the
House by 1st of February.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.400
-We could pass it in the
Senate every year for 50 years.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.910
That won't get
through the House.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:23.740
-I know you're disappointed.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.580
-I'm going home.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.090
-Deborah.

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.200
-I haven't seen my
kids in three months.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.420
-This isn't defeat.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.314
-What do I tell my tribe?

01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:32.230
I haven't been to a
council meeting in months,

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:34.420
and now I'm going to
lose my reelection.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.160
-You tell them Patty Murray
says one month from now,

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.210
we'll have VAWA 2013
passed in the Senate.

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:43.680
And then what?

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.330
You have momentum.

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.530
Don't stop now.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.252
-Murray and Leahy
think they could have

01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:50.460
a vote by the end of January.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.176
-That's fast.

01:07:51.176 --> 01:07:52.300
-Well, they have the votes.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:52.970
-And we don't.

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:53.980
Tell them to slow down.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.270
-We have momentum.

01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:58.590
-90 miles per hour down a dead
end road gets you nowhere.

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:00.650
-We just to convince
Cantor to put it to a vote.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:02.570
-And he's convinced
it's unconstitutional.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.820
-What's unconstitutional
about recognizing

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.020
a tribe's jurisdiction?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.410
-Olifante.

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.600
-Are you kidding me?

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.190
Have you read Olifante?

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:11.000
-A hundred times.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.522
It still that makes sense to me.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:15.480
I mean, how do you explain
the Court's decision

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.020
that after hundreds of years
of sovereign existence,

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.550
a sovereign existence that
predates the United States

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:25.170
Constitution, then all
of the sudden, in 1978,

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.430
tribal governments
lost their sovereignty?

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.760
Poof.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.170
I guess it just disappeared.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:33.960
-You know, I used to watch my
dad preside over tribal court.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.010
-My great grandfather was clerk
of our Chickasaw supreme court.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.490
-We prosecuted everyone.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.972
Indian, non-Indian, black,
white, French, Chinese.

01:08:40.972 --> 01:08:41.680
It didn't matter.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.590
-If you committed a
crime on the reservation,

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.850
the tribe could prosecute you.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.399
-When I was in college,
my sister Rachel,

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:55.410
she was working at the
Casino over in Red Rock.

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:59.130
And this guy, when my
sister finished her shift,

01:08:59.130 --> 01:09:02.850
he followed her into the
parking lot, and he raped her.

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:08.310
And when he was done with
her, he left her on the ground

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.180
and drove off.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.829
But she saw his license
plate, Joseph Jefferson,

01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:16.819
a 34-year-old white
male, chemical engineer,

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.420
living in Nichols Hills.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.779
She got his license plate.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.220
-You ask your sister to speak.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.130
People need to hear her story.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:31.600
-She killed herself.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.020
Six months after the rape
when we figured out our tribe

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.470
didn't have jurisdiction
process him,

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:38.899
and he came back to the casino
and started stalking her.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.015
So you're just going
to accept this?

01:09:44.015 --> 01:09:45.140
-What do you want me to do?

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.229
-Prosecute this man.

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:47.520
You're a judge.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.390
Issue an order.

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:49.590
Have the police arrest him.

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:50.560
-I can't.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.930
-We haven his license plate.

01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:53.460
-Dennis.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.200
-We know his name,
where he works.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.285
We know where he lives.

01:09:56.285 --> 01:09:58.190
-He's white.

01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.315
We don't have jurisdiction.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:05.290
-Olifante?

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.360
-Read it.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.170
-I'm not a lawyer.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:10.420
-I said read it.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.940
-We granted cer--

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.899
-Certiorari.

01:10:13.899 --> 01:10:15.440
-I don't even know
how to pronounce--

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.490
-Read the full sentence.

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:22.310
-We granted certiorari to decide
whether Indian tribal courts

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:25.290
have criminal jurisdiction
over non-Indians.

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:27.390
We decide that they do not.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:31.030
-What do you think that means?

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.210
-It meant I had to
go to law school.

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:34.680
-You read the entire opinion?

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.340
-Yeah.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.195
My dad made me.

01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:38.195
-Read the last sentence.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.620
-Finally, we are not
unaware of the prevalence

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.470
of non-Indian crime on
today's reservations,

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:50.630
which the tribes forcefully
argue requires the ability

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.910
to try non-Indians.

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.990
But these are
considerations for Congress

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.540
to weigh in deciding whether
Indian tribes should be

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.530
authorized to try non-Indians.

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:05.900
-What do you think that means?

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.150
-Congress has the
constitutional power

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:12.510
to recognize the inherent
sovereignty in Indian tribes.

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:15.929
-You go back, and
you tell Patty Murray

01:11:15.929 --> 01:11:17.970
that if she and Leahy can
get through the Senate,

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:21.550
I'll do whatever the hell
it takes to pass the House.

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:23.504
-Leahy's reintroducing
the bill on Monday.

01:11:23.504 --> 01:11:25.670
-Murray thinks they'll have
it passed by February 1.

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:26.629
-Isn't that a bit fast?

01:11:26.629 --> 01:11:27.836
-She thinks we have momentum.

01:11:27.836 --> 01:11:29.570
-But we need buzz and the press.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:31.030
-I know a reporter at The Times.

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:32.738
-Would he be willing
to write about VAWA?

01:11:32.738 --> 01:11:33.580
-She.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.900
-Maybe you could ask her.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.750
-Miss Millich?

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.250
Thank you for taking my call.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.370
I'm with The Times.

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:41.630
-Oh, the Aspen Times?

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.120
-The New York Times.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.100
-Oh.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.420
-Dennis Whitehawk
gave me your name.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.170
-He's been doing
that a lot lately.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.770
-I'm writing an article
about the tribal jurisdiction

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:54.920
provisions and pose a
reauthorization of VAWA.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.510
Would you be willing
to share your story?

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:01.050
-I was born on the
Southern Ute reservation.

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.870
My mother was a
southern Ute, and my dad

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.680
was a first generation
Yugoslavian.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.140
When I was 36, I
married a white man,

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.910
believing he would treat me
the same way my father treated

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.670
my mother.

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:16.382
He moved onto my reservation
and lived with me.

01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:18.965
But we weren't married for very
long before he became violent.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:24.030
The brutality increased
after I left and filed

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:26.840
for a divorce and the
order of protection.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.620
One day, after the
Southern Ute tribal court

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.950
awarded my order
of protection, I

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:35.750
was at work when I saw him
pull up in our red truck.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:39.640
My ex-husband walked inside
our office and told me,

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.240
you promised until death do
us part, so death it shall be.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.320
He was armed with a
nine millimeter gun.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.630
If not for my very
brave coworker,

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.680
I would not be alive today.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.070
My co-worker prevented by
murdered by pushing me out

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.450
of harm's way.

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:59.330
My coworker took the
bullet in his shoulder.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.330
The shooting took place
at a Federal Bureau

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:04.510
of Land Management land
site, where we both worked.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.740
The jurisdictional
issue was so complicated

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.070
that after the shooting,
my Southern Ute tribal

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.870
police, the Colorado State
patrol, our county sheriffs,

01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:14.490
the city police,
the federal agents,

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:17.050
all six agencies
were standing there

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:18.960
with measuring tapes and maps.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.010
-I've got five.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:20.985
-I've got four.

01:13:20.985 --> 01:13:23.145
-This is clearly federal.

01:13:23.145 --> 01:13:25.980
-It's at least six inches away.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.810
-Take a look.

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:28.720
The bullet landed on federal.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.434
-And the gun was
fired from state.

01:13:31.434 --> 01:13:32.600
-Yeah, but where's the body?

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.500
Not in the state.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.230
-It took hours just to
decide who had jurisdiction.

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:38.430
-Look, if you want it, take it.

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.930
-Nah.

01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:40.710
We don't need feds leftovers.

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.280
-This is small
potatoes for feds.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.030
-Southern Ute says
they want to prosecute.

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:46.710
-Yeah, but they don't
have the jurisdiction.

01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:48.250
-The district
attorney decided that

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.360
the sixth judicial
district of Colorado

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.540
would prosecute the case.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.250
-We'd like to offer
a plea agreement.

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.520
-What's on the table?

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.970
-Attempted voluntary
manslaughter.

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:59.290
-How about aggravated
driving under revocation

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:00.800
for driving without a license?

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.930
-He didn't have his license
when he was arrested.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:04.340
-But he tried to kill someone.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.940
-He's a first time offender.

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.830
-He has a history of
domestic violence.

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.760
-On the reservation.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.822
-You and I both know
that doesn't count.

01:14:12.822 --> 01:14:15.240
Get him for aggravated
driving under revocation,

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.800
and you can still look tough.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.680
Show you took a
stand against someone

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.050
who put the lives of your
police force in danger.

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:25.610
-No one ever asked
me, the victim,

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:27.150
what I needed to feel safe.

01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:30.370
-I'm telling you, aggravated
driving under revocation,

01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:33.240
and then we can
all go home happy.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.530
-OK.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:37.800
-My tribe wanted to prosecute,
but because of Olifante,

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.262
they couldn't.

01:14:40.262 --> 01:14:41.720
It was like his
attempt to shoot me

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.010
and the shooting of my
co-worker didn't happen.

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:48.720
In the end, he was right.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.780
The law couldn't touch him.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.930
He was about the law.

01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:54.520
-Thank you.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.905
Thank you for
sharing your story.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.120
-We passed the Senate.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.456
-I knew we would.

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.250
-We got 78.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.810
-That's 10 more than last year.

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:06.500
-10 Republicans switched over.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.410
-That's amazing.

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:08.860
-Diane's story in The Times.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.710
-It was powerful.

01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:11.690
-That's where those
10 votes came from.

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.190
-Huh.

01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.890
So now we just need
to win in the House.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:16.310
-Lord, save us.

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:17.410
-I need some caffeine.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.160
-I got coffee.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.610
-Great.

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:21.370
-Terry doesn't need caffeine.

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:23.110
-Oh, well, you can have hers.

01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:24.850
-Dennis doesn't drink coffee.

01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:26.350
-You don't drink Coffee

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:29.415
-You know that
stuff's bad for you.

01:15:29.415 --> 01:15:31.160
[LAUGHING]

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.670
-I also brought bagels.

01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:34.740
-Dennis doesn't eat bagels.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.680
He only hippie granola stuff.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.450
-They're called Clif bars, and
they're really good for you.

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:40.430
No corn syrup.

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:41.690
No processed ingredients.

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:45.750
-You went to law school
in Northern California.

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.250
-All right.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.416
So we need to figure out
the schedule for this week.

01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:50.700
-One is setting up a meeting
with the Black Caucus.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.045
-Thank God for Gwen Moore.

01:15:52.045 --> 01:15:53.420
-You said you'd
meet with Pelosi?

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.190
-I did?

01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.380
-Yes.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.130
We discussed this.

01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:57.630
-OK.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:58.130
OK.

01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:59.895
-I'll be stalking
Cathy McMorris Rodgers.

01:15:59.895 --> 01:16:01.270
-Well, what about
Betty McCollum?

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:02.010
-On my list.

01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:03.900
-I got McHenry and Denham.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.610
-Paul Cook?

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:06.090
-Talking to him
tomorrow morning.

01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:07.160
-Who's checking in Issa?

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:07.860
-That's me.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.580
-Don't forget.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.640
You've got Cole.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.680
-I think you got me.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.910
-Well, whatever you Oklahoma
boys share, its special,

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:15.020
I'm sure.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.510
-So who's got the press?

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:18.880
-I'm with The Washington Post.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.890
-The Los Angeles Times.

01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:20.806
-Do you have a minute?

01:16:20.806 --> 01:16:21.770
-Yes.

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.370
-I read Diane Millich's story.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.320
-It's powerful.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.570
-I'd like to hear yours.

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.770
-Why are you here?

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:28.740
-To speak out.

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.020
-To share my story.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.340
-To stop the silence.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.460
-Why are you advocating
for jurisdiction?

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.420
-One out of three Native women
will be raped in her lifetime.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.430
-60% of Native women will be
assaulted in their lifetime.

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:41.990
-Our women, our children--

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:43.360
-We're not safe.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.050
-What happened?

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:45.470
-My husband tried to shoot me.

01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:46.690
-He threatened to drown me.

01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:48.990
-My coworker took the
bullet in his shoulder.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.820
-Unbelievable.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.760
-67% of violent crimes
committed against Native women

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.289
are committed by non-Native.

01:16:54.289 --> 01:16:56.080
-They come to our
reservations because they

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.480
know they can harm us.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.570
-They know they are safe.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.490
-They're protected by the law.

01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:01.610
-Did you call the police?

01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:02.680
-Doesn't help.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.720
-They can't do anything.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.010
-They don't have jurisdiction.

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:06.190
-On your reservation?

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:07.840
-According to the Supreme Court.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.280
-Because I'm a Native woman
living on my tribe's lands.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.060
-The laws won't protect me.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.360
-What kind of message does
that send to our women?

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.010
-I know what message
it sent to me.

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.900
-I don't understand.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.320
-If the violence is so bad--

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.290
-If you aren't safe on
your own reservation--

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.870
-If he lives in your home--

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.520
-Your home is dangerous--

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.540
-Why don't you leave?

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.780
-Wouldn't the laws of
the state protect you

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.156
if you leave your reservation?

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.450
-My great great great great
grandfather was [NON-ENGLISH],

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.220
or Standing Wolf.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.020
During the time of the
removal, the soldiers

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.300
came to take him and his
family and forced them

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.930
to walk the Trail of Tears.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.760
At that time, a white
man named George Hayes

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.920
was living with Cherokees.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.275
[NON-ENGLISH] asked Hayes what
he could do to avoid going West

01:17:57.275 --> 01:18:01.140
and be allowed to
remain in his homeland.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.900
Hayes advised him to save
up all his food rations,

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.490
when he saw the opportunity,
to break away and make

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:08.190
his way back home.

01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:11.600
But to be caught escaping meant
severe punishment, or even

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.370
death.

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:16.110
One day, several
weeks later, Hayes

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:17.530
was out working
in his yard, when

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:21.230
he saw a small group of people
approaching on the horizon.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:25.660
It was Standing Wolf, his wife,
and several other Cherokees.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.630
His wife held a
small newborn baby.

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:35.100
Hayes asked Standing Wolf
what the baby's name was.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.380
And Standing Wolf told him
that this new son was named

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:43.010
[NON-ENGLISH], or
Come Back Wolf,

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.460
because that was the only
wish in their hearts,

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:48.230
just to come back home.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:52.030
This is why I and my
grandparents before me

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:55.810
came to be in the mountains
of Western North Carolina.

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:57.400
The Cherokee elders
and wise ones

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.070
say that we've
always been there.

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.880
We always will be there.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.050
It's believed that we
were given our home there

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.560
in those mountains
by the Creator.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.050
Since it was given
to us by the Creator,

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:12.950
only He can take it from us.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:16.370
So did I ever think
of leaving Cherokee?

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:17.630
-No, not once.

01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.530
-Never.

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:20.640
-We are still here.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.100
-This is my home.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.790
-I will never leave my home.

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.230
-Cathy McMorris Rodgers.

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:29.410
I didn't expect
to see you today.

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:31.690
-I'm on my way to the [? ENC. ?]

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:32.940
-Well, thanks for stopping by.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.950
-Believe me, I'd rather
visiting with you

01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:38.220
than sitting in a committee.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.330
-What can I do for you?

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.165
-I met with some of the women,
and I heard their stories.

01:19:42.165 --> 01:19:43.930
-They're very powerful.

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:45.650
-How do we get the press?

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:46.890
-It's up to Cantor.

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:50.800
-I mean, how do we convince him
to put jurisdiction to vote?

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.860
-Well, I've tried.

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.090
-He's stubborn as hell.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.450
-I'm sure it'd help if he
heard from you directly.

01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:00.490
-Let me see what I can do.

01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:03.160
-I think I know what
you're here to discuss.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.470
-Then let's discuss it.

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.870
-I'm not putting it to a vote.

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:07.917
-Did you read The New
York Times article?

01:20:07.917 --> 01:20:08.750
-Are you kidding me?

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:10.840
I have standards.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.080
-I hate the press
as much as you do.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.600
-You're the one quoting it.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.030
This is about perception.

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.910
53% percent of voters in the
last election were women.

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:24.490
Exit polls show that Obama
held the 10 point gender

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:26.151
gap over Romney.

01:20:26.151 --> 01:20:27.150
-I've heard the numbers.

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:29.710
-If you refuse to
put VAWA to a vote

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:31.560
now like you did
last year, there

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.002
will be consequences
for all of us.

01:20:37.897 --> 01:20:39.480
-I'm here because I
don't want to have

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.230
this conversation over email.

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:42.670
-We need a vote.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:45.250
-You think you can just pull
the camel's nose under the tent?

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:47.390
-No one's nose is
going under any tents.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:48.860
-Oh, they got your nose.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:49.860
That's for sure.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.190
-What's that supposed to mean?

01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:53.400
-You're supposed to be
our guy working with them.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.950
-I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:01.760
I'm their guy working with you.

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.410
My great great great
grandfather was one of the last

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:10.980
to travel the Chickasaw
Trail of Tears.

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.270
He was only 14.

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.726
He walked 80 miles.

01:21:15.726 --> 01:21:20.730
From 1837 to 1851, the federal
government moved everyone.

01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:24.240
We lost everything
except our sovereignty.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.224
After we got to our new
home in Indian territory,

01:21:29.224 --> 01:21:31.140
my great great grandfather
served as the clerk

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.620
of the Chickasaw Supreme Court.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.410
And after him, my
great grandfather

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:37.070
served as the last
Chickasaw treasurer

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:39.410
before Oklahoma became a state.

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.530
And my mother was the
first Native American woman

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:44.670
ever elected to the
state Senate in Oklahoma.

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:47.870
I come from a long line
of Chickasaw leaders--

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:49.620
men and women who
have served not only

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.060
their sovereign tribal
government, as I now

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:56.620
serve mine, but also the state
of Oklahoma and the United

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.390
States.

01:21:58.390 --> 01:22:01.140
I have a lot of respect
for this government,

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:06.530
this sovereign government,
and how it works.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:09.130
And it works
because people vote.

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:11.030
They vote in the
presidential election,

01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:13.300
and they vote in
their state elections.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.920
And here in the House, we vote.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.680
When a bill passes, it passes.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.935
And when it doesn't get
enough votes, it fails.

01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:26.600
But no one has to guess whether
the majority of the citizens'

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.000
representatives were
for or against a bill

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.650
when there's a vote.

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:34.980
That's all we're asking for.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.060
That's all we want.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.920
Please.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.052
Let us have the vote.

01:22:42.052 --> 01:22:43.490
-They're voting.

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:45.052
-I remember where I was.

01:22:45.052 --> 01:22:46.260
-I remember what I was doing.

01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:47.593
-I remember what I was thinking.

01:22:47.593 --> 01:22:48.750
-And I will never forget.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.960
-I was on the
floor of the House.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.790
-At my home in Fairfax.

01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:51.635
-On my reservation.

01:22:51.635 --> 01:22:52.700
-In Cherokee.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.450
-In Alaska.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:54.380
-Watching CNN.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.020
-C-SPAN.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:55.600
-Facebook.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.660
-Watching the vote.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.797
Working for votes.

01:22:57.797 --> 01:22:58.630
-I couldn't breathe.

01:22:58.630 --> 01:22:59.460
-I was so nervous.

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.710
-All I could do was pray.

01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:01.460
-What's the vote?

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:01.990
-30

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.990
-We got 30?

01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:04.000
-We need 218.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.040
-We need your vote.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:05.800
-You got my vote.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.340
-31.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.050
-Thank you.

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:08.830
-62.

01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:09.510
-My whole life--

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:10.510
-I dreamed of this.

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:11.320
-85.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.350
-I prayed for this.

01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:13.160
-114.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.360
-You got my vote, Tom.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:14.910
-Thank you.

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:15.930
-115.

01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:17.122
-Everything depends on this.

01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:17.830
-What if we lose.

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:18.750
-We can't lose.

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:19.460
-Not an option.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:19.960
-201.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.600
-201?

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.120
-Oh, my god.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.831
-I just prayed to Creator.

01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:24.330
-215.

01:23:24.330 --> 01:23:25.190
-Holy smokes.

01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:26.130
-216

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:26.930
-We got this.

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:27.575
-217.

01:23:27.575 --> 01:23:29.200
-Is this for real?

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:29.700
-218.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:30.350
-We did it.

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.890
-218.

01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:31.954
-218.

01:23:31.954 --> 01:23:32.870
-They're still coming.

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:33.900
More votes.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.320
-235.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:35.870
-246?

01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:36.520
-250.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.240
-285.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.460
-286.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.916
-286?

01:23:39.916 --> 01:23:40.772
-286.

01:23:40.772 --> 01:23:42.460
-286 votes.

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.480
-I couldn't believe.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.810
-Unbelievable.

01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:45.644
-I had to call Jacks

01:23:45.644 --> 01:23:46.351
-Terri texted me.

01:23:46.351 --> 01:23:47.400
-I just started texting.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.590
-I started crying.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.090
-I could hardly see who I was
texting, I was crying so hard.

01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:51.900
-I had to scream.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.970
-I scared my neighbors.

01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:54.400
-I did a victory dance.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.505
-I prayed for my sister.

01:23:55.505 --> 01:23:56.690
-It just seemed unreal.

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:57.890
-It felt like a dream.

01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:58.942
-It was amazing.

01:23:58.942 --> 01:23:59.650
-It was humbling.

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:01.570
-It was a miracle.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.230
-What about Alaska?

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:04.700
-Next time.

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:05.660
I promise.

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.059
-Why were we left out?

01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:13.140
-Miss Millich?

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.410
-This is Diane.

01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:18.130
-I'm calling on behalf of Obama.

01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:19.690
-Am I getting punked.

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:20.320
-No.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.750
He would like to
invite you to attend

01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:25.600
the signing ceremony for VAWA.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.610
-When is it?

01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:28.385
-We need you here tomorrow.

01:24:28.385 --> 01:24:30.190
-I have to ask my doctor.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:33.100
-Vice President Biden would
like you to introduce him.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:33.890
-To who?

01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:35.300
-To everyone at the ceremony.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.200
The President and
Vice President would

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.200
like to invite you to share
your story with the nation.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.120
-What should I wear?

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.260
-Hello, and welcome.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:48.270
Thank you for joining us today,
for this is very important

01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:51.550
event, the signing of
the reauthorization

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.718
of Violence Against Women Act.

01:24:54.718 --> 01:24:56.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:59.240
I'm very honored
to introduce you

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.720
to our first speaker
of the afternoon.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.160
She has traveled
all the way here

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.250
from the reservation
in Colorado.

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:10.055
Please welcome Diane Millich.

01:25:13.785 --> 01:25:15.780
Good afternoon.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:18.420
My name is Diane Millich and
I am a citizen of the Southern

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.970
Ute Indian tribe.

01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:21.890
My mother is known
as Bear Woman.

01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:23.890
She is also known as
Arlene Weaver Millich,

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:26.370
and is also a member of the
Southern Ute Indian tribe

01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:27.880
in Colorado.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.560
The VAWA being
signed today would

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.400
have allowed my tribe to
arrest and prosecute my abuser.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.630
When this act is
signed into law,

01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:39.410
VAWA will finally reach
Native women like me.

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:40.350
-And me.

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:41.210
-And me.

01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:42.320
-And my daughter.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.970
-If the Violence Against
Women Act tribal provisions

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:49.330
had existed 15 years ago, my
story would be very different.

01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:50.960
-My story would be different.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.090
-My daughter's
will be different.

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.920
-This act--

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.000
-The tribal
jurisdiction provision--

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.810
-It's a step in the
right direction.

01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:59.370
-It's an enormous victory.

01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:01.670
-But it only covers
domestic violence--

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:02.890
-And protection orders.

01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:04.164
-It doesn't cover rape.

01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:05.205
-It doesn't cover murder.

01:26:05.205 --> 01:26:07.500
-It doesn't cover what
happened to my daughter.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.590
-It protects me.

01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:09.560
-It protects me.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.570
-It protects me.

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:11.930
-It doesn't protect me.

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:16.680
-It excludes 228 federally
recognized tribes in Alaska.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.943
-Why were we cut out?

01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:27.510
I read about your
people before I met you.

01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:30.620
I have never known
anyone who was Cherokee,

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.190
but I read about your
Trail of Tears in 1839.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.690
I read about how the federal
government took your homes

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:39.090
and forced you to walk
thousands of miles.

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:42.570
I read that many
got sick and died.

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:45.140
Everyone keeps
saying, Nettie, we

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.210
can't include
Alaska in this bill.

01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:49.340
Sorry, Nettie.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.320
We'll protect Alaska
Native women next time.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.980
Sorry, Nettie.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.600
Alaska is different.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.490
What makes us different?

01:26:57.490 --> 01:27:01.520
Is it because what happened
to your people in 1839

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.860
didn't happen to us until 1959?

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.070
Because Congress
passed the Dawes Act

01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:11.590
and gave our land to
white settlers in 1887,

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:17.080
but didn't pass [INAUDIBLE] and
gave away our lands until 1971.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.390
Is it because the Supreme Court
took away your jurisdiction

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:24.170
in 1978, but didn't
take ours until it

01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:29.600
was decided Venetie in 1998?

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.110
Please someone, explain to
me, how are we different?

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:39.200
Because from where I stand, I
see our stories are the same.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.510
-You aren't different.

01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:41.760
-We are the same.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.360
-And we stand with you.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.690
-VAWA 2013 is just the start.

01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:47.290
-But we have more work to do.

01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.210
-Until this
government recognizes

01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:52.520
our tribe's sovereign authority
to protect all of our Native

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.450
women--

01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:54.860
-None of us are safe.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.990
-Until this government
recognizes the rights

01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:58.640
of our Alaska Native sister--

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.190
-None of us are safe.

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:01.360
-VAWA is a miracle.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.810
-A spiritual miracle.

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.530
-But it's just the beginning.

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:05.660
-It's just a sliver.

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.874
-The first sliver
of a full moon.

01:28:08.874 --> 01:28:12.858
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.390
-First, I want to
say thank you to all

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:53.665
of the actors and the director,
and of course, Mary Kathryn.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:00.610
We sometimes at
the law school have

01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:03.760
trouble making
the law come alive

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.840
and of people to see its
actual effects in the world.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.620
And here, what we actually
see is the effects

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:16.000
of not having law as well.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.350
And so I just say thank
you to everyone else.

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.090
It's an honor for me
to be able to introduce

01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:35.150
these three creative and quite
brilliant Native women lawyers.

01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:40.900
Maggie McKinley is a Climenko
fellow and a lecturer

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.640
of law at Harvard Law School.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.790
She serves as
co-principal investigator

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:48.580
of the Language of
Lobbying Project

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:51.490
at the University of Chicago.

01:29:51.490 --> 01:29:53.810
Her scholarship
examines the ways

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:56.710
that minorities participate
in the lawmaking process

01:29:56.710 --> 01:30:01.310
in democracies, with a
special focus on lobbying

01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:03.010
and petitioning.

01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:09.430
And I can say that I think she
single-handedly is creating

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:11.370
an entire new field of law.

01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:15.260
And I think it's a very
important and amazing project

01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:18.530
that she's working on.

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:21.430
She's conducted a field
study of federal lobbyists

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:24.910
during the campaign
to reauthorize VAWA.

01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.390
Her mother is a citizen
of Fond du Lac band

01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:29.100
of Minnesota Ojibwe,
and her father

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.240
is Irish Catholic
from the Bronx.

01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:38.580
Angela Riley is currently the
Oneida Indian Nation Visiting

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.930
Professor of Law at
Harvard Law School.

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:45.200
This semester, she's a professor
of law at UCLA School of Law,

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.990
as well as the director of
UCLA's joint program in law

01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:51.310
and American Indian studies.

01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:54.230
Her research focuses on issues
related to indigenous peoples

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:58.140
rights, with a particular
emphasis on cultural property

01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.080
and native governance.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.830
I should say good
native governance, which

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:06.390
is the name of her article.

01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:10.470
In 2003, she became the first
woman and the youngest justice

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.870
of the supreme court of the
citizen of the Potawatomi

01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:14.380
Nation of Oklahoma.

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:18.100
2010, she was elected
as Chief Justice.

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.880
She now serves as co-chair for
the United Nations Indigenous

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.580
Peoples Partnership
Policy Board,

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.980
and is an evidentiary hearing
officer for the Morongo

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.210
Band of Mission Indians.

01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:31.080
And have to say,
she was my student,

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:37.610
and I feel a particular
pride in her accomplishments.

01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:40.330
There's a Jewish term,
which is not [NON-ENGLISH],

01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:43.320
which is a term that parents
use about their children.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.650
It means this sort
of unmitigated joy

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:48.510
that you get in talking
about your children.

01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:53.140
So I feel [NON-ENGLISH]
for Angela.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.910
And finally, Mary
Kathryn Nagle, who I've

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:57.550
just met today for
the first time.

01:31:57.550 --> 01:32:00.940
Mary Kathryn's obviously an
accomplished Native playwright

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.120
and lawyer.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:06.140
She's the author of the
play that we just saw.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:08.408
In addition to practicing
and publishing--

01:32:08.408 --> 01:32:08.908
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:08.908 --> 01:32:09.408
-Thank you.

01:32:12.764 --> 01:32:13.264
-Here, here.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.810
-In addition to practicing and
publishing academic articles

01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:25.190
on Indian law, Mary
Katheryn has begun a project

01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:27.970
of telling the stories of
Indian country relating

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:30.520
to law and policy.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.230
She's using art as a
way to bring to people

01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:40.976
the reality of the legal
system and the situation

01:32:40.976 --> 01:32:43.860
of Indian nations in
the United States,

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.670
and especially Native women.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.880
In addition to Sliver
of a Full Moon,

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.360
she has documented the struggle
of the Sac and Fox Nation

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.990
to reclaim the
body of Jim Thorpe.

01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:59.110
And I didn't know
that she created

01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:03.740
a reenactment of the first
federal court decision

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.870
to declare Natives as
persons under federal law.

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:09.550
That's kind of amazing.

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:12.790
She's a citizen of the
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma,

01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:15.220
and a very creative advocate
on behalf of Indian country,

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.120
obviously.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.914
And it's a great honor for me
to be able to introduce her.

01:33:20.914 --> 01:33:24.365
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:33.500
-I just want to begin with a
few questions for this panel.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:38.530
And then, I'd like to turn the
active posing questions over

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.980
to the audience, so we can
get some wider discussion

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:42.730
going on there.

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:51.020
After listening to this
reading-- thank you again--

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:55.260
at some level, there
are some obvious ways

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.950
to go with this
question But let me just

01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:59.380
pose it just most
frankly so you can speak

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.720
to the issues, all of you.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.690
Where do we go from here?

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:07.100
Does the story of Sliver tell
us anything about what changes

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.320
are necessary in statute,
in jurisprudence,

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:16.310
in constitution-making,
or amendment-making

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:18.830
to make tribal
sovereignty a reality,

01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:21.440
the reality that it should be.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.210
And what are some of those
changes, and not simply

01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:27.490
identifying those, what are
strategies to make them happen?

01:34:27.490 --> 01:34:31.754
I'd like the three of you to
potentially reflect on that.

01:34:31.754 --> 01:34:33.670
-Could I offer a quick
point of clarification.

01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:37.890
Because this is something
in the play but I thought

01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:39.620
was really powerful,
but the language

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.670
wasn't always as precise
as lawyers love it to be.

01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:46.260
So I just want to--
so as far as-- I know.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:46.820
I'm sorry.

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.060
So as far as making
sovereignty a reality,

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.970
I don't believe that
one government can

01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:55.010
tell another government
what sovereignty is,

01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:57.750
or create that
government's sovereignty.

01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:01.030
I think sovereignty exists
in Indian country separate

01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:03.750
from the federal government and
whatever the federal government

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:04.530
recognizes.

01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:07.610
So the distinction that I'd like
to make in this conversation

01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:11.440
that I offer to the panel-- and
I hope that we can agree on--

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.820
is that the federal government
recognizes tribal sovereignty.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:19.421
It does not create it,
nor does it get rid of it.

01:35:19.421 --> 01:35:21.289
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.020
-Angela?

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.920
Or Mary Kathryn?

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.500
-Sure.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.190
Thank you.

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:31.350
Maggie, I think we're
on the same wavelength.

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:33.310
So yeah, I think it's
an interesting question.

01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:35.620
I just had a couple
of points to raise.

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:39.230
And then I really want to
hear more from everyone else,

01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:42.480
and I want to say thank you to
everyone for inviting me here,

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.940
and for this
wonderful experience.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.950
And of course, for the
performers and survivors

01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:47.810
for presenting.

01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:48.510
Thank you.

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:49.182
Yes.

01:35:49.182 --> 01:35:51.442
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.270
The play raises for me
a few critical points.

01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:59.380
The first one is one
that Maggie already made.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.680
And that is that tribal
sovereignty really

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.580
is a reality.

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:04.540
Our sovereignty is inherent.

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.300
We have it.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.330
We do exercise it.

01:36:06.330 --> 01:36:07.350
And we live it.

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:09.860
We have had moments
in time where

01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:13.020
it has been curbed by
either the US Supreme Court

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.350
or by the Congress.

01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:17.200
And things like the
reauthorization of VAWA

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.480
did not give us sovereignty.

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.300
It limited a restriction
on our inherent sovereignty

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.940
that was already there.

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:27.480
In terms of thinking about
other places to go with VAWA,

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.480
some of these things are
touched on in the play.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.870
And I've been
doing some research

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:35.330
around the way the cases
have been playing out

01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.710
at the tribal level and
in the tribal courts.

01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:41.540
And so some of the really
obvious places for expansions

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.935
and to really make the law
have the kind of impact

01:36:44.935 --> 01:36:46.810
that it needs to have
to really make families

01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:49.970
safe on reservations--
so one critical place is

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.120
to extend it to child abuse.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.940
In many of these
instances, children

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:57.830
were involved, in cases that
all three tribes that prosecuted

01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:01.030
defendants during the
pilot project period.

01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:03.550
Children were involved in
numerous of those cases.

01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:07.480
The crimes against the children
can't be prosecuted under VAWA,

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.750
so they have to be referred
to another sovereign.

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:12.270
Sometimes they get prosecuted,
sometimes they don't.

01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:15.030
So that's one obvious
place for extension.

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:17.530
But as you heard in the play,
there are also a lot of things

01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:19.860
that VAWA doesn't
apply to, including

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:21.870
situations involving strangers.

01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:23.320
There has to be
a particular kind

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.050
of relationship
with the defendant

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.200
and the reservation
or the victim.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.760
And so it limits the kind
of stranger situations

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.900
we see, and that
have particularly

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.110
been going on in some of
the Northern Plains areas

01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:38.110
with the increase in extractive
industry and non-Indians

01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:40.280
coming onto reservations
committing crimes

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.980
against Native
women, but not having

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:46.254
enough of a nexus to be
prosecuted under the statute.

01:37:46.254 --> 01:37:48.670
And the final thing, I think,
that's just really important

01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:51.530
is to educate people
more about tribal courts.

01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:53.360
During the pilot
project period, there

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.700
were three tribes that
prosecuted defendants

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:56.380
under VAWA.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.820
There were 26 total cases.

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:02.830
Of those cases, one went
all the way to a jury trial.

01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:07.120
And that defendant had a
jury panel of all Indians,

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.620
except for one person
who was non-Indian.

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:12.620
And that non-Indian defendant,
the first and only person to be

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:16.300
prosecuted and tried all the
way to a jury since Olifante

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.080
in 1978, and was acquitted.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.450
He wasn't convicted.

01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:24.610
And I think many people
feel that this is-- whatever

01:38:24.610 --> 01:38:26.240
the infirmities
may or may not have

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.030
been in that particular
case, it just demonstrates,

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:32.670
for one thing, that non-Indians
can and do get fair treatment

01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:34.060
in tribal courts.

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:37.240
Tribal courts want to protect
the rights of defendants

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.240
just like state courts, and
just like federal courts do.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.010
And the other thing that
sort of was interesting

01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:46.120
is that all the people that
were prosecuted during the pilot

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.420
project period, not one of them
filed a writ of habeas corpus.

01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.020
So they all had the opportunity
to go to the federal court

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:56.030
and say, my rights are being
violated in tribal court.

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:58.280
I want to be tried
elsewhere, or I

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.650
want to challenge the
tribe's authority over me.

01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:04.010
And none of them did, and
none of them wanted to.

01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:07.690
I've spoken with people who had
contact with those defendants,

01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.730
and they were really
happy with their treatment

01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:11.605
in tribal court, which
they felt was actually

01:39:11.605 --> 01:39:14.660
much more respectful and fair
than a lot of the treatment

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.780
they'd had outside
of tribal courts.

01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.691
So those are I think
the main points

01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:20.940
I wanted to just emphasize,
and then I'll turn it over

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.600
to my co-panelists.

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:24.100
-Sure.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:27.580
Well, you've heard a
lot from me tonight.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.250
And I have a lot to say.

01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:34.170
But I think kind of adding to
what Angela and Maggie have

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:37.510
said, which are some really
excellent points, just

01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:39.470
to add something new to
the conversation that

01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:42.710
hasn't already been said, I
would just point to the fact

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:45.990
that this play does talk
about this huge victory we

01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:48.360
had in 2013, which
is really amazing.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.920
And as Maggie points
out, our tribes

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.550
were sovereign before 1492.

01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:57.151
They were sovereign
after 1776, after 1887.

01:39:57.151 --> 01:39:58.400
They're still sovereign today.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.400
We don't have to
ask for sovereignty.

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.010
We inherently have it.

01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:06.340
And yet we keep having to defend
it in the United States Supreme

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:06.880
Court.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.320
And why is that?

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.230
And there's a huge case
to look to right now.

01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:15.650
And it's a bit alarming that we
can be celebrating this victory

01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:17.960
in 2013 in VAWA from
Congress, and that we

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.240
have a United
States President who

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.380
recognizes that our tribes are
sovereign and respects that,

01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.240
and on December 7, our
United States Supreme Court

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.640
will hear a case
that really goes

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.640
to the heart of tribal
sovereignty in the Dollar

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.700
General case.

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:32.992
And I think it's a
case that highlights

01:40:32.992 --> 01:40:35.200
a lot of the issues that
have been discussed tonight.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.520
Because in that case-- I'll
try to briefly summarize

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.950
the facts-- Dollar
General operates a store

01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:44.429
on tribal trust
lands in Mississippi,

01:40:44.429 --> 01:40:45.970
on the reservation
of the Mississippi

01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:47.512
Band of Choctaw Indians.

01:40:47.512 --> 01:40:49.470
And they entered into a
contractual arrangement

01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:51.300
with the tribe, whereby
they lease their lands,

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.800
and they also agreed
in the contract

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.380
to subject themselves
to tribal jurisdiction.

01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:58.440
Well, they also agreed to
participate in a tribal youth

01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.720
employment program.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.270
And during the course of an
employee, a summer intern

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:04.850
from the tribe, a
13-year-old boy,

01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:07.290
the non-Indian
supervisor in the store

01:41:07.290 --> 01:41:10.690
sexually assaulted the
tribal youth two times.

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.990
And now we know because
of Olifante in 1978,

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:16.780
his tribe cannot
prosecute that crime.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:20.310
And also despite the fact of
the reauthorization in 2013

01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:22.380
and the restoration
of jurisdiction,

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.810
there's no
jurisdiction for crimes

01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:25.290
committed against our children.

01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:29.137
And so the tribe has no
criminal jurisdiction,

01:41:29.137 --> 01:41:31.470
according to the Supreme
Court, to prosecute this crime.

01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:33.303
The federal government
hasn't done anything.

01:41:33.303 --> 01:41:34.250
Of course, they could.

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:35.950
Under the framework the
Supreme Court has created,

01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.680
they could prosecute,
and they have not.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.542
And so the only thing
the tribe can offer

01:41:39.542 --> 01:41:41.500
is civil court jurisdiction,
which is something

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.960
that a lot of other sovereigns,
like our state and federal

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.080
sovereigns, also offer.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.840
And the idea being that if
you are abused and battered,

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.460
you can go into a civil
court and file a tort

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:53.770
lawsuit against the
individual, the entity, that

01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:55.340
battered you or hurt you.

01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:57.180
And in this case, the
parents of the youth

01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.200
have filed a lawsuit
in tribal court

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.210
saying, please, Dollar
General, we think

01:42:02.210 --> 01:42:03.710
you need to pay for
our child's pain

01:42:03.710 --> 01:42:07.570
and suffering because our
child was abused on your watch

01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:10.750
at your store by your employee,
and you didn't stop it.

01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:13.510
And that's a very
common theory of law

01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:16.180
in terms of negligent
supervision of your employee

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.910
when there's been
a sexual assault.

01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:19.327
And Dollar General's
real argument

01:42:19.327 --> 01:42:21.951
has been to date, and it hasn't
progressed to the [? merits, ?]

01:42:21.951 --> 01:42:23.515
because their only
argument has been,

01:42:23.515 --> 01:42:25.640
the tribal court doesn't
have jurisdiction over us.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.724
We're not Indian.

01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:29.140
And it's going all the way up
to the United States Supreme

01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:29.640
Court.

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.190
On December 7, the Supreme
Court will hear the arguments.

01:42:32.190 --> 01:42:34.140
And if you read
their brief, it's

01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.560
like Olifante all over again.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.310
First of all, they
cite Olifante, I think,

01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:39.430
like I lost count,
maybe 50 times.

01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:43.400
And they are asking for nothing
less than the Supreme Court.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.202
It's kind of like they're
saying, Supreme Court,

01:42:46.202 --> 01:42:47.160
you did it in Olifante.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.167
You know how to do it.

01:42:48.167 --> 01:42:50.250
You already took away their
criminal jurisdiction.

01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:51.690
Now take away their civil.

01:42:51.690 --> 01:42:54.200
And what's really
inherent in their message

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.150
is that tribal
courts are inferior.

01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:59.350
Which as Angela pointed
out, they're simply not.

01:42:59.350 --> 01:43:00.900
They're simply not.

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:06.340
And so I think it's alarming
that we can be making progress

01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:08.340
on certain fronts,
and that we're

01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.800
threatened with retrogression
on other fronts.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.170
And so I just wanted
to draw that out

01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:16.350
as another point
of conversation.

01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:19.380
-Just to build a bit on
Mary Kathryn's point.

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.440
Something that is
this interesting,

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.690
or a little bit sad,
but still interesting,

01:43:24.690 --> 01:43:27.870
is that Indian country has
not had a whole lot of success

01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:31.150
in the Supreme Court
for the last 40 years.

01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:33.479
And that's saying
it's very lightly.

01:43:33.479 --> 01:43:35.270
There hasn't been a
whole lot of successes,

01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:38.260
and Olifante was issued
before I was born.

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:43.040
And so for my lifetime, we
have not seen many successes

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.790
anywhere, actually.

01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:46.630
Not even in the Congress.

01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:50.800
And so I think what
Sliver captures

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.920
and what the VAWA
reauthorization can communicate

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.090
on what happens
next is first, it

01:43:57.090 --> 01:44:00.690
is hope that
something can be done

01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:04.310
for a whole generation
of women and Natives

01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:07.810
who have not seen anything
go their way with respect

01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:09.530
to the federal government.

01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:10.890
And so that's one thing.

01:44:10.890 --> 01:44:14.540
It tells us that possible
is possible for once.

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:18.960
It also gives us an avenue
for enacting that change.

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:26.010
So the mechanism by which this
recognition of tribal court

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.800
jurisdiction happened
was through the Congress.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.540
It was through lobbying.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.140
It was through
legislative advocacy.

01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:34.660
It was not true
through litigation

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:39.230
in the courts, which is lost
and lost and lost and lost.

01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:43.580
And in this area, I think,
not just understanding

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:47.220
the law is helpful, but
understanding those mechanisms,

01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:53.120
so we can start to open them
for future progressive work.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.230
Because what's happened
here is we've lucked out,

01:44:57.230 --> 01:45:00.310
because VAWA was passing
through the Congress,

01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:02.590
to be able to latch onto it.

01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:06.530
This is an institution
that has passed fewer laws

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:08.990
and done fewer things,
and it's completely

01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:12.230
paralyzed in so many ways.

01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.580
And if this is our
only avenue for change,

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.000
not only do we need to
think about Indian country,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.550
we also need to think
about the Congress,

01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:22.130
and how we can make
that a place to where

01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:24.357
our voices will be
heard, and real change

01:45:24.357 --> 01:45:25.190
can make it through.

01:45:25.190 --> 01:45:28.770
Not just a sliver, but
real statutory change.

01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:32.010
Real legislative change
that can make our courts--

01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:33.962
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:33.962 --> 01:45:36.890
Thank you.

01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:38.441
-Joe, would you like to--

01:45:38.441 --> 01:45:38.940
-Yeah.

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:44.330
I wanted to just say that one
of the problems that we see

01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:48.140
is that the Supreme
Court issues rulings,

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.380
and they just assume
that Congress will fix

01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:54.780
whatever problems they create.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.140
And I agree with what
Maggie just said.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.770
We hope that we can get
Congress to do things.

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:01.990
But realistically,
it's very hard

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:03.340
to get Congress to do things.

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:06.340
And the Supreme Court sort
of puts it off on Congress,

01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.450
you fix it.

01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:10.430
The Congress puts it off
on the Court and says,

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.290
you tell us what
tribal sovereignty is,

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:13.831
and if there's no
tribal sovereignty,

01:46:13.831 --> 01:46:15.360
well, that's not our problem.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.150
And they're both sort of
putting responsibility

01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:21.910
on someone else, not themselves.

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:25.610
And this problem exists
in those situations

01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:29.890
where the law that was
passed, the VAWA 2013,

01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:31.720
did a lot of good things.

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.380
But there are a lot
of Indian nations

01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.647
that are not going to get
jurisdiction under that law

01:46:36.647 --> 01:46:38.230
because there are
certain requirements

01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:39.730
to get jurisdiction.

01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:45.284
And for women in
those nations, what

01:46:45.284 --> 01:46:47.450
they need, if it's not going
to happen that there'll

01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:49.810
be jurisdiction, what
they need is better law

01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:52.750
enforcement by the federal
government, and in some cases,

01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:55.760
by the state governments,
depending on the local--

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.150
there are several states
where the states do their law

01:46:58.150 --> 01:46:59.400
enforcement.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.550
And everyone is refusing
to take responsibility.

01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:07.170
And this is one of the
things that, to me, is why

01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:10.610
works of art are so crucial.

01:47:10.610 --> 01:47:13.510
Because it's very easy
for people to say,

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:14.960
it's not my problem.

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.300
Someone else should
take care of it.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:21.750
And the federal prosecutors
say we don't have enough money.

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.930
We're not close.

01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:25.080
We're not near where
their crimes are.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:26.580
We just don't have
enough resources.

01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:30.890
It's not the thing that
we're going to focus on.

01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:33.720
And they're sort of saying,
it's the Congress's fault.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.380
And the result of all of
this is that you wind up

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.480
having people that
are left vulnerable.

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.310
And it's works of art,
I think, that actually

01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:50.110
can help us actually understand
the significance of the failure

01:47:50.110 --> 01:47:51.990
of people who should
take responsibility

01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:53.650
to take responsibility.

01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:55.110
-Thank you.

01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:58.120
-I just want to--
one more question

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.940
to sort of extend
upon that theme

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:05.820
before we go to the audience,
which is that as Professor

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:09.390
Singer just sort of put it,
if you don't mind I give it

01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:11.280
this reading, that
basically this issue

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.380
has become something
of a hot potato passed

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:19.040
back and forth between
Congress and the Courts.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.400
And Sliver does give us
hope in that respect.

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:22.900
And one of the
things that I thought

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.770
was so powerful about it
was going back and forth

01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:30.320
between the stories of
survivors and the nitty gritty

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.970
of the legislative process.

01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:35.500
And I don't have a stopwatch
there, but a lot of this

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:40.880
takes place in Washington,
where these talks are occurring.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.940
And so, given that Congress
needs to be persuaded,

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:51.140
needs to be nudged, needs
to be shoved, what can we

01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:56.240
do, the Academy, artists, those
who are the audience for Sliver

01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:02.570
as well as the actors
for it, to bring

01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:05.910
about pressure on Congress?

01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:06.950
I get some lessons.

01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:08.530
We get some lessons.

01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:10.140
The role of the media.

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:13.320
The role of the stories.

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.660
My guess is there may be others.

01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:19.670
And I'd like to hear the panel,
and Mary Kathryn and Maggie,

01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:21.820
people who study
lobbying and petitioning

01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.570
to think about that.

01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:27.570
What needs to be
done politically?

01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:30.250
-Well, I mean, I would
just say, in reflecting

01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:31.910
on this play and the
political process,

01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:36.414
is that I was not-- as
a playwright coming in,

01:49:36.414 --> 01:49:38.330
I was a little bit coming
in from the outside.

01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:41.400
I was not a leader in
the movement itself.

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.460
And actually, at
the very last minute

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.290
when they were really struggling
to get through the House,

01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:48.330
I think lot of leaders
in the movement

01:49:48.330 --> 01:49:50.570
realized the power
of the stories,

01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:52.760
and how the women who
were coming forward

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.510
as survivors to
tell their stories

01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:58.040
in Congressional hearings in
the press and in the media

01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.950
was actually moving the dial.

01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:01.709
And that, actually,
I think a lot

01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:03.500
of people in the movement
across the board,

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.680
not just tribal leaders
and Native women,

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.780
would agree and would
tell you that VAWA

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.450
got reauthorized in 2013
because Native women stood

01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:11.370
up and spoke.

01:50:11.370 --> 01:50:13.050
That all the other--

01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:15.550
[APPLAUSE]

01:50:20.753 --> 01:50:23.520
-All the other
constituencies were stuck.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.925
And when Diane Millich, who--
I mean, I am not Diane Millich.

01:50:27.925 --> 01:50:28.920
Let's make that clear.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.940
So when she tells her story,
her story so powerful.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:34.142
It is so much more
powerful when she tells it.

01:50:34.142 --> 01:50:35.600
And I was very
heartbroken that she

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.290
got stuck in Denver
because of a blizzard.

01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:40.820
But when Lisa Brunner
tells her story,

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:46.320
when Billie Jo tells her story,
there is a power in that.

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.530
And I think that's what
makes this play powerful.

01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:52.210
That's what made the
political process powerful.

01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:55.690
And I think it's a huge
testament to the fact

01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:58.670
that I think the
biggest victory we've

01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:01.650
had legally for Indian nations
in the history of the United

01:51:01.650 --> 01:51:06.100
States came from a movement
that was created and propelled

01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.923
forward by Native women
who told their stories.

01:51:08.923 --> 01:51:11.881
And I think that
really says a lot.

01:51:11.881 --> 01:51:13.853
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:15.660
-Maggie or Angela?

01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:24.620
-So I was able to see the
discussions behind the scene

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:27.890
when the statute was
drafted and passed.

01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:33.440
And it was an incredibly
intense experience for me,

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:36.520
because it didn't
looked like it was going

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:39.350
to make it many, many times.

01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:41.300
But it was also
incredibly inspiring,

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:44.130
because I got to see that
behind the scenes in Congress,

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:46.880
it's not just power that counts.

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.190
They actually do have
discussions about the law

01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:54.410
and what the Constitution
means, and they

01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:57.490
deliberate over these questions.

01:51:57.490 --> 01:52:00.590
And the real question
was whether or not

01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:03.270
this was constitutional
after Olifante.

01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:04.840
There were real concerns.

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.830
So to the extent that legal
scholars, and lawyers,

01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:13.210
and academics, and
activists could get in there

01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:17.580
and explain the law to
Congress quickly in a way

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:21.100
that they could understand,
it actually moved the process

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:22.780
forward exponentially.

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:26.050
So I know we think that
it's just mudslinging

01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:29.530
and power all the way down, but
it's not necessarily the case.

01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:31.110
There actually is
a space for reason,

01:52:31.110 --> 01:52:33.450
and therefore, a
space for advocacy.

01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:35.680
Not just with the stories
of survivors, which I think

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.700
are so integral
and so important,

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:42.570
but also about discussions of
the law and the Constitution.

01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:44.750
-And just to add to that,
just one other thing

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:47.520
that I think we saw with
the reauthorization of VAWA,

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:50.440
and that I think it's going to
be really critical to us going

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:53.462
forward is, we're a tiny
percentage of the population.

01:52:53.462 --> 01:52:54.920
I mean, depending
on whether you go

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.720
by enrollment or
self-identification,

01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.170
we're 1% to 2% of
the US population.

01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:02.890
By almost every
marker in the country,

01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:06.410
we tend to be the poorest,
the most isolated,

01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:08.760
have the least
opportunity, et cetera,

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.820
so we don't have access
to a lot of power,

01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.880
and we don't have access
to a lot of money.

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.680
But one thing that
we saw with VAWA

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.640
is that we have to make friends.

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.560
There has to be coalition
politics going on.

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.810
We have to find people
whose interests are aligned

01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:26.040
with ours in ways that
are commonsensical

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.730
and go to people's basic sense
of fairness, and justice,

01:53:30.730 --> 01:53:34.730
and what is right, as I
think the people tonight,

01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:36.160
the performers,
the men and women,

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.330
have really demonstrated.

01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.590
And I think being
able to speak to that

01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:43.390
and to find friends
and find allies outside

01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:45.930
of Indian country is really
critical to getting legislation

01:53:45.930 --> 01:53:49.770
passed of this kind.

01:53:49.770 --> 01:53:51.150
-Can I just add
one more comment?

01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:51.970
-Please.

01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:54.920
-Because I feel like we always
say, what is the solution?

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.820
How do we make this change?

01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:00.060
And I think this is a
part of the solution.

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:03.060
I think what we are doing
here tonight is actually

01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:05.214
pretty revolutionary.

01:54:05.214 --> 01:54:06.755
Because I'm wearing
this lawyers hat,

01:54:06.755 --> 01:54:08.770
but I'm also wearing
my playwright's hat.

01:54:08.770 --> 01:54:11.660
And as a playwright, I look
at this country culturally,

01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:13.451
which we know informs our laws.

01:54:13.451 --> 01:54:14.950
And we still live
in a country where

01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:16.710
if you go to the
American theater,

01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:19.000
you're much more likely to
see a non-Native performing

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.990
red face on stage than an actual
Native body, a Native person,

01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:25.300
on stage performing
Native identity.

01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.710
And you have to ask
yourself, why is that?

01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:30.500
And do you know any theater,
any professional theater

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.620
in the United States right
now, producing a play

01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.690
by a Native playwright?

01:54:33.690 --> 01:54:35.520
I can tell you
several theaters that

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:37.564
have in the last several
years or will soon

01:54:37.564 --> 01:54:39.480
produce a play by a
non-Native playwright that

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.270
puts red face on stage.

01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:43.570
And when you think about
what this play is doing

01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:48.400
by putting actual Native people
on stage to tell their stories,

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.800
that's a pretty
revolutionary act.

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.030
And when you look at the
Supreme Court's jurisprudence,

01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:57.792
I think sometimes when we start
talking about it in Olifante,

01:54:57.792 --> 01:55:00.000
they're like, well, how
could the Supreme Court strip

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.208
tribes of their jurisdiction?

01:55:01.208 --> 01:55:05.400
When you're living in a country
where you have no voice,

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.110
the Court responds to that.

01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:11.360
The Court is a political, but it
is also a cultural institution.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:17.380
And so, I do think that
art is a very, very, very

01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:19.950
important part of the solution.

01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:21.587
-Thank you.

01:55:21.587 --> 01:55:25.990
[APPLAUSE]

01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:29.200
-We had a play, and
we have an audience,

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:34.340
and I note here that at 20
after 8:00 on a Thursday night,

01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:37.560
we have an audience that
has, as far as I can tell,

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.970
well over 100 members
still left in it.

01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:42.450
And I want to thank
everybody for coming.

01:55:42.450 --> 01:55:45.190
And now, we'd like to
turn the possibility

01:55:45.190 --> 01:55:48.870
for opposing questions to
this panel over to you.

01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:54.260
There is a stand and a
microphone in the center aisle.

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:57.160
And if you would like to
just get up and line up

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:06.910
behind that microphone to
ask a question, any question,

01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:11.570
to this panel or offer some
thoughtful remarks, please

01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:12.250
do so.

01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:15.334
Keep in mind that we
have about 20-25 minutes

01:56:15.334 --> 01:56:17.250
left in the evening, so
that you don't take up

01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:22.210
so much time that time is not
remaining to those behind you.

01:56:22.210 --> 01:56:23.430
Go ahead.

01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.930
-Hi.

01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:25.388
A pleasure to be
here this evening.

01:56:25.388 --> 01:56:29.030
Thank you so much for
having this open discussion

01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:30.030
and play reading.

01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:31.310
Beautiful, beautiful work.

01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.976
Congratulations.

01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:39.130
I am curious and a
little questioning,

01:56:39.130 --> 01:56:44.460
because I didn't quite see the
connection between the Cherokee

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.460
and the Alaska nation.

01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:50.510
And I know part of the
work that is done here

01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:52.590
is reflecting a lot of
the Cherokee struggle.

01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:57.970
So maybe some elucidation on
that would be really great.

01:56:57.970 --> 01:56:59.800
-Sure I'm happy to give that.

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:02.190
And is Nettie still here?

01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:02.740
-She left?

01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:04.590
-OK.

01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:09.120
-So from my point of view--
and I'm not Alaskan native.

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.724
And unfortunately,
Nettie has left,

01:57:10.724 --> 01:57:12.640
but we're very thankful
that she could be here

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.620
with us, because she
came a very long way.

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:17.280
And if you can imagine
traveling from Alaska

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.730
all the way here for this,
it was at least 30 hours

01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:20.290
of traveling.

01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:22.560
And now she's about
to make 30 hours back.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:28.346
But I think that a lot of
the discussions around Alaska

01:57:28.346 --> 01:57:29.720
politically, and
in terms of sort

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:32.260
of the-- everything in
Congress gets shortened,

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:34.370
and so the conversation
gets a bit truncated.

01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:37.200
But what people say is,
well, Alaska's different.

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.890
And a lot of times when I talk
to other federal Indian lawyers

01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:42.200
who are working
in the Lower 48--

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.410
because I'm a little bit
new on the scene too.

01:57:44.410 --> 01:57:46.350
I'm like, how do we have
this legal framework?

01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:49.780
Like how is it that we just
seem to have Alaska excluded,

01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:51.440
and we're not
fighting this harder?

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.420
And a lot of people will say,
well, Alaska's just different.

01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:56.910
And so I started talking to
a lot of women in Alaska,

01:57:56.910 --> 01:58:00.700
and trying to figure out,
why is Alaska different?

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.610
And the only thing
we could figure out

01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:05.110
is-- because it's not that
they don't have tribes.

01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:08.700
They have 229 federally
recognized tribes.

01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.184
They have more
tribes than Oklahoma.

01:58:11.184 --> 01:58:12.975
So it's not because
they don't have tribes.

01:58:12.975 --> 01:58:14.510
It's not because they
don't have Native people.

01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:16.150
They have their
ancestral homelands,

01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:17.530
just like we have ours.

01:58:17.530 --> 01:58:20.020
And when you look at
it, I think the point

01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:24.410
of making that connection
is that-- I think

01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:26.660
it's really easy for us
in this country today

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.240
to look at what happened to
my nation, Cherokee Nation,

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.810
in 1839, and say wow, that
Trail of Tears was awful.

01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:35.140
And Andrew Jackson
shouldn't have done that.

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.810
And I can sit here today and
say he shouldn't have done that.

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:40.420
But what do we do when we're
still doing that in Alaska?

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:41.900
How do we live
with ourselves when

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:45.280
we're actually just still
doing the exact same thing?

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.150
And when you look at Alaska,
it's the exact repetition.

01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:53.900
We had Trails of Tears and
Indian removal in the 1830s

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:56.090
up through the 1880s here.

01:58:56.090 --> 01:58:57.440
Same thing happened in Alaska.

01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.404
They came in.

01:58:58.404 --> 01:58:59.820
Everyone was living
where they had

01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:01.100
lived for thousands of years.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.850
And the government said,
you've got to move here.

01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:04.270
If you don't send your
kids to this school,

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:05.770
we're going to put you in jail.

01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:09.820
And in 1887, Congress
passed the Dawes Act,

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.280
and basically broke up a
lot of tribal reservations

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:15.870
and distributed tribal lands
to non-Indian settlers.

01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:19.260
Congress did the same
thing to Alaska in 1971.

01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.440
And then when you
think about Olifante,

01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.830
the Supreme Court in
1978 said, you guys

01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:25.450
don't have jurisdiction anymore.

01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:27.560
In 1998, the Supreme
Court said, there's

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.450
no Indian country
left in Alaska.

01:59:30.450 --> 01:59:33.630
So to me, they're
exactly the same.

01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:37.200
But law is just a set of rules
that at the end of the day,

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.200
nine people decide, or Congress
when they come in and maybe fix

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:45.980
what nine people decided.

01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:49.440
So these are all frameworks
that we've created,

01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:52.640
and that it's really a question.

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.870
How is Alaska different?

01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:58.910
Because it really
isn't, I think.

01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:59.720
-One quick note.

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:05.490
I'd like to mention
Hawaii, because that's also

02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.350
treated as different.

02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:12.070
In Hawaii, it's not
treated as Indian country.

02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:13.820
There is no tribal sovereignty.

02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:15.950
And you have native
peoples who are still

02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:19.150
fighting every day
to have recognition

02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:21.050
in the first instance.

02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:24.220
And so, I think this
patchwork that we have,

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:26.410
as we've seen the
patchwork of jurisdiction

02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:28.180
does not serve
Indian women well,

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:31.580
the patchwork of
treatment of tribes

02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:35.540
from Alaska, to Hawaii,
to the 50 states,

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.700
the complexity is alone a cost.

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.845
It is alone a problem
that we need to remedy.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.140
-I just want to
mention Massachusetts.

02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:50.580
The [INAUDIBLE] tribe
just lost a case recently

02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:54.540
because the history of the
federal recognition of tribes

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:58.160
in Massachusetts is
very different from what

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.080
it is in other places.

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.784
So I think to some
extent, we actually

02:01:03.784 --> 02:01:05.950
would like to have the
relation to the United States

02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:08.360
and the tribes be
different from each tribe,

02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.480
because each tribe
has the ability

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:13.630
to create a relationship
which suits it.

02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:16.140
On the other hand, some
of these differences

02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:17.850
are nothing less
than discriminatory,

02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:21.680
because they are denying
certain of the Indian nations

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.070
basic rights and
sovereign powers that

02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:28.220
are given to others without
adequate reason other

02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:31.560
than we did it in 1978.

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:33.213
Which is not good
reason for some

02:01:33.213 --> 02:01:35.050
of these different treatments.

02:01:35.050 --> 02:01:36.310
-Thanks, Joe.

02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.860
Question?

02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:37.360
-Hi.

02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.440
My name is Christopher
[? Helium. ?]

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.870
I'm actually a student in
Professor Riley's Federal

02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:42.630
Indian Law class.

02:01:42.630 --> 02:01:45.470
I wanted to say first off
that that was amazing.

02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:48.786
And I'm very impressed
at the ability

02:01:48.786 --> 02:01:55.580
of that to boil down a very
complicated legal issue

02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:57.250
into a way that's
very digestible.

02:01:57.250 --> 02:01:59.820
So I thought that
was very impressive.

02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:02.680
My question is actually somewhat
similar to the last question

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:03.600
about Alaska.

02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:12.270
I was sort of unclear as to why
the state doesn't enforce laws

02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:13.210
in Alaska.

02:02:13.210 --> 02:02:15.770
I understand that in a lot of
ways, the situation in Alaska

02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:16.450
is very similar.

02:02:16.450 --> 02:02:18.540
But the legal situation,
as we learned in class,

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.140
is really different in
Alaska, as you mentioned.

02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:24.860
And I'm just wondering what
it's like on the ground there.

02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:27.230
-Once again, I wish
Nettie was here.

02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:30.860
But she's not, so I'll
take this question.

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:38.302
So you know for a long time,
the Alaska attorney general--

02:02:38.302 --> 02:02:40.260
once again, going back
to the very basic point,

02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.410
our tribes are sovereign.

02:02:41.410 --> 02:02:42.640
We don't need the
federal government

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.973
to tell us that we're sovereign.

02:02:43.973 --> 02:02:46.510
At the same time, we live
in the reality of 2015.

02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:50.000
And for a long time, the state
attorney general in Alaska

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.950
had refused to enforce tribal
court protection orders.

02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:58.687
And so if you can imagine, a
lot of Native women in Alaska,

02:02:58.687 --> 02:03:01.020
where they suffer the highest
rates of domestic violence

02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.610
in the United States, could
go to their tribal court,

02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:06.410
get at protection order,
and then the state

02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:07.650
would refuse to enforce it.

02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:09.429
So basically, if
you went anywhere

02:03:09.429 --> 02:03:11.470
outside your little
community, you were not safe.

02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:15.290
No law enforcement
would protect you.

02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:18.740
Now, why would the state refuse
to enforce protection orders?

02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:22.130
Honestly, you know, I
could make some guesses,

02:03:22.130 --> 02:03:27.860
but they never really decided
to announce their reasoning.

02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.900
So they did recently--
the attorney general

02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:31.790
within the last several
months did come out

02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:34.030
with a new opinion
saying they will now

02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:37.070
enforce tribal court
issued protection orders.

02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:38.850
I think they received
a few messages

02:03:38.850 --> 02:03:39.842
from the federal
government about how

02:03:39.842 --> 02:03:41.258
it was in violation
of federal law

02:03:41.258 --> 02:03:43.560
to not enforce those
protection orders.

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.650
So I think they received
some encouragement

02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:48.110
to bring them into compliance.

02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:51.902
But I think that for
a lot of states--

02:03:51.902 --> 02:03:53.610
so I can kind of
generalize a little bit,

02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:56.110
because I live in Oklahoma.

02:03:56.110 --> 02:03:59.290
And in this Dollar General
case that I was talking about,

02:03:59.290 --> 02:04:01.990
our attorney general,
Attorney General Pruitt,

02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:05.030
filed an amicus brief on
the side of Dollar General,

02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:08.450
arguing that, oh, yeah, yeah,
by the way, tribes in Oklahoma

02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:10.730
also don't have civil
jurisdiction over non-Indians.

02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:13.910
Can you imagine the chaos
that would happen if they did?

02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:15.880
And he listed like a
parade of horribles,

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.182
like if a non-Indian drove
into a casino parking lot

02:04:19.182 --> 02:04:21.140
and didn't realize he
was on tribal trust land,

02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:23.210
and then all of a sudden could
be brought into tribal court

02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:24.810
for doing something
awful to someone.

02:04:24.810 --> 02:04:25.870
Oh, my gosh.

02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:28.205
And they list all these
parade of horribles.

02:04:28.205 --> 02:04:31.210
Well, you have to wonder,
why is the AG fighting

02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:33.630
tribal civil
jurisdiction so hard?

02:04:33.630 --> 02:04:36.630
Why does the Alaska
AG care so much

02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:40.240
about not enforcing tribal
court protection orders?

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.770
And I think-- this
is just purely

02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:45.330
my thought, because I don't
work for a state government.

02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:47.520
But I think that at
the end of the day,

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:49.470
the rights of our
Native women get

02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:55.340
sacrificed by state governments
who want tribal lands.

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:59.150
Want the resources, the oil, the
money, the taxes, the revenues.

02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:02.220
And that's been happening, as
we say in the play, since 1492.

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:08.000
So the idea being, I think,
for state governments that

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.850
don't want the resources
and the minerals

02:05:09.850 --> 02:05:11.808
and whatever's on the
land within a reservation

02:05:11.808 --> 02:05:13.600
to be taken away
from them, they don't

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:16.110
want any kind of precedent
that actually recognizes

02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:18.550
tribal sovereignty, because
that might limit their ability

02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:20.690
somewhere down the road
to extract something

02:05:20.690 --> 02:05:21.790
that could make money.

02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:23.890
And so that's where you
see Native women become

02:05:23.890 --> 02:05:28.767
the sacrifice for those kinds
of profits, if that makes sense.

02:05:28.767 --> 02:05:30.198
[APPLAUSE]

02:05:30.198 --> 02:05:32.057
-Thank you.

02:05:32.057 --> 02:05:32.640
Next question.

02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:37.810
-Hello. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:44.720
My name's [? Farina ?] King, and
I'm a Native American History

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:47.310
PhD Candidate from
Arizona State University,

02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:50.850
currently a visiting scholar
at Dartmouth College.

02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:52.430
And I'm so grateful that--

02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:53.254
[APPLAUSE]

02:05:53.254 --> 02:05:54.080
Oh, thanks.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:57.360
I am so grateful to have
this opportunity to see this.

02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.270
It's so powerful.

02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:02.040
And I just had to cover my
mouth and think of puppies

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:04.170
not to ball.

02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:10.390
Because my existence is
based off of a relationship

02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:11.790
that probably was rape.

02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:14.570
We don't know because
of the silences.

02:06:14.570 --> 02:06:19.430
Because my grandfather was
a parentless Navajo man

02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:22.240
who went to become
a medicine man.

02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:24.730
But you know, I'm doing
my family history,

02:06:24.730 --> 02:06:27.430
and piecing together
a story of his mother

02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:31.920
who worked for a trader, and he
slept with several Navajo women

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.930
and had several
children with them.

02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:37.280
Anyway, so for me, I've
often thought about this,

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:40.520
and how my father, you
know, that doesn't exist.

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:41.840
He's Navajo.

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.240
Full Navajo.

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.670
That's not a part of his story.

02:06:44.670 --> 02:06:46.950
His father didn't speak English.

02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:48.540
This is a part of it.

02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:51.890
And not only that, but also
the stories of my family,

02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:56.170
and that almost every woman
in my family on my Navajo side

02:06:56.170 --> 02:07:00.800
has faced abuse,
sexual, physical.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.920
That my father saw his mother
beat to the ground, my grandma.

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:09.870
And so this was really strong
for me, and thank you so much.

02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:13.410
I have two quick questions.

02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:17.840
One is, a lot of abuse
that I hear about as well

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:20.560
is actually done by Native men.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.910
And I found it really
amazing in the story

02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:25.930
how you featured the men
supporting the women here.

02:07:25.930 --> 02:07:30.060
But how does that affect
this movement as well,

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.260
of the abuse done by Native men.

02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:34.750
And then secondly,
there's a conversation

02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:39.470
about-- I heard some
Native American lawyer

02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:42.210
activist saying we
need to stop talking

02:07:42.210 --> 02:07:45.220
on moral terms in
these cases and push

02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.300
more talking about economics.

02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:53.470
And so how does economic
terms affect this movement

02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:55.800
and these battles
as well, and also

02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.850
those types of contestations?

02:07:57.850 --> 02:08:00.640
[NON-ENGLISH] Thank you.

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:01.140
-Thank you.

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:03.630
I just wanted to take a
crack at the first question,

02:08:03.630 --> 02:08:05.860
and then turn it over.

02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.080
So I think,
absolutely, depending

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.380
on the demographics of a
particular reservation, some

02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:13.430
as you know are heavily
allotted and have

02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:15.241
a lot of non-Indians
living there.

02:08:15.241 --> 02:08:17.740
Some have a lot of non-Indians
who come onto the reservation

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.190
either to live and work,
or for other reasons.

02:08:21.190 --> 02:08:23.430
So your reservation
demographics can

02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:25.850
have a lot to do with what
the makeup is, and therefore,

02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:28.800
who enters into relationships,
and therefore where

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.680
domestic violence really rests.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:33.920
So there's no question
that on some reservations,

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:36.230
a significant part of
the domestic violence

02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:40.630
is occurring in couples were
both partners are Indian.

02:08:40.630 --> 02:08:43.270
Where the perpetrator's Indian
and the victim is Indian.

02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:47.450
And one of the things that,
just looking at the way

02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:51.470
that I think tribes have
approached this-- so tribes do

02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:54.450
have criminal jurisdiction over
Indians on the reservation.

02:08:54.450 --> 02:08:56.720
And so one of the things
that's been really critical

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:02.670
is consistent standard set
forms of funding so that tribes

02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:05.030
can implement the kinds of
criminal justice systems

02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:07.920
that they need, so
that they can basically

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.750
police their own communities
and hold people accountable.

02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:13.509
And part of that, really, is
that the Indian Law and Order

02:09:13.509 --> 02:09:15.425
Commission out of the
Tribal Law and Order Act

02:09:15.425 --> 02:09:18.760
did an amazing exhaustive
report about criminal justice

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.830
in Indian country.

02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:21.860
And one of the things
that they found

02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:26.330
was that even if a prosecution
in a tribal court parallels,

02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:29.120
or in many ways,
is similar to what

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:32.280
would happen in a federal
court, just the legitimacy

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.040
of having the tribe being
able to police and enforce

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:39.090
its own laws on the reservation
among its own people

02:09:39.090 --> 02:09:42.740
increases the buy in of
the people to the system.

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:46.170
Many Native people don't
find outside criminal justice

02:09:46.170 --> 02:09:49.380
systems to be legitimate,
because for so long

02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:51.219
they've caused us harm.

02:09:51.219 --> 02:09:52.760
They haven't worked
to our advantage.

02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:54.470
They haven't worked
to protect as.

02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:56.660
They work to come
and take people away.

02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.229
So people don't really trust it.

02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:59.770
And so one of the
things that I think

02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:02.900
is just, in my own research,
one of the critical components,

02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:05.890
is investing in tribal
justice systems,

02:10:05.890 --> 02:10:08.240
supporting them, consistent
forms of funding,

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.750
empowering tribes to engage
in criminal justice activities

02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:14.870
themselves on the reservation.

02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:18.590
And when you do that, you do
actually see better outcomes.

02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:21.452
It hasn't been studied very
extensively, but what we do see

02:10:21.452 --> 02:10:23.410
is there are better
outcomes when that happens.

02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:25.740
So there's a big
push to really try

02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:27.780
to channel some of
those funds away

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:29.376
from federal or
state governments

02:10:29.376 --> 02:10:30.750
and back into
tribal governments,

02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:32.130
partially for that purpose.

02:10:37.516 --> 02:10:39.140
-With respect to the
economic argument,

02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:41.660
I'll just answer
very, very quickly.

02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:44.600
You know, I haven't
seen it work.

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:45.830
Not with Congress.

02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:48.440
Not in the way this did.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.760
And I think it also
doesn't empower

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.710
communities, our
communities, in the same way

02:10:53.710 --> 02:10:55.780
to talk about economics.

02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:59.180
Generally, economists do that,
whereas this is something

02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:01.852
that folks can relate to.

02:11:01.852 --> 02:11:03.310
I think that there
are ways to talk

02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:06.360
about the stability of tribal
governments and economics,

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:10.040
and that's something that was
there a major accomplishment

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.100
of the Harvard
Project, to understand

02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:14.720
that our problem with
economics in Indian country

02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:17.840
is a problem of governance,
of the inability

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.630
of tribal governments to not
only know what they're supposed

02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:26.750
to be doing, but also to
govern within the limits,

02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:28.300
extreme limits,
that have been set

02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:30.781
on them by the
federal government.

02:11:30.781 --> 02:11:32.530
So I think that there
are arguments there,

02:11:32.530 --> 02:11:35.860
but as you've seen
today, it's hard to have

02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:39.530
a play about economics
in the same way.

02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:41.240
-That'll be my next play.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.000
-She can pull it off, if anyone.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.900
-Next.

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:47.590
-Hi.

02:11:47.590 --> 02:11:48.730
My name is Christopher
[? Lukasic. ?]

02:11:48.730 --> 02:11:51.354
I'm an undergraduate student at
the University of Massachusetts

02:11:51.354 --> 02:11:52.390
at Amherst.

02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:57.720
So Professor Riley, you talked
about how Native people are not

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:00.620
really trusting of the
criminal justice system.

02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:05.460
And my question basically is,
did the rate protective orders

02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:10.060
for Native women increase
after the reauthorization?

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:13.210
And if so, actually,
I'll leave it at that.

02:12:13.210 --> 02:12:16.590
I have a second question,
but I'll hold that off.

02:12:16.590 --> 02:12:19.255
-So after VAWA, were there
more protection orders?

02:12:19.255 --> 02:12:20.130
Is that the question?

02:12:20.130 --> 02:12:20.760
-Yeah.

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.940
-I don't know that precisely.

02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:25.280
I mean, what we do
know is that there

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:28.590
were 26 non-Indians prosecuted
for domestic violence.

02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:31.000
Some of those also, not all
of them, but some of those

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
also involved the violation
of a protection order,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.530
some which were tribal,
and some which were

02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:38.050
issued by other sovereigns.

02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:40.380
So it certainly was
a feature of that.

02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:43.090
And really crimes that
probably would have gone

02:12:43.090 --> 02:12:45.180
unprosecuted otherwise.

02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:47.230
One other thing that
was really interesting,

02:12:47.230 --> 02:12:49.550
and also goes to the
protection order issue,

02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:52.790
is that if you look at
the assessment of one

02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:55.620
of the tribes that had the
most prosecutions in the Pilot

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:58.520
Project period, it was
[INAUDIBLE] in Arizona.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.000
And they calculate--
and I'm going

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.330
to give you the statistic,
and maybe a little off.

02:13:03.330 --> 02:13:06.370
But it's something around
that of the 18 cases

02:13:06.370 --> 02:13:08.990
they had involving
15 defendants,

02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:14.080
those defendants had close
to 100 contacts with police

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:17.650
prior to the arrest that
led to their prosecution.

02:13:17.650 --> 02:13:20.000
But many times,
the tribal police

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.310
were acting as a peace
officer in those instances,

02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:24.150
and then the tribe
didn't have jurisdiction,

02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:25.170
and then nothing happened.

02:13:25.170 --> 02:13:26.550
And then there's
another contact.

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:27.760
And then nothing happened.

02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.770
Not all of the contacts
were criminal in nature.

02:13:29.770 --> 02:13:32.430
They could have been a variety
of different kinds of contexts.

02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.750
But almost 100 contacts
of those defendants.

02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:37.230
And certainly, many of
them involved violations

02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:38.430
of protection orders.

02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:40.849
So I don't know exactly if
the number has increased,

02:13:40.849 --> 02:13:42.390
but there's clear
that there is crime

02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:46.600
happening in Indian
country by non-Indians.

02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:50.000
-And my second
question is, what type

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.860
of culturally appropriate
prevention programs

02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:55.371
need to be implemented
to actually prevent

02:13:55.371 --> 02:13:56.620
violence against Native women?

02:13:59.510 --> 02:14:03.680
-Well, I think there's a whole
range of different programs.

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:09.710
And the VAWA that
got reauthorized

02:14:09.710 --> 02:14:12.260
in 2013, as I said
earlier, was the result

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:14.370
of the huge movement.

02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:16.830
And a lot of the women who
were involved in the movement

02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:18.760
are involved in their
own communities,

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:20.320
and are involved in this work.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.380
And so a lot of tribes
have tribal programs

02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:25.730
that are led by Native women
in those communities that

02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:27.250
are leading the way.

02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:29.180
And actually, Lisa Brunner
sitting right here,

02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:31.100
is a really great example.

02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:33.530
And so I would encourage
anyone to talk to her

02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:36.090
about the efforts
that she's undertaken

02:14:36.090 --> 02:14:37.410
to do a lot of that work.

02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:39.190
And I will just give
a quick shout out

02:14:39.190 --> 02:14:44.210
to also one of my good
friends, is Gregory Gray Cloud

02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:46.700
And he's working at
Rosebud right now,

02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:49.160
and he has a group
called Wica Agli.

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.400
And that's spelled W-I-C-A, new
word, A-G-L-I. So look it up.

02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.570
They're doing amazing work.

02:14:54.570 --> 02:14:56.720
The whole theory of that
group is it's led by men,

02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.840
and it's this idea that the way
to stop violence against women

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.640
is to educate the men.

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:05.004
And that it's actually
a man's responsibility.

02:15:05.004 --> 02:15:06.980
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:10.870
And what's so beautiful
about the work

02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:13.727
that they're doing is that the
tribal court there in Rosebud

02:15:13.727 --> 02:15:16.310
has agreed, has like basically
taken them under on a contract.

02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:19.290
And so anyone who's convicted
of a domestic violence

02:15:19.290 --> 02:15:21.790
crime in Rosebud
tribal court will then

02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:24.140
go through the program with
Wica Agli that he runs.

02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:26.290
And it's a
culturally-based program

02:15:26.290 --> 02:15:29.260
because it's not
within Lakota culture

02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:31.630
to treat women that
way, to abuse women.

02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:34.250
So it's about
restoring the culture,

02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:35.950
and restoring the value women.

02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:38.063
Because in our tribal
cultures-- I dont'

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:39.712
want to speak too broadly.

02:15:39.712 --> 02:15:42.170
I mean, I've never encountered
a tribal culture that didn't

02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:44.984
practice respecting women.

02:15:44.984 --> 02:15:46.640
Yes.

02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:50.620
So I think, in terms of the
most culturally appropriate

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:54.530
best programs are, when
our men stand up and say

02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:57.819
it's my job to work with
other men in our community

02:15:57.819 --> 02:15:59.360
and to teach them
how to treat women.

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.912
Now unfortunately, because of
all the jurisdictional issues,

02:16:01.912 --> 02:16:04.120
we're not really in a place
where a program like that

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.270
works with non-Indians.

02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:07.910
Because even though we have the
restored jurisdiction in VAWA,

02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:14.400
it's very westernized, and it's
imposing a very Westernized

02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:15.410
system.

02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:17.900
And so things we want
to do outside of that,

02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.500
we have to get creative.

02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:22.660
-I think just this one follow up
there's nothing more culturally

02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:25.780
appropriate them local
control and allowing

02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:28.860
tried to self-govern, and
to set their own programs,

02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:32.795
and to protect their own
people in the way they see fit.

02:16:32.795 --> 02:16:33.336
-Well stated.

02:16:33.336 --> 02:16:34.304
-Thank you.

02:16:34.304 --> 02:16:36.240
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:38.510
-This is our last
question, and then I

02:16:38.510 --> 02:16:41.780
want to leave the last word
after this question to Shelley

02:16:41.780 --> 02:16:42.459
Lowe.

02:16:42.459 --> 02:16:43.629
Thank you.

02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:44.139
-Hi.

02:16:44.139 --> 02:16:45.940
I'm Jen [? Durnwater. ?]
I'm also

02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:48.469
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.969
So yay.

02:16:51.354 --> 02:16:52.979
I have a question,
but then I also just

02:16:52.979 --> 02:16:56.969
want to just quickly say I did
master's thesis in Alaska, so I

02:16:56.969 --> 02:17:00.170
can speak-- I'm certainly not
going to speak for anyone who's

02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:01.799
not myself and my tribe.

02:17:01.799 --> 02:17:05.340
But I do know that the
rates of sexual assault

02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:09.420
are so high there that one
of the weekly free papers

02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:11.930
that you can get in Anchorage,
it actually every week

02:17:11.930 --> 02:17:16.290
has a rape report with a listing
of all of the sexual assaults

02:17:16.290 --> 02:17:19.240
that have been
reported to the police.

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.410
And I've never encountered
that anywhere else in the US.

02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:23.910
So yeah.

02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:25.590
So my question, you
touched a little bit

02:17:25.590 --> 02:17:28.030
on about men and
culture, and how

02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:31.690
to get our men more organized
and involved in fighting

02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:33.830
against assault of women.

02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:34.910
So you cover that.

02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:37.770
But the other question
I had is, what can we

02:17:37.770 --> 02:17:41.080
do for indigenous women
who live in urban areas

02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:44.389
to fight all of the
abuse that we suffer.

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:46.250
Because yes, we
need to address what

02:17:46.250 --> 02:17:48.719
happens on reservations,
and reserves in Canada,

02:17:48.719 --> 02:17:49.420
and so forth.

02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.870
But so many of us are urban,
and we're still experiencing

02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:54.250
a great deal of violence.

02:17:54.250 --> 02:17:56.520
And yes, technically,
the law is supposed

02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:58.120
to be there to protect us.

02:17:58.120 --> 02:17:59.670
But it certainly doesn't.

02:17:59.670 --> 02:18:03.959
So what are your legislative
or policy ideas on that?

02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:09.730
-I think criminal
justice systems

02:18:09.730 --> 02:18:11.370
need to be reformed generally.

02:18:11.370 --> 02:18:15.090
I think we've seen disparities
in enforcement and means

02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:18.420
of enforcement across
communities quite recently

02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:21.030
in very intense ways.

02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:23.620
And so I think that
our discussions

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:26.620
about criminal justice should
incorporate Native women,

02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.260
they should
incorporate Native men.

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:32.180
Because the statistics
are equally as troubling

02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:34.450
across minorities.

02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:36.969
And so that's one solution.

02:18:36.969 --> 02:18:39.690
But I think in
addition to that, there

02:18:39.690 --> 02:18:46.290
could be a culturally specific
legislative solutions that

02:18:46.290 --> 02:18:49.180
do look at the
particular problems

02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:51.490
the Native women face
within urban centers,

02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:54.129
and the fact that they're
taking with them this concern

02:18:54.129 --> 02:18:58.040
about government involvement
to those urban centers in a way

02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:02.400
to address that concern and the
way police interact with them

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:04.219
in particular.

02:19:04.219 --> 02:19:06.330
-And this might sound
really abstract ,

02:19:06.330 --> 02:19:09.930
but I truly believe that the
restoration and recognition

02:19:09.930 --> 02:19:13.299
of our tribes' inherent
sovereignty to protect tribal

02:19:13.299 --> 02:19:15.620
citizens and including
its own Native women,

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.000
when that legal
framework shifts,

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.129
I think we'll see either
as a result of or as a part

02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:23.930
of, or maybe the
driving force will be,

02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:26.309
a cultural shift the United
States where women go from

02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:29.670
being sexual objects to be
abused to being actual citizens

02:19:29.670 --> 02:19:31.340
to be respected.

02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:37.860
And I think when you look at a
lot of the way our Native women

02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:40.354
are depicted in American
culture, I mean,

02:19:40.354 --> 02:19:43.020
they're just a Halloween costume
right now in the United States.

02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:43.730
Literally.

02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:50.250
Or maybe really like
a Pocahontas kind

02:19:50.250 --> 02:19:51.710
of character in a Disney movie.

02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:54.270
And so I think when
we're talking off

02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:56.720
of tribal lands and the
rates of domestic violence

02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:59.170
against our native
women in urban areas,

02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:03.530
I think at the root of
that is the legal framework

02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.220
and the cultural
misunderstanding that

02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:07.390
perpetuates from that.

02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:10.290
When our tribal sovereign
nations aren't real,

02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:12.590
then how can how can any
American citizen conceive

02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:14.090
of their women as real?

02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:17.040
And I think that's the
problem we're facing.

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.065
Thank you.

02:20:19.065 --> 02:20:19.565
Thank you.

02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:25.170
I'm going to leave the final
word to Shelley Lowe, Executive

02:20:25.170 --> 02:20:27.680
Director of HUNAP.

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:28.700
-Thank you.

02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:32.600
I just have some books,
actually, to give out.

02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:35.360
I want to give a shout out to
the National Indigenous Women's

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.550
Resource Center in Montana.

02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:40.225
They have been major, major
supporters to this play

02:20:40.225 --> 02:20:41.800
and to Mary Kathryn.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.370
And it's very important
to them that this play be

02:20:44.370 --> 02:20:46.820
performed and heard everywhere.

02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:50.150
So on behalf of them
and thanks to Harvard,

02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:52.090
I want to acknowledge
a few people.

02:20:52.090 --> 02:20:54.460
There's information about
this book on your chair.

02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:57.610
It's Safety for Native Women,
VAWA and American Indian

02:20:57.610 --> 02:21:01.540
Tribes, and it's published
by the Resource Center.

02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:03.140
I have one for
each of the panels,

02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:05.098
and I won't ask you to
come here at the moment.

02:21:05.098 --> 02:21:06.030
You can stay there.

02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:09.160
I have one for Aharon and
Esther, for all their hard work

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:11.146
on behalf of NALSA.

02:21:11.146 --> 02:21:14.104
You guys can come
grab yours real quick.

02:21:14.104 --> 02:21:17.062
[APPLAUSE]

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:29.940
-As students, they took time out
of their busy, busy, busy, busy

02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:32.510
schedules to help us
do some fund raising.

02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:34.260
We want to thank them for that.

02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:37.750
Bringing this to Harvard
is a feat all in itself

02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:39.440
I think sometimes.

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:42.570
It was very powerful
as you've seen.

02:21:42.570 --> 02:21:44.200
But it's also something
that you really

02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:47.300
have to convince an institution
that, yes, we should do this.

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.708
And I want to thank
Dan for helping

02:21:49.708 --> 02:21:51.798
with that as a conversation.

02:21:51.798 --> 02:21:52.423
Thank you, Dan.

02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:57.730
But then we have
to thank Radcliffe.

02:21:57.730 --> 02:22:01.350
And the first person who we
had to talk to about this,

02:22:01.350 --> 02:22:03.190
and we had to say,
come on, this is good,

02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:04.390
it fits our thematic year.

02:22:04.390 --> 02:22:04.973
Let's do this.

02:22:04.973 --> 02:22:06.490
And she said, yes,
let's do this.

02:22:06.490 --> 02:22:09.854
I want to thank Becky Wassarman.

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:13.347
[APPLAUSE]

02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:20.640
And more importantly.

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:22.360
Becky then said,
yes, let's do this.

02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:26.189
But we have to get the big,
big, big approval, which

02:22:26.189 --> 02:22:27.480
can be kind of scary sometimes.

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:29.630
You're like, a
OK, OK, all right.

02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:32.760
And she was pitched the
idea, and she wholeheartedly

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:36.070
said yes, even when
she saw the budget.

02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:40.270
So yes, we are at Radcliffe
tonight for a reason.

02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.420
And Dean Cohen, I want
to thank you for that,

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:46.356
for being such a great support.

02:22:46.356 --> 02:22:49.800
[APPLAUSE]

02:22:57.867 --> 02:22:59.950
And for being here all
evening with us, thank you.

02:22:59.950 --> 02:23:02.760
And lastly after we got
it, and we were set,

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:04.620
we were ready to go.

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:07.060
We sent little personal
notes to the provost

02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.850
and the President of Harvard
and said, we're doing this.

02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:10.900
Can you support us?

02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:12.620
And they said yes.

02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:15.580
So I want to think Provost
Garber, and President Drew

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:17.850
Faust for their support.

02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:19.710
I have the book here
for Provost Garber.

02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:22.080
I'm going to ask Associate
Provost Lori Gross.

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:23.060
To come and get this.

02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:26.950
We will send President
Faust, a book to her.

02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:29.350
[APPLAUSE]

02:23:35.517 --> 02:23:36.850
Thank you, everybody for coming.

02:23:36.850 --> 02:23:38.950
I hope you enjoyed it.

02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:42.300
