MALE SPEAKER: Good morning
and welcome to Talks at Google

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.880
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.110
Today it is my great pleasure
to introduce Dr. Anna

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.870
Frebel of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.370
where she is Assistant Professor
in the Department of Physics.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.280
She is here today to
discuss her book "Searching

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.880
for the Older Stars--
Ancient Relics

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.070
From the Early Universe."

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.189
Why do we care?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.770
Because if it's not lithium,
hydrogen, or helium,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.680
it came from these stars.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.610
Dr. Frebel herself,
along with colleagues,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.510
is responsible for discovering
many of these stars.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.340
And in her book she
discovers the process

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.080
by which she does it.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.550
The book itself is one of
the rare books in which we

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.150
get a dose of actual
science in terms

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.510
that both experts and lay
people can understand,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.270
as well as a great
behind the scenes

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.810
look at what's involved
marathon observatory

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.010
sessions to discover
the stars and map them.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.750
So without further
ado, please join me

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.830
in welcoming Dr. Anna Frebel.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.197
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:27.410
ANNA FREBEL: Thank you so much
for the great introduction.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.800
I'm very excited to be her
and to talk about my book.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.610
It's been in the making
for quite a while.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.340
So I'm really pleased
that it's finally out.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.141
And it really got very exciting.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.530
So I wanted to quickly introduce
and tell you a little bit what

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.364
my goal was of all these years.

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:50.780
Of course I'm a
scientist, but I'm

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.110
very interested in
conveying my research

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.870
results, but also the scientific
method to the wider audience.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.680
And in this case, I
have to quote my mom,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.580
because I regularly tell her
oh, I'm going to the telescope.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.949
I'm going observing.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.350
And she always says, yeah, yeah.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.990
Now, after having
written the book

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.190
and of course her reading
it in great detail,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.670
she really understands
what this means.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.510
And the point of this is
that the public really

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.090
doesn't know what
scientists do all day long.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.710
And this thing of going
observing and using telescopes

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.890
is certainly very
mysterious to anyone who

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.540
hasn't been at the telescope.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.060
And there are even lots
of astronomers who haven't

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.365
been at a big telescope.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:41.110
So this is really
a widespread issue.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.260
And so I wanted to
write a book that is not

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.820
your typical popular
science book that presents

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.190
just the scientific results.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.330
But I also wanted to tell the
story of how we get there.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.840
As it turns out, it's never
really a straight line path.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.670
And so the big windy
road is characterized

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.260
by good luck and bad luck, and
many other interesting things.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.300
And so I have devoted several
chapters to that journey.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.460
And so my motto is the journey
is the destination because I

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.150
became a scientist because
I wanted to find things out

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.601
and not necessarily to have
the flashiest of results.

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:28.600
Obviously that's really
great when that happens.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.750
And it's a part of the
journey, the destination.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.890
But really what I do on a daily
basis is not all that flashy.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.490
But it's nevertheless
really interesting.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.830
And so I want to give
a realistic insight

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.200
into what astronomers
do on a daily basis.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.270
So let's get the story started.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.120
Let's start right
at the beginning

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.915
some 14 billion years ago.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.900
So the Big Bang occurred
some 14 billion years ago.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.700
And the universe at
that time consisted

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.910
of just three elements--
hydrogen, helium, and lithium.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.690
And from that primordial gas,
the very first stars emerged.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.730
And they were made from
hydrogen, helium, and lithium,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.230
and nothing else.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.380
Now these stars had
very short lives

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.802
because they have
a very high mass.

00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:35.530
I'll touch on that a
little bit later again.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.160
So they were short lived.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.960
And when they exploded
as gigantic supernovae,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.110
the elements that they
had been cooking up,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.440
the additional elements that
they had been cooking up

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.010
in their cores to
sustain their luminosity,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.990
to shine, even for
their short lives,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.880
they were expelled into
the interstellar medium,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.930
into the universe.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.250
And that changed everything
because now the universe

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.160
consisted not just of hydrogen
and helium and lithium,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.370
but also of elements like
carbon and oxygen and iron.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.880
And that has a whole
lot of ramifications

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.250
for additional star formation
and also for galaxy formation.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.400
So clearly these stars ushered
in a new era in the universe.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.780
And then star and
galaxy formation indeed

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.470
had a chance to take off.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.970
So we have this slightly
enriched material here.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.340
And from that the next
generations of stars formed.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.380
And it's actually those
early generations-- here

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.780
the second one in
particular that we

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.810
are trying to find-- because
these stars here now,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.300
or some of these stars
in that generation

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.690
included low mass stars,
small, little stars.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.290
And they have a
very long lifetime.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.960
So they are still around today.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.130
And those are the guys
that we are hunting down

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.890
with our big telescopes.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.700
So I want to tell you
more about how we do that

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.680
and what we learn from
finding these stars.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.050
But first let's talk a little
bit about chemical evolution.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.530
That is the successive
buildup of heavy elements--

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.860
heavier than hydrogen, helium,
lithium-- in the universe

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.600
over billions of years.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.880
Imagine that this here is
the primordial gas cloud,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.760
so just what was there
after the Big Bang.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.170
And the very first stars formed.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.100
And they evolved.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.250
And they exploded as supernovae.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.410
And so the elements
that they cooked up

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.750
inside their cores
for energy production,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.030
they got ejected back
into the reservoir here.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.700
Then this is enriched
a little bit.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.620
You form the next
generation of stars.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.330
And then it goes round
and round and round.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.950
And there are
several consequences.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.860
You can immediately see that
you have this cycle here only

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.765
go around only a few times
as opposed to a few hundred

00:06:56.765 --> 00:07:00.020
or thousand times,
that the amount

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.410
of the heavy elements in the
resulting stars will increase.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.020
So older stars contain
much fewer of the elements.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.120
And the younger
ones contain more.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.440
And the sun, for reference,
also formed at some point,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.090
probably when the cycle had gone
around maybe a thousand times

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.860
in this local region where
the sun formed later.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.040
And the sun contains-- I'll
have another slide on that--

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.440
contains a whole 1.4%
of the heavy elements.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.200
So that's already a lot.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.010
But I'll say a little bit
more about this in a second.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.300
So our primary goal is, when
we search for the oldest stars,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.450
is to look for the
stars with the least

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.850
amount of heavy elements in
them because as it turns out,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.710
it's incredibly difficult
to actually obtain

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.170
an actual age for the star.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.820
However, at the very end,
I'll show you one example

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.040
where we managed to do that.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.768
So that kind of
wraps it all up nice.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.920
So we have to talk about
stellar chemical compositions.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.720
And for reference
here I have at the top

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.640
the composition of the
universe after the Big Bang.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.170
I've already mentioned this.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.160
We have hydrogen, 75%, 25%,
and just a tiny sprinkle

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.720
of lithium.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.280
So I excluded that
because actually it's

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.430
not too relevant for the
remainder of my talk.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.539
And then after about 9 billion
years of chemical evolution,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.690
the sun formed.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.580
That was about 4.6
billion years ago.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.700
And you can see how the
composition changed.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.240
Hydrogen got convert
it into helium,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.340
and helium got converted
into heavy elements.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.740
So the sun is very
rich in heavy elements,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.890
comparatively, a whole 1.4%.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.400
And so what we're
doing is we are

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.040
looking for stars that have a
million times less than this.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.110
So a whole different
ball game, but that

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.480
gives you an idea of what the
ranges we're playing with.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.530
So there are a lot of chemical
elements in the periodic table.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.762
Here a few illustrated.

00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:16.470
I hope your little
coffee shop over there

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.350
will soon sell element cupcakes.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.580
I'm sure they will taste
particularly sweet.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.630
They certainly would to me.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:30.530
A few are highlighted here, C,
N, O, P, S, and N-- oh sorry,

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.460
C, N, O, P, S-- that are
the elements of life.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.030
As humans, we consist
mostly of carbon.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.090
All life forms are carbon based.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.720
And in particular, of
these five elements here.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.840
But we contain also a whole
bunch of other elements.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.660
And all that material of course
needs to come from somewhere.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.990
And I already mentioned
that stars produce

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.460
elements for energy production.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.410
But one thing that
is often forgotten

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.420
is that we actually also carry
a little Big Bang material in us

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.170
because our bodies
consists 90% of water.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.060
And water is made of
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.870
And those protons
in the hydrogen,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.130
they were certainly
recycled through stars.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.820
But they were made
in the Big Bang.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.180
And so we're not just
children of the stars,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.670
but also children
of the Big Bang.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.350
And so I think
that's really nice

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.110
that we can feel a little
connected to the beginning.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.370
And so I already mentioned
here just a few pretty pictures

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.700
because in every
astronomy talk, you also

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.400
need a few pretty pictures.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.120
This is a star
forming region here.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.400
But the elements are
not just made in stars.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.130
They're also made in
supernova explosions.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.720
Here are a few examples of
various so-called supernova

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.780
remnants.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:06.450
So they are just the shells
of heavy element material

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.420
that are still expanding
since the explosion.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.390
And you can actually see in
the different colors here,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.770
they are depicting
different elements.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.760
So you can literally witness
how these new elements that

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.050
are produced in stars
and supernova explosions

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.952
are being dispersed
into the cosmos.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.070
Here is another version
of the periodic table.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.760
You can see that
I'm ready for lunch,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.590
because I like somewhat
unusual depictions

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.830
of the periodic table
of the elements.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.500
But then I'm also not a
chemist, I'm an astronomer.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.150
We take a unique spin
on the periodic table

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.910
because you probably know
from your chemistry classes

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:55.490
that in chemistry here,
according to the colors,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.620
the columns are very
important in chemistry

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.010
because the elements in a
column have similar properties.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.960
As an astronomer, I couldn't
care less about the columns.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.070
I care about the rows because
the elements are subsequently

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.810
made.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.990
If you want to
create iron here, you

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.170
have to create these
guys here beforehand.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.030
So it goes one to
one to one to one

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.200
to get where you have to go.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.880
So we care for the rows.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.540
And so maybe I have
to soon bake one

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.960
of those 109 cupcakes colored
in a slightly different way.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.940
Let's get to the
heart of the matter.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.130
So my work is often
called stellar archaeology

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.340
because we take these survivor
stars that are in the Milky Way

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.330
today, and we study their
chemical composition so that we

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.460
can [INAUDIBLE] their age, or
at least their formation era,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.770
due to the small amounts
of heavy elements in them.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.770
And from that, we
can then infer what

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.610
the composition
of this gas cloud

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.210
was this little guy formed from.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.970
And that tells us
what exactly came out

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.760
of one of those first
star supernova explosions.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.500
Because as I said
in the beginning,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.630
these guys here are very
massive and short lived.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.040
So we can actually not
study them anymore.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.790
The only way we can do this
is through this indirect way

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.510
of looking at their
stellar genes that

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.690
are incorporated into the
next generation of star.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.130
So obviously that
requires that we

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.170
have to find these second
generation stars here.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.450
But we are finding them now.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.260
And so we can infer properties
of these very first stars

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.600
that really shaped the
universe at this early time.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.300
So where do we find these stars?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.310
Let's look at the
Milky Way for a second.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.270
Here is a top view.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.230
And we live in a spiral galaxy.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.930
This is the galactic center.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.140
It's very brightly lit.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.020
You can actually see it here.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.980
This is what we see on the
sky because we sit over here

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.940
about 2/3 on the way out.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.130
And in the northern
hemisphere from here,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.000
we are actually looking out.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.680
So what we see on the sky
is this spiral arm here.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.020
Whereas if we go to the
southern hemisphere,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.450
we look in that direction and
we see that spiral arm here.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.610
But it's backlit by
the galactic center.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.960
And that's why the Milky Way
is so much better in the south.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.480
And this is a
picture of the south.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:40.070
So you can see the back lighting
of the galactic center here.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:46.150
And here is a
further edge on view.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.500
What I want to focus
on now is actually

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.430
not the disk itself at
all, but this outer region

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.280
here that we call
the halo, which

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.550
is very thinly populated
spherical envelope that

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.640
kind of protects and
swirls around the disk.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.800
And we have lots of
things living in their,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.280
little old halo stars.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.170
And those are the
ones we want to find.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.150
It's a little bit like
the junkyard of the galaxy

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.630
actually.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.040
And we also have
little dwarf galaxies

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.910
that are orbiting the
Milky Way as well.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.490
And we study those as well.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.350
So I told you a little
bit about stars now

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.442
and that they are old.

00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:32.900
You can probably
guess that they're

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.210
not very rare, because a lot of
stars have formed since then.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.830
So I want to put this
to a test with you.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.800
Who can tell me which one's
the oldest one in here?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.090
I'll give you a hint, it's not
this guy here in the middle.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.454
That would be too easy.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.960
There can only be
wrong answers here.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.510
Actually, they will
likely be wrong,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.790
but why don't you give it a try.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.290
Yes?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.373
AUDIENCE: The reddest one.

00:16:04.373 --> 00:16:06.030
ANNA FREBEL: The reddest one.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.012
Why do we have red one?

00:16:07.012 --> 00:16:07.970
We have a red one here.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.930
This one?

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.620
Perhaps this one here.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.520
OK, well it's not
the reddest one.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.250
Maybe the bluest one?

00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:21.520
Pardon?

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.519
AUDIENCE: You said they
were small, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.820
ANNA FREBEL: That's a
good deduction, yeah.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.780
However, if you put
a star further away,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.900
it'll appear smaller.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.220
So from this collective image
here, we can't really tell.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.830
Well I can tell you one thing.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.660
I have absolutely no
clue which star is old

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.170
and which star is young.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.710
All we can see in this
image, all that you have seen

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.470
is that there are
different apparent sizes

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.770
and different colors.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.600
Because a picture like that
is really not giving you

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.760
any more information.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.070
Now that's really
good information,

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.490
but it's limited information.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.750
What do we need to do?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.500
Well we need to use a
different technique,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.829
and it's called spectroscopy.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.050
It doesn't deliver
pretty pictures.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.520
But oh boy, it
delivers information.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.359
And you guys hopefully
appreciate that.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:20.730
So we use the method
of spectroscopy

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.819
to explore the outer
atmosphere of the star.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:30.075
And with that we can bridge
very large distances.

00:17:30.075 --> 00:17:31.450
And it's almost
like we're taking

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.650
a little piece of
the star and looking

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.970
at it in the lab, kind
of like the CSI guys

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.710
and their mass spectrometers.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.120
We use big telescopes for that.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.560
But before telling you a
little bit more about that,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.110
I just wanted to
make one more point,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.710
namely a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.500
but a spectrum is worth
a thousand pictures.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.570
Because this is a
star-- this is a picture

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.015
of a very important star.

00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:02.390
But when you look
at the picture,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.060
it's a fuzzy blob
in the universe.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.152
How boring.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:07.110
It's incredibly boring.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.880
It doesn't really
tell us anything.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.220
But the spectroscopic
analysis has

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.480
revealed that this is the by
now second most iron poor star.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.610
So this is a second generation
star in the universe.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.100
That's pretty neat I think.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.590
So let's briefly recap
what we do in terms

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.740
of a chemical balance analysis.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.140
That is based on a spectrum.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.160
We collect the starlight
with a big telescope.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.540
And we have a
spectrograph, which

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.190
is basically a prism here.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.727
So the prism splits up the
light into the rainbow colors,

00:18:44.727 --> 00:18:46.310
and then you get a
spectrum like that.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.893
It doesn't look quite
like the rainbow

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:50.070
because there are all
these dark lines in here.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.860
And each dark line refers
to a little piece of light

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.360
that is lost.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.650
And what's happening
in the stellar surface

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.440
that we are all
observing, there are

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.800
all sorts of elements,
atoms, swirling around.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.490
And each element absorbs
at certain wavelengths.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.550
And well, absorption means
that the light is absorbed.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.210
It's gone.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.860
And so that's why we
see these lines here.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.630
And actually a cross cut
through here is shown up here.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.020
You can see all of
these lines here.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.500
These are all absorption lines.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.290
And if we take a little
peek, a closer look here,

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.170
we have hydrogen lines here.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.710
And here's even a
tiny calcium line.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.020
So we can measure the
strength of these lines

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.660
and then infer their abundance.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.220
Because that's really what we
want in order to determine OK,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.240
how much of these heavy
elements is there,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.910
and is that a star
that could have formed

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.960
as part of the second generation
because it's abundances are

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.290
low.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:54.090
And so I already hinted at
that these stars are very rare.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.660
They formed 13
billion years ago.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.940
And since then, the universe has
been quite busy making stars.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.360
And so we need a big sky surveys
to go from hundreds-- sorry,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.710
from millions, actually
hundreds of millions almost,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.100
stars, to actual
hundreds and then dozens.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.640
And we do that by getting
different kinds of spectra.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.430
And the quality goes up and up.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.140
We really need very high
resolution spectra here

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.950
which just means
we really stretch

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.330
the light out to an extreme
to get to really, really

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.210
fine spectral details here.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.272
So we can measure this
tiny little iron line here.

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.230
And here's another one.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.590
This is the calcium line
here-- to do our work.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.570
So it's quite painstaking.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.340
And it takes years sometimes
to go from here to here.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.720
But it's really awesome
when we get there.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.250
And so let me tell you a
little bit about the observing

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.090
because it's absolutely
fascinating to go there

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.790
and to take your data and
have these discovery moments.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.700
And so that was
something that I really

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.700
wanted to share with everyone.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.000
And so here are just a few
pictures of big telescopes

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.590
that I have used.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.110
I will tell you
a little bit more

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.730
about the Magellan
telescopes here.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.100
These are the Keck
telescopes on Hawaii.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.660
Maybe you have been to Hawaii.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.930
You can even go up the summit,
almost up to the summit

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.560
and take a telescope tour
if you're ever there.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.230
The Japanese telescopes
also up on Mauna Kea,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.380
and then also in Chile some
of the European telescopes.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.090
So lots out there.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.320
And here are the
Magellan telescopes.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.640
I take students there.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.140
This was an undergrad at MIT.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.050
So I like to train students
also from early on.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.210
And I have won some extra
funds to take specifically

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.370
undergrads to the telescope
to give them the research

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.650
experience very early on.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.800
It's very inspiring to them.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.070
And so far they've all gone into
science, or stuck with science.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.150
And it's been always
very exciting.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.190
So I really love
going there, even when

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.290
it's cloudy like this.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.950
But it doesn't make
for pretty pictures.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.270
And that's how it
looks at night.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:23.850
This isn't even the center
part of the Milky Way, just

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.450
the spiral arm part here,
the non backlit part.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.110
The galactic center
is sort of down here.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.970
I was observing some
dwarf galaxy stars

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.840
with that telescope while
I had to stand very still

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.440
for 30 seconds.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.247
So that was exciting.

00:22:39.247 --> 00:22:40.330
But let me show you some--

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:40.595
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:45.630
ANNA FREBEL: --movies to really
give you the visual counterpart

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.326
to what I describe in the book.

00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:50.780
So theses are the
two telescopes.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.340
This is sort of mine,
the one I always use.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.250
And you can see the
Milky way now moving up.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.350
And you can clearly see the
backlit spiral arm here.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.090
This is the galactic center.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.050
And it's just
absolutely majestic.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.730
And actually if the
moon is down and you

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.415
have the Milky
Way above you, you

00:23:10.415 --> 00:23:15.320
can see your own shadow
in the light of the stars.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.440
Just think about
that for a second.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.920
That's just truly magical.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.190
But the moon does come
up once in a while

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.760
and wrecks your time lapse.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.470
But as I said, this is
about realistic experiences

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.870
and not fudge things
like it's always dark

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.160
and the Milky Way is up.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.150
So I just wanted to
just show how it really

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.057
is, the good, the
bad, and the ugly.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.400
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.670

one because this one was

the outside.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.891
ANNA FREBEL: But
what happens inside?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:14.940
So a lot of screens, a lot of
keyboards, lots of buttons,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.350
and lots of spectra.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.300
And you'll see here
the round spectra.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.160
They're not yet fully processed.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.480
But you see the
absorption lines in them.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.750
So I inspect the strength
of those absorption lines

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.920
immediately after
ever observations.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.260
And it's yea or nay.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.030
So either I go to the next
target or it's like oh, maybe I

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.404
need to take more care here.

00:24:36.404 --> 00:24:38.666
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:38.666 --> 00:24:40.790
ANNA FREBEL: And yeah, that
happens all night long.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.464
That's what astronomers
are doing all night long.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.960
ANNA FREBEL: But, as I
said, there's good luck

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.230
and there's bad luck.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.320
I have been at the
telescope many times

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.790
and it was completely cloudy
and I came home empty handed.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.230
I have to wait for a year
until I get time again

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.000
that I actually have to
competitively win first.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.850
So sometimes the
universe is just

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.510
against you, or
the weather gods.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.102
But again, it makes
for pretty pictures.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.377
You can see here, this
is Scorpion, Antares.

00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:21.210
So even through the
clouds, you can actually

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.910
see quite a lot of stars.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.700
It just depends how
thick the clouds

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.750
are whether you keep
observing through the clouds

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.050
or you have to stop because
there's just nothing coming

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.890
through anymore,
like in this case.

00:25:38.694 --> 00:25:43.530
Obviously it works
out to be artsy.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:48.790
What you see here is, well,
the trucks on the highway.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.910
Light pollution is a big
issue, even at the telescopes.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.042
Every year I go there it
gets a little bit worse.

00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:55.500
The cities get a
little bit bigger.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.720
There are a little more
trucks on the road.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.070
It's no good.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.500
It's really affecting us.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.930
And this is in Atacama
Desert at 2,500 metres

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.220
up in the mountains.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.820
But we can see very far
because the air is so good.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.577
And then it gets light
again in the morning.

be interested in
seeing what astronomers

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.422
are doing at big telescopes, you
can put my name into YouTube.

00:26:23.422 --> 00:26:26.130
I guess you know how that works.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.180
You can also tweet me or
just check out my website

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.930
as I have a whole
bunch of things there.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.690
Because my outreach
program is called Science--

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.359
It's a Human Thing.

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:36.900
It's people who are
doing this, so we

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.440
should show people doing it.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.370
Pretty simple, yet
apparently so difficult.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.650
Back to the science.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.490
So here is this picture
again, this fuzzy blob.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:54.180
This is one of the most
important stars we have found.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.630
As far as we know, it's
a second generation star

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.680
because its iron abundance
and other elements

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.250
are so deficient that only
one first star supernova is

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:10.780
required or needed to produce
all these elements that we

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.570
see in the star now.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.040
I should say here
for clarification,

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.200
this star is actually
really unevolved.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.060
It has not even
started yet converting

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.600
anything else but hydrogen
to helium in its core.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.920
So this star has not really
made any heavy elements itself.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.100
Whatever we find in the
stellar surface today

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.030
came from the birth gas cloud
from which the star formed,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.410
which means it must have come
from that previous generation

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.760
star that enriched that gas.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.080
So this is really the
pinnacle of our work.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.320
And how much iron is in there?

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.630
Well, the star's obviously
a little bit bigger

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.140
than the Earth,
about 300,000 times.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.940
But if you want to
make the comparison,

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.220
you take the Earth iron core.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.210
And it's about 1%
of the Earth iron

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.280
core that is spread throughout
my little star there.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:16.450
So that supernova produced
about that much, which

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.010
makes you think
like, could the Earth

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.350
have formed early
on in the universe?

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.680
Well the answer is clearly no
because you needed at least

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.200
100 supernovae to
produce as much iron

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.420
in the universe to even
make up the Earth iron core.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.120
So it took probably
several billion years

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.770
before there was enough material
out there to have planets form.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.360
That sort of transition of
when the first planets emerged

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.380
is currently researched, and
certainly a very, very exciting

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.550
topic.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.950
And I look forward to
knowing the answer.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.230
But no planets in
the early universe.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.180
And so what do we
learn from this now?

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.800
I already mentioned
many tidbits.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.710
So let's put this together.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.310
So we usually use iron, but also
elements like carbon and oxygen

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.840
to try to figure out what
went on in the supernova.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.900
And we work with people who
calculate how many elements

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:27.640
are produced by the star itself
as it does before it explodes,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.840
and then in the
supernova explosion.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.180
And we compare those models.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.570
And then we figure out oh, it
was this and this much that

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.560
came out of this first star.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.710
And this really is the one
and only diagnostic tool

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.950
that we have to study the
properties of the first stars.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.370
So what are we interested in?

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.090
Well, first of all we're
interested in their masses,

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.430
because theory has actually told
us that these first stars were

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.770
very massive.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.980
It's actually very
difficult for stars

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.520
to form from just hydrogen
and helium and lithium.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.920
It can't really cool down,
so it can't be a clump well.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.760
And so it's difficult
to make small stars.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.240
So we would like to confirm
that the theorists are right

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.980
and that they have high
masses, maybe as [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.510
says, maybe up to 100
solar masses, 100 times

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.050
the mass of the sun.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.720
And indeed our works,
from this comparison,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.040
we have found that the first
stars might have been something

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.780
like 50 or 60 solar masses.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.720
No, it's not exactly 100, but
that was just a ballpark number

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
to start with.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.600
So it's definitely
more than 10 or 15,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.930
which is a typical mass
for today's larger stars.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.310
So kind of different back then.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.170
But we can also learn about
the explosion mechanism

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.040
and the explosion energy.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.230
And that is very important
for understanding really

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.660
how much power
these stars started

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.090
to change the universe
when they exploded.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.630
There are all sorts
of ramifications

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.410
that come from that
depending on how

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.420
violently these stars exploded.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.390
So we have a whole bunch
of ongoing sky surveys

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.110
that help us to find
more of these stars,

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.300
especially some that
involve a new technique that

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.060
is a lot more efficient now.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:21.560
So hopefully we'll find a
lot more of these guys soon.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.780
I think in the last
few minutes I'd

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.740
like to introduce this
second star to you.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.090
Here's another fuzzy
blob in the universe.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.910
Now this one is
actually fairly bright.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.820
So if you have a small
telescope at home

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.210
or you know someone who
has, you can actually

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.500
take a picture yourself.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.210
This was taken by an
amateur astronomer.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.220
And he sent me
this picture there.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.580
So that's kind of nice.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.200
But again, you need that
spectroscopic knowledge

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.120
to say that this is one of
older stars we know because we

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.180
have measured its age.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.430
So what's the big deal here?

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.380
We have taken a spectrum, and
the spectrum is very unusual

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.240
because it contains
absorption lines from very

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.360
heavy rare earth elements.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.630
And that included elements
like thorium and uranium.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.710
And you hopefully know that
these are radioactive elements.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.740
So as soon as you deal
with radioactive material,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.970
you have yourself a clock.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.700
So we're making use of that.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.050
And it basically works like
the radiocarbon method,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.920
just we're dealing with
slightly older [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.030
So if you think that
this was the supernova,

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.140
these heavy elements
including, thorium, uranium,

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.098
they got produced here.

00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:40.100
They got expelled
into the universe.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.970
And then our little guy formed.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.380
And all this material
got baked into the star.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.310
And then actually, pretty much
since the supernova explosion,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.470
the radioactive material
has started to decay.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.740
And today we
measure what's left.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.580
And we compared that
with calculations

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.530
for how much was produced.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.110
And bang, we have an age.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.650
That all sounds really easy.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:07.610
And the concept is
very straightforward.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.450
Before I show you
why this is so hard,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.030
let me just
illustrate to you what

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.240
it means to work on some
of those special stars.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.440
So here are a few elements
that we regularly measure

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.040
in all of our old stars.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.880
We then have these purple ones
here, the rare earth elements,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.250
especially the ones
here at the bottom,

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.170
that we can measure in there.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.250
These elements are produced
only in supernova explosions

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.990
during very, very
special conditions.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.840
So the gold and the
silver from your jewelry

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.870
all comes from these very
special supernova explosions.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:48.190
And there are still a
lot of open questions

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.320
about this process that
makes these elements.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.670
And so it's very exciting for
us to find some of these stars

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.680
so we can chime
into this question

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.630
where elements like silver
and gold actually come from

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.940
and how exactly they are
produced in the universe.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.910
So here is why this
measurement takes

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.060
an incredible amount of data.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.350
And it's a very
difficult analysis,

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:14.179
because we want to
measure uranium abundance.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:18.190
And so here you have absorption
lines-- magnesium, iron,

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.560
neodymium, samarium, iron here.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.000
And you see it's a
blow up [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.580
So if you look at
this blue line,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.840
this is a synthetic
spectrum that we

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.949
have created to model the
star that contains no uranium.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.860
And the question
is, does that one

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.260
correspond to the observed
data, which is the dots?

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.380
And clearly the answer is no.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.770
Instead we have data that's
a little bit lower, which

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.920
means there is a little
uranium absorption.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.610
And so we have then
created models that kind of

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.776
reproduce those here.

00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:55.190
And if the uranium
was not decaying,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.596
it would have been
absorbed up to here.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.970
So that would be
easy to measure.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.410
But it's good that it's decaying
because it gives us this clock.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.890
So making this
measurement here requires

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:09.530
extremely exquisite data.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.170
But it worked because
this star is bright.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.460
And we got an age.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.880
Well, this is not
precision cosmology,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.710
but nevertheless it's an
important contribution

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.480
to the early universe or to
studies of the early universe.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.440
And it confirms
that the whole story

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.130
I have told you about
the chemical composition

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.700
and they're telling us that
we can look back in time

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.570
to this early era by
measuring chemical abundances

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.600
is actually correct.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.330
So here are different
elements ratios.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.070
They all involve either
thorium, or uranium, or both.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.640
And these are ages
in billion years.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.600
Now the universe is
13.8 billion years.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.320
So this is just a mathematical
number that pops out.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.510
Obviously it's
unphysical, but math

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.810
doesn't care about physics.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.810
So we have to take it.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.550
But if you average
all of this, it

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.550
comes out to about
13 billion years.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.530
And that is the number we like.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.100
It's very consistent with
the age of the universe.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:14.450
Now there are some uncertainties
of course, but it is not 10,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.290
and it's not 5 billion years.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.810
It's not like the sun.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:22.740
And even 10 is still a
while away from 14 here.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.700
So the concept of stellar
archaeology is correct.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.490
It works.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.670
And these old stars, first
of all, they really are old.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.620
And we can use them to
explore the early universe.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:40.110
And of course before the
era of these satellites that

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.500
probe the cosmic microwave
background radiation,

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.090
and that led to the very
precise determination of the age

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.610
of the universe to 13.8 billion
years, methods like these

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.980
were the standard
to date the universe

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.140
and to provide a lower limit
to the age of the universe.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.730
So when I went to high school,
that was still the standard.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.780
And this would have made
a great addition then.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.340
OK, so that brings
me to the end of it.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.320
I hope I could give you just a
tiny little bit of an insight

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.190
that these old stars really
are like little diamonds

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.690
in the sky.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.690
They are very rare.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.980
They are difficult to come
by, but we have our methods.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.320
I didn't have time to
talk much about this,

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.240
but many contain actually
unusually large amounts

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.520
of carbon compared to
the other elements.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.900
And that actually
indicates to us

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.300
that carbon is not just an
important element for us today,

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.640
since we're all carbon based,
but it was probably also

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.260
the most important element that
helped in the early universe

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.960
after the formation
of the first stars.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.720
So carbon really is the
most important element

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.940
if you ask me at
all cosmic times.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.580
And well, these
stars are quite old.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.690
So I would say they last
almost until forever.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.880
And we can address, in theory,
many different and exciting

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.220
science questions with them.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.010
So there's almost an old
star for any kind of question

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.050
you might have.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.850
And of course when you find
them, they make you happy.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.590
So I would just say-- and
my slides a little cut

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.120
off there-- with our
new and ongoing service

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.810
and the big telescopes
that we're using,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.700
we are continuing
this treasure hunt.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.640
Thank you so much.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.041
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.830
AUDIENCE: So how many of
these second generation

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.100
stars are known now?

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:47.090
ANNA FREBEL: So I think we
know about six, five or six.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.710
It depends a little
bit on who you ask,

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.020
and it also depends a little
bit on the type of first star

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.110
supernova that you're modeling
and how much it outputs.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.090
So there are obviously
a little variation.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:03.630
But we've come really a long
while, because in 2000, there

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.530
were zero.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.870
So OK, that's 15 years ago.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:12.220
But with our increasingly
improving search techniques,

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.940
it's now kind of on the rise.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.760
AUDIENCE: And you
mentioned that we've

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.960
learned things about the
first generation of stars.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.065
Is there any prospect
that someday we

00:39:23.065 --> 00:39:25.190
will have a telescope that
will let us actually see

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.072
some of these first
generation stars?

00:39:27.072 --> 00:39:28.530
ANNA FREBEL: Well
for that we would

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.740
need to have a strong infrared
telescope like the James Webb

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:37.010
Space Telescope that's
currently being built by NASA.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.800
People have made
this calculation

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.120
whether you could look
far enough back in time

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.910
that you would essentially
look back to that era,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.350
because the light that
comes from this early era

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.760
just travels for 13 something
billion years to us.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.320
So if you can look
that far back,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.820
that would be really awesome.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.800
Now that would be
really, really, really

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.180
far away, which means you
really need really, really

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.550
bright sources.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.670
And while the first stars,
very, very bright, individually

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.070
they're not bright
enough to shine over

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:13.150
13.8 billion light years.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:18.590
However, maybe if there was
a cluster of first stars

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.840
together, that could
just be bright enough.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.580
We don't know.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.990
But it's very speculative.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.370
And again, as [INAUDIBLE]
theorists have calculated that.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.650
God bless them.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.390
But we'll have to see
how that matches up

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.380
with the capabilities of
a telescope like the JWST.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.630
AUDIENCE: The stars
that you described

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.960
seem to have low mass.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.230
Is this typical of
what you would predict,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.200
or do you think it's selection
bias from your search?

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.200
ANNA FREBEL: It's
absolutely a selection bias

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.790
because stellar mass correlates
inversely with lifetime.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.980
So the big guys,
they die very soon.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.780
And the little guys
live very long.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.440
So we can only find old staffs
that are of very low mass.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.170
And to give you a reference, the
sun, and to use the solar mass,

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.650
the mass of the
sun as a reference,

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.110
has a lifetime of
10 billion years.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.260
That's actually
easy to remember.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.190
And so the guys that we
are interested in now

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.620
have about 0.6 to
0.8 solar masses

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.210
because they have total
lifetimes of 15 to 20

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.380
billion years.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.650
So if they're formed
14 billion years ago,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.120
they still have a while
to go, but not that long.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.900
And so they are just in the
right evolutionary state

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.360
right now for us to find
them and to not have

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.090
messed up their surfaces
from the interior

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.990
and doing all sorts
of other wonky things.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.057
So yeah, it's kind of by design.

00:41:48.057 --> 00:41:48.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.190
So you mentioned that the
first generation of stars

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.050
are very massive,
like 100 solar mass.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:06.791
And the one you presented is
much lighter, like 0.6 or 0.8.

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:09.290
And consequently there's a huge
difference in their lifetime

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.880
because the first
generation died very fast.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.644
And this one is 13
billion years old.

00:42:15.644 --> 00:42:17.310
But they are not very
different in terms

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.900
of the amount of
heavier elements in them

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.200
because, as you said, there's
only a teeny tiny amount

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.010
in this one, and there is zero
in the first generation one.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.390
So it doesn't really seem a
striking difference to me.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:34.550
Why is it that very teeny tiny
amount of heavier elements

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.295
can make such a big difference
in the mass of forming stars?

00:42:37.295 --> 00:42:38.920
ANNA FREBEL: Thank
you for asking that,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.800
because I usually don't have
time to talk about that.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.370
So zero or little
makes a big difference

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:49.560
because heavy elements,
especially carbon and oxygen,

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.590
they act as coolants.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.350
So imagine you have this soup.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.510
And the soup just can't cool.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.870
You add just a sprinkle of
salt, well in this case,

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.020
you change the whole
flavor of your soup.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.030
It goes from bland to tasty.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.540
And the same kind
of thing happens

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.900
when you add a little carbon.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.480
It suddenly can cool
and it can clump.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.080
And it can fragment.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.630
And once you have
fragmentation, the cloud

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.360
breaks up into smaller clumps.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.740
And then gravity will
again do its thing,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.320
but on smaller length scales.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.480
It's a little bit more
complicated than that,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.267
but that's the basic idea.

00:43:29.267 --> 00:43:31.600
So as soon as you have some
elements-- because you know,

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.720
carbon is a more extended
complicated atom.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.135
So it has a lot of
transitions for the electrons.

00:43:38.135 --> 00:43:39.760
And they're just kind
of wiggling away.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.343
And carbon and oxygen
are particularly

00:43:41.343 --> 00:43:44.740
good at having so-called fine
structure line transitions.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.725
So it can wiggle, whereas
a hydrogen atom really, it

00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:49.350
can do nothing.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.058
I mean, it has one
electron going around.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.169
I mean, the cooling
mostly comes from H2.

00:43:56.169 --> 00:43:58.460
So you have two electrons
because you have two protons,

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.740
or HD.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.816
So it's a little bit
better than that.

00:44:02.816 --> 00:44:03.940
But you see the difference.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.870
So as soon as you have
even a few atoms in there,

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.800
they radiate away, which
means they send out photons

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.050
that can leave the gas cloud.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.580
And poof, your energy gone.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.107
So this is some critical
metallicity, so critical amount

00:44:18.107 --> 00:44:19.190
of elements that you need.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:24.700
It's very, very low, but really
it ushers in this transition.

00:44:34.072 --> 00:44:35.780
AUDIENCE: Please
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.990
but I imagine that what
you see in the spectrum

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.920
is basically determined
by the composition

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.720
of the surface of the star.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.290
Do we know to what extent
that matches the distribution

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.140
of elements in the whole star?

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.990
ANNA FREBEL: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.290
And that's always the concern.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.790
So that's why we
have to make sure

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:59.560
that we catch the stars in
the right evolutionary phase.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.400
To back up a little bit, people
have done for a long time--

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.160
actually, that was the
beginning of astrophysics

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.350
with a computer.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.430
They have calculated the
evolutionary paths of stars.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.750
So stars evolve.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.470
They get born.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.490
They start to burn
hydrogen to helium.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.540
Later on they burn helium
to heavier elements.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.430
And so there is a
whole sequence that

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:24.260
also correlates to how the
star looks from the outside.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.120
It changes color.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.040
It changes size as a function
of what's going on inside.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:35.990
And so we know very well at
what time the star gets mixed

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.190
and whether the outer
layers actually realize

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.880
what's happening inside.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.170
So our stars, it's the
case that the outer layers

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.730
don't realize at all what's
going on in the center

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.490
because they are
just burning hydrogen

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.507
to helium in the center.

00:45:49.507 --> 00:45:51.090
And the outer layers
really don't care

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.390
at all what's happening there.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:56.040
They just sit there undisturbed
for billions of years because

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.900
of their very slow evolution.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.830
If we had, let's
say, a 0.9 solar mass

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.210
star, that would evolve faster.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.190
And if we would see it today,
it would still be alive,

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:10.700
but it would have
already started

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.900
to burn helium into carbon.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.430
And in the process of
that, the star gets mixed.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:19.270
And the carbon from the
interior gets indeed transported

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.660
to the outer layers.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.350
So we call that self-enrichment.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.690
And that's also very
interesting to study.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.770
But for stellar
archaeology, that's

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:30.850
a big no no because then
we can't transfer anymore

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.410
what we see today to what
the composition was before.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.390
AUDIENCE: My sister-in-law was
a telescope driver at Kitt Peak.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:48.210
And often the scientists weren't
actually necessarily there.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.090
And I expect a lot of
times, as a scientist,

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:55.110
you don't actually have to
ever get near the telescopes

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.640
for these observations to occur.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.260
How frequently do you go?

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:05.650
And do you go for practical
reasons, or just because it's--

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.400
ANNA FREBEL: Well actually
all of the above, sort of.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.420
So it's true.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.990
Most telescopes these days
have professional operators.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.010
And the astronomer doesn't
even need to go there anymore.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.590
Certainly all of the big
ones except for the Magellan

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:20.340
telescopes that I'm using.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.340
They have the old school policy
that if you want to take data,

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.300
you've got to better
do it yourself.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.820
And for our discovery work,
that is actually very beneficial

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.530
because I need to inspect the
data right there and right then

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.694
because the stars
are not observable

00:47:37.694 --> 00:47:39.360
all night long because
they are standing

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.800
steady above my telescope.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.910
They are moving.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.770
And if I want to keep
catching the star

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:45.860
because it turned out to
be really interesting,

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.020
so we take a quick
exposure first.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.470
And we inspect it because we
only deal with candidates.

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:56.670
And so we then have to make
the decision, yea or nay.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:58.720
So that has to happen fast.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.310
If someone was to
take the data and then

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:05.740
we would get it the next day,
and then we'll look at it.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.590
It might not be
observable anymore.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.400
The weather might turn bad.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.280
That kind of moment
just kind of goes.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.030
And so for us, it's very
good to be at the telescope

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:19.010
and focus 100% percent
on that and get our data.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:23.610
Now I travel to Chile about
two or three times a year.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.310
It takes a long
time to get there,

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.335
something like three hours.

00:48:27.335 --> 00:48:31.087
And I always feel like I
need a vacation coming back

00:48:31.087 --> 00:48:32.420
because you work all night long.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:37.850
You have to switch 12 hours,
working from days then nights.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:42.260
In between you have night
over flights down there.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.020
So that's no fun.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.780
But being there is a lot of fun.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.970
And then having the
data is a lot of fun.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.450
But I do really think that
it's important for at least

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.270
every student to
go to a telescope

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.250
once to see the process.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.800
But with all these
big new sky surveys,

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.450
people just download the
data from the internet now.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.990
And I have come across
students who, A,

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.000
don't think the data is real
because it was downloaded

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.750
from the internet.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.610
It was like faked.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.890
Yeah sure, we can
make fake data.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.230
We have.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.530
That has certain purposes.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.980
As a scientist, your work
is based on data collection.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.484
And that has been
erased from astronomy.

00:49:27.484 --> 00:49:28.900
Downloading data
from the internet

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.030
is not data collection,
at least not to me.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.670
So that's another
reason why I really

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.790
enjoy going there
because it brings me back

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.830
to the root of my profession
and one of the reasons

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.220
why I wanted to become an
astronomer in the first place.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.560
And being on the mountain
top, and seeing the sun down,

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.470
and having the mountains
that tinged in purple,

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.420
and having the night
sky above me, I mean,

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.090
that's just priceless
on top of that.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.550
AUDIENCE: So I noticed
you use heavier elements.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.950
You don't say metals.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:12.650
Is that because you're talking
to the public and astronomers

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:14.502
have hydrogen, helium, and
then metals for everything

00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:15.140
else, right?

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.280
ANNA FREBEL: I took
that slide out.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.520
I had to cut a few slides.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.399
You want me to elaborate, or--

00:50:21.399 --> 00:50:22.940
AUDIENCE: You go
into it in the book?

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.170
ANNA FREBEL: Yes, I am.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.590
Because I do believe that
with sufficient explanation

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:34.200
and motivation, the public can
understand a lot of details.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.790
You just got to
walk them through.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:40.260
So what we're talking about
is that astronomers are not

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.600
chemists, so we can do
pretty much whatever we want.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.410
And the universe is a complex
and complicated place.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.770
So a long time ago,
someone came up

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:54.070
with a grandiose idea of lumping
all the chemical elements

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.580
into one thing.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.350
And so they're called hydrogen
because the universe is

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.950
full of hydrogen, X. Then
helium is the second most common

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:02.550
element.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:04.907
They called it Y. And
then all the rest,

00:51:04.907 --> 00:51:05.990
that's kind of negligible.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:10.440
That's Z. So if your
dinner conversation ever

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.580
goes stale, just tell them,
what's the universe made of?

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.460
XYZ, haha.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.420
So we look for the
stars with the least

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.100
amount of heavy
elements in them,

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.847
which means we look for stars
that are poor in metals,

00:51:24.847 --> 00:51:25.680
all of the elements.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.750
So we call them
metal poor stars.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.220
So that's the jargon.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:33.960
But usually unless I give a long
talk, so in my hour long talks

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.340
I do it.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.020
But in the shorter ones
I usually cut it out.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.030
Thank you so much.

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.390
[APPLAUSE]
