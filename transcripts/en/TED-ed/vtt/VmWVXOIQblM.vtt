00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:10.135
They say the pen is mightier 
than the sword,

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:13.665
and authorities have often agreed.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.503
From outlawed religious tracts
and revolutionary manifestos

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:19.803
to censored and burned books,

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:24.584
we know the potential power
of words to overturn the social order.

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.363
But as strange as it may seem,

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:31.934
some numbers have also been considered
dangerous enough to ban.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:36.525
Our distant ancestors long counted
objects using simple tally marks.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:40.975
But as they developed agriculture and
began living together in larger groups,

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.265
this was no longer enough.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.375
As numbers grew more complex,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.096
people began not just using them,
but thinking about what they are

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:51.087
and how they work.

00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:57.225
And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece,
the study of numbers was well-developed.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.735
The mathematician Pythagoras
and his school of followers

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:05.417
found numerical patterns in shapes,
music, and the stars.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:10.265
For them, mathematics held 
the deepest secrets of the universe.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:15.268
But one Pythagorean named Hippasus
discovered something disturbing.

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:20.529
Some quantities, like the diagonal
of a square with sides of length one

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:25.530
couldn't be expressed by any combination
of whole numbers or fractions,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.267
no matter how small.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:31.568
These numbers, 
which we call irrational numbers,

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:33.749
were perceived as a threat

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.947
to the Pythagorean's notion 
of a perfect universe.

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:40.197
They imagined a reality 
that could be described

00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:43.429
with rational, numerical patterns.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.717
Historians write that Hippasus
was exhiled for publicizing his findings,

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:52.990
while legends claim he was drowned
as punishment from the gods.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.549
While irrational numbers 
upset philosophers,

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.217
later mathematical inventions
would draw attention

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:02.320
from political 
and religious authorities, as well.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.719
In the Middle Ages, while Europe
was still using Roman numerals,

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.270
other cultures had developed 
positional systems

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.188
that included a symbol for zero.

00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:15.659
When Arab travelers brought this system
to the bustling maritime cities of Italy,

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.400
its advantages for merchants
and bankers was clear.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.948
But the authorities were more wary.

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:26.094
Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered
easier to forge or alter,

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:30.383
especially since they were less
familiar to customers than to merchants.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.487
And the concept of zero opened 
the door to negative numbers

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.946
and the recording of debt

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:39.644
at a time when moneylending
was regarded with suspicion.

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:43.831
In the 13th century, Florence banned
the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.981
for record keeping.

00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.060
And though they soon proved
too useful to ignore,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.921
controversies over zero 
and negative numbers

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.640
continued for a long time.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.692
Negative numbers 
were dismissed as absurd

00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:59.470
well into the 19th century.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.221
And prominent mathematicians,
like Gerolamo Cardano,

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:03.871
avoided using zero,

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.854
even though it would have made it
much easier to find solutions

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.440
to cubic and the quartic equations.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.012
Even today it's illegal to use
some numbers for different reasons.

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:17.732
Some are banned because
of what they represent.

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:21.137
For example, governments
have prohibited the display of numbers

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:22.852
that have symbolic meaning,

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:24.542
such as the date of a revolution

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:28.613
or connections to oppositional 
political figures or parties.

00:03:28.613 --> 00:03:32.713
Other numbers are potentially illegal
because of the information they carry.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.502
Just about any information,

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:35.332
whether text,

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:36.033
image,

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:36.784
video,

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:42.085
or executable programs can
be translated into a string of numbers.

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:44.184
But this means that protected information,

00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:45.354
whether copyrights,

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:47.154
proprietary materials,

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:48.693
or state secrets

00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:51.463
can also be represented as numbers,

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:56.802
so possessing or publishing these numbers
may be treated as a criminal offense.

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.194
This idea gathered attention in 2001

00:03:59.194 --> 00:04:02.254
when code that could be used
to decrypt DVDs

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:07.813
was widely shared and distributed
in the form of a large prime number.

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.244
The idea of illegal numbers 
may sound absurd,

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:11.605
but like words,

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:15.615
written numbers are a way
of expressing concepts and information.

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:18.525
And in a world where calculations 
and algorithms

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:20.695
shape more and more of our lives,

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:24.455
the mathematician's pencil
grows stronger by the day.
