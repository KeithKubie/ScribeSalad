Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm a lesbian man. I'm just looking for gas to peg me. I bet there's a lot of them that would want to fuck you just for revenge. How much of that is a women that, why is it that the pretty women don't seem to have any problem with men? Like a lot of them are like pretty easy going about men, but if you have bad genetics, like if you got dealt a wrong in the stick, that's that is if there's like people talk about income inequality in this country and that's definitely a real thing. But if there's a real thing, it's like who do people want to fuck inequality in this country? And that's off the Goddamn charts, right? I mean there's just, as men and as women, we just have to, we have to understand that some people, they have a unearned tyranny on sexual affection. It's unearned. They didn't have to do anything like these Russian women. The people aligned to you about, right? Yeah. You, you meet them and you go, Jesus is just Russian gladiator genetics and perfect like model form. And you're like, Holy Shit, let me get the fuck out of this room quick.

Speaker 2:          01:04          I was on a cruise one time, I was married and um, and I had rented the, like the back quarter I've ever gone to the same spot. Oprah stays in and it cost a fortune. And I were out on the deck and, and there's two big suites in the middle and another one just like mine at the end, but the one that was in this one, which was also a real expensive room, was this Russian dude. And he was short, got a chunky and bald, but the girl who was with him was just a 12 and I knew his second, I saw her, I was fucked because there's no way my wife was not going to catch me, just at least take it away. One little glimpse at the corner of my eye. And then she would go, oh yeah, that's what you want. You'd rather fuck her than me. And I'm like, no, absolutely not. Absolutely not. Why would I, why would I,

Speaker 1:          02:02          that's outrageous. What did that Regis assertion? What an accusation. Yeah. If they only knew how vulnerable we are to a woman like that, it's like that woman can, there's a lot of people that that woman can like run their life and they'll meet a guy who's an accountant who's never fucked a 12 and they'll start talking to him and basically, and you can do anything they want to do as long as they're willing to actually touch him. As long as they're willing to stick their fucking beautiful times. Guy's mouth, he's helpless to suck on his list and the grind that pussy against Dick, he's God has asked. She later put your finger on the base of his taints and rub it while you stick your tongue down his throat, his dick, as hard as a rock.

How much of that, like for dudes who you, there's certain cases where you know, it's not gonna work. Like God dammit, this dude, he's like, uh, uh, a small sheep and he married a wolf or it's just a matter of time before she fleeces them and gets the fuck out of dodge and hopefully he'll still be alive, but this is not going to work out well. We've all seen that before.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Oh, I wish I could tell you this story. I wish you could too. Let's shut this fucking podcast off and resume 10 minutes. Okay. All right.

No, there is no such thing as a guy named Matt. And I will not tell you the story on the same. But anyway, what was amazing was I saw it happening in front of me. Yeah. You know, his, his wife was there and they'd been married for a long time and he didn't look like much. And, and uh, and at all. And uh, and, and there was a kind of an assistant and uh, that was ridiculously gorgeous. And so I just looked at that and I was like, uh, you know where this is going. [inaudible] exactly. I've seen where I thought it was going in and uh, and there was nothing he can do it. I mean, it was absolutely, he was completely right.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Just perfect. You know, there was nothing he could do. He wouldn't give everything. Oh yeah. Like Gary Oldman and Dracula. Remember that time we would have, like we'd known the Reiner was just hypnotized by him.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Ah, she's going to put a shirt in the middle of the night
