that there's a there's when we are
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.140
that there's a there's when we are
living in a paradigm which is our

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
living in a paradigm which is our
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.170
living in a paradigm which is our
current one where we are trying to find

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180
current one where we are trying to find
 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.860
current one where we are trying to find
the role already existing that we fit

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
the role already existing that we fit
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.810
the role already existing that we fit
into I think when we try to exist in

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820
into I think when we try to exist in
 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.510
into I think when we try to exist in
modern times in that paradigm it causes

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520
modern times in that paradigm it causes
 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.990
modern times in that paradigm it causes
a tremendous stress and anxiety because

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
a tremendous stress and anxiety because
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.630
a tremendous stress and anxiety because

from middle school for kids to think
 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.900
from middle school for kids to think
about their specialty and it's like how

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910
about their specialty and it's like how
 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.330
about their specialty and it's like how

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390
but the biggest dream should be you're
 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.450
but the biggest dream should be you're
gonna invent something we don't know yet

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460
gonna invent something we don't know yet
 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.310

and when you look at humanity
everyone who's alive picks from the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
everyone who's alive picks from the
 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.420
everyone who's alive picks from the
existing narrative roles that we've been

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
existing narrative roles that we've been
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.720
existing narrative roles that we've been
given and they used to be terribly

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730
given and they used to be terribly
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.720
given and they used to be terribly
primitive but they still are shockingly

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730
primitive but they still are shockingly
 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.300

permitted from where I think we can get
 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.450
permitted from where I think we can get
to quite rapidly if we accept this

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460
to quite rapidly if we accept this
 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.640
to quite rapidly if we accept this
different paradigm

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650
