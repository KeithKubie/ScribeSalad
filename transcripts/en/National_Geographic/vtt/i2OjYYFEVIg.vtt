00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:05.372
(exciting, quick-paced music)

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.472
(applause)

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:43.710 line:0%
So, we've heard a
lot of amazing stories

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.945 line:0%
and information tonight
about the various ways

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.914 line:0%
that we can lose cultural
heritage to looting,

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.749
but we haven't really
talked about losing

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.519
cultural heritage
to armed conflict

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.990
and the kind of looting
that basically just happens

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.328
when you have an entire
nation, like Nazi Germany,

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.029
<i> kind of devoted to looting</i>

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.398
<i> on the most massive
 scale in history.</i>

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.668
There was a recent movie
called "The Monuments Men"

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.072
that kind of, in a
fictionalized way,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.741
devoted itself to talking
about the Monuments Men

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.443
and these were really my heroes.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:21.347
<i> When I was in grad school
 studying art history</i>

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.449
<i> and also serving as a
 young military officer</i>

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.085
and I thought wow,
that's pretty cool.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.789
I would love to save art as
part of my military career.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.759
There were fewer than 350
Monuments Men all together.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.794
<i> Most of them were
 in the US military,</i>

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.465
<i> a small handful of them were
 from the British military</i>

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.200
<i> and then the other
 Allied forces.</i>

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.204
<i> Think of this in a conflict
 of over a billion people</i>

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.439
<i> throughout World War II.</i>

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.677
While we have this amazing
story, the Monuments Men,

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:55.447
not a lot of people remembered
it and I think the movie

00:01:55.447 --> 00:02:00.019
really brought to bear
this awareness about

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.954
cultural property
during armed conflict

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.723
and the risk that it takes.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.859
Yes, of course,
people are killed

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.062
and people are displaced
on a massive scale,

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:13.733
but what happens to
their identity, to
their cultural heritage

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:18.570
and how did the Nazi looting
of millions of objects

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.442
and particularly from
European museums and

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:27.212
Jewish collections where people
were targeted specifically

00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:30.149
because of their collections,
like the Rothschild Family,

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.319
et cetera, how do
you combat that?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.489
<i> We had this small group of
 people dedicated to this.</i>

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.225
<i> This is James Rorimer who
 was a serving military</i>

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.162
and infantry officer
and basically most of

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.699
the Monuments Men were already
actively serving in the military

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.202
and the cultural heritage
professional community,

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.337
the museums community
essentially,

00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:54.707
told the military where
to find these folks

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.143
within the ranks who had
this kind of capability.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.513
James Rorimer was a curator at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.849
They brought him out of
the infantry and over

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.685
to the Monuments Men
and they worked kind
of all across Europe,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:11.023
first of all, preventing
or trying to prevent
through mapping,

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.459
by providing maps to the
military to keep them

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.161
from hitting sites
with bombing, but then

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.864
later as they discovered the
looted material that the Nazis

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:23.202
were keeping around in
Austria and Germany,

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:26.205
finding that material,
figuring out a way to

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.440
repatriate it to its country
of origin so it could be

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.110
returned to its rightful owners.

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.083
So we learned a big lesson
from that and the
countries of the world

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.453
got together and
decided to create a new
international treaty

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:43.823
at the 1954 Hague
Convention specifically to

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.726
protect cultural heritage
during armed conflict,

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.662
but that doesn't mean that
it necessarily worked.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.832
You can make treaties, but
a lot of times the countries

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.969
involved in conflicts don't
necessarily adhere to them.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.371
We had terrible situations,
like the intentional

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:02.975
targeting of cultural heritage
in the Bosnia Conflict,

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.513
<i> we had the deliberate
 destruction of Bamiyan Buddhas</i>

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:10.116
<i> by the Taliban and I
 think most of us remember</i>

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:13.418
<i> the 2003 looting
 of the Iraq Museum.</i>

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.754
<i> It was very much in the
 media that everything</i>

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:18.090
<i> from the museum was
 completely gone.</i>

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.559
That actually turned
out not to be true.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:24.363
The museum staff hid
many of those collections

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:27.700
or most of the collections
in a secret storage location.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.836
The real saviors of
cultural heritage in these

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:34.673
terrible situations of
disaster and armed conflict

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:37.409
and looting are the people
who take care of it every day.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.214
Those curators, those
museum directors who
often risk their lives

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:45.484
to do this and this was the
same case in the Iraq Museum.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.321
But they did indeed lose
more than 15,000 objects

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.356
<i> from the collection,
 that's an estimate.</i>

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.759
Documentation, very
important, you don't know

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.128
what's been looted from
your museum if it hasn't

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:59.399
properly been cataloged and
photographed to begin with.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.368
Unfortunately, that was the
case with the Iraq Museum.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.470
Under the ten years of
sanctions they hadn't

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.574
really been able to take
the time to document
excavation material

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.577
that was coming into the museum.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.946
It kind of got boxed
and put in storage

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.648
and that was the first
place the looters went

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.482
was to the storage areas.

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:19.017
They couldn't hide everything.

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:21.754
Many, many storage magazines,
over a million objects

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.623
were in this museum
when it was looted

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.658
and unfortunately, many
of the regional museums

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.796
had stored their collections
in Baghdad for safekeeping

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.630
which turned out
to be not so safe.

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:35.935
You'd think there was
an international group,

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:40.139
sort of a cultural
heritage rescue squad

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.975
that parachutes in after
an incident like this

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.677
and that's what I thought.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:50.883
I was a very naive major
who was assigned to go

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.586
to Baghdad to help with
the museum and to help

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.289
advise the Minister of
Culture as an art historian

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.425
and museum curator myself
and we suddenly realized

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.393
that we had a much
larger scale problem than

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:02.895
just the museum looting.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:06.399
We had looting of archaeological
sites throughout the country.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.936
<i> Under Sadaam Hussein,
 death was the penalty</i>

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:12.438
<i> for looting if you got caught,</i>

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:16.475
but suddenly here was a
really unstable situation

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:19.711
with looting happening
in the city of Baghdad

00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:22.715
so it wasn't very easy to
go out to the countryside

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.817
and protect
archaeological sites.

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:27.820
<i> And so here's the extent
 of the Monuments Men</i>

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.058
<i> for Baghdad in 2003 and
 one of them was a woman.</i>

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.560
<i> There were Monuments Women
 in World War II as well.</i>

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.398
<i>My colleague, Wes Sumner there,
Captain Wes Sumner at the time,</i>

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:46.806
was a landscape archaeologist
so he preceded me in Baghdad

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:53.211
and when I arrived after
the looting, I was called up

00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:55.180
as an individual and
went straight to Baghdad

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.283
and he said, "Wow. Okay,
good luck with this

00:06:57.283 --> 00:07:01.020
because I'm going to go
save the National Zoo now,"

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.088
and that's exactly
what he proceeded to do

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:04.690
and he wrote a
wonderful book about it.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:07.493
But I just want to
point out that we're

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:10.696
at the Central Bank of Iraq
in this photo in Baghdad

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:13.899
and we're here because
a wonderful collection

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.203
of archaeological artifacts
from the site at Nimrud,

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.673
often referred to has
the Treasure of Nimrud

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:25.277
which is a very
important, probably next
to King Tut's Treasure

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:28.781
and the Bactrian Hoard, probably
the third most important

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.250
treasure of the like.

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:35.521
National Geographic
was very, very worried

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.190
about the status
of this collection

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.927
and had representatives
there on the ground.

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:44.329
They had a project
where they actually paid

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:50.035
to pump water out of
the basement of the
Iraq National Museum

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:53.973
and why the military hadn't
figured out how to do this yet,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:57.376
I still don't have a clue,
and it had to be done

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.311
more than once because they
were having a hard time

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.614
finding out where the
water was coming in.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:05.450
But finally they were able
to do so and ten years later,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.153
I just want to thank
my colleagues at
National Geographic

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:10.222
for contributing to
that and allowing us

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:13.893
to safeguard this really
important cultural resource.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.267
Coming back and realizing
that there really isn't

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:24.737
an organization who
does this kind of

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.673
cultural heritage rescue,
like on the ground

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:31.043
immediate response, like
Doctors Without Borders

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:34.312
does for people, I really
realized that there is not

00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:36.281
that kind of museum for culture.

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:40.052
We have UNESCO which is a
really important organization

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:43.822
that does major cultural
heritage preservation projects,

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:47.426
but I am talking about real
have a bag packed by your door

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:51.930
and have all your shots and
go and help your colleagues

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.600
in a disaster
situation like this.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.103
We created the US Committee
of the Blue Shield.

00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:01.040
It's a non-profit
organization that's part of

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.076
an international network
to do this or support

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:07.013
this kind of work, but
it's still very difficult

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.849
and I'll talk about some
of the ongoing challenges

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:12.484
of trying to do this kind
of work internationally.

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:14.954
I don't think I have to go
too far into the problems

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:17.189
with Egyptian sites, but
I have to say it felt

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:21.594
<i> a little bit, uh,
 déjà vu seeing images of...</i>

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:26.332
<i> in a major archaeological
 museum in a country</i>

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.701
where there was
horrible instability

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:32.871
and seeing images of soldiers
inside the National Museum

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:36.475
in Egypt, a place that I'd
only gotten an opportunity

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.010
to visit once.

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:41.847
Worried very much about what was
going to happen with the sites.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.785
<i> Another major area where
 we've seen intentional</i>

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.721
<i>destruction of cultural heritage
 recently, you've heard about</i>

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.989
the Jihadist groups who
occupied Northern Mali

00:09:50.989 --> 00:09:55.126
and finally in January of
2012, they were driven out

00:09:55.126 --> 00:09:57.362
by French forces, but
not before they did

00:09:57.362 --> 00:10:01.033
a tremendous amount of damage
to the cultural heritage

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.636
<i> of the region and
 particularly the historic city</i>

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:07.306
<i> of Timbuktu where they
 damaged, they burned</i>

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:11.944
<i> many of the manuscript
 collections of the
 Ahmed Baba Library.</i>

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.980
<i> They looted museums,
 as you can see there.</i>

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.351
They destroyed the
Sufi Saint's Mausoleums

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.621
around the city of
Timbuktu and they also,

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:27.159
in a really insidious
way, prevented Malians

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:31.864
from practicing their very
important, intangible heritage.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:35.901
No singing, no traditional
dress, women were not

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.637
allowed to wear their hair
the way they wanted to,

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:41.807
men were required to
dress in a certain way

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:45.877
and they weren't allowed to
have dance, poetry or theater.

00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:50.249
So these things, for Malians,
were almost as damaging

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:54.286
to their culture as seeing
the objects destroyed.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.991
And then finally, the really
terrible scenario that we're

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.593
experiencing now with
the Syrian civil war.

00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:04.029
<i> This is the ancient
 souk in Aleppo.</i>

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:07.866
<i> This is just one example of
 the many, many tragic cases.</i>

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:10.735
<i> The city of Aleppo is
 a world heritage site</i>

00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:15.874
and it has been pretty much
devastated during the conflict.

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:20.445
The Grand Mosque has
been grievously damaged.

00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:24.950
The whole central ancient
part of the city damaged.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.721
<i> Krak des Chevaliers,
 the Crusader Fortress,</i>

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:31.724
<i> another world heritage
 site, very much devastated</i>

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:35.961
from being used as a
military base of operations

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.463
and the fighting going
on between the two sides.

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:40.466
Those are just a few examples.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.969
So what can we do about it?

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.205
Resources, well where I
work, the Smithsonian

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:50.676
<i> a few years ago recognized
 that there is a need</i>

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:54.079
<i> for this type of response
 and with our resources</i>

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:57.249
<i> that we have, 19 museums,
 9 research centers, a zoo</i>

00:11:57.249 --> 00:12:01.320
and more than 6,000 colleagues
that I can call upon

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.358
for their time and their
expertise, it's become

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:11.163
really clear that through
partnerships, sort of

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:14.333
whole of government approach,
talking with organizations

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.669
within government, like
the Department of State,

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:19.204
USAID, the Department of
Defense, that we can have

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:23.375
a lot of effect and then
partnering with non-governmental

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:27.645
organizations and non-profits
like National Geographic,

00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:31.383
the Blue Shield, like
the International
Council of Museums,

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.952
et cetera, that we
can have an effect.

00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:40.559
In order to help with this darth
of modern day Monuments Men,

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:45.397
as we like to say, the
Blue Shield instituted

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:49.167
a program of training
US military forces

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:50.803
about cultural
property protection,

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.972
specifically Civil
Affairs Units.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.873
The World War II Monuments
Men were Civil Affairs

00:12:54.873 --> 00:12:56.341
and they still are today.

00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:58.743
<i> This is a very recent one,
 just a couple of weeks ago.</i>

00:12:58.743 --> 00:13:01.747
<i> We had Marines from the Civil
 Military Operations School</i>

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:04.583
<i> at Quantico at the
 National Portrait Gallery</i>

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:08.387
<i> and American Art Museum
training on packing and crating</i>

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.256
<i> in emergency situations.</i>

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.261
<i> The Haiti Project was a
 big area where Smithsonian</i>

00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.797
<i> really recognized
 the need to jump in</i>

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:21.199
<i>and help with cultural recovery.</i>

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:24.236
<i> During that, we partnered
 with a number of organizations</i>

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:27.172
<i> including the American
 Institute for Conservation</i>

00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:29.942
<i> which is based here
 in DC, the President's</i>

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:32.344
<i> Committee on the Arts
 and Humanities helped us</i>

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:35.848
get it kicked off with
Michelle Obama's involvement

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:39.118
and we were able to help
our Haitian colleagues

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.720
save more than 30,000
objects of their heritage

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.423
over an 18 month project.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.392
<i> Here are the Holy Trinity
 Murals that were saved</i>

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:47.959
<i> and these are being
 restored until they can</i>

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:49.661
<i> build a new church.</i>

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.797
We have a museum
professional training program

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.466
at the Smithsonian which
works around the world,

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.269
<i> but in particular
 recently we went to Mali</i>

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:00.538
<i> to help train their
 museum professionals,
 plus professionals</i>

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:02.941
<i> from eight other west
 African countries</i>

00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.977
on disaster risk
management, thinking about

00:14:05.977 --> 00:14:10.582
using museums for
post-conflict reconciliation

00:14:10.582 --> 00:14:14.486
and other programs to really
help museum professionals

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:17.590
think about that what-if
scenario, what if this

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.792
could happen to my museum
or if it already has,

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:22.928
sharing information about
how you were able to

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:24.429
save your collections.

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:27.632
We hope to be able to serve
as a point of coordination

00:14:27.632 --> 00:14:30.635
for multiple partnerships
to help be that

00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:33.004
emergency responder
for cultural heritage,

00:14:33.004 --> 00:14:36.107
to help our colleagues
who are under duress

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:38.443
from natural disasters
and armed conflicts

00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:43.414
to save their collections and
to train about documentation

00:14:43.414 --> 00:14:46.318
and international legal
instruments that can

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:49.955
help worldwide in saving
our cultural heritage.

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:50.689
Thanks a lot.

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.724
(applause)

00:14:52.724 --> 00:14:58.030
(airy, peaceful music)
