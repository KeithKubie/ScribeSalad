00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.060
For this course, we'll be working
pretty extensively with the idea

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.290
of a calendar and to-do list app.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.080
This idea has certainly been done before
and you probably have some images in

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.250
your head of what an app
like this might look like.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.940
Rather than relying on those though,
we'll be working from a set of mocks of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.870
the sort you would have developed
in the product design course.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.810
As you go through this class, remember
that each time you do something with

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.160
our example app, you can do the same
something with your own app idea

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.470
which will help you get started on
the final project for the course.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.320
If you haven't taken the product design
course or haven't thought enough

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.479
about your app to make some very
rough mockups of the screens,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.420
you'll benefit from taking a detour to
that class before you continue here.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
If you have, take some time to
familiarize yourself with the mocks

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.600
which we've included below
the video in the classroom page.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.608
The app design starts on this home
screen here, [SOUND] which is then

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:49.134
connected by a menu to all of
the other screens of the app.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:52.143
Currently, we have a frequent action
button which connects to the new

00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:53.570
events screen.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.060
As you can see, we only have a basic
idea of what should go where.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.710
We have a sense that there should be
multiple screens but we don't yet

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.060
have a sense of exactly
how they relate or

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.540
what the arrangement needs
to be on each screen.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.810
Remember, you should be comfortable
throwing all this work away.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.348
If we spend ten hours designing
the initial prototype,

00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:12.733
we're going to have to throw
ten hours of work away.

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.650
If we spent ten minutes on it, that's an
amount of time that's easier to get rid.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.940
And both will get a useful
feedback at this stage.
