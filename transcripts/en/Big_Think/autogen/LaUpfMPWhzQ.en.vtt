in our lives can can bring us closer and
then can also keep us farther apart from

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
then can also keep us farther apart from
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710
then can also keep us farther apart from
from each other and the movie is not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
from each other and the movie is not
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750
from each other and the movie is not
just about technology it's also about

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
just about technology it's also about
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.370
just about technology it's also about
the way in which we communicate with

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
the way in which we communicate with
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439
the way in which we communicate with
each other about how people talk to each

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
each other about how people talk to each
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.640
each other about how people talk to each
