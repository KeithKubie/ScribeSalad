and so just like a diabetic requires a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
and so just like a diabetic requires a

your leg in the elderly we may just give

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
your leg in the elderly we may just give
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800
your leg in the elderly we may just give
you a shot of these proteins to turn

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
you a shot of these proteins to turn
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870
you a shot of these proteins to turn
back on your stem cells so you can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
back on your stem cells so you can
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120
back on your stem cells so you can
repair quicker we're trying it in cancer

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
repair quicker we're trying it in cancer
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190
repair quicker we're trying it in cancer
because cancer in kids is about 90%

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
because cancer in kids is about 90%
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.940
because cancer in kids is about 90%
curable once you turn 25 that same

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
curable once you turn 25 that same
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.520
curable once you turn 25 that same
cancer turns incurable so maybe if I can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
cancer turns incurable so maybe if I can
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770
cancer turns incurable so maybe if I can
convince the body it's younger I can

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
convince the body it's younger I can
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.630
convince the body it's younger I can
have or we as a science community can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
have or we as a science community can
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.569
have or we as a science community can
have a bigger impact on cancer so I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
have a bigger impact on cancer so I
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910
have a bigger impact on cancer so I
leave you with that bit of hope that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
leave you with that bit of hope that
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100
leave you with that bit of hope that
aging is something that may be able to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
aging is something that may be able to
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.070
aging is something that may be able to
be reversed and not so we can live till

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
be reversed and not so we can live till
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.780
be reversed and not so we can live till
150 but so that we can all live until

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
150 but so that we can all live until
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.700
150 but so that we can all live until
our ninth or tenth decade with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
our ninth or tenth decade with
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920
our ninth or tenth decade with
there being a decrease in quality in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
there being a decrease in quality in
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.080
there being a decrease in quality in
those last decades because that be the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
those last decades because that be the
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.740
those last decades because that be the
goal quality years till the end

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750
