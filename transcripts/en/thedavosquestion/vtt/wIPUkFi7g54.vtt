&gt;&gt;Hi, YouTube.
Here I am, back again.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.760
Last time I talked to you was about the water
issue.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.170
And I'm happy to say that we are still talking
about it, that we are

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.940
not only talking about it, this time we were
able to make a big, big

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.359
step.
We took the last year and we developed a tool,

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.029
scientific tool, in
order to be able to help politicians to make

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.260
the right decision on how
to solve this problem.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
And we have presented this now to governments.
And I'm very happy to say that we have found

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.680
seven governments who are
now willing to work with us, together with

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.470
McKinsey, and to bring this
tools into practice.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.140
And to hope during the next year to try to
solve in some watersheds,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.000
this problem.
So I think this was a great way forward from

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.780
last time I talked to you
when I was still talking about the problem

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.090
but now we have solutions.
And I hope that in a year from now I'm able

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.530
to talk to you about how
this solution has been put into practice.
