America the principled six opportunities
 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.600
America the principled six opportunities
for becoming a can-do nation once again

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610
for becoming a can-do nation once again
 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.779
for becoming a can-do nation once again
and so those six opportunities seemed to

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789
and so those six opportunities seemed to
 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.360
and so those six opportunities seemed to
me to be the most important issues one

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370
me to be the most important issues one
 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.840
me to be the most important issues one
is how do we secure our future and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850
is how do we secure our future and
 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.250
is how do we secure our future and

well actually there's a gap between

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
well actually there's a gap between
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.520
well actually there's a gap between
liking Americans as a people and liking

the American government many more people

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989
the American government many more people
 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.559
the American government many more people
like Americans than like the American

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569
like Americans than like the American
 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.289

government we have and speaking of

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299
government we have and speaking of
 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.420
government we have and speaking of
government we have a problem with

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
government we have a problem with
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.300
government we have a problem with
respect for government in fact in recent

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
respect for government in fact in recent
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.180
respect for government in fact in recent
years people have discredited government

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
years people have discredited government
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.470
years people have discredited government
because so many government officials

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
because so many government officials
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.259

indictment for a while so if we don't
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.280
indictment for a while so if we don't
restore respect for government I'm sick

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290
restore respect for government I'm sick
 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.319
restore respect for government I'm sick
of politicians running against

government I'm running for this office
because I believe that we shouldn't have

because I believe that we shouldn't have
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.240
because I believe that we shouldn't have
these offices it's ridiculous so we need

these offices it's ridiculous so we need
 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580
these offices it's ridiculous so we need
respect so that good people run for

office in turn they appoint confident

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680
office in turn they appoint confident
 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.949
office in turn they appoint confident
people and they care about how well

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959
people and they care about how well

traditional American principle to say
that government is best which governs

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859
that government is best which governs
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.210
that government is best which governs
least but frankly it can't govern least

unless it governs better because it's
 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.699
unless it governs better because it's
much more costly to have a disaster like

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709
much more costly to have a disaster like
 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.920
much more costly to have a disaster like
Hurricane Katrina than it would have

think we need a spirit of service the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
think we need a spirit of service the

ugliness in America has plagued us if we

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549
ugliness in America has plagued us if we
 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.759
