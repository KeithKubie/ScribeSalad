00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.559
one point is to realize bright blue LEDs

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
one point is to realize bright blue LEDs
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.930
one point is to realize bright blue LEDs
we need very high quality crystals that

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
we need very high quality crystals that
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.170
we need very high quality crystals that
is gallium nitride one thing is to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
is gallium nitride one thing is to
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660
is gallium nitride one thing is to
realize a very high quality gallium

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
realize a very high quality gallium
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.810
realize a very high quality gallium
nitride and the other one is to public

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
nitride and the other one is to public
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.810
nitride and the other one is to public
eight leds we need boast n-type and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
eight leds we need boast n-type and
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.979
eight leds we need boast n-type and
p-type conductivity and there or any

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
p-type conductivity and there or any
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.030
p-type conductivity and there or any
type it is not so difficult but p-type

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
type it is not so difficult but p-type
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.119
type it is not so difficult but p-type
it was very very difficult so we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
it was very very difficult so we
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.139
it was very very difficult so we
achieved the p-type conduction back in

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149
achieved the p-type conduction back in
 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:02.990
achieved the p-type conduction back in
1985 yeah when I saw the samples I I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
1985 yeah when I saw the samples I I
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.980
1985 yeah when I saw the samples I I
thought that ah I forget or I missed

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
thought that ah I forget or I missed
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.490
thought that ah I forget or I missed
something because the crystals were 22

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
something because the crystals were 22
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.270
something because the crystals were 22
popping are too good but when I checked

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280
popping are too good but when I checked
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.190
popping are too good but when I checked
by the microscope I found that we have

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
by the microscope I found that we have
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.580
by the microscope I found that we have
done it and at that very amazing moment

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
done it and at that very amazing moment
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.430
done it and at that very amazing moment
or for me
