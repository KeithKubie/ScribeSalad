[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:10.540
MARIANA SARACENI: Hugh, welcome.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.080
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.390
Hugh is the nation's favorite
food hero at the moment.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.010
You are an inspiration.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.690
You help the animals.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.810
You help the vegetables.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.940
You help us all.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.415
Yes, I like that.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.850
Your River Cottage cookbooks
have won you many awards,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.110
and your "Fish Fight"
series earned you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.550
a BAFTA and Radio
4, "The Observer,"

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.090
and Guild of Food Writers.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.910
Congratulations on that.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.130
Besides more than 10
cookery book series,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.580
Hugh's work includes recent
hard-hitting campaigns,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.014
such as "Hugh's War
on Waste," which

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.930
helped change the way
we think about the stuff

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.570
we throw away while challenging
supermarkets that definitely

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.230
need challenging, and then
the fast food restaurants

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.200
drastically in the
way they waste food.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.870
Hugh's current mission is
to increase consumption

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.660
to expand our veg horizons,
fueled by his passion

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.220
and belief that
plant foods should

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.365
be the dominant force in our
kitchens in his new book--

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.870
that I hope you all buy, guys--

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.210
"River Cottage, Much More Veg."

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.310
He uses fruit, grains,
[INAUDIBLE],, nuts, seeds,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.190
spices, and herbs to produce
a cornucopia of delicious,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.590
satisfying, and
life-enhancing recipes.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.130
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh
Fearnley-Whittingstall.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.725
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:30.350
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thank you.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.420
Thank you so much.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.350
Thank you very much.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.650
It's lovely to be here.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.510
MARIANA SARACENI: So, thank you
for coming to the office today.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.770
You have quite a lot of
people coming to see you.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.210
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It's great.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.190
MARIANA SARACENI: Everybody's
very excited about all the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.600
food.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.016
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:43.219
It's all about lunch really.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.635
It's always about
lunch, isn't it.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:45.920
MARIANA SARACENI: You should
also come at breakfast.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.160
The amount of juicing
that goes on here is--

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.440
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I hope

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.154
you haven't just had breakfast.

00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:52.195
MARIANA SARACENI: No, no,
no, but it's good, too.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.360
Bit of an open-ended
question to kick this off,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.300
how did you get
to where you are?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.670
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Gosh.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.690
All I can say for sure is
there was never much of a plan.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.289
I've always sort of
fallen into doing things.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.830
I mean, I learnt to cook
as a kid with my mom.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.850
I was one of those restless kids
who always needed entertaining.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.680
And if it was
raining outside, I'd

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.620
be tugging at my mom's
skirt saying, what can I do?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.910
I'm bored.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.000
And I think when I was
four or five years old,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.130
she just propped me up
on a chair in the kitchen

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.310
and got me cooking.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.204
And the first thing,
I say cooking.

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:32.620
I mean, I think
she produced a bag

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.660
of icing sugar,
some green coloring,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.930
and some peppermint
essence and showed me

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.470
how to make peppermint
creams, which is basically

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.367
green, edible,
mint-flavored Play-Doh.

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.200
MARIANA SARACENI:
Organic, of course, right?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.283
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I doubt it very much.

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:51.700
We're talking kind of 1969 here.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.670
And my mom was a keen
cook, but organic food

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.400
was a distant and not very
well-understood thing.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.980
But I cottoned on pretty fast.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.980
And in fact, I just learnt
I love loved cooking from

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.480
as a kid.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.470
And I had with that
little introduction,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.500
that little sugary
introduction to cooking,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.350
I was very keen on making
cakes and desserts.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.340
And I became the pastry chef for
my mom's '70s dinner parties.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.200
And I learned to make
things like pineapple mousse

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.610
and profiteroles and
chocolate roulades and things

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.040
like that, some
of which still get

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.687
knocked up from time to time
on special occasions today.

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:34.270
MARIANA SARACENI:
One of my colleagues

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.750
actually, when I told
her that you were coming,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.507
she immediately said, he has
the best meringue recipe.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:42.840
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: Ah.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.339
Good.

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.384
That's very pleasing to hear.

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:47.550
Hopefully, we'll get on to
vegetables at some point.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.023
MARIANA SARACENI: I know.

00:03:48.023 --> 00:03:48.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:49.939
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.850
But I mean, those things, those
little treats are important,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.350
too.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.310
MARIANA SARACENI: When
she said that, I'm like,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.340
he makes desserts?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.046
I actually was a bit confused.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:57.840
I didn't know that.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.250
Because, to be fair, full
disclosure here for everybody,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.100
I moved here in 2007 that
I was telling you before.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.590
And it's when the "Fish
Fight" show was going on.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.980
And I quite appreciated-- not
being from here, all the fishes

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.840
that I eat are obscure because
they're not in our language.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.020
So it was quite easy
to go to a fishmonger

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.029
and just show up and
be like, I want that.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.329
So between then, and now
your fight for vegetables,

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.430
reducing wastage,
everything, you clearly

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.110
are one of the heroes or the
pioneers of the good food

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.060
movement.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.395
What happened in your
life, in your family,

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.020
in your eating habits
that actually you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.640
decided, you know what, we
you do something about this?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.806
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
That's a good question.

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:39.940
And moving on from my
sweet-toothed youth,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.970
I never really planned
to become a chef.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.920
I've been cooking
all my life, and I

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.670
enjoyed cooking at university
and with my friends.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.480
But my plan after
I left university,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.840
I was really interested
in wildlife conservation,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.590
and I planned a trip
and a friend of mine.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.350
And we went to southern
Africa for six months.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.125
We hired a pickup truck.

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.000
We bought a pickup truck,
which we sold again

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.958
at the end of the trip.

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.290
And we drove away camping a
lot, visiting game reserves.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.540
We took a tape recorder with
us and interviewed people

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.210
working in the world
of conservation.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.230
And I came back to the UK
hungry to do more of that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.500
and looking for a way
to get back to Africa,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.740
maybe trying to come
up with a book idea.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.620
But while I was doing
that, a friend of mine

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.320
was working as a waitress
at the River Cafe--

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.735
now celebrating this year
its 30th anniversary--

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:35.040
a wonderful pioneering
West London restaurant

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.620
run by two amazing women,
as I'm sure many of you

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.580
know, Ruthie Rogers and
Rose Gray, Rose very sadly

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.050
no longer with us.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.090
But I walked in one day looking
for a job in the kitchen

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.227
or as a waiter, whatever.

00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.060
And someone in the
kitchen hadn't turned up,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.990
and they asked me if my
would stand at the pass

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.030
and help dress some
salads as they went out.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.130
And after the lunch service
where I didn't totally

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.620
disgrace myself, they said
what do you like to do?

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.540
I said, I like making puddings.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.210
So they asked me, they said,
can you make a lemon tart?

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.460
So as it happened, I had a
lemon tart recipe up my sleeve.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.250
So I made a lemon tart, and
they said, that's not bad,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.350
and we'll put that
on the menu tonight.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.240
It's not how we make ours.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.550
We can do that if you want
to come back tomorrow.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.700
So I did come back
tomorrow, and I ended up

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.950
doing six months
at the River Cafe.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.125
And I won't say I never
made it back to Africa

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:30.750
because I had made
it back a few times,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.380
but that was the switch point.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.560
But there was something about
that fascination with wildlife

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.540
and the wider
story of the planet

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.450
that I think has always
informed my interest in food

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.400
and has also allowed me
in a very lucky way--

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.240
because the TV work
that I've done--

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.310
it's allowed me to come back and
look at the conservation stroke

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.680
sustainability issues in
the business of global food.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.860
And I mean not just global
food, but what we all

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.980
choose to eat every day
is part of that story.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.270
What we are choosing
to eat on a daily basis

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.950
is probably affecting the planet
more than any other decisions

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.510
being made by human beings.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.407
I mean, we do extremely
things on this planet.

00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:13.740
We make extraordinary buildings.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.400
We build amazing
electronic gadgetry

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.940
and we program it in
brilliant and innovative ways.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.900
And that, of course,
affects the world,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.650
but probably nothing
affects the world more

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.600
than the way we produce food.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.440
It's the main reason we're
chopping down forests,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.364
which arguably-- well, in
my view, not arguably--

00:07:35.364 --> 00:07:36.030
we need to keep.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.250
We're doing all
sorts of things often

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.090
in the name of feeding the
world that could ultimately

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.280
jeopardize feeding the world.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.490
Because, if we don't look after
the primary resources of--

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.410
I'm going off on
one now, aren't I--

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.060
the primary resources
of a planet.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.600
MARIANA SARACENI: I want
to be like, stop it.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.279
Everybody, veg.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.070
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Well, exactly.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.760
I mean, if we don't look
after those primary resources

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.280
in a sustainable way, we will
run out of stuff to grow food

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.710
on and we'll be in trouble.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.610
But the great thing,
the exciting thing,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.660
is that we can cook and eat
our way out of this problem

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.040
by changing the decisions
and the choices that we make.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.900
Many, many things are
happening in the world

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.810
that make those changes
really, really hard.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.480
We are hugely
under the influence

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.910
of the industrial
food machine, and it

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.950
wants us to behave
in certain ways

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.159
because it's highly
profitable if we do.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.404
And what it's become
incredibly good at--

00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:35.820
I really am going
off on one now--

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.620
what it's become incredibly good
is molding very inexpensive,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.860
highly-subsidized,
highly-refined ingredients,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:49.680
essentially sugar, cheap
vegetable and animal fats,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.170
and highly-refined starches--

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.560
wheat flour is a lot
of it, but increasingly

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.980
soya starch and
things like that--

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.200
just respinning them into
endless different products

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.660
and putting little bits
and sprinkles on that

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.320
actually make them incredibly
difficult to resist.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.060
It's pretty much
an exact science

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.300
making inexpensive food
very hard to resist

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.490
and creaming off
a lot of profit.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.760
And that's taking us
away from the sort

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.830
of bounty of natural
foods that really

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.590
should underpin our diet.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.710
And essentially, that's
unrefined plant foods.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.060
That's what we need to put back
at the center of our eating.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.380
Doesn't mean we have to
be vegetarian or vegan.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.300
I'm neither of those things.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.770
I eat meat and fish.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.540
But I eat meat and
fish carefully, I hope.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.810
And to eat any of those
things without thought

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.300
is potentially contributing
to the problem.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.340
To make your food choices
in a thoughtful way

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.885
is contributing to the solution.

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:53.260
MARIANA SARACENI:
That's actually

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.610
a perfect opening to my next
question because I've been--

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.805
Netflix, there's five
million food documentaries,

00:09:58.805 --> 00:10:01.434
and I just love watching
everything food related.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.850
And I've been
watching quite a lot

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.880
of vegan and plant-based
documentaries.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.880
And both views tend to
be very black and white.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.680
Either you eat meat or
you never eat meat at all.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.820
One of them actually was
the most generous one saying

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.965
it will not be sustainable.

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:17.340
If the entire
planet wants to eat

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.610
organic plant-based food 100%,
it will not be sustainable.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.880
You do not have
to be 100% vegan.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.630
You just need to be very
mindful of what you eat.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.340
I was just telling
you before I currently

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.390
have in my diet two
vegetarian days a week,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.770
and I'm trying to incorporate
a vegan one, which I really

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.395
hope you help me
because I'm struggling

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:36.340
without the cheese
and the butter.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.110
But how do you think
we should approach

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.330
this in terms of quantities?

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.640
Not only having the animals as a
side dish rather than the main,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.230
how do you think people
should approach this?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.340
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I think

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.380
there are many different
ways to approach it.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.540
And I mean, it is
interesting to me

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.910
that more and more
people and young people

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.357
are making the
choice to be vegan.

00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:55.690
And I think it's a great choice.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.690
I mean, because I've written
enthusiastically about meats--

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.770
one of my early books was
"The River Cottage Meat Book,"

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.190
and I've cooked meat
and fish in the shows--

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:11.500
other chefs have put
themselves out there somehow

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.500
being critical of
vegetarianism or veganism.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.370
And maybe sometimes people have
assumed that I'm in that camp.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.670
I think it's great that more
and more young people are

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.630
choosing to be vegan.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.630
I've got time for anyone
with principles about food.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.030
Anybody who's thinking
about what they eat

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.190
and thinking about the
consequences of the choices

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.120
they're making, I
think that's fantastic.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.290
And if more and more
people on the planet

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.880
become vegan and
vegetarian, that's

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.220
going to help the situation.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.860
I do think there are
ways to incorporate

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.480
fish and meat into your diet.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.300
I think both foods can be
very healthy if well-chosen.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.820
And they can be sustainable--
again, if carefully chosen.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.060
But the thing that's really
difficult and damaging

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.390
is this idea that was
born of the great miracle

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.870
of industrial farming of
industrial meat production,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.410
that somehow no meal is
complete without meat--

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.775
somehow, two or even
three times a day.

00:12:09.775 --> 00:12:12.940
The old, great,
British breakfast fry

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:18.502
up once in a while, twice a
year maybe, fantastic thing.

00:12:18.502 --> 00:12:19.960
But I mean, if
you're going to have

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.300
sausages and bacon for breakfast
and a beef sandwich at lunch

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.280
and then more meat or
fish in the evening,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.310
if we're all doing that,
there's no way we're not

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.960
in trouble as a planet.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.100
So we've really got
to balance things out.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.690
And I think meat and fish
can be incredibly delicious.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.070
If you put a little bit
of fierce heat on them

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.110
and you sear that
edge of the steak

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.700
or the crispy skin
or the fish, you

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.080
create a really special flavor.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.740
And I get that.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.630
And that's something
we can enjoy.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.870
And also in moderation,
those foods are very healthy.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.920
They've got great proteins
in them, good amino acids.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.930
They're good, digestible foods.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.260
So that's kind of where I'm at.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:10.000
But to recklessly consume them
the sort of commodity foods

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.737
is a big part of
the problems that

00:13:11.737 --> 00:13:14.320
are stacking up that we're going
to have to solve in the years

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.100
ahead.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.930
MARIANA SARACENI:
Very much agree.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.720
In terms of now jumping
into vegetable specific,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.020
your mother--

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.904
you come from a
gardener family, so you

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:27.070
have an unfair advantage
because in my family nobody

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.819
has a green thumb.

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:30.312
So in terms of growing, I've
tried and failed miserably.

00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:32.770
I even signed up and paid for
an allotment that is just now

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.080
flowers because I have no clue.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.870
Do you have any tips
for us Londoners

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.110
living in the typical,
non-outer-space London

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.550
apartment?

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.966
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:46.804
I mean, I think if you've
got any space at all--

00:13:46.804 --> 00:13:48.970
and it doesn't even have
to be outdoor space-- where

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.271
you can put a pot with soil
in it, I mean, lots of people

00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:55.270
are in the house plants.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.978
I think why not grow
edible house plants.

00:13:56.978 --> 00:13:59.300
I mean, that just
makes me more excited

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.850
the fact that at
the end of it I'm

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.240
going to get some
food out of it.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.470
It might just be a window box
full of herbs or one big pot

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.000
with a tomato plant
growing in a sunny window.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.900
Anything like that,
anything that you've

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.990
grown yourself is always going
to taste fantastic and just

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.920
remind you--

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.810
not necessarily consciously,
but subliminally--

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.517
that this stuff
comes from the soil.

00:14:21.517 --> 00:14:22.600
We can take a bit of soil.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.183
We can look after
our own bit of soil,

00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:25.870
and we can grow
some food from it.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:30.400
And we're connected
to the whole process.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.870
And we're connected
to the problem.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.203
We're connected to the solution.

00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:36.580
We're part of it.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.790
I mean, obviously, if you can
find an allotment in London

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.770
and get a bit busy, people
get really excited about that.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.540
And once you start
doing a bit of that,

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.330
from the people I talk to,
people tend not to backslide.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.170
Once you start growing
a little bit of food,

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.200
it's a pleasure that
becomes part of your life

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.345
and you tend to want
to do more and more.

00:14:58.345 --> 00:14:59.980
MARIANA SARACENI: Is there
like a super-easy one, one

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.190
of the vegetables or
spices you can be like,

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.140
you really can't mess this up?

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.470
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Well, lots of things

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.700
are much easier than
you think, but I

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.170
think the really
important thing is

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.990
to choose something that you
will then really look forward

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.029
to eating.

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:11.320
There's no point in growing
a vegetable that you're not

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.410
enthusiastic about, maybe
just because it looks cool.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.560
Very easy to grow
a courgette plant

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.380
on a balcony or a window sill.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.540
A fun thing to do is to
grow things in a window box

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.760
and direct them that way
and then let them climb up

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.800
a trellis and harvest
them on the floor above.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.630
You know, there's all
sort of fun you can have.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.730
MARIANA SARACENI: Talk to
your neighbors first, please.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.896
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Climbing beans and peas

00:15:36.896 --> 00:15:37.820
are easy to grow.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.680
Herbs, obviously, really
useful because you

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.890
can use a bit of them every
day or a few times a week.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.360
Just grow something that you're
going to get excited about.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.526
MARIANA SARACENI: Beautiful.

00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:48.920
Besides growing, any tips
for buying vegetables

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.180
in the supermarket.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.790
Farmers' market I'm
hoping are ideal,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.090
but if there's no
close-by farmers'

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.020
market, tips from buying
vegetables in supermarkets?

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.520
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I think

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.550
that the ideal when
buying any food

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.310
is to know as much about
it as you possibly can,

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.320
to know the story of
where it comes from.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.720
For me, it's that connection.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.610
I've talked in the past about
the idea of a sort of continuum

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.170
which I've sort of glibly called
the food acquisition continuum,

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.802
or FAC for short.

00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:22.760
Which is, basically,
we're all somewhere on it.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.300
And at one end of it,
over here if you like,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.510
there are millions of us now
who are almost completely

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.900
dependent on made
food-- essentially,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.040
industrially-produced food.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.930
Ready meals and takeaways,
that's what we eat.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.584
We don't cook.

00:16:37.584 --> 00:16:39.250
We don't even buy
ingredients, and we're

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.730
at this end of the scale.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.360
Right down at the other
end of the scale--

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.040
and there's not
many of the people

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.480
on the planet left doing this--

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.810
you've still got a
few Kalahari Bushman,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.530
a few Amazonian tribes who are
essentially hunter-gatherers

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.020
who wake up in the morning
and the only real issue

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.330
is to feed themselves
and their extended family

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.760
and the others in
their tribe, and they

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.890
have an extraordinary range
of seasonal knowledge.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.480
And as far as they may have
been left some land that they

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.030
can still explore, historical
and tribal and seasonal

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.099
knowledge and the
different value

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:18.020
of plants at different
times of year, and they

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.369
may still hunt and fish.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.702
Not many of them left, as I
say, but we're all somewhere

00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:22.970
on that continuum.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.300
And my whole contention, the
whole River Cottage argument,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.060
if you like, from the very
beginning has been it's

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.130
really good to get a little bit
further down towards some kind

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.160
of self-sufficiency,
some closer connection

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.050
to the origins of your food.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.300
And you can do it by,
just as we talked about,

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.190
growing food in
whatever environment

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.300
you find yourself in.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.730
But you could also do it
in the way that you shop.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.030
And that means buying
less anonymous food

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.094
and more food where,
as you buy it,

00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:53.510
you get a little
bit of the story.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.200
You get a bit of the context.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.840
So that's why farmers'
markets and all markets

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.370
have got a lot going for them
because you've got somebody

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.690
there who's selling with passion
something that they believe in.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.100
Maybe they've made
it themselves.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.260
Maybe they've grown
it themselves.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.830
The idea of farmers'
market really

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.730
is they should only
be staffed by people

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.640
who are connected
from the farm itself

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.060
so they can really tell
you the story of that food.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.220
I get that that's not
easy for everybody,

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.040
but it does make
shopping a real pleasure

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.880
in itself and the cooking
thereafter because you're

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.000
taking with you back into
your kitchen some of the story

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.090
and some of the understanding
and some of the connection

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.780
with that ingredient.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.070
It's kind of mindful.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.144
It puts your mind in a better
place than if you're cooking

00:18:43.144 --> 00:18:45.560
sort of cling-wrapped, anonymous
food from the supermarket

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.290
and you couldn't even say
which country came from--

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.370
sometimes, if it's meat,
which animal or animals.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.730
There's so much you don't know.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.810
I find it scary to be
presented with food that I

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.030
don't know anything
about, and my basic rule

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.215
is I don't eat it.

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:02.840
MARIANA SARACENI:
That's a good policy.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.789
And now, moving
specifically to this book,

00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:07.830
I have to say this is
going to sound very random,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.240
but I already told you
about this I seriously

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.380
have love and respect for
you for the swaps option

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.220
that you put.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.240
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
The swaps?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.960
MARIANA SARACENI: Yes.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.360
I am very much like yes, free
spirit, everything's great.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.520
But when it comes to
a recipe, either I

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.430
don't follow a recipe or
I follow a recipe to a t.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:30.590
So if it says 336 milliliters
of [INTERPOSING VOICES],,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.630
I really get very if
I don't have that.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.213
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Precision

00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:35.867
is rarely vital in cookery.

00:19:35.867 --> 00:19:36.950
MARIANA SARACENI: I agree.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.117
Still, I know it's my issue.

00:19:38.117 --> 00:19:40.033
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
As a pastry chef,

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:42.050
as a former pastry
chef-- well, not former,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.030
I still make some
nice desserts--

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.760
but, yeah, if you're making
a cake, you need to be there

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.700
or thereabouts.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.741
But even then, there's
probably a little bit more

00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:50.930
give the most people think.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.540
But for this kind of
cooking and for the kind

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.570
of nice, rich, tasty assemblies
of different ingredients,

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.480
you don't need precise
amounts of anything.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.180
Maybe be a little bit
sharp with your seasonings.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.590
Otherwise, you can relax.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.720
And what I've done
in several books now

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.580
is I've suggested
a bunch of swaps.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.900
I mean, there's no reason at all
why a carrot recipe won't work

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.050
brilliantly with celeriac
or parsnips or another root

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.620
vegetable.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.500
It won't be the same, but that
would be part of the joy of it.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.400
It will be exciting
and delicious.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.750
So I've suggested a few
swaps, but the idea really

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.224
is make your own swaps.

00:20:28.224 --> 00:20:30.640
Do you think, well, I haven't
got that, but I've got this,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.181
will it work?

00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:32.380
Of course it'll work.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.000
MARIANA SARACENI: Oddly enough,
I understand what you mean,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and it makes sense.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.670
But in my crazy
mind, I kind of like

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.253
needed you, the person who wrote
the book, to tell me it's OK.

00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:39.804
Go ahead.

00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:40.845
I feel kind of validated.

00:20:40.845 --> 00:20:42.350
Like, OK, I'll play with it.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.933
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It is OK.

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:45.200
It is OK.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.740
Go ahead.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.980
MARIANA SARACENI: Thank you.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.680
So considering this is not
your first vegetable cookbook,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.969
how do you come to do recipes?

00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:55.510
Do you decide and
say, you know what?

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.020
Today, I'm going to
explore carrots or today

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.050
I'm going to explore--

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.092
I don't know-- buckwheat?

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.966
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
The first thing,

00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:03.700
and I'm not too shy
about admitting this,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.860
is it's a highly-collaborative
business for me,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.830
and I work very closely
with two amazing people.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.630
One of them used to be my
head chef at River Cottage,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.130
the Cookery School, Gil Meller.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.210
He's just written a
beautiful cookery book

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.310
himself called "Gather,"
his first solo cookery

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.680
book, which has rightly
won loads of awards--

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.500
very much in the spirit of
what we do at River Cottage,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.840
foods of friends
gathered from close by.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.820
So he's my sounding
board for recipes.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.090
And I've also been working with
my food editor, Nikki Duffy,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.390
for more than 10 years.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.430
So Gil, Nikki, and I are a team,
and we get together regularly

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.590
and we brainstorm
ideas for a book.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.050
And we go away, and we
cook different things

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.820
and we send each other pictures.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.640
And we get together
again and have tastings

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.720
and swap things around.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.812
And that's how we do it.

00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.270
First couple of
books I wrote were,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.730
I literally kind
of sat in a garret

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.270
and did them all on my own--

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.810
the original "River Cottage
Cookbook" and the meat book.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.400
But since I've been
working with Gil,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.450
he's so talented it
just seems natural to me

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.340
to swap ideas with him.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.290
So we've got a
pretty good system,

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.680
and the recipes only make it if
we all think they're damn fine.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.390
And I love having them alongside
me to help make it all happen.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.630
MARIANA SARACENI: Do you
guys test your recipes

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.370
on your families?

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.120
As in, kind of like, if my
mother-in-law passes a test?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.180
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yes, we do.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.510
They don't stay just inside
that collaborative circle.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.780
We have various people.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.630
My sister does quite a lot
of tasting and testing.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.009
Some of the team down
at River Cottage--

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:43.300
not just the kitchen team
because it's really important

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.170
that your recipes are tested by
people who are not in any way

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.122
professional cooks
because professional cooks

00:22:49.122 --> 00:22:50.330
won't read the recipe anyway.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.750
They'll do what they want.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.360
So yeah we have
a bunch of people

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.830
who help us out with that.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.490
MARIANA SARACENI:
Including kids?

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.615
Because that's another
thing, I have three nephews,

00:22:59.615 --> 00:23:01.995
and it's quite challenging to
get them to eat a vegetable

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:04.120
unless you make a story of
the magic of the tomato.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.536
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:07.750
I mean, I don't
necessarily put kids

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.580
in charge of recipe
testing, but I'm

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.150
very happy for them
to get involved.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.460
And my recipes are being
tested in a family kitchen,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.910
and hopefully they are
passing the kid test

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.980
at some level or other.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.980
MARIANA SARACENI: Great.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.040
If you could pick one or
three favorite recipes

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.160
from this book, which
ones would they be?

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.610
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
That's so, so hard.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.430
I think what I'd like to say
about the recipes generally is

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.581
that what's so important that
we recognize about vegetables--

00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:41.830
and indeed, we should really
say plants because as you

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:47.770
mentioned, of course the whole
spectrum includes fruits,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.820
seeds, spices, nuts,
grains, and pulses,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.090
as well as the things that we
think of in an everyday sense

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.070
as vegetables--

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.290
we have to recognize there's
an extraordinary palette

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.706
of different
textures and flavors.

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:05.530
Compared to meat and fish, it's
an amazingly-rich, broad world

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.070
of flavors.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.110
We're so hidebound and so
dominated by meat and fish

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.850
in our diets that
we've hardly begun

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.660
to scratch the surface of
the sheer possibilities,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.270
the infinite
possibilities of combining

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.920
all the different plant
foods in delicious ways.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.724
So the first thing
I've done in this book,

00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.140
even more than in
the last one, is

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.389
to sort of throw out the
rulebook and just try things.

00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:30.820
So there's loads of
recipes where I mix

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.650
fruit and vegetables together.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.380
One of the things I'm
doing a lot at the moment

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.060
is just, because
I've got tomatoes

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.300
in the greenhouse and plums
just coming to an end,

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.340
there's a tomato and
plum salad in there.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.840
And just the two
different flavors--

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.464
I mean, they're both
fruits, obviously,

00:24:45.464 --> 00:24:47.560
even though we think of
tomatoes as vegetables--

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.924
but just the tart
sweetness of one

00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:51.340
and the tart
sweetness of another,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.450
yet aromatically they're
completely different.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.660
As it happens, They go
really well together

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.550
with a little bit
of aniseed herb,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.920
like a bit of basil or
torn tarragon in there.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.676
You get an extraordinary
combination

00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:03.550
of different flavors.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.390
It's really exciting.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.840
So there have been lots
of experiments there.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.690
And the recipes
there, I suppose--

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.750
and I think, is it
on the menu today?

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.650
There's another roast
beetroot, plum, and tomato.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.150
MARIANA SARACENI:
Is it on the menu?

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.700
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It's out there.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.460
MARIANA SARACENI: Yes, it is.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.170
Go eat it, everyone.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.461
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It takes those two flavors

00:25:21.461 --> 00:25:23.820
and intensifies them through
roasting and combines them

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.390
with another thing, which
is a root vegetable.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.480
And again, it's a
really beautiful, deep,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.690
resonant spectrum of
flavors that you get.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.626
So really, it's been about
having fun with that.

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:37.500
And the other thing, of
course, is technique.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.708
And when I say that, I don't
mean in a difficult way.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.990
When it comes to
fish, you know we've

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.895
got the barbecue, the
oven, the frying pan.

00:25:47.895 --> 00:25:49.520
And yet, for so long,
vegetables seemed

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.080
to be either boiled
or raw in a salad.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.970
Let's roast more vegetables.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.530
You'd really
challenge me to think

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.090
of a vegetable that is
inappropriate at any time

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.050
to roast.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.860
There's a recipe for
roast lettuce hearts

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.780
in the book where,
in a hot oven,

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.060
you caramelize
those cut corners.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.890
Those little burn
brown bits that you

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.380
get on the edges of
your roast roots,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.850
you can do that
with cauliflower.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.960
You can do that with broccoli.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.168
You can do that with lettuce.

00:26:16.168 --> 00:26:18.140
You can do it with leeks.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.260
You can do it with
all kinds of things.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.170
MARIANA SARACENI: The
latest thing I'll try.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.753
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Does that

00:26:22.753 --> 00:26:25.470
let me off answering the what's
your favorite recipe question?

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.220
The squash patties, which
are on the menu, that's

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.660
a little comfort.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.140
Again, you've made
something there,

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.310
it's kind of a little
bit like a veggie burger,

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.920
but you've surrounded it with
a few little seeds as well.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.440
And you've got some chickpea
in there and some squash,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.800
so it's got that satisfying,
slightly-carby comfort food

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.900
thing but with some
seeds and spices

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.880
just to give it a
little bit of edge.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.378
And I think that's as satisfying
as any kind of fried thing.

00:26:50.378 --> 00:26:51.544
MARIANA SARACENI: Beautiful.

00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:54.650
I have a list of now kind
of like quickfire questions,

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.220
which are very much
like one or the other.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.970
Don't get nervous.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.679
It's fine.

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:01.220
Is there any vegetable
that you think

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.120
isn't worth the while, one
that you think, you know what?

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.050
No.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.990
Or one that you just
simply don't like?

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.781
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Any vegetables

00:27:07.781 --> 00:27:11.879
that are not worthwhile at all?

00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:13.170
MARIANA SARACENI: Don't be shy.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.570
We all have something
we don't like.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.256
HUGH
FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: God.

00:27:19.256 --> 00:27:21.720
I'm just trying to think.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.130
AUDIENCE: Baby sweetcorn.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.670
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
What's that?

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.027
AUDIENCE: Baby sweetcorn

00:27:25.027 --> 00:27:26.860
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Baby sweetcorn.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.575
Yeah.

00:27:27.575 --> 00:27:27.970
MARIANA SARACENI:
That's very random.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:28.675
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:27:28.675 --> 00:27:30.716
MARIANA SARACENI: You
can't steal her answer, no.

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:31.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.463
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thank you

00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:34.520
for coming to my rescue.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.790
It's true that I can't get super
excited about baby sweetcorn.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.420
But even then, I don't hate it.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.140
I don't hate it.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:52.250
Actually, I find
bell peppers not

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:57.136
super exciting on their own.

00:27:57.136 --> 00:27:58.760
There's a nice kind
of sweetness there,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.710
but I think they really
come into their own

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.690
when they're roasted and
cooked and caramelized

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.490
and blended with other things.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.090
And I always think that
thing of a salad that's

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:14.480
got slices of green pepper and
slices of onion, of raw onion,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.210
you've got harsh flavors
that aren't being

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.710
sort of mollified or blended.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.680
It's that salad that is
lettuce, cucumber, peppers,

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.210
and raw onions.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.630
It's like, those they're
all four great ingredients,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.250
but they don't
necessarily just work

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.170
if you plop them raw on
the side of the plate.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.340
MARIANA SARACENI: It's
like a plain salad.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.299
Or you say, like something,
a plane that flies.

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:38.464
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I mean, I'd rather just

00:28:38.464 --> 00:28:41.060
have the lettuce with a nice
dressing or roast the peppers

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.950
and the onions
together or break them

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.800
down really small
into a salsa so you've

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.490
got finely-chopped onion working
with a finely-chopped pepper.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.152
And then maybe add some seeds
and spices and just kind of--

00:28:53.152 --> 00:28:54.110
MARIANA SARACENI: Yeah.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.370
I hear you.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.360
Bell peppers on their
own are impressive.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.180
For the next question, you
cannot say something like

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.720
Italian.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.010
Three favorite
foods, items of food.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.900
For example, I could
not live without them

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.954
without tomatoes,
lemon, and rice.

00:29:10.954 --> 00:29:13.370
I would literally just give
up anything except those three

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.897
things.

00:29:13.897 --> 00:29:15.230
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: OK.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.060
This is really good that
you've got your mind made up

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.080
about this stuff.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:18.760
MARIANA SARACENI:
Are you kidding me?

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.930
I have my death row meal
plan and everything.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.656
And I ask everybody
that I work with,

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:23.780
even clients in interviews.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.360
The first thing I ask, before
we talk about anything, what

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.787
are your three favorite foods?

00:29:27.787 --> 00:29:29.370
I need know what I'm
up against, guys.

00:29:31.364 --> 00:29:32.780
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Shall

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.960
we say three
favorite vegetables?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.664
MARIANA SARACENI: I leave
that poetic license to you.

00:29:37.664 --> 00:29:39.080
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
There

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.750
are three things that
I think kind of we

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.310
don't explore or do enough with.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.700
And I say one of
these as someone

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.658
who used to be quite rude
about this vegetable,

00:29:51.658 --> 00:29:55.470
but I've really come
around to cauliflower.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.020
And I've come around
to it by virtue

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.450
of doing things
like barbecuing it

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.030
or cutting it into thin
slices and putting it

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.550
in a really hot pan and getting
a little bit of color on it

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.280
and then dressing it
with some oil and seeds.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.640
Or, it makes a wonderful soup.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.890
So cauliflower, let's talk
about the under-rated.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.650
Celeriac is another
one, which looks

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.500
like a big, weird, curly
lump that you would struggle

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.940
to get really
enthusiastic about,

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.480
but it's incredibly aromatic.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.800
And it's got so many qualities.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.970
And also, it's different.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.550
If you shave it in very thin
slices, that's one thing.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.800
You can spread it
out and dress it raw.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.250
Matchsticks raw is another.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.060
But then, cooked,
roasted again in cubes.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.250
Or, one of my
favorites, a mash of

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:43.689
half celeriac and half potato
is really, really beautiful.

00:30:43.689 --> 00:30:45.480
MARIANA SARACENI: Jason
does it often here.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.740
Seriously, it's like
a mash of things.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.440
Jason is our chef over there.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.205
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Or a celeriac gratin,

00:30:53.205 --> 00:30:55.610
thinly-sliced chilis.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.940
Obviously, old school, you
would put a bit of cream in,

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.040
but we don't necessarily
need to go there.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.770
I mean, that's the other thing.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.830
This book is vegan.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.260
It's not written
just for vegans.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.100
It's written for everybody.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.310
And so the last veg book
was vegetarian but included

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.670
cheese and dairy and all sorts.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.420
But I wanted to take
this to another level

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.387
just really to prove the point
that I've been banging on about

00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:23.970
since I got here
really, which is just

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:30.190
extraordinary under-explored
world of these vegetables

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.460
where you don't need
the cheese on top.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.602
Of course, it's fine
and cool to put,

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:37.060
and there's loads
of lovely recipes

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.030
that combine vegetables with
dairy and vegetables with meat.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.500
But I just want to celebrate
vegetables in and of themselves

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.440
and the amazing things
you can do with them.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.300
Then, if you want to
add something on top

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.000
or put it on the side or
serve any of these recipes

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.350
next to a simply-cooked
piece of fish,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.770
I've got no problem with that.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.272
But right here, right now,
it's all about the veg.

00:32:01.272 --> 00:32:02.980
MARIANA SARACENI: To
be fair, we actually

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.604
are very blessed here
at Google, and we

00:32:04.604 --> 00:32:06.580
have such a plethora of foods.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.130
The vegan days are
much, much easier

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.710
because you guys give me
such great vegan options.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.490
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Because you have really

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.190
talented chefs here, and I've
met some of them already.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.810
And that's fantastic.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:21.010
For an organization
in their workplace

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.960
to be able to offer
really seriously

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.080
well-thought-out
food that includes

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.410
a really exciting attitude
to vegetables is very cool,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.000
but it is quite unusual.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.083
MARIANA SARACENI: It is
unusual, but I do love it.

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:34.750
Thank you, guys.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.795
I have two questions left before
we move to all of you guys

00:32:40.795 --> 00:32:43.120
being able to ask questions.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.730
Your thoughts on use-by
date or best-before dates,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.549
sell-by dates?

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:47.965
Do you think they
are a suggestion

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.420
or you should follow them?

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.750
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: Of
course they are a suggestion.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.930
You know, used by I've
got a bit of a problem

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.970
with because it's
quite a bossy thing.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.010
It's like suggesting you've
really got to do this thing.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.370
And I think a lot of
people-- and I didn't really

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.370
realize this-- but when
we did the waste series,

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.161
I talked to people.

00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:11.404
They actually felt
really compelled.

00:33:11.404 --> 00:33:12.820
I thought the
spinach looked fine,

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.640
but it said used by
the 11th of March.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.600
So on the 11th of March
on the 10th of March even,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.980
I had to bin it.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.530
You really don't have to.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:28.770
The first thing to care
about is cooking foods.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.910
If a vegetable is
a little bit tired,

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.206
you might not want
to eat them raw,

00:33:33.206 --> 00:33:35.080
but you can roast them
or make them into soup

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.560
or put them together with
various other things.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.660
There's no real safety
issue of anything

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.100
that's properly cooked.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.400
Anything that's heated above
70 degrees for three minutes

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.070
is safe.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.230
But I have to say
one or two things,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.740
very few toxins
that don't survive--

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.625
toxins not bacteria.

00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:56.560
All bacteriological
contamination

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.501
is killed at 70 degrees
for a couple of minutes.

00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:03.070
No doubt about that at all.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.870
There's a few rather
unusual toxins

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.812
that can appear in things
like fermented rice

00:34:08.812 --> 00:34:10.270
that has gone off
or beans that you

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.770
have to be a little bit careful,
but that's a bit out there.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.590
Mostly, heating food
makes it really safe.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.989
So there's no really
real safety issue.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.375
So if it looks OK and it
tastes OK, what is the problem?

00:34:21.375 --> 00:34:23.500
MARIANA SARACENI: Back
home, we actually don't even

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.458
use it as a suggestion.

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:26.080
We just use it as
a marketing lie.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.570
So when I moved here with
a bunch of British people--

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.650
my husband is French--

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.330
they were all outraged that
I never checked anything.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.230
I just smell things.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.060
And they're like, what
if you have a cold?

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.199
I'm like, I might get sick.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:35.839
We'll see.

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.380
I don't know.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:36.880
Look at it.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.630
It's melted.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:37.810
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
You've

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.350
been equipped with pretty
good sensory apparatus

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:45.320
for telling you whether
food is OK to eat or not.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.590
And we don't want to be
disassociated from that.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.102
It's important that we know how
to use those physical tools.

00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:54.310
MARIANA SARACENI: I don't
know if your friend replied

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.860
to your message, but
in London restaurants,

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.620
besides the full-on
vegetarian or vegan

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.032
ones, somebody that's doing
a great job at vegetables?

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:03.240
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Aside from or including?

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.719
MARIANA SARACENI: No, aside.

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:06.010
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: OK

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.426
MARIANA SARACENI: One that
actually could be serving meat,

00:35:08.426 --> 00:35:10.870
but they are very good
putting the [? hero ?] part

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.124
of vegetables on the plate.

00:35:12.124 --> 00:35:13.540
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Yeah.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.520
I'm not great at keeping up with
the London restaurant scene.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.459
I tend to go back to
old favorites including,

00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:25.750
from time to time, the River
Cafe where I used to work.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.680
It's always taken
their vegetables very,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.230
very seriously along with
their pasta and, of course,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.060
their fish and meat.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.420
But I am going to mention one
place because a friend of mine

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.320
took me to a place called
Sunny's Olive Tree, which

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.800
is a vegan takeaway
in Cowcross Market.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.965
I'm very bad.

00:35:50.965 --> 00:35:52.660
Does anyone know where that is?

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.520
And it was so much
in the spirit--

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.750
it was just beautifully
simple, a few salads,

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.520
a few cooked things
piled up together,

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.084
lots of brilliant flavors.

00:36:02.084 --> 00:36:04.000
And the key was going
halfway down the street.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.310
And I just took that as
massive encouragement.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.660
And any restaurant that isn't
taking vegetables seriously--

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.266
and I'm doing a piece
of work for a TV series

00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:14.890
at the moment where
we are going to be,

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.980
at the opposite end
of your question,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.100
highlighting a few well-known
chains who particularly don't

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.280
take the responsibility of
feeding vegetables to kids

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.480
nearly seriously enough.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.010
Because it's really important
to get young diners for whom

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.670
going out to eat a meal with
their family is such a treat.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.920
To encourage them to think
from the age of five or six

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.360
that the world of
eating out only

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.460
consists of carbs, fish, and
meat is dangerous behavior.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.880
So we've got to look at that.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.680
MARIANA SARACENI: Very
exciting about that

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.160
because I'm actually against
kids mainly using restaurants.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.070
I think kids should eat the
same thing as adults, just

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:51.810
smaller portion.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.518
So the same vegetables
that I should eat,

00:36:53.518 --> 00:36:54.670
kids should eat them.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.230
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Well, I think, broadly

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.604
speaking, I agree
with you, but I

00:36:57.604 --> 00:36:59.890
think that lots of
families going out

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.780
do like a little bit
of help, but they're

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.420
getting the wrong kind of
help a lot of the moment.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:04.870
MARIANA SARACENI:
Because you're just

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.040
being led by the
restaurant saying,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.785
oh, this is kid friendly, and
then they just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:08.020
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Would they

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.250
like chips with their pizza?

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.620
They'll be happy.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.710
MARIANA SARACENI: I agree.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.680
So guys, if anybody wants
to come and ask Hugh any

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.530
questions-- or myself,
I'm open as well--

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.185
there's a yellow
mic in the middle.

00:37:20.185 --> 00:37:21.490
Please go ahead.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.140
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It's an open-mic slot.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.390
AUDIENCE: Two quick questions.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.680
Which international cuisine
excites you the most,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.190
and who's your favorite TV
chef apart from yourself?

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:36.000
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Well, I hope it isn't me.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.010
International, it's
so hard because I

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.380
think one of the great
things about this country

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.130
is the amazing access we
have to some of the best food

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.930
from all around the world.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.790
But I'd never actually been
to India until four years ago,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:52.960
and I went there.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.220
I took a family sabbatical.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.411
I took time out, four months,
and it was an incredible trip.

00:37:57.411 --> 00:37:59.410
And we based ourselves
in Delhi and went and did

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.830
various different
trips from there.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.560
And I had some incredible food,
and it really opened my eyes.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.680
And that influence has found
its way into this book.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.000
So probably India.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.500
Sorry.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.340
What was the other question?

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.160
AUDIENCE: Favorite TV chef?

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.810
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Well,

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:21.057
no longer with us, but
Keith Floyd, what a legend,

00:38:21.057 --> 00:38:21.640
what a legend.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.515
And I'm sure I wouldn't
be sitting here today

00:38:23.515 --> 00:38:26.420
if I hadn't been glued to
Keith Floyd as a student.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.900
And what he did that I
think was incredible--

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.740
and I hope I've lived
up to it in some ways--

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.814
is he took food
out of the studio

00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:36.730
and went to find out
where it was coming from.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.860
And he met food
producers and celebrated

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.440
what they were doing and
went out on a fishing boats

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.210
and cooked in the galley
and that kind of stuff.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.360
And the energy around
that and the excitement

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.240
about provenance and food
has always stayed with me.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.349
MARIANA SARACENI: Thank you.

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:53.140
AUDIENCE: Hi, Hugh.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.500
Thanks so much for joining us.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.080
Such an interesting chat.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.160
My question is we're
blessed with amazing chefs

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.600
in our kitchens
here, but we also

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.840
have the luxury of
microkitchens all over Google.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.060
The other day, I grabbed a bar.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.810
It's delicious.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.410
I finished it.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.860
And then I realized it was
made from cricket protein.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.960
It was called Eat Grub.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.130
I don't know if you're
familiar with it.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.945
I'd really be interested
in your thoughts on the--

00:39:17.945 --> 00:39:20.320
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
The world of eating insects.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.580
AUDIENCE: The world
of eating insects.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.930
If you've experimented with it.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.620
And if so, how do you see that
evolving into everyday kitchen?

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.120
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I think

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.470
it's going to be
massive and important.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.140
It's a really good
source of protein.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.940
Of course, we've
eaten insects forever.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.900
Ever since we could
call ourselves

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.280
any sort of a human being,
we've been insect eaters.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.090
It's only in quite
evolved Western cultures

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.270
where it's considered
odd to eat insects.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:58.540
So again, potentially,
insects could

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.670
be a great source of sustainable
food, sustainable protein.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.630
And not necessarily
exotic either.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.970
I have experimented
a little bit,

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.830
but I'm only just
sort of starting

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.009
to get my head around it.

00:40:13.009 --> 00:40:14.550
And I think it's
going to be massive.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.530
But mealworms, which you
can easily grow at home,

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.930
using actually little bits of--

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.430
talking about
leftover vegetables

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.650
when they really are past
their prime-- mealworms,

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.850
you just have a few little
carrot peelings or little bits

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.887
you sprinkle them over the top
of the bran that they live in.

00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:32.470
You've got these
little black beetles,

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.557
and they produce these
wriggly little mealworms.

00:40:35.557 --> 00:40:37.390
I don't know if anyone's
familiar with them.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:38.920
If you feed birds
in your garden,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.140
you might have bought
dried mealworms.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.030
But with this, this is a
really useful ingredient.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.780
Quite a simple,
unoffensive taste to it.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.220
People make mealworm
cookies now,

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.480
which I've tried,
which are pretty good.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.920
We've had some enthusiastic
insects businesses

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.970
come and talk and sell their
food at River Cottage Festival.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.290
So definitely something not to
be seen as purely eccentric.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.377
It's going to be
highly relevant to some

00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.460
of the big issues we talked
about at the beginning

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.612
of this session.

00:41:10.612 --> 00:41:13.348
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:13.348 --> 00:41:14.041
Hi.

00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:14.540
I'm Shaz.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:14.875
This is Yogi.

00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:15.210
Sorry.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.500
He gets a little
bit [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.660
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Hi, Yogi and Shaz.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.560
AUDIENCE: So firstly,
I want to thank

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.550
you so much for coming in.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:20.925
I was so excited
about your talk.

00:41:20.925 --> 00:41:23.580
I actually cleared my
calendar for today.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.460
So I just wanted to ask
a couple of questions.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.910
I saw a program of yours
quite while ago about you

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.377
doing a vegan or a
vegetarian wedding.

00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:32.710
I don't know if you recall that?

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.590
HUGH
FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL: Yes.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.381
AUDIENCE: So I'm getting
married next year.

00:41:35.381 --> 00:41:37.650
And sort of unlike
traditional weddings

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.940
where you have to request
a vegetarian meal,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.390
I would actually love to do
it all vegetarian, flirting

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.740
with the idea of veganism.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.170
And if you really need
meat, you can request it.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.291
I have actually had a few
wedding planners laugh

00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:50.040
in my face already about that.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.840
So a couple of
questions on that.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.660
One, have you done a
second vegan or vegetarian

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.230
wedding since then?

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.990
Two, what is sort of
the general feeling

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.610
that you get from
the guests on that?

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.470
And three, who do I
nee to talk to to hire

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.836
you to do my wedding?

00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:03.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.620
Please.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.120
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Have we

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.930
done a completely vegetarian
wedding since then?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.930
I'm not quite sure,
but we've certainly

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.230
done some big vegetarian nights
and big vegetarian events.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.690
Ben, who's here somewhere,
might know whether we've

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.900
done any more veggie weddings.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.005
Not completely.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.920
And in fact, I understand there
might be a few tickets left

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.010
if anybody is interested.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.550
We're doing a big
vegan feast based

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.740
on the recipes from this book at
Borough Market tomorrow night.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.290
It's a fundraiser for the
Borough Market Traders Fund

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.680
for traders who were affected
by the terror attacks

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.860
back in June.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.240
So I love doing all
vegetarian or vegan events.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.210
And I've just had another
one come in into my inbox

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.950
a couple of days ago.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.260
Born Free, the charity, the
wildlife conservation charity,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.190
want to do a vegetarian banquet,
and I'm putting a menu together

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.120
for that.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.160
I love it absolutely
it, and so do my team.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.530
And Ben and I work
together, Gil and I

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:08.970
and Gelf, who's now the
head chef at River Cottage.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.770
All the River
Cottage canteens are

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.340
very big on veg we have a whole
section of the menu called

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.690
Veg Out, which is 10 to a
dozen vegetable side dishes

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.940
but always with a little
extra twist or with something

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.650
added, whether it's
some seeds or a spice

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.630
or a particular way
of cooking things,

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.600
As well as loads of
vegetarian options right

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.920
through the rest of the menu.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.860
So I take vegetarian and vegan
food very, very seriously.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.430
And I think putting it at
the center of a celebration

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.770
is absolutely no problem.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:41.340
I went to my goddaughter's
21st-birthday party

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.870
last weekend.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.000
And she decided to have
a vegetarian feast,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.960
and it was absolutely delicious.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.345
So yeah, lots you can do.

00:43:48.345 --> 00:43:50.220
And don't let your
friends talk you out of it

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.770
if that's the way
you want to go.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:53.880
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thanks a lot.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.390
And if anyone else wants
to come tomorrow night,

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.350
if you haven't got
a golden ticket,

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.080
it's a massively good cause.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.180
It's going to be an
amazing vegetable feast.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.520
It is 120 quid a
ticket, but that

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.850
is making a substantial donation
to this amazing fund that's

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.010
helping put Borough
Market back on its feet.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.850
So if you were interested,
Josie, somewhere here--

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:14.350
where?

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.690
Oh, she's just outside.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.145
Josie from River Cottage can
talk to you more about that.

00:44:18.145 --> 00:44:20.520
MARIANA SARACENI: By the way,
if you auction the tickets,

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.706
you can donate that
money to the cause.

00:44:22.706 --> 00:44:25.080
Just so you know, guys, we're
running a bit late on time.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.870
So if you have any super-long
questions, maybe for after.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.439
But short, come on in.

00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:29.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.480
I'm Neri.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.510
Thank you so much for your talk.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.120
It was really,
really interesting.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.310
I have my own vegan
Indian food blog,

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.380
and I'm really into creating
sort of Indian recipes.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.590
But I sort of find
it quite difficult

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.540
with some other
cuisines to really find

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.630
things which are, as you
say, very veg-focused

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.320
and really bring out vegetables.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.120
It's kind of contrary
to a question asked

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.700
before where you were like,
which cuisine inspires you

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.530
the most, but are
there any cuisines

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.690
you found which are really
difficult to create veg

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.950
recipes from but that
you've kind of managed

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.627
to find inspiration from?

00:45:04.627 --> 00:45:06.210
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Any areas

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.470
that are difficult to create?

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.980
AUDIENCE: Any cuisines
which are not veg-focused?

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.480
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I think

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.490
sort of Central European cooking
and old school British-English

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.160
cooking is not massively
adventurous with veg.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.730
We have to face up to that.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.960
And as soon as you get around
to other parts of the world--

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.484
I mean, I suppose it's
partly a climate thing,

00:45:29.484 --> 00:45:31.650
but I don't think that's a
good enough excuse for us

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.149
because we know
that in this country

00:45:33.149 --> 00:45:35.550
we can grow
wonderful vegetables.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:39.060
But it's also a
cultural thing where

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.300
to be putting meat
on the table seemed

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.120
like a kind of priority,
a kind of way of saying,

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.600
we're doing OK.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.210
Look, we've got meat every day.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.670
And I think that's what
drove a lot of the idea

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.430
that everyone could have
a chicken in the oven

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.200
every weekend.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.040
That's one thing.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.890
But a chicken in a
sandwich every day

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.040
or a piece of fried
chicken in a bun every day,

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.810
that's led to industrial
farming, and that's

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.100
a whole different thing.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:12.930
But I think that the tropical
cuisines of the world

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:18.090
and also, often, the peasant
cuisines of the world

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:21.930
are much more resourceful
with vegetables.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.540
And so all over Asia,
but also South America,

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:28.830
you've got great traditions
of using things like beans

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:32.100
and rice as the essential
food and then jazzing them up

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.990
with all kinds of
delicious vegetables

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.790
and fruit and spices
and nuts coming into it.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.400
But, I mean, we should all
have that vernacular now.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.030
And I'm sure there's all kinds
of influences in those recipes

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.910
which I could start
to deconstruct,

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.610
but I wouldn't even
be conscious of them

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.180
when I put the recipe together.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.820
But definitely, a lot of Indian
and Asian in there, and I

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.500
guess some Mexican
and South American

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.978
stuff, a lot of good ideas
around veg come from there.

00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:01.824
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:01.824 --> 00:47:02.990
MARIANA SARACENI: Go for it.

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.200
If it's quick, you can come in.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:04.500
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.020
Thank you.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:05.728
Nice to meet you.

00:47:05.728 --> 00:47:08.040
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.160
We've seen the advent of
the impossible burger.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.280
And given that agribusinesses is
the single largest contributor

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.560
to greenhouse gases
on the planet--

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.429
so basically it's warming the
planet through cows farting--

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:22.470
with the advent of the
impossible burger and meat

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.410
being made from plants,
what's your take

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.484
or how does this kind
of resonate with you?

00:47:29.484 --> 00:47:30.900
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Look.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.740
I mean, creating meat-like
textures from plants

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:39.120
probably is not a bad idea
because so many people are

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.370
attached to those
consistencies and flavors.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:46.410
I haven't done the taste test
for that so-called thing.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.490
I don't think it's
necessarily central.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.610
I think really being
much more relaxed

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.100
without denaturing them
or reconstructing them

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.340
or growing strange
things in laboratories,

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.310
vegetables already offer
us a massive solution

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.290
to the problems of
global agriculture.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.680
But the thing we
mustn't forget--

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.880
and it's so easy to-- is that
ultimately it is our choice.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.430
And I get that huge
amounts of money

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.030
are spent on us making
the choices that industry

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.970
wants to make.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:25.410
And that's not like some
big sinister conspiracy.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:26.790
That's just capitalism.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.430
That's just the drive
of making money.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.010
And it's all about margins
and people have found out,

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:36.840
as I said at the beginning, that
cheap starch, fat, and sugar--

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.090
all highly-refined fats
and carbohydrates--

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.850
can be whizzed into
any number of things.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.430
Somehow, we have to
push back against that

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.890
by knowing what's really good
for us and for the planet

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.555
and making the choices that
are going to make a difference.

00:48:49.555 --> 00:48:50.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.320
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thank you very much.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.010
MARIANA SARACENI:
Our last question

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.270
because we are
five minutes over.

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:55.061
AUDIENCE: Hi, Hugh.

00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:55.596
I'm Alex.

00:48:55.596 --> 00:48:56.970
I have a question
about children.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.810
You started talking
about it earlier.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.490
So I cook in my house, and my
wife used to be a vegetarian.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.830
So I used to cook pretty much
three meals-- kids' meals,

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.500
my wife's meal, and my meal.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.280
I mean, I would love
all of these things,

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.571
and I think my kids would
definitely like some of them.

00:49:11.571 --> 00:49:13.590
But there are, as you
said, some complex flavors

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.420
and spices in here.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.700
How best can I get my
children-- who are young,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.320
two and a half and five--

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.320
to start adventuring
more with their food

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.530
and getting more sophisticated
palates at that kind of age?

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.000
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
It's a really good question.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.460
Putting a lot of
stuff in front of kids

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.780
early is really important--

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.550
really early.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.175
I mean, I'm not saying
you're too late,

00:49:37.175 --> 00:49:39.570
but there is something that
kicks in with kids, which

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:42.000
is that after a certain age--

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.940
and it's usually the age when
they're independently mobile--

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.824
they become a bit
mistrustful of new foods.

00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:48.240
And there's an
evolutionary reason

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.420
for that, which is that,
once you wander away

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.870
from the immediate control of
your parent figure, usually

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.920
your mother, you don't want to
be popping berries and things

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.390
randomly into your mouth.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.540
So a little bit of
protection kicks in.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.690
So you need to
encourage your children

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.080
to recognize as many
different foods as possible

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.470
are safe and exciting.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:13.390
Even if they don't necessarily
like them straightaway,

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:15.721
it's important that they
know that they are food.

00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.970
And there's all sorts of
things I didn't like as a kid

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:19.470
that I've somehow
come around to.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.690
Mushrooms, ugh, slimy,
revolting things.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:23.320
Now, I love them to bits.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.270
Tomatoes, couldn't go near
one, mainly because they used

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:28.620
to be completely tasteless.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.570
Although I was addicted
to tomato ketchup,

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:32.840
so there was kind of
a contradiction there.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.710
But it's about variety.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:37.440
It's about using spices
in a very subtle way

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.390
to begin with because
kids actually do quite

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.800
like a little bit of spice.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.300
Kids love garlic.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.680
A little bit of garlicky oil.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.680
Green beans and carrots
plainly steamed, fine.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:51.120
But if you cook a tiny
bit of garlic in oil

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.130
or a little bit
of butter and you

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:56.130
toss the vegetables in that,
that little savory edge

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:56.674
makes it--

00:50:56.674 --> 00:50:58.590
there's something for
them to catch onto there

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.540
that they often really like.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.570
So a little bit of
seasoning, not too much salt.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.450
Also, it's a bit of an easy
win salt. Kids do like salt,

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:08.440
so you have to be a bit careful.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.210
But tiny bits of garlic,
very, very small amounts

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.310
of curry powder
even can actually

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.350
stimulate kids to
like vegetables

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.790
more rather than less.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:20.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:21.400
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thanks a lot.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.233
MARIANA SARACENI: Hugh,
can you stick around

00:51:23.233 --> 00:51:25.590
for signing a few cookbooks
and any questions?

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.390
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
I would love to.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.190
Anyone who wants to come over
and say hi and get a book

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.410
signed, I'd be
absolutely delighted.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.230
MARIANA SARACENI: Thank
you, everyone, for coming.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.850
Thank you, Hugh.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:33.225
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:33.225 --> 00:51:33.525
HUGH FEARNLEY-WHITTINGSTALL:
Thank you all.

00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:35.420
Thank you very much.
