[PBS intro music]

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.480
Hello. I'm Micheal Aranda and starting next week Crash Course Film is going to get critical.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.720
Not like mission, critical.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.160
What I mean is, we're going to start thinking about specific films, critically.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.940
Analyzing them for story, performance, technique, meaning, purpose, and historical importance.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.260
We're going to talk about why we look deeper into movies.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560
Why they're important to us as individuals and as a society.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.940
But, movies are tricky and studying them isn't always about liking or disliking, loving or hating, good or bad.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.560
Movies are emotionally potent pieces of art

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.720
and sometimes we kind of have to wade through the emotional experience of viewing the movie

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.780
before we can really start to study it.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.800
So, that's what we're going to do.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.660
But, why?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.120
Why do we need to look deeper?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.660
Can't we just enjoy what we enjoy and not analyze something to death?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.440
Of course you can!

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.900
Dude, no rules!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.340
But, understanding how movies are working to manipulate your emotions or where the filmmakers are coming from to tell the story they're trying to tell,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.640
Can help you understand more about, well, lots of things.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.000
Things like history, economics, class struggles, race and gender inequalities, or even grief.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.620
Think about DW Griffith's views on race and how they helped create a deeply awful picture of black Americans during the Civil War in "Birth of a Nation."

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.980
Or about Lois Webber's confused views on contraception that led to an equally confused yet powerful

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.860
film "Where Are My Children?" that we'll talk about in this series.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.480
So, there's a lot to take in.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.220
But, don't worry.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.080
It'll be fun and hopefully educational.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.100
Since this is our first film criticism series, we want to talk about a wide range of movies.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.080
From blockbuster to indie darlings.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.780
From action thrillers to deep studies of character and social comentaries.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.700
We'll be starting with Orson Welles' classic, "Citizen Kane".

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.520
To try to answer the questions, "What makes for a great movie?" and, "Is Citizen Kane the best movie of all times?"

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.040
Spoiler alert, It's not,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.560
Or is it?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.960
We'll be looking at 80's culture phenomenons like James Cameron's "Aliens" and modern Oscar winners like "Moonlight".

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.600
We'll tackle quiet comedies, thoughtful war dramas, and revenge flicks.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000
All culminating in Stanley Kubrick's cerebral, "2001 a Space Odyssey".

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.660
A film many people feel is incomprehensible.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.720
Spoiler alert. It's not.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.860
Or is it?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
There's a complete list of the films we'll be going through in the doobly-doo.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.520
So, have a look and join us here next week for our first episode of Crash Course Film Criticism which is produced in collaboration with our

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.760
wonderful friends at PBS digital studios.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760
