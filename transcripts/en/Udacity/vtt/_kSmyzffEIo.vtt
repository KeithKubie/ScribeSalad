00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.020
Now that we've configured
our repositories,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.550
we can define dependencies on artifacts
contained in those repositories.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.905
Dependencies that are resolved from
repositories are referred to as external

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:10.935
module dependencies.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.622
Dependencies are assigned
to configurations.

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:17.031
We'll talk more about configurations
in detail later, but for

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:21.195
now you can simply consider them to
be groups of related dependencies.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.750
For the examples here,
we'll be adding dependencies to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.670
the compile configuration,
which is added by the Java plugin.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.050
Dependencies are configured in
the dependencies script block.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.700
The syntax used is the name of
the configuration we want to add

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.250
the dependency to followed
by a dependency notation.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.050
We can also use a Groovy map syntax
to identify dependencies, again,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.630
by their group,
their name and their version.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.480
In some cases, we simply have files
we want to add as dependencies.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.070
File dependencies are declared very
similarly to manage dependencies,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.760
however instead of a dependency notation
we simply use a file collection or

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.050
a file tree.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.400
In this example, we are simply
adding two JAR files as dependencies

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.580
by creating a file collection.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.570
We can also use a file tree,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.580
which allows us to do things
like specify filters.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.970
This is useful for including a number
of files within a directory.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.920
Gradle also supports project
dependencies, which are dependencies on

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.440
other Gradle projects within
a single multi-project build.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.300
We'll talk more about
multi-project builds and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.060
project dependencies in the next lesson.
