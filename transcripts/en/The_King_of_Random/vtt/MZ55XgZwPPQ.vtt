00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.720
Hey, what's up guys

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.340
You probably know by now that i'm a huge fan of DeWalt tools

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.140
And i'm super stoked for this video, cause they just sent me a hole line-up of their next generation of power tools

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.380
Which aren't limited by cords or power outlets anymore

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.500
So, we jumped in the car and took a road trip to the Southern Utah desert, miles away from civilization

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.980
So we can put these things to the test and show you what they can do

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.940
Now on our way here we rented a truck and picked up a whole bundle of lumber

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.580
Because i'm really, truly curious to see how much lumber we can cut on one single charge

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.180
And out here in the desert, far away from civilization, there's no other source of electricity

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.200
But I don't want to cut these things on the ground

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.460
So let's get busy building ourselves a makeshift workbench first

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.180
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.880
So it's really as simple as taking some wood screws, fastening some 2x4's together, and building a sturdy surface

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.580
where we can start ripping wood, and do some run test to see how much mileage we can get on one charge

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.760
Could've been a Gymnast

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.840
And building this workbench was a really good chance for me to test out the DeWalt flexible battery

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.040
Because i swapped it from the Miter Saw to the Drill Driver, and to the circular saw, and it worked flawlessly and completely as advertised

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.580
Here's the basic idea of how it works

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.560
You've got your Drill Driver that works on 20 Volts

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.260
You pop the DeWalt flexible battery out and put it into your circular saw

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.760
This thing works on 60 Volts and the battery automatically switches voltages

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.240
So you're immediately good to go

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.440
But now you need to power your Miter saw, that runs on 120 Volts, just stick your battery in it

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.000
It doubles up to create 120 Volts, and there are no cords, so it's completely portable

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460
So, it's actually pretty amazing technology

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.600
So, our work bench is finished, our tools are set

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.060
And I've got two DeWalt batterys that were freshly charged this morning

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.780
So, how much wood can we cut on one charge?

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.740
We're about to find out

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.300
(Musical Interlude)

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.440
Alright, quick update guys, our table saw has just stopped

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.100
which i'm assuming means that the battery has just died

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.140
Now, we've got ten 2x4's cut, nd each of them were 8 feet long

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.340
That means we've cut 80 linear feet of 1 1/2 inch thick 2x4

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.540
Let's throw on one more battery, do one more run, and see if the test results come out the same

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.860
Alright guys, just finished our second, that one was a little bit better, we got 12 and a half boards ripped

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.100
Remember, this is inch and a half

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.900
And i'm doing it by myself, for this next round, let's get Mark helping me out

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.120
We can just funnel these things through and see how many we can do as a team

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.420
Alright guys, so we've actually ripped three different rounds of three different charged batterys

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.460
And the results were pretty consistent

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.740
The first one, we ripped 10 boards on one charge

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.720
The second time, i got 12 and a half

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.160
And then with teamwork, we got 14 and 3/4

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.560
So, almost 15 boards

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.700
So I think the first round was a little bit lower due to the learning curve, it took me a little bit to catch onto this

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.340
But you can see they progressivly get better

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.620
These 2x4s are an inch and a half thick, so that's a lot of wood to rip through

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.720
And to be able to get between 12 and 14 consistently is pretty awesome

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.420
Let's move on to the Miter saw next, it takes two batteries

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660
How many cuts can we make before those batteries die?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.400
(Musical Interlude)

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.620
How long can this keep going?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.660
Oh yeah, my arms are getting tired

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.420
And, there it goes, it finally died guys

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.960
Four hundred and fourty eight cuts

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.720
This litter Miter saw totally exceeded my expectations, and now we've got wood everywhere

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.680
So what are we gonna do with all this wood, there's only one thing I can think of, and thats to light it up

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.440
King of Random style

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.180
We're just about there, this is what we've been waiting for

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.900
Wow, that got hot fast

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.400
Wasn't quite the dramatic explosion I was going for, but it got the job done

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.300
That is an epic bonfire

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.800
Here we go

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.360
Whoa, the GoPro over-heated

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.820
Cool guys don't look at explosions

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.080
So there you have it guys, that's the new DeWalt flexible system

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.420
The power of corded, the freedom of cordless

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.580
And if you wanted to try these for yourself you can check them out at Flexible.DeWalt.com, i'll put a link down in the despription

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.920
So there you go, that's what happens when you give a guy cordless power tools and send him out in the desert

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.220
Hey, thanks for joining me for this video, i'll be looking for you in the next one

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.780
Talk to you then

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.940
Oh no, the quad copter
