1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,810
And I appreciate you have
me on her to do it and I,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,420
and I know I don't have a talking
point, I don't have a PR firm. You know,

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:09,330
we even taught before went on air about
what am I gonna you know, I mean Alex,

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:12,330
what do you want to say today so you
can help me get it out. I don't know.

5
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:15,780
I'm alive. I want to say a bunch of
things. I'm only learning how this works,

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,280
being in the process of it and it's
given me a much bigger view than a new 23

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:24,900
years ago when I first got on here
because I've experienced what other people

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,960
have said, bad things. I did
experience. I did it from a good heart.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,980
I believe questioning was okay,
I was covering other people questioning,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,160
but then there's a weird sick irony in
the media that says that I'm the one that

11
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,800
pregenerated sandy hook didn't happen
when I wasn't too then in my name

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,480
popularize it to a level of like they've
put out more [inaudible] gets me.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,420
This is key.
Then before you invade a major country.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,870
I mean this has been going on for
years. Every day the news, the print,

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,900
no one died at sandy hook. Alex
Jones says, Alex Jones says,

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,300
go to their houses and hurt them.
What the hell is it for?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,960
It goes on and on and on and on.
Well,

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,230
you're thinking this because it's
about you, so because it's about you,

19
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:10,990
it becomes a primary point of focus
because it's affecting your life and it's

20
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:14,100
something that you're concentrating
on, but the volume is massive. It is.

21
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,460
Volume is massive because it's
something that generates interest.

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,390
This is part of the problem
with the way we do news today.

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,380
Anything that generates interest,
I mean if the it, honestly,

24
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,280
if the media really cared, they probably
would have never talked about it.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,470
They'd probably would
have never brought it up.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,450
We had real terror attacks in the sixties
and seventies that weren't staged a,

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,830
if you go back and look at him like
the weatherman and all that stuff,

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,160
then that and the government and
the media didn't cover it. Well,

29
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,190
this is a long time ago,
but they didn't cover because it gives,

30
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,190
if you cover terrorists, they
do it more. Right. That's true.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,340
I was agreeing with you. Yeah.
Okay. That's true. That's
like in other countries,

32
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,370
they don't print the name of mass shooters
in the newspaper because they don't

33
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:57,120
want people to get attention for
that. I mean, some different cultures.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,110
I genuinely,
I've known you 20 years or so.

35
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:04,410
It's like 1998 99 I genuinely really,

36
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm trying to find the truth and I
realized that once I saw a bunch of

37
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,900
declassified stage defense,

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,670
like Northwoods or like Gladio or
locked off the Tonkin Gulf of Tonkin.
