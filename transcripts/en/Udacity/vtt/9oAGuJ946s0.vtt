00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.680
for a great experience on Android Wear.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.740

we used Werable extensions to add more
detail that is useful on Android Wear.

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:17.490
The Android Wear software takes
care of all the hard parts such as,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.710
showing the user interface and
handling speech recognition.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.810
Another thing to know,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.160
is that these kinds of extensions
are quite common in Android.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.440
Similar concepts are used to handle
messaging with Android Auto.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.810
So, you'll be able to use similar
techniques to extend your software

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.120
to many different platforms.
