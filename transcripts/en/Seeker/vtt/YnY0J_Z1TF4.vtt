00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.340
It’s time we talk about a new global crisis:
the Sand crisis.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.410
And no, I’m not talking about the frustration
from getting sand out of your underpants after

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.429
a day at the beach.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.179
For most of us, that’s the limit of our
experience with sand: it’s at the beach,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.010
we maybe make a castle out of it, it clings
to things, and then we go home.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.680
Few of us stop to think about the role sand
plays in our daily lives.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.230
Sand is used to make glass, electronics, and
in fracking.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.400
Huge quantities of sand have been dumped into
the sea to reclaim land for development while

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.380
other cities need it to shore up islands against
rising sea levels.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.500
But it’s mostly used in construction.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.440
Sand is the remains of pulverized and weathered
rock mixed with shell fragments and other

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.240
bits and pieces washed up and left as sediment
from a body of water.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.149
And because of that, sand is unique to where
you find it — its composition depends on

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.170
the rocks and minerals in that part of the
world, some of which are sturdier and last

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.760
longer than others.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.670
This means with populations rising, sand is
quickly becoming a hot commodity.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.380
Because, not all sand is created equal.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.520
The fine-grained sand of the Sahara, for example,
does not make an appropriate building material.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.220
Instead, coarser sand must be mined.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.530
Usually from the banks of local rivers and
coastlines, and this brings a whole host of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.350
environmental and human problems, but also
makes for a valuable export.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.259
You’d think sand is everywhere, but it’s
NOT.

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.060
Modern cities use a lot of sand in construction;
the global total for sand mining in 2010 was

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.270
about 11 billion metric tons (12 tons).

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.549
Sand is a globalized commodity, whose trade
value has increased sixfold in the last quarter-century.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.740
FOR SAND.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.060
Some cities are built on sand-heavy foundations
but mostly it’s used to make concrete and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
asphalt.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.770
Nations like Dubai import the “right”
kind of sand for construction -- even though

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.930
they’re surrounded by desert sand it isn’t
strong enough for concrete, so the necessary

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.520
sand is imported from Australia.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.680
And cities experiencing incredible growth
rates are using a lot of sand.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.560
According to estimates, China used more concrete
from 2011 to 2014 than the US went through

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.890
in the entire 20th century.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.780
And their rate isn’t slowing down.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590
There are plans to build cities that will
dwarf New York!

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.000
And because of this booming urbanization -- sand
mining has increased -- with some pretty negative

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.370
consequences.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.800
Sand for construction in Shanghai was originally
dredged from the bottom of the Yangtze River.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.270
But bridges were damaged, the riverbank collapsed,
and the shipping industry was disrupted so

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.020
much that dredging the river bottom was banned.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.310
Now nearby Lake Poyang is dredged.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.319
But it’s not just structural.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.520
Sand dredging is taking a toll on the environment
too.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.310
Dropping water levels can damage nearby wetlands,
destroy the habitat for migratory birds, and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.569
putting animals that rely on that water source
on endangered species lists.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.129
Sand extraction in Kenya damaged coral reefs.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.459
In India it’s a threat to rare crocodiles.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.330
In Indonesia sand mining wiped out whole islands.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.349
So, what can we do about this “sand crisis”?

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.300
One solution could be developing new materials
with all the properties of sand for use in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.300
construction.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.769
Another could be to find an alternative to
concrete for building.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.800
Whatever the case, this is soon to be something
we can’t ignore.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.870
Recycling concrete could help, but some countries
might not be able to set up the infrastructure

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.340
to do that.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.269
Finding an alternative to sand is ideal, but
difficult; it would be hard to replace something

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.460
that has, until now, been so abundant and
cheap.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.800
So, next time you’re shaking sand out off
your shoes at the beach, remember, this material

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
is important.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.810
It’s a natural resource.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.599
It’s not renewable.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.349
And like a lot of nature -- it’s got a lot
of value.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.820
We’re finally recognizing our insane use
of sand as a problem, and that is the first

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.879
step to finding a solution.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.590
There are OTHER ways we’re making construction
more environmentally friendly, like building

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.730
skyscrapers out of WOOD.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.730
How?

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.730
Find out here.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.990
Fun fact: Shanghai has built as many high
rises in the last decade as have been built

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.879
in New York in the last century!
