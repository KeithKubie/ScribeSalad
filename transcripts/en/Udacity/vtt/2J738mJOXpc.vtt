So now you know a lot more

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.400
how they're used along with DNS
to get users to your website.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.560
In the next lesson,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.500
we'll see how addresses are grouped
together into networks and

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.970
how the world is coping with
the ongoing shortage of IPv4 addresses.
