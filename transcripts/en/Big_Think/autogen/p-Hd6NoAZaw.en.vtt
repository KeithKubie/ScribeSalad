Oh

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730
 
 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.090
 
well there's something that interests me

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100
well there's something that interests me
 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.010
well there's something that interests me
and it does look quite promising and

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020
and it does look quite promising and
 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.420
and it does look quite promising and
maybe I'm inflating its importance

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430
maybe I'm inflating its importance
 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.350
maybe I'm inflating its importance
because I can understand it but for most

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360
because I can understand it but for most
 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.750
because I can understand it but for most
of the history of biology the stuff of

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760
of the history of biology the stuff of
 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.790
of the history of biology the stuff of
life well it used to be thought over

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800
life well it used to be thought over
 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.290
life well it used to be thought over
some sort of magic matter but then about

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300
some sort of magic matter but then about
 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.390
some sort of magic matter but then about
a hundred years ago the the cell became

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400
a hundred years ago the the cell became
 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.890
a hundred years ago the the cell became
seen as a sort of bag of complex

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900
seen as a sort of bag of complex
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.230
seen as a sort of bag of complex
chemicals and so the chemical approach

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240
chemicals and so the chemical approach
 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.090
chemicals and so the chemical approach
to cancer is across well known in

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100
to cancer is across well known in
 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
to cancer is across well known in
chemotherapy about 60 years ago the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520
chemotherapy about 60 years ago the
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.880
chemotherapy about 60 years ago the
informational side of life became

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890
informational side of life became
 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.430
informational side of life became
apparent with the discovery of DNA and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440
apparent with the discovery of DNA and
 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.709
apparent with the discovery of DNA and
the genetic code and so on and so now we

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719
the genetic code and so on and so now we
 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.470
the genetic code and so on and so now we
have genetics and bioinformatics and the

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480
have genetics and bioinformatics and the
 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.380
have genetics and bioinformatics and the
whole sort of information all approached

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390
whole sort of information all approached
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.450
whole sort of information all approached
genomics proteomics and so on the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
genomics proteomics and so on the
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.759
genomics proteomics and so on the
follows from that so we've got two views

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769
follows from that so we've got two views
 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.220
follows from that so we've got two views
of cancer cells bagra chemicals and an

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230
of cancer cells bagra chemicals and an
 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.500
of cancer cells bagra chemicals and an
information processing system but

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510
information processing system but
 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.970
information processing system but
there's a third viewer cancer cell is a

and what we were like to is integrate
all of these three points of view but

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
all of these three points of view but
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.020
all of these three points of view but
the physical part has been very much

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030
the physical part has been very much
 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.960
the physical part has been very much
neglected so for example healthy cells

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970
neglected so for example healthy cells
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.900
neglected so for example healthy cells
and cancer cells respond very

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910
and cancer cells respond very
 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.720

trying to map those keralites I think is
a really important way forward so maybe

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570
a really important way forward so maybe
 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.960
a really important way forward so maybe
we can control cancer by controlling or

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970
we can control cancer by controlling or
 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.300
we can control cancer by controlling or
manipulating the microenvironment you've

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
manipulating the microenvironment you've
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.680

got to get away from the idea of cancer

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690

just misbehaving and going a bit wrong
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.140
just misbehaving and going a bit wrong
and you don't have to cure cancer you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
and you don't have to cure cancer you
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.180

don't get rid of all those cells most

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
don't get rid of all those cells most

don't do any harm so what we want to do

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
don't do any harm so what we want to do
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.940
don't do any harm so what we want to do
is prevent the cancer from gaining

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
is prevent the cancer from gaining
 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.280
is prevent the cancer from gaining
control we just want to keep it in check

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290

maybe this is a whole new approach so
it's not you don't zap the cancer with

it's not you don't zap the cancer with
 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.070
it's not you don't zap the cancer with
chemicals you don't bombard them with

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080
chemicals you don't bombard them with
 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.630
chemicals you don't bombard them with
raised to make them die and you don't

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640
raised to make them die and you don't
 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.729

we're not talking about gene therapy

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739
we're not talking about gene therapy
 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.280
we're not talking about gene therapy
where you try and insert some sort of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290
where you try and insert some sort of
 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.050
where you try and insert some sort of
gene to switch them off or something

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
gene to switch them off or something
 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.479
gene to switch them off or something
we're talking about something much

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489
we're talking about something much
 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.820
we're talking about something much
simpler about controlling the physics of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830
simpler about controlling the physics of
 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.800
simpler about controlling the physics of
the cells and their immediate

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810
the cells and their immediate
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.990
the cells and their immediate
environment in a way that will change

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
environment in a way that will change
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.420
environment in a way that will change
their behavior and their gene expression

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430
their behavior and their gene expression
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.860
their behavior and their gene expression
so it's really a whole new way of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
so it's really a whole new way of
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.500
so it's really a whole new way of
thinking about it and I'm really hopeful

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510
thinking about it and I'm really hopeful
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.789
thinking about it and I'm really hopeful
look so we're going to learn a lot of

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799
look so we're going to learn a lot of
 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.490
look so we're going to learn a lot of
interesting things I might say that this

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500
interesting things I might say that this
 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.449
interesting things I might say that this
cancer research I think it's really

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459
cancer research I think it's really
 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.070
cancer research I think it's really
important to inform cancer not just from

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080
important to inform cancer not just from
 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.469
important to inform cancer not just from
subjects like physics and chemistry but

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479
subjects like physics and chemistry but
 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.140
subjects like physics and chemistry but
also from astrobiology astrobiologists

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150
also from astrobiology astrobiologists
 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.870
also from astrobiology astrobiologists
have spent a long

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880
have spent a long
 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.970
have spent a long
and think about the nature of life and

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980
and think about the nature of life and
 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.220
and think about the nature of life and
its its evolutionary history how it

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230
its its evolutionary history how it
 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.890
its its evolutionary history how it
began how it evolved over time I think

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
began how it evolved over time I think
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.290
began how it evolved over time I think
they have a lot to contribute to the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300
they have a lot to contribute to the
 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.450
they have a lot to contribute to the
understanding of cancer so I only I was

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460
understanding of cancer so I only I was
 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.210
understanding of cancer so I only I was
talking about the holy grail of

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220
talking about the holy grail of
 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.730
talking about the holy grail of
astrobiologists is to find life 2.0 that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
astrobiologists is to find life 2.0 that
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.860
astrobiologists is to find life 2.0 that
is a second form of life right here on

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870
is a second form of life right here on
 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.740
is a second form of life right here on
earth i think cancer is life 1.1 it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750
earth i think cancer is life 1.1 it's
 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.080
earth i think cancer is life 1.1 it's
like another form of life it's closely

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090
like another form of life it's closely
 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.620
like another form of life it's closely
related to healthy life a healthy body

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630
related to healthy life a healthy body
 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.930
related to healthy life a healthy body
is one form of life cancer is in a way

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940
is one form of life cancer is in a way
 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.900
is one form of life cancer is in a way
nature's experiment with with life it's

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910
nature's experiment with with life it's
 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.930
nature's experiment with with life it's
its life almost as we know it but

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940
its life almost as we know it but
 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.000
its life almost as we know it but
modified in a certain way and I think

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010
modified in a certain way and I think
 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.970
modified in a certain way and I think
studying cancer it's not not a one-way

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980
studying cancer it's not not a one-way
 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.610
studying cancer it's not not a one-way
street studying cancer could provide

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620
street studying cancer could provide
 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.850
street studying cancer could provide
huge insights for astrobiologists into

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860
huge insights for astrobiologists into
 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.010
huge insights for astrobiologists into
the nature of life itself cancer

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020
the nature of life itself cancer
 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.890
the nature of life itself cancer
biologists really are not mostly not

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900
biologists really are not mostly not
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.580
biologists really are not mostly not
very interested in evolution they

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590
very interested in evolution they
 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.170
very interested in evolution they
they're not evolutionary biologists

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180
they're not evolutionary biologists
 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.550
they're not evolutionary biologists
their cancer biologists so that their

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
their cancer biologists so that their
 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.270
their cancer biologists so that their
cell biologist but we really understand

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
cell biologist but we really understand
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.670
cell biologist but we really understand
the nature of life itself by looking at

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
the nature of life itself by looking at
 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.820
the nature of life itself by looking at
that long evolutionary history cancer is

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830
that long evolutionary history cancer is
 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.410
that long evolutionary history cancer is
not something confined to human beings

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420
not something confined to human beings
 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.790
not something confined to human beings
it's found in all multicellular

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800
it's found in all multicellular
 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.500
it's found in all multicellular
organisms where the adult cells

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510
organisms where the adult cells
 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.560
organisms where the adult cells
proliferate so it's widespread in the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570
proliferate so it's widespread in the
 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.630
proliferate so it's widespread in the
biosphere so it's a phenomenon that is

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640
biosphere so it's a phenomenon that is
 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.090
biosphere so it's a phenomenon that is
deeply related to the history of life

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100
deeply related to the history of life
 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.040
deeply related to the history of life
itself so by studying cancer I think we

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050
itself so by studying cancer I think we
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.780
itself so by studying cancer I think we
can illuminate this your life itself and

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790
can illuminate this your life itself and
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.260
can illuminate this your life itself and
vice versa so my thinking and running

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270
vice versa so my thinking and running
 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.700
vice versa so my thinking and running
this cancer forum is to just get

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710
this cancer forum is to just get
 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.190
this cancer forum is to just get
expertise from as many fields as we can

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200
expertise from as many fields as we can
 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.430
expertise from as many fields as we can
bring it to bear on hopefully some very

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440
bring it to bear on hopefully some very
 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.090
bring it to bear on hopefully some very
well-defined problems in cancer biology

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100
well-defined problems in cancer biology
 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.190
well-defined problems in cancer biology
and really try and nail them and try and

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
and really try and nail them and try and
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.130
and really try and nail them and try and
move the subject along
