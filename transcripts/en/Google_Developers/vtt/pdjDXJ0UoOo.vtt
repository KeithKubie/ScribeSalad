00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:08.241
Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.920
My name is Maria,
also known as Masha.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.012
I work at Play Games' BD team.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.090
I believe games are art.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.110
I still occasionally play
"Heroes of Might and Magic 3."

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.980
And I literally cried with joy
when I opened up all the tiles

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.005
in "Thrace."

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.060
When I think about the
best games to play,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.530
my mind immediately goes to
unique, deep, more meaningful

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.970
experiences-- in other
words, to indie games.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.210
Indie became the genre of
its own in the same way

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.217
as [INAUDIBLE] to
an idle clicker,

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:46.140
to shooter, or to an adventure.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.150
And this specific
genre makes people

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.000
all over the world really
excited about video games

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.630
and motivates them to tweet
to their friends, oh my gosh,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.434
you should totally
check this out.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.830
Today, if indies
didn't exist, we

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.300
would only have big
and mainstream games.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.834
And we would live, technically,
in the gamer's horror

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.690
"Groundhog Day" where you pretty
much play the same game over

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.440
and over again.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
But luckily, we do have freedom.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.020
We do have freedom to choose
what games we want to play.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.990
And this freedom is one of the
best and most beautiful things

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.130
about video games.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.670
And we should say thank you
to indies for this choice.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.180
Thank you, indies.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.054
While not everyone can come
up with the next big game

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.260
on mobile, it's very
important to support artists

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.050
at each stage of
their creative process

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.000
and reward them for risks.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.505
On other platforms,
we already saw proof

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.320
that indies do not
cannibalize on the success

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.800
of mainstream and big titles.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.180
But they coexist in
the comfortable space,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.036
attracting new players
and entertaining

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:59.640
those who are in wait.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.510
They do coexist on PC and
consoles, but not on mobile,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.360
not yet.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.520
So what is Indie Corner?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.820
Indie Corner is the place on
the Play Store ruled by indies.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.100
This is the
destination for players

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.243
to discover new games
coming from most

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:24.580
interesting, inspirational,
and talented teams from all

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.100
over the world.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.260
This is the place to keep up
to date with most trending,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.540
most talked about, and recently
launched indie releases.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.670
Also, this is the
hall of fame where

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.820
players can discover
the true masterpieces

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.400
of independent game
development crafted for mobile.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.180
Indie corner includes
three games collections,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.690
which represent three stages of
the success of independent game

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270
developers.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.400
And we would love to support
your team through all

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.430
those stages with us.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.330
The first collection is
called new highlights.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.580
This is the section
of the Indie Corner

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.580
that helps to solve
discoverability for new teams

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.690
when they're launching their
first, and most innovative,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.420
and experimental title.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.340
If you are one of those
teams, stay with me.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.740
In a few minutes, I will tell
you how to get considered.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.940
The second collection
is most popular.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.140
We highlight trending,
recently launched indie

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.630
titles that received the highest
user rating and play time.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.450
And with that collection is
a carefully curated showcase

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.480
of the most innovative,
noteworthy, critically

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.250
acclaimed masterpieces
of the indie space

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.230
to keep you inspired
and motivated.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.440
And I'm thrilled to announce
to you that we have already

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.250
launched our first
collection on the Play Store.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.954
The collection went
live on February 25,

00:03:54.954 --> 00:03:58.580
and we are planning to
update it on a monthly basis.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.472
Besides being just a
showcase, Indie Corner

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:03.195
empowers developers
to take advantage

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:06.090
of existing free
Google Play tools

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.340
and to optimize their
presence on the platform.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.780
Player Analytics
provides a better view

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.730
into players' behavior and helps
with fine-tuning a free to play

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.490
game.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.810
And developers working
on premium titles

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.710
can protect their creations
by using Google App licensing.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.590
I'd like to feature a very
passionate and talented team

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.820
from Singapore, Springloaded.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.595
This team did a phenomenal
job tuning their game,

00:04:34.595 --> 00:04:37.740
"The Last Vikings,"
with actionable feedback

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.296
from Player Analytics.

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:42.194
They achieved material
improvements in their KPIs,

00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:46.350
as you can see, and received
a feature in Indie Corner.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.900
So how do you get started?

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.040
I would like you to take
out your phones right now

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.540
and take a picture
of this slide.

00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:01.152
Here, you will find the
link to the submission form

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:04.680
to get your game considered
for Indie Corner.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.140
But before you do so, please
review the requirements.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.680
Technically, we want you
to unleash your creativity,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.310
to experiment, to
do something that

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.750
has never been seen before.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.590
And we're here to support you.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.345
That's it.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:20.985
We're excited to see
your submissions.

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:24.860
We are thrilled to grow this
space together with you.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.931
And you can find me
later, during the break

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.980
or at roundtables, to ask
any questions and talk more.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.140
And please stay awesome.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.104
Thank you, and play indie.

00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:38.790
[APPLAUSE]
