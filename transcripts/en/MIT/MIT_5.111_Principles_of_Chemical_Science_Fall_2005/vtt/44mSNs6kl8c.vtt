00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.625
We are going to finish up
acid-base titration stuff today.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:26.447
And I think actually most of
you have probably ventured into

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:30.000
the Problem Set,
which is great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.296
I think the best way to learn
acid-base titrations is usually

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.733
you hear a little bit about
acid-base titrations,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.743
then sit down and try to do
problems, go back and revisit

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:44.893
how to do the problems and then
try it again.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:49.190
This is one of the units where
you really cannot learn how to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.340
do it by just sort of listening
to a lecture.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.706
You have to sit down and work
numerous problems.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:59.000
That may be true in other
units.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.809
But I think it is particularly
true in this one,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.797
that it is all about practicing
doing the problems,

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.144
so it is real important to work
through a number of them.

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:10.356
And you will have other
opportunities.

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:12.866
Of course, this will be
material on Exam 3.

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.273
But also acid-base titration
always makes an appearance on

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:18.724
the final.
It will be well worth your time

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.891
to work these problems.
They will be worth a number of

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:25.000
points for the rest of the
semester.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.447
And, as I said,
you will see all this

00:01:27.447 --> 00:01:31.188
information again in organic
chemistry, in biochemistry,

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:33.908
and a lot of other courses that
you take.

00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:37.172
You will talk about pKa's and
buffers in biology.

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:39.756
You will see all this again.
All right.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:43.563
We were talking about the
titration of a weak acid with a

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:47.236
strong base, and we went through
this figure on Monday.

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:50.432
And the particular problem that
we were working,

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:54.444
we are going to go through and
look at different time points

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:59.000
along the titration and
calculate what the pH is.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.424
And the problem we were working
was 25 mLs of a 0.1 molar

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:09.365
solution of a weak acid titrated
with a strong base.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:11.109
In this case,
NaOH.

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:16.243
And that was 0.15 molar.
And you were given the Ka for

00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:21.765
the weak acid in this problem.
We had done one time point,

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:27.384
and that was the initial time
point when no strong base had

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:32.963
been added yet.
Let me just put that down.

00:02:32.963 --> 00:02:39.573
We are plotting the volume of
the strong base that is added

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:43.676
versus pH.
And we had one time point,

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:49.716
and that was a pH of 2.38.
And that was when there was

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:53.477
zero mLs of the strong base
added.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:03:01.000
So just the pH of the weak acid
in water was 2.38 for pH.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.273
And then we had started
calculating what happens at 5

00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:08.808
mLs, when 5 mLs of the strong
base is added,

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.438
and that is this time point
here.

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:16.369
Here we are in between zero and
the volume at the equivalence

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:20.315
point, and we have the 5 mLs.
Let me just review.

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:25.000
We talked about this right at
the end of class.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.192
The first step in doing this
type of problem is to figure out

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:35.038
how many moles of both the weak
acid that you have in the

00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:40.230
problem and the number of moles
of strong base that have been

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.480
added so far.
For the acid,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.721
there was 25 mLs originally of
0.1 molar solution,

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.750
so 2.5x10^-3 moles of the weak
acid.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.250
And for the strong base,
now we have added 5 mLs of a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.096
0.15 molar concentration.
So far we have added 0.75x10^-3

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:03.610
moles.
This strong base will react

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.573
with the acid.
It will pull off a hydrogen

00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:12.116
ion, or a proton,
from the weak acid and convert

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:17.336
it to its conjugate base.
Now we need to figure out how

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:20.913
much we have left after this
reaction.

00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:24.683
We had 2.5x10^-3 moles of the
weak acid.

00:04:24.683 --> 00:04:30.000
We have now converted over
0.75x10^-3 moles.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.560
We have 1.75x10^-3 moles of the
acid left.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.988
And now we formed 0.75x10^-3
moles of the conjugate,

00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:42.764
so 0.75x10^-3 moles have been
converted from acid to the

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:46.064
conjugate base.
Now we need to know the

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:50.666
molarities of those amounts,
so we take the weak acid,

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:55.095
the number of moles divided by
the total volume now,

00:04:55.095 --> 00:05:01.000
which is 25 plus the 5 we just
added, or 30 milliliters.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.472
And we have a concentration.
And then we do the same with a

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:07.884
weak base, number of moles that
we have divided by the new

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:11.416
volume gives you the molarity.
Right at the end of class you

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:15.068
said, okay, the next thing you
can do, there are two different

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:17.164
options.
One option, which we talked

00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:19.977
about, was set up this little
equilibrium table.

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:23.390
And the important point to
remember, and when you set this

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.742
up, is that you have the weak
acid and its conjugate over

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:30.009
here.
And the other problem is when

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.988
you just have a weak acid and
water problem,

00:05:32.988 --> 00:05:36.937
you just have the weak acid,
or if you have a weak base in

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.709
water problem,
you just start with a weak

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:41.926
base.
Here, this is really like a

00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:45.043
buffer problem.
You have both the acid and its

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:48.715
conjugate to some amount,
so you need to put things on

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.487
both sides.
We had come up with the pH of

00:05:51.487 --> 00:05:53.773
3.38.
And you have to set up using

00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:58.000
Ka, check your assumptions and
calculate pH.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.943
There is another way that you
can do this particular problem,

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:05.229
and that is option two.
The first part is the same.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.580
You have to do all the
calculations with a number of

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.392
moles and calculate molarity.
The second part is different.

00:06:12.392 --> 00:06:15.284
Instead of setting up that
equilibrium table,

00:06:15.284 --> 00:06:18.307
you can use the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:20.541
In this case,
you need to know pKa.

00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.630
And you know Ka.
You take the minus log of Ka to

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.062
get pKa.
And then you can fill in your

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:29.873
concentration of the weak acid
and the concentration of the

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:35.000
conjugate base that is formed
after the addition of 5 mLs.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.034
And then you can calculate.
And you should definitely get

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:42.492
the same pH out of this 3.38.
Now, this equation,

00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:46.383
the Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation, only works with the

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:50.489
assumption that x is small,
so that 5% rule that we talked

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:52.795
about.
And that is because in the

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:57.118
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,
if you were to remember back,

00:06:57.118 --> 00:07:01.568
we are making an assumption.
We are assuming that the

00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:05.098
initial concentrations that we
have are the same as the

00:07:05.098 --> 00:07:08.758
concentrations we have at
equilibrium, which is basically

00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:11.764
saying x is small.
You can only use it if x is,

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.640
in fact, small.
The way that you would check,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.450
in this case,
is you have to back calculate.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.980
You know your pH answer,
and then you have to calculate

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.921
then what the hydronium ion
concentration was,

00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.712
which is easy because pH just
equals minus log of hydronium

00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:32.267
ion concentration.
And so you can get this answer

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:34.760
out.
Then you take this and divide

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.463
by either of these two.
You want to use really the

00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:42.015
smaller one or both of them and
see, is x small?

00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:45.717
And, in this case,
both of those are less than 5%.

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:50.176
4.2x10^-4 is less than 5% of
this number and of this number,

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:53.652
so that assumption is okay.
If it was not okay,

00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:57.430
you would have to have used
option one and used the

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.272
quadratic equation.
If x is not small,

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:05.160
the only way you can do it is
option one with quadratic.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.411
But most of the time,
x is small because we are

00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:10.814
talking about weak acids and
bases.

00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:14.914
And a lot of people find the
Henderson-Hasselbalch a faster

00:08:14.914 --> 00:08:18.307
way to get the answer.
And as you are doing these

00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:21.417
problem sets,
you realize these problems take

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:24.103
a while to do.
And on a 50 minute exam,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:28.415
part of the process in thinking
about how to do these problems

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:32.303
should be how can I do the
problem the fastest to get it

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.855
done?
And a lot of people find this

00:08:35.855 --> 00:08:38.607
to be a little bit of a faster
way to do it.

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:41.423
Henderson-Hasselbalch only
works for buffers,

00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:44.368
so it only works under
conditions where you are

00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:48.272
starting with an acid and its
conjugate base or a base and its

00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:51.152
conjugate acid.
Only in the buffer region will

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:54.416
Henderson-Hasselbalch apply,
but when it does apply,

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.399
you should think about using
it.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:03.105
All right.
Let's put our other pH up here.

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:12.000
After we have added 5 mLs,
then we have a pH of 3.38.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.353
Okay.
Now we have reached a special

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:25.053
point called the half
equivalence point.

00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:29.000
This is right in the middle of
this buffering region.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.777
Again, the buffering region is
the part of the curve that is

00:09:32.777 --> 00:09:36.362
flat, where you are adding your
strong base but it is not

00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:39.883
changing the pH very much,
because the solution is being

00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.187
buffered.
The pH is staying the same,

00:09:42.187 --> 00:09:44.428
so it is the flat part of the
curve.

00:09:44.428 --> 00:09:48.141
And right in the middle of the
flat part, you find the half

00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:51.086
equivalence point.
That is when you have added,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.774
in this case,
half the amount of the strong

00:09:53.774 --> 00:09:58.000
base that you need to reach the
equivalence point.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.197
At the equivalence point,
the number of moles of strong

00:10:01.197 --> 00:10:04.750
base are equal to the number of
moles of weak acid you had to

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.177
begin with.
At the half equivalence point,

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:10.138
you have converted half over to
the conjugate base.

00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:12.861
You have the half of the acid
you started with,

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:14.815
and half of it is being
converted.

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:18.013
This is in the buffering
region, and so you can use the

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:21.684
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
And you see that if you plugged

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:24.881
in values into here and you
would have equal amounts of

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:27.605
these two, you have converted
half the amounts,

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:30.625
you half this and half that,
and you solved the log,

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:34.000
you would find this term drops
out.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.722
And so pH just equals pKa.
If you know the pKa,

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:46.937
and usually the Ka is given so
you can easily calculate the

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:52.038
pKa, then that is the pH.
The pKa is 3.75,

00:10:52.038 --> 00:11:00.000
so that is then also the pH at
the half equivalence point.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.711
Here would be 3.75 at the half
equivalence point.

00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:08.582
Now, when I was mentioning that
on an exam you are going to look

00:11:08.582 --> 00:11:12.989
for fast ways to solve the
problem, if you are asked about

00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:17.474
the pH at a half equivalence
point, you can write pH equals

00:11:17.474 --> 00:11:19.561
pKa equals 3.75.
That is it.

00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:24.123
It might be a number of points
question, but that is all you

00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:27.139
are looking for and you give the
answer.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:32.139
This is a fast problem.
Make sure that you remember

00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:35.229
this trick.
You can work it out the long

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:39.825
way and figure out the same
answer, but this is a perfectly

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:44.183
acceptable answer to say that pH
equals pKa equals 3.75.

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:47.590
That is a shortcut for doing
these problems.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.442
Then we get to the equivalence
point.

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:55.117
I mean, sometimes you might
have here, this has point D also

00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:59.000
in the curve,
but we will skip that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.189
You would do that problem the
same way you did the problem on

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.261
the other side of the half
equivalence point,

00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:10.240
so we can skip over that and
move right to the equivalence

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.684
point.
Again, the equivalence point,

00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:16.804
also called the stoichiometric
point, is when you have added

00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:20.364
the amount of strong base,
the moles of strong base,

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:24.554
that are equal to the moles of
the weak acid you had to begin

00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:26.997
with.
You have converted all of your

00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:31.409
weak acid to its conjugate.
In terms of the pH,

00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:35.562
the pH is going to depend on
the salt that is formed as a

00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:39.122
result of this addition.
In the case when you are

00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:43.350
titrating a weak acid with a
strong base, you are going to

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.800
get a pH greater than 7 because
all of your weak acid will be

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.028
converted to the conjugate base.
All you are going to have

00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:55.217
around is conjugate base,
and base is basic,

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:59.000
so you are going to be greater
than 7.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.760
In this case,
you will get the conjugate base

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.712
in the form of a salt and water.
The Na plus doesn't do

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:08.222
anything for you.
It has no effect on pH.

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.982
All Group 1 and Group 2 have no
effect on pH,

00:13:10.982 --> 00:13:14.558
but we have a conjugate base,
so we are going to have a pH

00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:17.005
greater than 7 at the
equivalence point.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:20.079
And this is a good way to
quickly check your math.

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:23.530
If you know what kind of
problem it is and you don't get

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.792
a pH that is greater than 7 for
this type of problem,

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:30.368
you know you have made some
kind of math mistake somewhere

00:13:30.368 --> 00:13:34.000
along.
And you can go back and try to

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.333
find that.
All right.

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:39.200
How do you do the problems?
You want to find the pH then at

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.533
the equivalence point.
The exact pH.

00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:45.066
You know it is greater than 7,
but what is it exactly?

00:13:45.066 --> 00:13:48.733
The first thing you need to do
is find the total volume,

00:13:48.733 --> 00:13:52.733
and you need to know the volume
of NaOH that you added to the

00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:55.399
solution to get to the
equivalence point.

00:13:55.399 --> 00:14:00.000
You know how many moles of acid
you had to begin with.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.426
2.5x10^-3.
That is how many moles,

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.926
then, of conjugate base you
formed.

00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:09.411
And that must be how many moles
of OH you needed to add to get

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:13.235
the equivalence point.
You need this number of moles.

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:17.500
This was your concentration.
And so that is how many liters

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.955
needed to be added to get the
equivalence point.

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:23.823
And in terms of your total
volume, then,

00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:26.470
you had 25 milliliters to begin
with.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.000
You are adding 16.7 of the
base.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.408
Now you are at 41.7 milliliters
of volume.

00:14:33.408 --> 00:14:36.401
All right.
Just to show this again in

00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:39.311
cartoon form.
The point to remember,

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:43.884
at this equivalence point,
is that this is all you have.

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:46.628
You just have that conjugate
base.

00:14:46.628 --> 00:14:50.951
If you had four molecules of
weak acid to begin with,

00:14:50.951 --> 00:14:56.189
and you added four molecules of
NaOH, then each molecule of NaOH

00:14:56.189 --> 00:15:01.510
or of OH will pluck one of these
hydrogen ions off and will leave

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.000
you, then, just with a conjugate
base.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.916
You are going to have equal
moles here to what you had here,

00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:15.833
so you have these equal moles.
In terms then of the molarity

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:20.833
of this, you have to have the
same number of moles now of the

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:25.500
weak base as what you had of the
weak acid to start with.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.000
You have converted all of it to
the weak base.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.278
You have that many moles,
and you calculated the total

00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:37.265
volume, so you know your new
molarity.

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:40.575
This is just a weak base in
water problem.

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:43.966
And we talked already about how
to do this.

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:48.567
We can set up this table here.
Now all we have is the weak

00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:51.473
base.
We don't have any of this left.

00:15:51.473 --> 00:15:55.429
It has all been converted,
so all we have is this.

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:59.062
We have 0.0600 molar minus x,

00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:03.403
x and x.
Now, again, you cannot use the

00:16:03.403 --> 00:16:07.728
Henderson-Hasselbalch here.
It is not a buffer problem.

00:16:07.728 --> 00:16:12.454
We have to solve it using Kb,
because it is a base in water.

00:16:12.454 --> 00:16:16.299
We cannot use Ka.
We have to use Kb for a base in

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:18.782
water.
Kb is the base ionization

00:16:18.782 --> 00:16:21.105
constant.
If I was given a Ka,

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.390
how would I find the Kb for the
conjugate?

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.552
What would I use?
Kw, right.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:32.000
That is an easy conversion,
using Kw to calculate Kb.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.311
And then that would be equal to
x squared over 0.06 minus x.

00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:41.441
We can simplify that if x is

00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:46.162
small, double check that that is
okay, and if we do that,

00:16:46.162 --> 00:16:50.040
we find that the OH
concentration is 1.83x10^-6

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.906
molar.
Then we can calculate a pOH,

00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:56.026
and from that we can calculate
the pH.

00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:01.000
It would be 14 minus this,
and the pH is 8.226.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.075
That is greater than seven,
so that makes sense.

00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:16.505
We can draw that up here.
We have 8.26 at the equivalence

00:17:16.505 --> 00:17:21.473
point.
And that is greater than 7,

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:29.000
which is what we expect.
It should be basic.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.116
Now, a lot of people forget,
because they are going quickly,

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:36.813
to convert from pOH to pH.
And that should be a way to

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:39.674
double-check.
If you find out that you are

00:17:39.674 --> 00:17:43.232
the equivalence point and the pH
is less than seven,

00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:45.674
you realize that something is
wrong.

00:17:45.674 --> 00:17:49.023
And hopefully you will remember
to convert, then,

00:17:49.023 --> 00:17:50.767
to pH.
Greater than seven.

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:53.488
All right.
Beyond the equivalence point,

00:17:53.488 --> 00:17:59.000
so the last kind of point that
you may have in a curve up here.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.842
Beyond the equivalence point,
you still have your conjugate

00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:06.619
base hanging out and you still
have all that you had here,

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:10.196
but that was not making the
solution really very basic.

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:12.979
There wasn't much.
It was like 10^-6 molar.

00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:16.556
There was not much of it.
And so the pH is really going

00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:20.200
to be determined only by the
amount of excess OH that is

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.513
added to the solution.
Now you can forget all about

00:18:23.513 --> 00:18:27.422
your weak acids and weak bases
at this pint and just look at

00:18:27.422 --> 00:18:31.000
this problem as a strong base
problem.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.812
You are swamping the system
with your excess strong base.

00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:40.882
This kind of problem at the
end, past the equivalence point,

00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:45.523
is going to be a strong acid,
strong base type problem.

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:48.531
In this case,
a strong base problem.

00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:53.601
We know how to do this already.
We talked about this before.

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:57.984
If you are 5 mLs beyond,
and you say 5 mLs times the

00:18:57.984 --> 00:19:01.765
concentration,
so you have 7.5x10^-4 moles of

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:06.077
excess base.
The only trick to this problem

00:19:06.077 --> 00:19:09.886
is remembering the entire volume
that you have in there.

00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:13.626
You know how many moles you
have, and it is 5 mLs past,

00:19:13.626 --> 00:19:17.573
you had 25 mLs to begin with,
you added 16.7 to get to the

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.897
equivalence point,
add those together and you can

00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:24.567
get the concentration.
Now, remember the concentration

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:29.000
we had at the equivalence point
of OH was like 10^-6.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.338
That is still around,
but if you add something of

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:38.941
10^-6 to this number it is not
significantly going to change it

00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:42.104
at all.
You can ignore that and only

00:19:42.104 --> 00:19:47.075
consider the concentration of
the OH that is due to that

00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:51.233
excess strong base added and
calculate the pOH,

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:56.113
and then from that the pH.
Our final point on the curve

00:19:56.113 --> 00:20:00.000
then, somewhere up here,
12.21.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.946
And this is 5 mLs beyond the
equivalence point.

00:20:03.946 --> 00:20:08.751
There we have a titration
curve, where we have calculated

00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:13.813
various points along the way.
The point to remember in doing

00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:19.133
these problems is that you just
need to break down each part of

00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:23.766
the curve and define it as a
different type of problem.

00:20:23.766 --> 00:20:29.000
Here we started out and we did
a weak acid problem.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.495
Then we were in the buffering
region and we did a buffer

00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:34.974
problem.
We had this special category of

00:20:34.974 --> 00:20:38.088
buffer when we were at the half
equivalence point.

00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:41.711
And then we moved up here.
All the weak acid was converted

00:20:41.711 --> 00:20:45.016
to weak base at this point,
so it is just a weak base

00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:47.495
problem.
And then beyond the equivalence

00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:49.593
point it is a strong base
problem.

00:20:49.593 --> 00:20:52.580
The titration curve,
this is why it takes a long

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.250
time to do these,
because it is really many

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.000
problems all wrapped up into one
problem.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.711
And the other thing to
remember, especially if you are

00:21:01.711 --> 00:21:04.678
given different subsections,
is you are not always going to

00:21:04.678 --> 00:21:06.519
be working through it
systematically.

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:09.026
You may be asked to start here
or start down here.

00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:12.146
And so you always have to ask
yourself what kind of problem is

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:13.681
this?
And I tell people who are

00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:16.750
grading the exam that if you
write on the top of the problem,

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.871
this is really a buffer problem
or this is a weak base problem

00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:22.531
at the equivalence point,
if you write something down

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.293
that tells me that you know what
type of problem it is,

00:21:25.293 --> 00:21:28.414
that is worth some points right
there, even if you get lost in

00:21:28.414 --> 00:21:31.792
the math.
If you think about these in a

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:35.624
way that will help you do them,
it also might give you a little

00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:37.911
partial credit on the test.
All right.

00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:40.693
Again, there are just these
types of problems.

00:21:40.693 --> 00:21:44.278
And it is a matter of picking
and choosing and putting them

00:21:44.278 --> 00:21:46.935
all together.
There are not a huge number of

00:21:46.935 --> 00:21:49.779
types of problems,
but it is hard sometimes for

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:53.364
people to figure out where they
are, and which one of these

00:21:53.364 --> 00:21:54.971
things to apply.
All right.

00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:58.000
That moves into today's
handout.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.630
I am going to start today's
handout finishing acid-base.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.469
And I did this for the first
time last year,

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:08.562
this kind of little cheat sheet
on how to solve these problems.

00:22:08.562 --> 00:22:11.202
And I will write this stuff on
the board.

00:22:11.202 --> 00:22:14.833
And as maybe some of you
remember, I mentioned that last

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:18.794
year we had the best performance
on acid-base that I think we

00:22:18.794 --> 00:22:21.501
have seen in 5.111 for a really
long time.

00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:25.000
People did really,
really well on this.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.083
And so I would like to continue
that trend of having fantastic

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:34.833
acid-base titration answers,
where there are little smiley

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:39.750
faces drawn on the exams where
everything is really perfect.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.666
Let's see if we can keep this
going.

00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:45.916
All right.
Let's work on our cheat sheet

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:51.250
and how you go about solving all
the different kinds of problems.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.833
First we will just quickly
review this type,

00:22:54.833 --> 00:23:00.000
the weak acid being titrated
with a strong base.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.329
Let's consider now,
we will work backwards through

00:23:06.329 --> 00:23:12.270
this, when we are beyond the
equivalence point.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.825
And I guess I should say,
this is weak acid,

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:20.020
strong base.
Okay.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:27.770
Beyond the equivalence point,
then, is a strong base problem,

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:34.096
as we just did.
It is really due to the excess

00:23:34.096 --> 00:23:39.359
strong base that we had.
We would solve this problem

00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:42.971
saying, okay,
the extra strong base,

00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:48.544
and that is the number of
moles, over the total volume.

00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:54.633
And that is going to give you
the concentration of hydroxide

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:58.039
ion.
And then you can find pOH and

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:03.163
then pH.
That is how you would do that

00:24:03.163 --> 00:24:07.745
category of problem here.
Let's move, then,

00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:13.418
to volume equals the volume at
the equivalence point.

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:19.854
And this is a salt problem that
gets broken down into a weak

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:24.436
base problem,
because now we have converted

00:24:24.436 --> 00:24:30.000
all our weak acid into its
conjugate base.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.741
This is an A minus plus
H2O going to HA plus OH minus

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:42.359
type problem.

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:47.977
And we would use Kb,
because we are talking about a

00:24:47.977 --> 00:24:52.696
base in water,
to find the concentration of

00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:57.528
hydroxide ions.
Then you would calculate pOH

00:24:57.528 --> 00:25:00.000
and then pH.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.288
And you should know how to
write an equation out for all

00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:13.653
the types of problems you are
doing.

00:25:13.653 --> 00:25:18.653
It will help you figure out
what you are doing in the

00:25:18.653 --> 00:25:22.019
problem.
When your volume equals the

00:25:22.019 --> 00:25:26.923
volume at the half equivalence
point, pH equals pKa.

00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:33.492
And that is really it.
You might have to find pKa from

00:25:33.492 --> 00:25:38.000
Ka, but that is pretty
straightforward.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.072
Now, when you are in the
buffering region,

00:25:47.072 --> 00:25:53.132
again, the buffering region is
where the pH titration curve is

00:25:53.132 --> 00:25:58.000
in the flat region.
This is a buffer problem.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.016
And here mostly you want to try
to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:26:04.016 --> 00:26:09.842
equation, pH equals pKa minus
the log of HA divided by A minus

00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:14.426
of your weak acid and
the conjugate base.

00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:20.348
And you can use this if the

00:26:20.348 --> 00:26:23.977
5% rule applies,
but that usually does,

00:26:23.977 --> 00:26:29.612
so that is probably going to be
your first route to do these

00:26:29.612 --> 00:26:33.969
calculations.
Again, you have to find the

00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:37.835
concentrations of these.
You have to remember that the

00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:42.285
amount of strong base you are
adding is converting some of the

00:26:42.285 --> 00:26:46.370
weak acid to the conjugate.
You need to find out how much

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.580
gets converted,
find these concentrations and

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.103
then plug it into this equation.
This equation only works for a

00:26:54.103 --> 00:26:57.865
buffer problem.
And I also just want to say

00:26:57.865 --> 00:27:01.735
that every once in a while,
people decide instead of pKa,

00:27:01.735 --> 00:27:04.845
let's rewrite this equation for
a pKb instead.

00:27:04.845 --> 00:27:07.333
Don't do that.
That is my little tip.

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:10.304
It has been tried,
and it has never actually

00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:13.069
succeeded in yielding the
correct answer.

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:15.626
If someone wants to say,
on this test,

00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:19.565
I will come up with this new
equation using pKb and I will

00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:23.227
prove that we can get it,
you can do that if you want,

00:27:23.227 --> 00:27:27.304
but I think it is best to stick
with this equation just from

00:27:27.304 --> 00:27:30.696
previous experience.
Okay.

00:27:30.696 --> 00:27:35.153
Then, lastly,
volume equals zero,

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:42.814
so this is a weak acid problem.
And a weak acid problem,

00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:49.639
you have your acid in water
going to hydronium ion

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:54.932
concentrations and your
conjugate base.

00:27:54.932 --> 00:28:02.453
You are going to use Ka,
the acid equilibrium constant,

00:28:02.453 --> 00:28:09.000
to find hydronium ion
concentration.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.160
And then from that you can
calculate pH.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:18.493
Those are the different ways
that that breaks down.

00:28:18.493 --> 00:28:25.000
Now let's do the same thing for
a weak base, strong acid.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.447
And I will move that onto the
next.

00:28:34.447 --> 00:28:38.909
To start with,
start at the top of the chart.

00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:43.674
Here, in the beginning,
when volume equals zero,

00:28:43.674 --> 00:28:49.454
all you have is your weak base.
And then, as you add acid,

00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:53.611
the pH is going to drop.
In the beginning,

00:28:53.611 --> 00:29:00.000
when volume equals zero,
this is a weak base problem.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.590
And so you can draw that as
your base in water going to the

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.439
conjugate acid and hydroxide ion
concentration.

00:29:06.439 --> 00:29:09.906
Now you are going to use Kb,

00:29:09.906 --> 00:29:13.125
the base ionization equilibrium
constant, to find the

00:29:13.125 --> 00:29:15.230
concentration of OH minus.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.769
Then you can calculate pOH,
and from that,

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:20.183
calculate pH.
Next, we will consider the

00:29:20.183 --> 00:29:23.774
buffering region when the volume
is in between zero and the

00:29:23.774 --> 00:29:27.180
volume at the equivalence point.
And so this is a buffer

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.161
problem.
Again, I recommend using

00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:33.000
Henderson-Hasselbalch as written
with pKa.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:47.682
And so here you need to know
the concentration of the

00:29:47.682 --> 00:30:02.647
conjugate acid over the
concentration of the weak base

00:30:02.647 --> 00:30:14.788
that you had.
And so you can use this if the

00:30:14.788 --> 00:30:21.000
5% rule applies.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
And you can check that by
calculating.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.022
This will also work.
Now, remember.

00:30:32.022 --> 00:30:33.331
you are starting.
then.

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:36.247
with your weak base.
You have converted some of it

00:30:36.247 --> 00:30:39.221
to the conjugate acid.
depending on how much strong

00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:42.196
acid you have added.
Before you can plug in numbers

00:30:42.196 --> 00:30:45.707
here, you have to subtract how
many moles of the strong acid

00:30:45.707 --> 00:30:49.098
were added, so that means,
how many moles of the weak base

00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.954
do you have left,
how many moles of the conjugate

00:30:51.954 --> 00:30:56.000
acid have been formed.
Again, we are in this region.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.629
If you had, say,
four molecules to begin with,

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:03.258
and you added one molecule of
the strong acid,

00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:07.693
then you would be left with
three and you would have one

00:31:07.693 --> 00:31:10.596
converted.
These problems all involve

00:31:10.596 --> 00:31:14.951
subtractions before you can plug
in your numbers to the

00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:19.387
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
Then we have the special

00:31:19.387 --> 00:31:24.225
category of buffer where your
volume equals the volume at the

00:31:24.225 --> 00:31:28.580
half equivalence point.
Again, you can just solve this.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:33.000
pH equals pKa.
If you are given a Kb,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.454
you will have to convert to a
Ka to find your pKa,

00:31:37.454 --> 00:31:40.000
but this will still work.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.478
Maybe I will write on this next
board.

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:57.333
Then your volume at the
equivalence point.

00:31:57.333 --> 00:32:01.000
And this is,
again, a salt problem.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.416
But the salt problem breaks
down to a weak acid problem

00:32:05.416 --> 00:32:10.405
because when you have a strong
acid, its conjugate is neutral.

00:32:10.405 --> 00:32:14.985
And if you have a weak base,
its conjugate is also a weak

00:32:14.985 --> 00:32:17.929
acid.
The salt that is formed in this

00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:23.000
problem is going to be acidic.
We can write that down.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.355
We have our conjugate acid that
has formed as a result of the

00:32:38.355 --> 00:32:44.922
titration in water forming the
conjugate base and hydronium ion

00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:49.158
concentrations.
Now we can use Ka to find

00:32:49.158 --> 00:32:55.196
hydronium ion concentration,
and then we can calculate pH.

00:32:55.196 --> 00:33:01.127
Again, at the equivalence
point, you converted all of the

00:33:01.127 --> 00:33:06.000
weak base you had down to weak
acid.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.326
You have added enough acid that
it has protonated all of the

00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:14.140
weak base you have and now all
you have left is acid,

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.440
so it is really just an acid in
water problem.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.299
And then, finally,
if you are beyond the

00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:23.893
equivalence point,
now you are just pouring excess

00:33:23.893 --> 00:33:26.533
acid in.
And so this is a strong acid

00:33:26.533 --> 00:33:30.441
problem.
You still will have a little

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:35.498
acid solution left from the
titration, but that is going to

00:33:35.498 --> 00:33:39.247
be overwhelmed by the amount of
strong acid.

00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:44.130
You can solve that by just
saying how many extra moles of

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.008
strong acid over the total
volume.

00:33:47.008 --> 00:33:52.239
And that is going to give you
hydronium ion concentration and

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:57.209
then you can calculate pH.
At this point it is just a very

00:33:57.209 --> 00:34:02.232
simple calculation.
The only tricky part is to

00:34:02.232 --> 00:34:06.783
figure out the total volume,
to get that number right.

00:34:06.783 --> 00:34:12.022
That is the cheat sheet which
should help lead you through the

00:34:12.022 --> 00:34:16.659
rest of the problem set and also
problems for the exam.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:21.124
Let's do a little bit,
we have just a little bit that

00:34:21.124 --> 00:34:25.504
I want to do today on
oxidation-reduction reactions.

00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:31.000
And so this is the next unit
that we are moving into.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.917
And today we are just going to
talk in the last 15 minutes

00:34:34.917 --> 00:34:38.559
about some simple rules for
doing oxidation-reduction.

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:41.445
We are also moving away from
the acid-base,

00:34:41.445 --> 00:34:45.500
but you will find there are a
lot of parallels between these

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.561
units.
We are still going to be

00:34:47.561 --> 00:34:49.966
talking about equilibrium
constants.

00:34:49.966 --> 00:34:53.677
We are still going to be
talking about delta G as we go

00:34:53.677 --> 00:34:56.151
along.
This is another application of

00:34:56.151 --> 00:35:00.000
thermodynamics and chemical
equilibrium.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.273
There are some rules to start
with.

00:35:03.273 --> 00:35:07.027
Most of them are actually
pretty simple.

00:35:07.027 --> 00:35:12.226
And you need to know what these
rules are for assigning

00:35:12.226 --> 00:35:15.788
oxidation numbers.
Here are the rules.

00:35:15.788 --> 00:35:21.180
If you have a free element,
the oxidation number is going

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.742
to be zero.
If you have ions then your

00:35:24.742 --> 00:35:28.785
oxidation number,
here is lithium plus one.

00:35:28.785 --> 00:35:33.553
You have an oxidation number of

00:35:33.553 --> 00:35:38.332
plus one, so the oxidation
number is equal to the charge on

00:35:38.332 --> 00:35:41.380
the atom.
And we find that Group 1 are

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:46.323
always going to have plus one,
Group 2 metals on the periodic

00:35:46.323 --> 00:35:51.267
table are always going to be
plus two, and aluminum is always

00:35:51.267 --> 00:35:55.468
going to be plus three.
Those are the ones that will

00:35:55.468 --> 00:36:00.000
help guide you through doing
these problems.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.913
Oxygen is a little bit more
tricky, but it almost always

00:36:04.913 --> 00:36:07.951
minus two.
The only exception is in

00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:11.792
peroxides, where you have a
minus one state.

00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:16.974
This will also help you in
solving a lot of these problems,

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:22.334
but you are actually going to
have a couple of examples where

00:36:22.334 --> 00:36:27.247
oxygen is a bit different.
Hydrogen also is usually plus

00:36:27.247 --> 00:36:33.375
one, but there are exceptions.
And you will actually see a

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:36.278
number of exceptions in this
unit.

00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:41.205
You should know that in these
particular cases it will be

00:36:41.205 --> 00:36:44.724
minus one.
Here we have Group 1 and Group

00:36:44.724 --> 00:36:47.715
2 metals which will always be
plus.

00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:51.410
And so in this case,
hydrogen is minus one.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:56.249
Fluorine is always minus one.
Other halogens are usually

00:36:56.249 --> 00:37:01.000
minus one, but there are some
exceptions.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.880
When you combine it with oxygen
you have an exception to that.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.519
And so then you could have a
different oxidation state when

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:13.079
it is combined in these
oxoacids.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:17.480
And so then you would have a
positive oxidation state or

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.639
oxidation number.
All right.

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:23.880
Things need to add up.
In neutral molecules the sum of

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.000
all the oxidation numbers needs
to be equal to zero.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.429
If you have a polyatomic anion,
the sum of the oxidation

00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:40.254
numbers needs to add up to the
net charge on that particular

00:37:40.254 --> 00:37:43.512
ion.
You need to be able to sum to

00:37:43.512 --> 00:37:47.264
get the overall charge of the
molecule.

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:50.719
All right.
Let's look at an example,

00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:56.050
NH four plus.
What would the oxidation number

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:04.347
of hydrogen be in this case?
It will be plus one here.

00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:08.000
What about nitrogen?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.776
And so the sum needs to add up.
And so if you have four plus

00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:26.748
1s, minus 3, gives you plus 1.
There is one

00:38:26.748 --> 00:38:29.000
example.
All right.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.921
Another rule is that they don't
always have to be integers.

00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:38.418
Most of the time they are,
but the oxidation number of

00:38:38.418 --> 00:38:43.000
oxygen in O two minus one
would be what?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.939
Minus a half for each
individual oxygen atom in there.

00:38:51.939 --> 00:38:55.655
That is kind of one of the only
exceptions to this.

00:38:55.655 --> 00:38:59.000
You won't see this very often.
All right.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.355
Let's look at a couple more
examples to get you used to

00:39:04.355 --> 00:39:09.512
doing these problems.
And I will just erase this part

00:39:09.512 --> 00:39:11.000
right here.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.750
Okay.
Let's look at lithium two oxide.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.708
What is oxygen going to be in

00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:28.354
this compound?
It will be minus two,

00:39:28.354 --> 00:39:34.395
and lithium will be plus one.
Lithium is always going to be

00:39:34.395 --> 00:39:37.616
plus one.
And so if we have plus 2 minus

00:39:37.616 --> 00:39:41.415
2 that gives us 0,
which is the overall charge.

00:39:41.415 --> 00:39:45.380
There was no charge.
That was a neutral molecule,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.766
so that worked out.
Let's look at PCl five.

00:39:48.766 --> 00:39:52.070
What is chloride going to be in

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.722
this case?
Minus one.

00:39:53.722 --> 00:39:57.852
We have 5 times minus 1.
What does that give us for

00:39:57.852 --> 00:40:00.544
phosphorus?
Plus 5.

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:05.051
You will actually find in this
unit on oxidation-reduction,

00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:09.093
we are going to go into
balancing oxidation-reduction

00:40:09.093 --> 00:40:11.968
equations, too,
and oxidation numbers,

00:40:11.968 --> 00:40:15.310
it is counting.
This unit, lots of counting.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.041
It may be a little break.
I think people find the

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:23.471
acid-base titrations a little
bit more, they have to think

00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:25.103
more.
Here, you count,

00:40:25.103 --> 00:40:30.000
so that might be a little nice
relief coming up.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.962
Okay.
HNO three,

00:40:32.962 --> 00:40:39.382
what would be oxygen?
Minus two, and we have three of

00:40:39.382 --> 00:40:43.580
those.
What is hydrogen going to be

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.308
here?
Plus one.

00:40:45.308 --> 00:40:49.753
What does that leave us for
nitrogen?

00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:55.679
Plus five, right,
to get our overall sum equal to

00:40:55.679 --> 00:41:00.000
zero.
And one last one.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.033
N two O.
What is oxygen here?

00:41:03.033 --> 00:41:06.235
Minus two.
What does that mean nitrogen

00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:07.837
has to be?
Plus one.

00:41:07.837 --> 00:41:12.808
Two plus one to give us zero.
See, nitrogen can have lots of

00:41:12.808 --> 00:41:16.516
different numbers.
And a number of atoms can.

00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:21.320
That is why knowing some things
in the rules about oxygen,

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.292
chloride and other things will
help you figure out then what

00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:30.792
that other molecule has to be.
All right.

00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:33.247
Here are the whole set of
rules.

00:41:33.247 --> 00:41:35.544
Okay.
Oops, going in the wrong

00:41:35.544 --> 00:41:37.128
direction.
All right.

00:41:37.128 --> 00:41:39.584
Let's look at a few
definitions.

00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:43.782
Oxidation, most of these should
be familiar to people.

00:41:43.782 --> 00:41:47.504
Oxidation means that you are
losing an electron.

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:51.306
Reduction means that you are
gaining an electron.

00:41:51.306 --> 00:41:56.138
And then we have an oxidizing
agent, and an oxidizing agent is

00:41:56.138 --> 00:42:02.000
something that accepts electrons
and gets reduced itself.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.758
And a reducing agent is
something that is going to

00:42:05.758 --> 00:42:08.904
donate the electrons,
give electrons away,

00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:13.123
so it itself becomes oxidized.
And these two terms often

00:42:13.123 --> 00:42:16.882
confuse people because an
oxidizing agent goes and

00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:20.487
oxidizes other things,
but it itself is reduced,

00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:25.167
so it is an agent of oxidation.
It is running around trying to

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:30.000
oxidize other things.
That is the part to remember.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.119
Sometimes people get these
parts backwards.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:37.427
These are really a lot of the
definitions you need to know.

00:42:37.427 --> 00:42:41.214
There are not so many
definitions in this particular

00:42:41.214 --> 00:42:43.888
unit.
One other term that you need to

00:42:43.888 --> 00:42:47.676
be familiar with in here is
these disproportionation

00:42:47.676 --> 00:42:50.201
reactions.
And so, like we saw with

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:54.732
acid-base where we could have
something that could serve as an

00:42:54.732 --> 00:43:00.267
acid and a base is amphoteric.
We also find that you can have

00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:04.198
an element that can be both
oxidized and reduced in a

00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:07.902
particular reaction.
We saw that with acid-base we

00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:12.514
had water plus water going to
hydronium ion and hydroxide ion,

00:43:12.514 --> 00:43:17.200
where one molecule of water was
acting as an acid and the other

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.904
was acting as a base.
A similar kind of idea here,

00:43:20.904 --> 00:43:25.062
but in this case we are having
one thing be oxidized and

00:43:25.062 --> 00:43:27.632
reduced.
Let's take a quick look at

00:43:27.632 --> 00:43:30.203
that.
We can break this down to two

00:43:30.203 --> 00:43:35.547
different equations.
And sodium is a spectator ion.

00:43:35.547 --> 00:43:40.641
Poor sodium really doesn't get
to do much of anything in both

00:43:40.641 --> 00:43:45.311
this unit and the last unit.
And we are only focusing on

00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:49.386
these species here.
You are going to have one ClO

00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:53.971
minus going to ClO
three minus and

00:43:53.971 --> 00:43:57.113
another one going to Cl 
minus.

00:43:57.113 --> 00:44:02.288
What is happening here?
Let's take a look at what is

00:44:02.288 --> 00:44:05.313
happening.
Let's look at the oxidation

00:44:05.313 --> 00:44:08.419
numbers.
Oxygen here will be minus two.

00:44:08.419 --> 00:44:11.525
What does that leave for this
chloride?

00:44:11.525 --> 00:44:15.694
If we write that out,
it all has to be equal to one.

00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:19.700
That would be plus one.
And let's consider what is

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.051
going on over here.
Again, this minus two,

00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:27.138
three of them here.
And it all needs to be equal to

00:44:27.138 --> 00:44:32.612
minus one over here.
What does that leave for this?

00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:36.878
We have plus five.
We are going from plus one here

00:44:36.878 --> 00:44:40.535
to plus five.
And so this particular guy is

00:44:40.535 --> 00:44:44.279
being oxidized.
It is losing electrons here.

00:44:44.279 --> 00:44:48.546
Now let's look down here.
We already did this one.

00:44:48.546 --> 00:44:51.506
It is the same.
We are at plus one.

00:44:51.506 --> 00:44:54.467
And here we are going to minus
one.

00:44:54.467 --> 00:44:59.255
We have this particular guy
going from plus one to minus

00:44:59.255 --> 00:45:05.296
one, so it is being reduced.
You have the same chloride in

00:45:05.296 --> 00:45:10.205
both cases, but in one reaction
it is being oxidized and in the

00:45:10.205 --> 00:45:14.085
other it is being reduced.
That is an example of a

00:45:14.085 --> 00:45:18.994
disproportionation reaction and
also another example of how you

00:45:18.994 --> 00:45:22.002
look at what the oxidation
numbers are.

00:45:22.002 --> 00:45:25.011
All right.
Let's see if we can actually

00:45:25.011 --> 00:45:30.000
get through some of this,
these balancing reactions.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.235
How many people have seen
balancing oxidation-reduction

00:45:34.235 --> 00:45:36.823
reactions before?
A lot of people.

00:45:36.823 --> 00:45:40.901
Again, it is counting.
I think we can go through this

00:45:40.901 --> 00:45:44.117
very fast.
You have to consider whether an

00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:48.588
acid solution or basic solution
at least some of the time.

00:45:48.588 --> 00:45:52.980
Let's do acid solution first.
You can take this and write

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.960
your unbalanced equations out
for this.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.960
Break it down into two halves
and figure out what is

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.375
happening.
Again, here we have minus 2

00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:10.250
times 7.
And it all has to be minus two.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:15.125
This oxidation would be what?
6 times 2.

00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:19.250
We are plus 6 to plus 3 over
here.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.750
Plus 6 to plus 3,
and so we have a reduction.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:30.000
We are going down in number
here.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.372
And so this one is the
reduction, and that is good

00:46:33.372 --> 00:46:36.675
because over here we have plus
two to plus three,

00:46:36.675 --> 00:46:39.565
so we have our oxidation in the
other part.

00:46:39.565 --> 00:46:42.868
You are always going to have
oxidation-reduction.

00:46:42.868 --> 00:46:46.860
You will always have something
being oxidized and something

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.094
else being reduced.
Now we have to balance this.

00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:54.154
And so the first thing you are
going to do, you are going to

00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:57.733
look and insert coefficients to
balance the elements,

00:46:57.733 --> 00:47:02.000
except for oxygen and hydrogen,
on both sides.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.162
Do we need to do something up
here?

00:47:05.162 --> 00:47:07.767
If so, what?
Multiply by two.

00:47:07.767 --> 00:47:10.465
What about down here?
Nothing.

00:47:10.465 --> 00:47:14.837
Now we are going to add water
to balance oxygen.

00:47:14.837 --> 00:47:18.837
Again, we only need to worry
about one side.

00:47:18.837 --> 00:47:24.325
There are seven oxygens here,
so we have to add seven waters

00:47:24.325 --> 00:47:30.000
on the other side.
We have our seven waters here.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.535
Now we want to balance
hydrogens.

00:47:32.535 --> 00:47:37.210
And you can add H plus.
The book uses hydronium ion,

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:41.726
which makes it much harder,
so I suggest you don't do that

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:46.401
and just add H plus.
If you just add H plus,

00:47:46.401 --> 00:47:51.076
how much do you need to add?
You need to add 14 to the other

00:47:51.076 --> 00:47:53.453
side.
Again, nothing down here.

00:47:53.453 --> 00:47:59.000
And so now you need to balance
charge by adding electrons.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.428
In this case it is going to be
plus six because we have 14

00:48:04.428 --> 00:48:10.238
minus two on this side and we
have this six on the other side.

00:48:10.238 --> 00:48:14.238
And then over here,
what do we have to add?

00:48:14.238 --> 00:48:18.142
We just have to add one.
Now we take this,

00:48:18.142 --> 00:48:23.190
and we need to multiply the
reactions so the number of

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:29.000
electrons are equal.
We would multiply by six here.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.528
And now our electrons are
equal.

00:48:31.528 --> 00:48:34.139
The electrons have to cancel
out.

00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:37.647
If they don't you have done
something wrong.

00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:41.644
Now we add and make the
appropriate cancellations.

00:48:41.644 --> 00:48:46.376
Here is the whole equation.
And we should be able to cancel

00:48:46.376 --> 00:48:49.802
out electrons.
If we don't we did something

00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:52.821
wrong.
And can we cancel anything else

00:48:52.821 --> 00:48:54.044
out?
Not really.

00:48:54.044 --> 00:48:57.634
You want to double-check that
it is balanced.

00:48:57.634 --> 00:49:01.146
14 Hs here.
Two chromiums.

00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:05.980
The seven oxygens and the six
irons, that is the same on the

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.338
other side, the same charge on
both sides.

00:49:09.338 --> 00:49:13.025
And then, finally,
if it is in basic solution,

00:49:13.025 --> 00:49:16.138
all we are going to do,
the same steps,

00:49:16.138 --> 00:49:20.070
is adjust the pH by adding OH.
If we had 14 plus,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:24.658
we would add 14 OHs and then
come along and you would add

00:49:24.658 --> 00:49:29.000
those up.
And then you can cancel again.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.613
And so now, instead of having H
plus,

00:49:32.613 --> 00:49:35.898
we have OH.
And so in acidic solution you

00:49:35.898 --> 00:49:40.496
would have H plus,
and in basic solution you have

00:49:40.496 --> 00:49:42.221
OH.
That is balancing.

00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:46.409
It is pretty simple.
You just have to make sure that

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:47.675
everything adds up.
