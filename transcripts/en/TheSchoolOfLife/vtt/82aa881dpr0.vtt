00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.320
For most of human history, what we did for
a living was decided for us by our families.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.290
We would either directly copy what our parents
did, or else we would reverentially accept

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.130
their suggestions for what we might do. Only
for around the last 200 years have we been

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.360
choosing jobs for ourselves – and we’re
still at the dawn of learning some of the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.890
complexities involved. On the surface, most
families claim to have no interest in their

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.429
children doing any job in particular. The
standard line is that they simply want us

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:41.239
to be happy. But we are not as free as this
sounds. We are always hemmed in by what can

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.780
be termed ‘family work scripts’, scripts
that guide us – often very subtly but also

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.749
very heavily – towards certain occupations
and away from others. Part of properly growing

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.579
up – which may sometimes happen only in
one’s 50s – involves learning to find

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.830
a way round the scripts we’ve been handed.
At the most benign level, our family work

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.640
scripts are the result of what our families
understand of the working world. Every family

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.071
has a range of occupations that it grasps,
because someone has practiced them and in

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:23.230
the process brought them within the imaginative
range of other family members. Yet it isn’t

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.970
just a case that our families might not know
about certain jobs and so cut us off from

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.500
them. They might also be positively hostile
or suspicious of other jobs. We’re liable

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.780
to have received many little messages indicating
that certain careers are inferior – and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.140
therefore beneath us, dangerous, phoney or
not quite right for our sort of station in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.550
life. Whatever lip service might be paid to
gender equality, families are also highly

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.610
talented at sending out covert messages about
what a ‘real’ man or a ‘real’ woman

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.650
should honourably do. Yet more darkly, families
may say that they want us to succeed, but

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.540
would be highly threatened if we did so. A
choice we make might remind someone of one

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.390
of their failed ambitions. Our success might
make them feel like a failure. We might try

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.300
to sabotage our chances of winning so as not
to leave a loved one feeling crushed. Often

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.030
without realising it, we are being heavily
controlled by our families. Controlled not

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.860
by harsh words but by something far more poignant
and yet far harder to extricate ourselves

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.709
from: by our ongoing desire to be a good child,
to please those who brought us into this world,

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:51.470
by love. Love can control us as much as force
or the law ever did. We are liable to try

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.989
to be good children not just because we feel
love but because we fear losing love, because

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.560
we live in dread of being cast out if we were
to dare to what we really want. But here is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.840
the good news for timid good children. Parents
very rarely disown their progeny. It certainly

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.920
seems they might in our imaginations forged
in childhood. But the adult reality is that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.310
families are extremely good at threatening
to break apart, but then forgiving one another,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.739
and accommodating the most extraordinary challenges
and tests. We can’t know all families, but

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.029
we can guess that almost anyone could do a
lot more than they think, a lot more that

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:41.580
might be a bit ‘bad’ in the eyes of the
elders, and still be forgiven. We owe our

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.469
parents respect and kindness. We do not owe
them our lives. We should dare, when the pressure

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.980
has become unbearable, to leave their script
aside.
