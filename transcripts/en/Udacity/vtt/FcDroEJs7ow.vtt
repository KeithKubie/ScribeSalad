00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.270
Alright so this first of, Bjorn's questions, I'll just read it word

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.830
for word because this is coming straight from the instructor of the

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.380
course. so at first sight, current physics seems to be concerned with

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.910
sophisticated mathematics. Like Riemannian manifolds, self-adjoint

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.552
operators, path integrals over anti-commuting spaces

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:16.630
[LAUGH].

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.555
But, wouldn't it be fair to say that most of this higher mathematics in the end

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.400
boils down to differential equations. Even if we're

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.132
dealing with elementary particles or with the entire universe.

00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:30.510
&gt;&gt; It almost always has to do with differential equations. it, let

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.930
me take back one phrase, Almost. It always has to do with

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.010
differential equations, yes. It may be

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.220
that other things, other mathematical things

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.000
are more important than the differential equations in this particular area or

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.971
that particular area. But it always has to do with differential equations, yes.

00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.400
&gt;&gt; Why is that? Why is it that differential equations become the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.860
&gt;&gt; Because what we're interested in is how things vary. You know where physics

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.500
is about It's prediction. Basically, to predict

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.580
the future from the present or the future

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.750
from the past and that means understanding

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.630
how things change. And you not only want

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.420
to understand how they change with time,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.100
but you want to understand how they change

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.300
with space. You, like for example, you want to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.960
predict the weather. Alright we theoretical physicists usually

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.230
don't predict the weather. But they do predict similar kinds

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.700
of things. How do you predict the weather? Well the first

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330
thing you have to know is called an initial condition. You

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.980
have to know what the weather is exactly every wheres on

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.410
the earth. What does that mean? That means you need to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.760
know the pressure, you need to know the temperature. Whatever it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.630
is, you need to know the wind velocity, and these are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.470
all a bunch of things which vary from place to place.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.420
So, the first thing you have to input is the conditions at an instant of

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.730
time. Now, you want to know how they change. How do they change? They change by

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.980
little incremental changes from instant to instant. And

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.460
the incremental changes at one position depend on

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.060
what's going on in the region nearby that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.520
one position. Whenever you have a situation where

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.010
the change in something depends on what's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.260
going on nearby, that's a partial differential

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.560
equation. That's a partial. So whenever you're

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.570
in the business of predicting how the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.050
world changes. Or how some part of the world changes both with respect to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.710
position and with respect to time, you're

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.950
in the business of partial differential equations.
