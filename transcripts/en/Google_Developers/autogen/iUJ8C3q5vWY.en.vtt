so let's dive into it let's do it so

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
so let's dive into it let's do it so
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.940
so let's dive into it let's do it so
this is called Avery design and print

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
this is called Avery design and print
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.179

app for Google Drive and on our first

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189
app for Google Drive and on our first
 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.359
app for Google Drive and on our first
screen this is a web-based release we

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369
screen this is a web-based release we
 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.800
screen this is a web-based release we
could either pick between a Google

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810
could either pick between a Google
 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.469
could either pick between a Google
spreadsheet or Google contacts so let's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479
spreadsheet or Google contacts so let's
 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.660
spreadsheet or Google contacts so let's
say that I pick spreadsheet then I hit

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
say that I pick spreadsheet then I hit
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.660
say that I pick spreadsheet then I hit
the next button very simple interface

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
 
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.280
 
it shows a list of all the spreadsheets

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290
it shows a list of all the spreadsheets
 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.430
it shows a list of all the spreadsheets
that I have in my own google drive and

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440
that I have in my own google drive and
 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.449
that I have in my own google drive and
so i'll just pick one of these called

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
so i'll just pick one of these called
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.000
so i'll just pick one of these called
address list i have to press a button

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
address list i have to press a button
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.699
address list i have to press a button
here so that i can run apps script that

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709
here so that i can run apps script that
 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.830
here so that i can run apps script that
will actually parse that spreadsheet and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
will actually parse that spreadsheet and
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.090
will actually parse that spreadsheet and
convert it into a csv stream and once

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
convert it into a csv stream and once
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.380
convert it into a csv stream and once
I've done that there will be a little

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390
I've done that there will be a little
 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.340
I've done that there will be a little
spinner it finishes and if I hit the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
spinner it finishes and if I hit the
 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.070
spinner it finishes and if I hit the
merge button I'll actually be taking

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
merge button I'll actually be taking
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.620
merge button I'll actually be taking
that data into our website for emerged

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
that data into our website for emerged
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.260
that data into our website for emerged
but what I'd rather do is show that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
but what I'd rather do is show that
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.410
but what I'd rather do is show that
second step with contacts so we'll just

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
second step with contacts so we'll just
 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.930
second step with contacts so we'll just
back up here and we'll do the same

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
back up here and we'll do the same
 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.360
back up here and we'll do the same
process will start with contacts instead

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
process will start with contacts instead
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.220

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300
simply disable the ones you don't want
 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.039
simply disable the ones you don't want
to merge and then you can go on at this

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049
to merge and then you can go on at this
 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.660
to merge and then you can go on at this
step we are allowing you to do a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670
step we are allowing you to do a
 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.520
step we are allowing you to do a
drag-and-drop interface so that you can

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530
drag-and-drop interface so that you can
 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.310
drag-and-drop interface so that you can
specify where you want the fields from

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320
specify where you want the fields from
 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.380
specify where you want the fields from
that contact list to show up and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390
that contact list to show up and

typically just be name address and i can
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.730
typically just be name address and i can
drag over country and so these fields

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740
drag over country and so these fields
 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.040
drag over country and so these fields
are filled in and the merge will be

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050
are filled in and the merge will be
 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.720
are filled in and the merge will be
completed and i will go to the design

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730
completed and i will go to the design
 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.550
completed and i will go to the design
canvas and you can see the actual data

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560
canvas and you can see the actual data
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.700
canvas and you can see the actual data
