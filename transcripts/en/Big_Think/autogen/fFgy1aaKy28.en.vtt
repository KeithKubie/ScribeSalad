stress disorder it's a survival
adaptation I was having all the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
adaptation I was having all the
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.920
adaptation I was having all the
reactions the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930
reactions the
 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.390

to fight all the things we associate

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349
to fight all the things we associate
 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.129
to fight all the things we associate
with PTSD have real survival value in a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139
with PTSD have real survival value in a
 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.940
with PTSD have real survival value in a
situation of great danger the problem

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
situation of great danger the problem
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.490
situation of great danger the problem
the problem happens when that acute PTSD

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500
the problem happens when that acute PTSD
 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.110
the problem happens when that acute PTSD
turns into a long-term disorder that can

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120
turns into a long-term disorder that can
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000
turns into a long-term disorder that can
last even someone's lifetime and at that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
last even someone's lifetime and at that
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.500
last even someone's lifetime and at that
point it doesn't have survival value it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510
point it doesn't have survival value it
 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.960
point it doesn't have survival value it
actually has negative value I mean it

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
actually has negative value I mean it
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.759
actually has negative value I mean it
gets in the way of leading a healthy

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769
gets in the way of leading a healthy
 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.789
gets in the way of leading a healthy
life and that's chronic long-term PTSD

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799
life and that's chronic long-term PTSD
 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.369
life and that's chronic long-term PTSD
it's not adaptive it's not healthy it's

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379
it's not adaptive it's not healthy it's
 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.500
it's not adaptive it's not healthy it's
the opposite and that is the problem

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510
the opposite and that is the problem
 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.170
the opposite and that is the problem
that America is trying to solve with

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
that America is trying to solve with
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.409
that America is trying to solve with
some of its soldiers most of the US

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419
some of its soldiers most of the US
 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.149
some of its soldiers most of the US
military is not face to face with their

on there were casualties but they
 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.240
on there were casualties but they
actually never were they never saw the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
actually never were they never saw the
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.780
actually never were they never saw the
enemy and most of the US military is not

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
enemy and most of the US military is not
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.699
enemy and most of the US military is not
in combat only 10% of the US military is

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709
in combat only 10% of the US military is
 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.000
in combat only 10% of the US military is
actually in combat but the curious thing

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010
actually in combat but the curious thing
 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.909
actually in combat but the curious thing
is that when you bring these soldiers

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
is that when you bring these soldiers
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.030
is that when you bring these soldiers
back to this country a much larger

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040
back to this country a much larger
 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.789
back to this country a much larger
percentage than 10% experience pretty

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799
percentage than 10% experience pretty
 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.399
percentage than 10% experience pretty
intense psychological distress

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409

it can't be trauma because they weren't
 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.379
it can't be trauma because they weren't
in combat so what is it exactly if you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
in combat so what is it exactly if you
 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.909
in combat so what is it exactly if you
look at Peace Corps volunteers who

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919
look at Peace Corps volunteers who
 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.390
look at Peace Corps volunteers who
obviously aren't in war zones but

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
obviously aren't in war zones but
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.909
obviously aren't in war zones but
they're living in small tightly bonded

they're living in small tightly bonded
 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.069
they're living in small tightly bonded
communities in the developing world and

communities in the developing world and
 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.860
communities in the developing world and
when they come back something like 25

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
when they come back something like 25
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.929

actually and I'm not a psychologist my
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.100
actually and I'm not a psychologist my
guess is that a fair amount of those

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
guess is that a fair amount of those
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.339

people actually weren't traumatized and

drone warfare is an interesting example

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789
drone warfare is an interesting example
 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.950
drone warfare is an interesting example
of how you don't have to be in danger to

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960
of how you don't have to be in danger to
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.450
of how you don't have to be in danger to
be traumatized and in fact what

be traumatized and in fact what
 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.310
be traumatized and in fact what
researchers have found is that the most

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
researchers have found is that the most
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.029
researchers have found is that the most
traumatizing thing to human beings is

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039
traumatizing thing to human beings is
 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.189
traumatizing thing to human beings is
witnessing harm to others witnessing

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199
witnessing harm to others witnessing
