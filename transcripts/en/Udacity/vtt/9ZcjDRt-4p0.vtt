Okay, so here is the Python documentation, and if I scroll

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.980
down, I can find the os module. Let me click on it.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.030
And in here, we can find all o the OS related functions that we used. So here

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.090
is os.change directory, and here is os.getcwd, or

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.190
get current working directory. Let me scroll down some

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.810
more. And if I do that I find os.listdir, which lists all of the files within a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.920
given directory and on scrolling down even further, I

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.290
find os.rename. By the way, I want to make a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.190
quick note here that even though we don't know how

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.350
functions like rename really work behind the scenes. We can

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.740
read their documentation and use them just fine. This hiding

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.340
of detail behind documentation, in computer science, is called abstraction.
