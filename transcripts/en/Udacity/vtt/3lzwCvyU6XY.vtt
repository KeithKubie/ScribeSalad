00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.942
So, personality psychologists do in fact use the kinds of measures that Lauren

00:00:02.942 --> 00:00:07.544
and Susan just discussed to do many different things. In fact, it's the job of

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:11.986
the personality psychologist to assess personality. And if they're researchers,

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:16.975
they do this either quantitatively or qualitatively. And quantitative

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:21.750
personality assessment involves behavior observations or self reports.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.950
Qualitative assessment of personality involves interviews or projective test.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.390
So, researchers of personality might then look at how personality is associated

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.750
with or related to outcomes like health, or career interest, our creativity, or

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.604
marital satisfaction. Now clinical psychologists, who study personality, may

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:49.820
use personality assessment to diagnose personality disorders, and come up with

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.748
a treatment plan to help them. Now let's talk about where personality comes

00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:57.589
from.
