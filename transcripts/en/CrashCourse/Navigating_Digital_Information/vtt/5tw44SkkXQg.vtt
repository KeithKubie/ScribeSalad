00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.770
Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course, Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.280
So you know when you take a slice of pizza
out of the microwave and it’s extremely hot?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.880
But you’re so hungry that you decide to
just fight through the pain and take a bite anyway.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.280
Whereupon you confirm that you’re basically
eating hot lava and now your tongue is burnt,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.900
and also you couldn’t even really taste
the pizza so you put it back down for like

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.680
10 seconds, blow on it, and then try again.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.250
And then you continue that cycle until your
meal is actually cool enough to eat but by

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.200
then of course have no more taste buds.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.780
Right. What I’m saying is that patience is a hard-earned skill for humans, especially when you’re

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.019
really hungry.

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.570
And on the Internet, I at least am hungry
for information basically all the time.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.570
I want to know about the news stories I care
about so much that I will scroll through endless

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.469
posts and wikipedia edits and even god help me youtube comments looking for more information,

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.399
and when I am done getting all the known information about that story, I will scroll through endless

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.940
speculation while I wait for more facts to
come out, because I am incredibly bad at being patient.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.560
But also, the architecture of the social internet tells you not to be patient--it tells you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.900
that if you load more tweets or see more posts, there will always be something new, something

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.140
that could be very important, and the ubiquity of newness can make it difficult for us to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.240
read an entire article that was published
yesterday because uggg that is literally so yesterday.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.120
So instead maybe I should just read the headline and then see if there’s anything new on

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.560
facebook, which there always is, and then
I’m scrolling and scrolling and ENOUGH.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.920
Approaching the Internet this way has left
me with a lot of bad habits that don’t actually

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.880
help me find the answers I’m looking for.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.090
So today we’re going to learn a skill to
help break that bad habit of impatience called

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.300
click restraint.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.180
INTRO

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.030
During this series so far, we’ve talked
a lot about what to do when encountering new

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.019
information online like before believing and
sharing, we need to find out who is behind

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.269
the information and what evidence there is
for their claims.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.890
We also want to find out what other sources say.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.230
One of the strengths of the Internet is that
there are always more sources, so if you’re

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.519
not sure about a claim, or you can’t decide
whether a source is reliable, then you should

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.459
try to find another reliable source.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
But often, the problem actually isn’t finding
multiple sources to corroborate or verify

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.359
claims--because there are many, many, many sources for almost anything.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.270
Like, if you search for “Flat Earth Theory,”
you will get like seven million results debating

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.590
whether the Earth is flat, and it would take
you a lifetime to look through the all.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.310
That’s not a challenge, by the way.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.310
Don’t do that.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.080
You have but one wild and precious life, my
friends.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.680
Spend it knowing that the Earth is roughly
spherical.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.989
My point is that understanding information
is not about finding multiple sources; it’s

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.579
about finding multiple reliable sources when conducting a search.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.290
It’s about learning what expertise is and
when to trust it.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.230
But when many of us search the Internet, we pick from among the top two search engine

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.219
results even though there might be literally
millions of results to choose from.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.749
But researchers from the Stanford History
Education Group found that fact checkers,

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:32.769
who confirm facts and debunk myths for a living, spend more time on search results than like

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.019
everyone else does.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.139
They typically scroll through the entire first
page of search results, and sometimes even

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.540
check the second or third page, as they decide what looks most promising.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.670
And they practice what researchers call click restraint.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.720
Instead of immediately clicking the first
thing they see, fact checkers /restrain/ themselves.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.159
They scan results to check out their options, get a sense of what sources are available

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.309
and what information is on offer, and then,
based on what they’re looking for, make

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.980
informed decisions about which websites to visit first.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.180
So obviously there’s, you know, a lot of
content to sift through on the Internet, and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.690
a search engine’s job is to sort all of
that for you, but search engines don’t just

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.040
like arrive on the web fully-formed.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.810
There is no search engine stork dropping them on Silicon Valley doorsteps.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.660
Humans create and manage search engines, so the results they produce via complex algorithms

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.740
are not somehow separate from human fallibility.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.190
Algorithms are human products just as much as this table is a human product, and this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.729
physical representation of a virtual representation of a physical flower is a human product.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.830
What I’m saying is that algorithms are not
objective.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.009
There's always going to a degree of human
influence, even if that degree is supposed

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.009
to be small.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.669
Now before we go any further, I want to highlight a potential conflict of interest here.

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.220
This series is funded in part by a grant from Google, which is a search company.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.290
As part of the grant, they viewed final scripts of these videos, but they did not write or

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.290
edit them.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.590
The content of these videos was developed
by the Stanford History Education Group, not

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.220
google, but I think it’s important to reiterate
here that Google did help fund the series.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.980
Having said that search engines like Google are profoundly fallible and they are subject

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.870
to human influences, and they are shaped both by the people who work on those search engines

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.550
and also by the people who use them.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.970
So when you enter a keyword into any search engine, it doesn’t spit out a list of sources

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.210
ranked by trustworthiness.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.419
Instead they sort links based on a variety
of factors using an algorithm -- a set of

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.800
rules or operations a computer follows to
complete a task.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.300
And those algorithms, to reiterate, are created by people.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.759
Now, the exact algorithms search engines use are secret -- that’s why they remain in

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:46.759
business.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.780
But roughly -- and I mean roughly -- they
didn’t like tell us any secrets, Google

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.960
returns results based on (1) How relevant
it thinks a page will be to what you searched

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.919
for and (2) The quality of the site, based on Google’s

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.370
own definition of quality.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.800
A page might be relevant to your search if
it contains multiple instances of the keyword

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
you searched.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.711
Like, if you search “Golden Gate Bridge”
it may surface the official website of the

00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:13.980
Golden Gate Bridge because it says Golden
Gate Bridge like 12,000 times in key places,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.430
like the page title.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.069
Quality is a bit more difficult to nail down.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.080
One parameter search engines use is how many other sites link to a result, and whether

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.400
those sites are of high quality.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.630
Some search companies also pay individuals around the world to rate the quality of the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.169
pages it finds in search, which...is google
hiring?

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.740
Because I would love that job!

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.699
I feel like I would be good at it because
I spend a lot of time on the Internet and

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.960
I have very strong opinions.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.409
Google raters do follow a set of guidelines
of course.

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.330
We’ll link to them in the video description.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.050
But also search results aren’t a one-way
street.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.780
Like web content creators know roughly how to try to ensure their websites appear higher

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.990
in search results.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.600
This is called search engine optimization.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.259
To use a basic example, keywords are important to search results, so if you make a site about

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.540
doggos and puppers but most people are searching for dogs and puppies, you’d be better off

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.060
including dogs and puppies in the title.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.830
And since linking to other sites can impact
search results, some creators even create

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.110
websites to link to their websites.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.240
Now, that’s considered spam but it’s still
very common.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.240
Why?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.189
Because many of us click those first couple
links of a search result, getting your site

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:26.790
into those spots can be extremely valuable.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.500
And research has shown that students interpret the order of search results as an indicator

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.500
of trustworthiness.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.320
As I already mentioned, that’s not actually
the case, but it benefits a website to appear

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.919
trustworthy… or a YouTube channel for that
matter.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:46.509
Okay, so the first step of click restraint
is /not clicking./ Alright?

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.530
Take a deep breath.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.530
Count to ten.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.530
Or, I don’t know.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.530
It’s the Internet.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.530
Count to three.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.580
Send your friend a search time selfie…

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580
I don’t…

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.620
whatever you have to do to not instantly click the first link of your search results.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.600
Then scan the result titles and URLs of that
first page of results..

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.469
Are there names of major news organizations or blogs you’ve never heard of?

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:09.949
From the title you can also sometimes tell
whether a page is

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:13.750
a news article, or if it’s presenting an opinion, an op-ed

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.700
piece, or if it’s just like irrelevant to your search.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.620
Next you should scan the snippets below each title.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.120
The text under the URL will hint at the webpage’s content.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.909
This alone could point you towards the information you’re looking for.

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:30.340
Once you’ve compared these results you can try some lateral reading by opening a couple

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.710
results in new tabs.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.710
You know what.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.380
Let’s just try out this whole process in
the Thought Bubble.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.760
Okay, my friend told me that the Chinese government is buying Walmart.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.660
I had not heard anything about that, so I
decided to Google it.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.079
I typed in “did China buy Walmart.”

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.639
And here are the results.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:49.640
The first is called “China Buys Walmart,
Will Rebrand as GreatWallMart” and it’s

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.640
from thefinaledition.com.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.750
Now I’ve never heard of The Final Edition,
and that pun does sound too good to be true.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.839
On the other hand the first three words are,
“China Buys Walmart”.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:04.550
A few results down I see stories from Forbes and Business Insider, two business websites,

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.140
suggesting that the Walton family that owns Walmart has been selling its shares.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.750
The seventh result is Walmart’s own website,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.380
then comes its Wikipedia page,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.889
and a CNN article about Walmart buying a stake in a Chinese retailer from two years ago.

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:23.240
From this group of results, Walmart’s own
website is probably the best place to start.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.430
While I wouldn’t always trust a company’s
website to tell its own story impartially,

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.100
I do think they probably know who their owners are.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.410
The company page explains how the Walton family came to own Walmart.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.850
And then in 2016, they teamed up with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com to form what they

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.190
called a strategic alliance.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:47.980
Actually, if we go back to that CNN story,
we can confirm that Walmart bought a 5% stake

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.400
in JD.com.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.500
So, no, China did not buy Walmart, but the
retailer did do business with a major Chinese company.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.980
Just for kicks, let’s go back to that first
Google result about the GreatWallMart

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.260
since that was the only source that even hinted
at China buying Walmart.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
The link leads to a page that looks like a
news article,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.230
but when I find the About page for the Final
Edition,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:16.260
it explains that it’s a satirical site that
“aims to be the #1 humor experience on the Internet."

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.680
Definitely not a reliable source of news.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.380
Good thing I didn’t just click that first
link.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.560
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.320
So obviously not all search results will bring up a clear juxtaposition of true news sites,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.550
satirical onex, and primary source information.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.750
If you’re not finding the kind of results
you need when conducting a search, I do have

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.750
some tips:

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.570
First, put the phrase you’re searching for
in quotation marks.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.380
That way a search engine will only look for
those words in that order.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.880
And if you want to limit your results to one
website domain, add site, colon, then the

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:55.680
domain name as in site: youtube.com You can even try site: .edu to search websites sponsored

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.900
by educational institutions.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.620
To eliminate certain words or websites from your search, include a minus sign before the

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:08.220
phrase like searching for Wall Street Journal -site:wsj.com will give you results about

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.949
the Wall Street Journal but none of them from the Journal’s own website.

00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:16.600
Search engines may be something we use everyday, and we might even know some of these tricks,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.460
but that doesn’t make them foolproof.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.980
As we’ve noted many times before, when it
comes to evaluating information, there just

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.120
is no magic bullet.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.779
No single path will get you to unimpeachable information.

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:36.110
Dare I say you might even want to try the
second page or beyond!

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.400
Next time, we’ll bring this miniseries to
a close with the second joke I know, and we’ll

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.580
tackle the great white whale of the contemporary Internet--your social media feed.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.940
I'll see you then.
