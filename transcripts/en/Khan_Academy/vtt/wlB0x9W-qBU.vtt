00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.267
What I want to do with this video

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:06.267
is think about what happens to some type of projectile,

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:09.800
maybe a ball or rock, if I were to throw it

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.400
straight up into the air.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.600
To do that I want to plot distance relative to time.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.800
There are a few things I am going to tell you about

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
my throwing the rock into the air.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:29.667
The rock will have an initial velocity (Vi) of 19.6 meters per second (19.6m/s)

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.667
I picked this initial velocity because

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:35.133
it will make the math a little bit easier.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.667
We also know the acceleration near the surface of the earth.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.267
We know the force of gravity

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:47.267
near the surface of the earth is the mass of the object times the acceleration.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.467
(let me write this down)

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:54.800
The force of gravity is going to be the mass of the object times little g.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.733
little g is gravity near the surface of the earth

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.800
g is 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2)

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Now if you want the acceleration on earth

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.800
you just take the force divided by the mass

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.533
Because we have the general equation

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.067
Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma)

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:17.133
If you want acceleration divide both sides by mass

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.200
so you get force over mass

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.400
So, lets just divide this by mass

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800
If you divide both sides by mass,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.733
on the left hand side you will get acceleration

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:35.600
and on the right hand side you will get the quantity little g.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.267
The whole reason why I did this is

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:39.467
when we look at the g it really comes from

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.667
the universal law of gravitation.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.800
You can really view g as

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.733
measuring the gravitational field strength near the surface of the earth.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.200
Then that helps us figure out the force

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.667
when you multiply mass times g.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.000
Then you use F=ma, the second law,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.867
to come up with g again

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.933
which is actually the acceleration.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.667
This is accelerating you towards the center of the earth.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.333
The other thing I want to make clear:

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:11.533
when you talk about the Force of gravity

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:15.333
generally the force of gravity is equal to big G

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.533
Big G (which is different than little g) times

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.000
the product of the masses of the two things

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.067
over the square of the distance between the two things.

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.867
You might be saying "Wait, clearly the force of gravity is dependent on the distance.

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:33.867
So if I were to throw something up into the air,

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.533
won't the distance change."

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.400
And you would be right!

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.667
That is technically right, but

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:40.867
the reality is that when you

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:42.333
throw something up into the air

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.933
that change in distance is so small

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.933
relative to the distance between the object and the center of the earth

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:48.133
that to make the math simple,

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.873
When we are at or near the surface of the earth (including in our atmosphere)

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.000
we can assume that it is constant.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.557
Remember that little g over there is

00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:04.343
all of these terms combined.

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:06.990
If we assume that mass one (m1) is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.492
the mass of the earth, and

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:23.059
r is the radius of the earth (the distance from the center of the earth)

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.938
So you would be correct in thinking that it changes a little bit.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.863
The force of gravity changes a little bit, but

00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:31.139
for the sake of throwing things up into our atmosphere

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.436
we can assume that it is constant.

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:35.876
And if we were to calculate it

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:40.056
it is 9.8 meters per second squared

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:42.238
and I have rounded here to the nearest tenth.

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.932
I want to be clear these are vector quantities.

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:47.904
When we start throwing things up into the air

00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:49.251
the convention is

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.641
if something is moving up it is given a positive value,

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:57.331
and if it is moving down we give it a negative value.

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:01.650
Well, for an object that is in free fall

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.833
gravity would be accelerating it downwards, or

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.226
the force of gravity is downwards.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.501
So, little g over here,

00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:08.755
if you want to give it its direction,

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:14.142
is negative. Little g is -9.8m/s2.

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.975
So, we have the acceleration due to gravity.

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:19.669
The acceleration due to gravity (ag) is

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.149
negative 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2).

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.471
Now I want to plot distance relative to time.

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:32.300
Let's think about how we can set up a formula,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.830
derive a formula that, if we input time as a variable,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.827
we can get distance.

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:39.933
We can assume these values right over here.

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:46.093
Well actually I want to plot displacement over time because that will be more interesting.

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:50.667
We know that displacement is

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:59.933
the same thing as average velocity times change in time (displacement=Vavg*(t1-t2)).

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.200
Right now we have

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.926
something in terms of time, distance, and average velocity

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:07.595
but not in terms of initial velocity and acceleration.

00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:12.842
We know that average velocity is the same thing as

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:17.626
initial velocity (vi) plus final velocity (vf) over 2. (Vavg=(vi+vf)/2)

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:20.273
If we assume constant acceleration.

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:26.333
We can only calculate Vavg this way assuming constant acceleration.

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:29.467
Once again when were are dealing

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:31.836
with objects not too far from the center of the earth

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:33.601
we can make that assumption.

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:36.759
Assuming that we have a constant acceleration

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.031
Once again we don't have what our final velocity is.

00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:43.307
So, we need to think about this a little more.

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:48.090
We can express our final velocity in terms of our initial velocity and time.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.733
Just dealing with this part, the average velocity.

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:56.067
So we can rewrite this expression

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:59.667
as the initial velocity plus something over 2.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.267
and what is final velocity?

00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:05.000
Well the final velocity is going to be

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.333
your initial velocity plus your acceleration times change in time.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.000
If you are starting at 10m/s

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.667
and you are accelerated at 1m/s^2

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:24.267
then after 1 second you will be going 1 second faster than that. (11m/s)

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:29.267
So this right here is your final velocity.

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:35.200
Let me make sure that these are all vector quantities...(draws vector arrows)

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.933
All of these are vector quantities.

00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:42.533
Hopefully it is ingrained in you that these are all vector quantities, direction matters.

00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:44.467
And let's see how we can simplify this

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:47.467
Well these two terms

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.867
(remember we are just dealing with the average velocity here)

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:52.067
These two terms if you combine them become 2 times initial velocity (2vi).

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:57.133
two times my initial velocity

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.667
and then divided by this 2

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:05.200
plus all of this business divided by this 2.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.200
which is my acceleration times my change in time divided by 2.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.600
All of this was another way to write average velocity.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.000
the whole reason why I did this is because we don't have final velocity

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.133
but we have acceleration

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:20.733
and we are going to use change in time as our independent variable.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:25.133
We still have to multiply this by this green change in time here.

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:29.422
multiply all of this times the green change in time.

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:31.419
All of this is what displacement is going to be.

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:32.859
This is displacement, and lets see...

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:34.716
we can multiply the change in time times all this

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:37.733
actually these 2s cancel out

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:42.867
and we get (continued over here)

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:47.933
We get: displacement is equal to

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:52.467
initial velocity times

00:07:52.467 --> 00:08:01.533
change in time

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:07.400
Some physics classes or textbooks put time there but it is really change in time.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.333
change in time is a little more accurate

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:19.800
plus 1/2 (which is the same as dividing by 2)

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.268
plus one half times the acceleration

00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:27.240
times the acceleration

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.748
times (we have a delta t times delta t)

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:31.733
change in time times change in time

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.333
the triangle is delta and it just means "change in"

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.467
so change in time times change in time

00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:41.133
is just change in times squared.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:44.067
In some classes you will see this written as

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:51.333
d is equal to vi times t plus 1/2 a t squared

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.200
this is the same exact thing

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.733
they are just using d for displacement

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:58.200
and t in place of delta t.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.800
The one thing I want you to realize with this video

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.533
is that this is a very straight forward thing to derive.

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:10.400
Maybe if you were under time pressure you would want to be able to whip this out,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.491
but the important thing, so you remember how to do this when you are 30 or 40 or 50

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:17.256
or when you are an engineer and you are trying

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:20.367
to send a rocket into space and you don't have a physics book to look it up,

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:25.568
is that it comes from the simple displacement is equal to average velocity times change in time

00:09:25.568 --> 00:09:27.844
and we assume constant acceleration,

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:31.234
and you can just derive the rest of this.

00:09:31.234 --> 00:09:33.277
I am going to leave you there in this video.

00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:37.667
Let me erase this part right over here.

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:40.243
We are going to leave it right over here.

00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:42.751
In the next video we are going to use this

00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:44.284
formula we just derived.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:46.141
We are going to use this to actually

00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:48.667
plot the displacement vs time

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:50.467
because that is interesting and we are going to be thinking about

00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:52.867
what happens to the velocity and the acceleration

00:09:52.867 --> 99:59:59.999
as we move further and further in time.
