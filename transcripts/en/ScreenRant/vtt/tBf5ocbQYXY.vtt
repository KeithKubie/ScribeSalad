00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.880
No matter how many heroes may be re-imagined,
rebooted, or replaced, and with more and more

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.720
comic book superheroes being introduced every
year, Spider-Man remains one of the most beloved,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.480
relatable, and recognizable around the world.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.260
Taking that kind of success and moving it
to the big screen is harder than it sounds,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.759
as a few directors have already learned - with
more lessons still coming.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.869
As Spider-Man makes his journey to the Marvel
Cinematic Universe, what better time is there

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.240
to take a look back at the hero's movie outings,
in our latest Docu video, The Evolution of

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.149
Spider-Man in Movies.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.500
Nicholas Hammond
It's Tobey Maguire who usually gets credit

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.059
as the first movie Spider-Man, but Nicholas
Hammond predated him by more than twenty years.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.829
Before CBS greenlit an entire Spider-Man TV
show, a two hour TV movie was made to see

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.449
if it could really be done.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.220
Hammond never actually performed in the costume,
which is probably for the best, since it wasn't

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.880
all that inspiring or heroic.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.660
Still, the superhero was popular enough to
bring in over 16 million viewers, and even

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.820
though most fans took issue with Peter Parker's
mission to take down a mind controlling new

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.160
age guru, not a supervillain, a five episode
series was ordered.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.610
It only ended up lasting thirteen in total,
since the cost of actually adapting comic

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.100
book stories was too high.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.280
The network was also dealing with the same
risk of superhero fatigue that movie studios

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.890
are today, with TV shows and specials based
on Wonder woman, the Incredible Hulk, Captain

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.850
America and Doctor Strange all competing for
attention.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.850
The TV show never actually made the jump from
vhs home video to dvd.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.430
So if you've got a copy, hang onto it, and
you can see the show's problems firsthand.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.250
One weird example: every time Peter's famous
Aunt May appears, she's played by a different

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.540
actress.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.990
Tobey Maguire
It's hard to believe, but since the days Nicholas

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.770
Hammond's stunt double was foiling presidential
bomb plots, movie studios had been trying

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.030
to make a Spider-Man movie a reality.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
Countless scripts were produced, including
one dark, adult one from Avatar director James

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.750
Cameron, and directors ranging from M. Night
Shyamalan to David Fincher were all considered.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.159
In the end, it was Sam Raimi, a director better
known for small-budget horror, who got the

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.159
job.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.250
It was Raimi's love and passion for getting
Spider-Man right that convinced the studio,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.989
and they clearly made the right choice.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.290
The casting of Tobey Maguire over more experienced,
or more classically handsome leading men raised

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.989
eyebrows, but the decision to find the right
Peter Parker, not the right Spider-Man, paid

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:43.989
off.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.640
Maguire's goofy charm won over audiences,
and his physical transformation was one of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.670
the earliest superhero makeovers to drop jaws.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.800
And thankfully, this time around, the costume,
story, and villains all put the comic book

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.140
source material ahead of everything else.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.659
With a one-piece costume torn right off the
comic page, and an armored Green Goblin that

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.540
still holds up, not even the studio security
could resist.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.629
It took the studio over a year to find a handful
of the stolen costumes, after a security guard

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.359
and his accomplice couldn't resist taking
them home.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.359
Can you blame them?

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.999
Sam Raimi's version may not be timeless for
today's comic fans, but the first movie to

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.409
crack a 100-million dollar opening weekend,
and one of the most successful and critically

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.270
acclaimed superhero movies EVER helped prove
comic book heroes were Hollywood's next big

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.670
blockbuster craze.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.239
It's usually impossible to catch that kind
of luck twice, but Sam Raimi managed it, raising

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.579
the stakes, the action - and doubling the
budget - for his sequel, Spider-Man 2.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.580
It's hard to pin down exactly what it was
that the movie got so right, but aside from

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.100
an interesting, entertaining, and visually
stunning villain in Doctor Octopus, the real

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.189
victory was below the surface.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.751
Years before "dark" superhero movies became
all the rage, Spider-Man 2 saw Peter Parker

00:03:54.751 --> 00:04:00.060
trying to be a hero and a man, and learning
that being a superhero usually meant happiness

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.209
wasn't possible.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.310
That's the idea that superhero movies and
TV shows are still using for drama, and even

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.000
if Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight has taken
the spot of "best comic book movie" for a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.440
lot of fans, Spider-Man 2 remains one of the
very best examples of what the genre CAN be,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.930
if not the top performer.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.440
&nbsp;Andrew Garfield
When Raimi's third film showed his hopes for

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.440
the character weren't the same as the studio's
the decision was made to scrap plans for Spider-Man

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.660
4, and make the upcoming production a reboot,
instead.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.440
The idea of rebooting a superhero so soon
seemed like a risky move, especially since

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.530
it meant telling the same origin story all
over again.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.670
But after finding Andrew Garfield for the
lead role, and up-and-comer Emma Stone as

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.380
Peter's REAL first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy,
things turned around completely.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.970
The story seemed to be a darker one, aimed
at a younger audience more used to grim heroes,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.680
and the darker, more tactile costume reflected
it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.450
Still, it wasn't all grim.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.280
Fans can debate whether Andrew Garfield could
play a convincing outcast, bullied nerd as

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.010
Peter Parker, but he captured the humor and
sarcasm of Spider-Man like no one before.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.690
But the thing fans left the theater talking
about was the obvious chemistry between Garfield

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.130
and Stone: enough to build a franchise on,
and when the pair started dating in real life

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.920
shortly after, the future seemed even brighter.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.680
Fans were willing to overlook just how closely
the origin story stuck to the previous one,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.390
and even forgive a CG lizard villain thanks
to improved special effects and a likable

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.390
star.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.810
With director Marc Webb at the wheel, Sony
moved to build an entire shared universe around

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.210
the webslinger, with spinoff films and even
standalone movies starring villains like Venom

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.090
and the Sinister Six.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.500
When Amazing spider-Man 2 hit theaters, those
plans changed, and fast.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.060
Critics and fans still couldn't get enough
of Peter and Gwen, but with two villains and

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.650
a ton of supporting characters and subplots
all squeezed into a single movie, the reception

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.650
was mixed.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.000
Despite adapting Gwen Stacy's death faithfully
and powerfully, the franchise-low box office

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.110
take showed Sony that they were heading in
the wrong direction.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.470
Almost overnight, sequels, spinoffs and shared
universe movies were permanently delayed,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.190
as Sony realized that you can't build a universe
of franchises unless you get the star right.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.410
Sadly for Garfield, that meant starting over
from square one.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.080
Tom Holland
Fans of Marvel Comics were pinching themselves

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.830
when word broke that the rift between Marvel's
films and Sony's Spider-Man had been crossed,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.670
with the webslinger being fully introduced
into the MCU as part of Civil War, before

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.100
Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige came over
to produce a Spider-Man solo film.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.860
It wasn't long after the announcement that
Garfield learned he was out, with Marvel wishing

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.720
to actually cast a high-school-aged actor
for the part of Peter Parker.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.060
Actors under 20 competed furiously for the
part, with a select few being brought to screen

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.800
tests with Marvel's heavyweights Chris Evans
and Robert Downey, Jr.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.030
In the end, it was Tom Holland who grabbed
the part, already an expert jumper and dancer

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.030
from headlining Billy Elliot: the Musical
in London.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.890
The decision to once again tell the origin
story of Peter Parker may be a necessary risk

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.560
at this point, but fan hunger for Spider-Man
- ANY Spider-Man - was proven once and for

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.740
all when the new Spider-Man's cameo in the
second trailer for Captain America: Civil

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.580
War exploded online.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.220
With a technical-but-classic suit, and eyes
traced right out of an animated series - not

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.500
to mention the animated zoom on the eyepieces
themselves - it's clear that Spider-Man's

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.720
suit can only change so much from version
to version.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.470
But now that movie fans have seen a spider-Man
that was fantastical, heartfelt, and cheesy

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.220
in the best way possible, followed by a darker
and more modern take, the world of comic book

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.830
fans waits to see how Marvel's new vision
of Spider-Man will continue to surprise...

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.210
or at the very least, keep from burning fans
out on the webslinging wallcrawler.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.740
What do you think of the newest take on a
movie Spider-Man?

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.470
Has your favorite version already come and
gone, or do you still think Marvel has a chance

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.490
to find something truly special in Civil War
and the new Spidey solo film?
