00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
&gt;&gt; Education is the ultimate poverty eradication
tool.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.990
When you know better, you tend to do better.
We all know this.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.860
We all know that in Africa if you give a woman
two years of primary

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670
school education in a village in Africa, you
lift the entire village

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.670
out of poverty.
We know the power of education in China and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.410
the power of education in
the developing world, yet we do so little.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.410
Yet we tend to have ready, fire, aim.
We wait until the last minute.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.660
We don't make our first investments.
Why don't governments do this?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.290
Why don't they make this a larger priority?
In my book, Love Leadership, a New Way to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.870
Lead in a Fear-Based World, I
talk about laziness as well, fear as a lazy

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.390
bastard.
There's two things in the world there's love

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.230
and there's fear.
And you don't love, you fear.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.749
And fear's first cousin is laziness.
And laziness' best friend is short-termism,

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.300
a focus on me and not we.
What do we have to get versus what we have

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.299
to give?
And this immediate gratification and greed.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.030
And so it is our short-term nature it is the
immediacy of politics

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.080
versus the long-term nature of public service
that has got us wrapped

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.940
in this vicious cycle.
And what I've said, if you want to make a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.640
lot of money, you want to do
really well, there's nothing better for you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.530
or worse for society than
oppression in the short term.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.070
But in the long term, you hit a wall and we've
hit a wall around the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.560
world.
I keep saying this is not a recession; it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.410
a reset.
And so we're going to have to start making

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.340
long-term investments in
everything, the environment, in our economy,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.680
financial literacy is an
example of a long-term investment and education

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.890
is the ultimate way to
break the back of poverty.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.390
In America, 30 percent of all students who
are dropping out of high

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.730
school in the largest economy in the world.
50 percent of all urban kids are dropping

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.140
out of high school and
70 percent of black men are dropping out of

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.120
high school.
This is an economic death sentence and it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.180
is not sustainable.
We need to make smart sexy again.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.910
We need to make a long-term investment to
reframe education and smart

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.720
sexy and cool.
And I guess the last thing I'll say is developing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.610
countries where kids
are dropping out of high school -- where in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.420
developing countries kids
are just trying to get into school, but in

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.060
developed countries, they're
jumping out of high school.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.291
They're dropping out out of school because
they don't think that

00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.810
education is relevant to their future.
How do you make it relevant?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.960
Show kids how to prosper, how to succeed,
how to do well, and even how

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.740
to get rich if they want to legally.
That's financial literacy, free enterprise

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.930
and capitalism, ownership,
opportunity, and entrepreneurship.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.370
Even if you're dealing with a drug dealer,
he's not dumb.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.020
He understands import/export, supply/demand,
wholesale/retail, customer

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
service, security.
You're not talking about a dumb kid.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.490
You're talking about a mis-directed kid.
So let's give them a role model.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.600
Let's give them a relevant education.
Let's give them the opportunity to apply those

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.120
skills and to improve
their life, and we will see education be the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.900
ultimate long-term
investment in our society and that's doing

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.160
well and doing good.
Doing well by doing good.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.660
If you want to help, go to 5MK.org.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.069
Help Quincy Jones, Andrew Young, and myself
to make smart sexy again.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.960
Thank you very much.
