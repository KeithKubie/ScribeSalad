MALE SPEAKER: Developing
apps for Android

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.771
is an exciting opportunity
to change the world.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.270
I'm going to step you through
the process of getting started

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.220
with Android using Android
Studio, while also sharing

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.560
some pro tips based on the
experiences of a real Android

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.800
start-up.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.740
Before we even install
Android Studio,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.004
you should start thinking about
the app you plan to build.

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.420
Start by looking
at the challenges

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.630
you, your friends,
or family face.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.965
Could you build an app to
solve one of those problems.

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:28.340
Let's take a look
at our start-up

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.890
and see where their
idea came from.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820
-Get something in there.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.810
-Just kick it open.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.180
-Well that was unexpected.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.630
-What the hell was that?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.930
What's going on?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.760
-Zombies.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.220
Obviously those were zombies.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.879
I don't know how but, I bet the
bald guy is somehow to blame.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.379
-Oh sure.

-How are we going to
survive a zombie apocalypse?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.990
We don't have any training.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.635
It's not like we can
go to Google Play

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:16.260
and download an App.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.140
MALE SPEAKER: Like
our start-up team,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.306
you have a problem to solve.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.030
So it's time to
start developing.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.880
First, check that you have
version 7 or later of the Java

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760
Development Kit installed.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.425
Open a terminal window or a
command prompt and type Java

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:35.399
dash version.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.690
I'm doing this on a Mac but
it should look very similar

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.065
on Linux or Windows.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.490
The Java version number
is showing after the one.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.410
So here you can see.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.350
I've got JDK
version 8 installed.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.860
If you see an error or the
version is less than 7,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.020
you'll need to download
and install the JDK.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.840
From this download page, find
the Java platform Standard

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.520
Edition.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.300
Select download and then
select the right bundle

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.470
for your operating system.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.810
I'm on a Mac so I'll accept
the license agreement

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.360
and download the Mac OSX x64
installer from the Java SE

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.320
development kit.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.199
Once that's downloaded,
locate the file

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.610
and double click it to begin
the installation process.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.700
Once that's completed,
go back to your terminal

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660
and confirm that it's
installed correctly.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.230
Now you're ready
install Android Studio.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.730
We'll start by navigating to
the Android Studio home page

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.321
on developer.android.com/sdk.

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:25.820
There's a big button
at the top that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.890
says download Android Studio.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.400
Click that.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.382
Now carefully read the
terms and conditions.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.590
Select the check box confirming
that you've read them

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.519
and agree with them.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.560
And then press the download
Android Studio button

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.386
to begin the transfer.

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:40.010
It's a pretty big
file, so while you're

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.510
waiting for that
to complete, you've

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.110
got a great opportunity to
start thinking about the APIs

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.620
you'll be using to build an
app that solves your problem.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.120
This early in the
product life cycle

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.010
it's worth exploring some of
the options made possible using

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.555
new versions or even
early access beta versions

00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:56.554
of the Android platform.

00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:57.970
Here we're looking
at the new APIs

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.330
available from the Marshmallow
release of Android.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Let's take a look at our
start-up team exploring

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.856
possibilities for their app.

How are we doing?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.670
-Well I'm sure glad we
got this Duel Booted

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.252
Google's got APIs for location
based services and mapping.

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:17.745
-What about a fitness API.

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:19.870
And we should make sure it
works with Android Wear.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.630
Is there like a zombie
killing or zombie protection

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.880
API or something?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.280
-Well location apps are
pretty hot right now.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.890
-I'm not finding
anything in here.

have in the support library.

to three gigs, which
includes the Android SDK.

to take a break,
make a cup of tea,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.484

how to monetize your app.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.780
-What do you think we should
do about monetization?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.800
Because I feel
like in-app billing

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.270
would be great for all the
extra skills and defenses

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.710
but subscription would
be so consistent.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.730
-Maybe we could try A/B
testing both of them.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.225
See which one turns out
to be more effective.

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:51.890
-That's true.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.661
That's a good idea.

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:54.160
-Hey.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.810
Should we worry about
performance this early?

I mean if you're being
chased by a zombie,

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.420

premature optimization?

Now you're ready

We'll start by creating
a new Hello World project

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.150
that you can build from.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.760
Now, keep in mind that
Android Studio is constantly

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.530
being updated and improved.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.990
As a result, the process
for your particular version

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.010
may look a little different
to what I'm showing on screen.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.150
Don't be alarmed.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.000
The options presented
in the general flow

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.310
should still be very similar.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.750
Start by choosing to start a
new Android Studio project.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.240
Give it a name and
enter a domain.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.660
These two will be used together
to form your app's package

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.360
name.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.840
Package names must be unique.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080
So, ideally, you'll own a
domain and you can use it here.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.630
Even if you don't,
try and select

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.340
something that's unlikely to
collide with another developer.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.570
I happen to own a domain
so I'll enter that here.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.540
I'm happy to use the
default project location.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.010
So let's hit Next to continue.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.190
Now we can select the devices
we plan to target with our app.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.870
Eventually we'll
want to make our app

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.040
available on all
possible form factors.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.500
But for our first
ever application,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.880
let's keep it simple and
target only phones and tablets.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.940
Next we can choose the minimum
SDK we plan to support.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.400
Selecting a min SDK lets
you choose your app's level

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.220
of backwards compatibility.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.600
A lower value will make your
app available to a larger

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.610
number of devices.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.390
But in turn, will require
you to do more work

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.230
to ensure compatibility
with devices

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.470
that may not support all the
features added in newer Android

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.960
releases.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.680
You can check to see what
proportion of Android devices

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.280
are running on each

by clicking this

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.330
When we filmed this
video in October of 2015,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.670
supporting back to Android
4.0 or Ice Cream Sandwich,

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.560
let us reach around
90% of devices.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.060
Now you're prompted to select a
new activity or user interface

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.960
screen type to add
to your project.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.710
To get started, we'll
choose a blank activity.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.520
Give it a name and a title.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.960
The other files, layout,
and menu resources

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.865
will be automatically
generated for you.

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:20.410
And you can keep
the default names.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.010
Then hit Finish.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.140
Read some tips and wait for
your new project to be created.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.640
This may take a little while
the very first time you run it.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.358
So here's one we
prepared earlier.

00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:34.237
Your Hello World app
is now ready to run.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.820
You can see it running
on the emulator

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.120
by hitting the green
Run button like this

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.245
and selecting the emulator.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.610
But it's much more fun to run
it on a real Android device.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.000
Enable USB debugging by
navigating to the Settings

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.190
and going down to About Phone.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.370
Then scroll down and press
the build number seven times.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.460
This will enable
developer options.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.330
Navigate back.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.250
Select Developer
options and enable US

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.076
bugging from within there.

00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:05.450
If you're running
Windows, you'll

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.977
also need to download a
driver for your phone.

00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:10.060
You can find drivers and
installation instructions

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.130
for them here on the
Android developer site

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.309
at developer.androi
d.com/tools/extra/oem-usb.

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.600
Now plug your phone into your
computer and if prompted,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.660
choose to allow USB debugging.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.190
Hit the Run button in
Android Studio but this time,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.680
select your real device.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.620
Congratulations.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.590
You are running your
first app on a real phone.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.620
With that, you're ready to
start building a real app.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.490
Unlike this example,
you need to spend

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.120
a lot of time working on a
delightful, responsive, and

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.140
intuitive user experience.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.539
Speaking of which, let's see
how our start-up is getting on.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.340
-So I've got the
app running but,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.770
how do I know if it's working?

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.070
-It's not working.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.590
-Have you enabled real time
location in the settings?

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.300
-Wait, is that the brain
icon or the celery stick?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.010
-Celery stick.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.343
Then you scroll to the bottom
and hit the version number

00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:00.430
seven times.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.190
-Joanna, are you
getting any of this?

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.690
-Hmm.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.140
Oh.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.460
I'm sorry.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.560
I meant to tell you guys.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.980
I decided to join a different
start-up called Meatr, which

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.740
will connect zombies
with host humans

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.330
and make sure that they're
fresh juicy brains on demand.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.130
So it's going to be great.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.126
But I guess I
should probably go.

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:19.936
Good luck, you guys.

00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:21.400

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.220
MALE SPEAKER: Unfortunately,
for our courageous start-up,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.480
they were late to market.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.970
And they had some serious
issues with their UX design.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.400
You can avoid mistakes
using our resources

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.960
to learn how to build and
design great Android apps.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.757
Good luck.

-Meatr delivery.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.070
-Hey.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.028
Oh.

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:54.944
-Hi you guys.

00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:56.381
-How are you doing?

00:09:56.381 --> 00:09:58.420
You know, Colt, we
definitely used an eNom

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.920
to get to market faster.
