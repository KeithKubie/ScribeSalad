00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.997
- [Voiceover] So, we're told that g of x

00:00:01.997 --> 00:00:05.140
is equal to x squared
plus 5 x minus 3

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.141
and h of y is equal to 3 times

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.030
y minus 1 squared, minus 5.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.538
And then, we're asked,

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:16.718
what is h of g of negative 6?

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.092
And the way it's written might
look a little strange to you.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:24.859
This little circle that we have
in between the h and the g,

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.581
that's our function composition symbol.

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.901
So, function,

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.971
function composition,

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.161
composition,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:39.591
composition symbol.

00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:40.935
And one way to rewrite this,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.408
it might make a little bit more sense.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:46.294
So, this h of g of negative 6.

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:48.678
You could rewrite this as,

00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:51.276
this is going to be the same thing as

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:54.342
g of negative 6,

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:57.072
and then h of that.

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:00.511
So, h of g of negative 6.

00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:04.160
Notice, I spoke this out the
same way that I said this.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.307
This is h of g of negative 6.

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:10.305
This is h of g of negative 6.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.905
I find the second notation
far more intuitive,

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.379
but it's good to become familiar with this

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.718
function composition
notation, this little circle,

00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:18.379
because you might see that sometime and

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.263
you shouldn't stress, it's
just the same thing as

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:21.981
what we have right over here.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.620
Now, what is h of g of negative 6?

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.683
Well, we just have to remind
ourselves that this means

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:28.764
that we're going to take
the number negative 6,

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:31.995
we're going to input
it into our function g,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:35.493
and then that will
output g of negative 6,

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.831
whatever that number is, we'll
figure it out in a second,

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.857
and then we're going to input
that into our function h.

00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:44.084
We're going to input
that into our function h.

00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:46.165
And then, what we output is going to be

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:50.208
h of g of negative six, which
is what we want to figure out.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:54.107
h of g

00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:56.467
of negative 6.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:57.853
So, we just have to do
it one step at a time.

00:01:57.853 --> 00:01:59.459
A lot of times, when you
first start looking at

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.027
these function composition,
it seems really convoluted

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:03.842
and confusing, but you just have to,

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:06.235
I want you to take a breath
and take it one step at a time.

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.209
Well, let's figure out
what g of negative 6 is.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.575
It's going to evaluate
to a number in this case.

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.348
And then, we input that
number into the function h,

00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:14.292
and then we'll figure out another --

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:16.521
that's going to map to another number.

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.622
So, g of negative 6.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:20.042
Let's figure that out.

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.297
g of negative 6 is equal to

00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:26.447
negative 6 squared,

00:02:26.447 --> 00:02:31.204
plus 5 times negative 6, minus 3,

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:36.204
which is equal to positive
36, minus 30, minus 3.

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:37.593
So, that's equal to what?

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:41.777
36 minus 33, which is equal to 3.

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:44.802
So, g of negative 6 is equal to 3.

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:46.636
g of negative 6 is equal to 3.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.332
g of negative 6 is equal to 3.

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:51.140
You input negative 6
into g, it outputs 3.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.104
And so, h of g of negative
6 has now simplified

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:58.733
to just h of 3 because
g of negative 6 is 3.

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:01.464
So, let's figure out what h of 3 is.

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:06.464
h of 3 --. notice,
whatever we outputted from g,

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.544
we're inputting that now into h.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:11.647
So, that's the number 3,
so h of 3 is going to be

00:03:11.647 --> 00:03:15.937
3 times 3 minus 1,

00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:20.127
3 minus 1 squared, minus 5,

00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:23.815
which is equal to 3 times 2 squared,

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.595
this is 2 right over here, minus 5,

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:30.727
which is equal to 3
times 4 minus 5,

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:35.230
which is equal to 12 minus 5,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.753
which is equal to 7.

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:39.064
And we're done.

00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:43.011
So, you input negative
6 into g, you get 3.

00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:44.892
And then, you take that output from g

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:48.119
and you put it into h and you get 7.

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.919
So, this right over here is 7.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.288
All of this has come out
to be equal to 7.

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:57.094
So, h of g of negative
6 is equal to 7.

00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:01.343
h of g of negative 6 is equal to 7.

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:04.510
Input negative 6 into
g, take that output

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.080
and input it into h, and
you're gonna get 7.
