with gay people I think that there's an
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219
with gay people I think that there's an
asterisk that position no problem with

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
asterisk that position no problem with
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750

think the idea of introducing that and
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.190
think the idea of introducing that and
into one's personal life whether people

issue I think it's very easy from the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
issue I think it's very easy from the
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910
issue I think it's very easy from the
bubble of New York or LA to say you know

this should be a non-issue but they're
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.010
this should be a non-issue but they're
so much so many opinions and views in

so much so many opinions and views in
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140
so much so many opinions and views in

between those coasts that don't
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.090
between those coasts that don't
necessarily agree with that and I think

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
necessarily agree with that and I think
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.060
necessarily agree with that and I think
it's very clear that evangelical and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
it's very clear that evangelical and
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.300
it's very clear that evangelical and
very conservative religious groups

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310
very conservative religious groups
 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.910
very conservative religious groups
maintain quite a bit of power in this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
maintain quite a bit of power in this
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.249
maintain quite a bit of power in this
country because there are you know it's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
country because there are you know it's
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859
country because there are you know it's
very clear that candidates are are

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
very clear that candidates are are
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929
very clear that candidates are are
leaning one way or the other one when it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
leaning one way or the other one when it
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.069
leaning one way or the other one when it
comes to their approach of them and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
comes to their approach of them and
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.160
comes to their approach of them and
their viewpoints have to be taken

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
their viewpoints have to be taken
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.249
their viewpoints have to be taken
seriously on the political spectrum and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
seriously on the political spectrum and
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.530
seriously on the political spectrum and
that's the you know it's there that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
that's the you know it's there that
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.000
that's the you know it's there that
these things are going to change

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010
these things are going to change
 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:14.610
these things are going to change
I have a I have a personal issue with

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
I have a I have a personal issue with
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.740
I have a I have a personal issue with
the idea that some people can tolerate

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
the idea that some people can tolerate
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.530
the idea that some people can tolerate
homosexuality I do not tolerate women I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
homosexuality I do not tolerate women I
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.320
homosexuality I do not tolerate women I
do not tolerate black or Asian people I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330
do not tolerate black or Asian people I
 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.930
do not tolerate black or Asian people I
embrace them as I would anyone else and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
embrace them as I would anyone else and
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.540
embrace them as I would anyone else and
so I think right now we're sending this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
so I think right now we're sending this
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.720
so I think right now we're sending this
message of tolerance and I think it is a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
message of tolerance and I think it is a
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.030
message of tolerance and I think it is a
stepping stone toward embracing or even

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
stepping stone toward embracing or even
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.510
stepping stone toward embracing or even
so much so that it's a non-issue I think

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
so much so that it's a non-issue I think
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.760
so much so that it's a non-issue I think
right now that the goal needs to be to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
right now that the goal needs to be to
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.150
right now that the goal needs to be to
promote this as a normalized sort of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160
promote this as a normalized sort of
 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.800
promote this as a normalized sort of
behavior and I think that if we're

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
behavior and I think that if we're
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.990
behavior and I think that if we're
taking these sort of band-aid or

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
taking these sort of band-aid or
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.090
taking these sort of band-aid or
sideways approaches to get to a final

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
sideways approaches to get to a final
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.650
sideways approaches to get to a final
result we're going to end up with

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
result we're going to end up with
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.110
result we're going to end up with
something that's still not viewed very

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
something that's still not viewed very
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690
something that's still not viewed very
well so the I think the message we need

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
well so the I think the message we need
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.960
well so the I think the message we need
to be pitching is this sort of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970
to be pitching is this sort of
 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.560
to be pitching is this sort of
normalized behavior gay people are just

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570
normalized behavior gay people are just
 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.150
normalized behavior gay people are just
like straight people they just sleep

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
like straight people they just sleep
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.070
like straight people they just sleep
with the same sex I mean that's there's

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080
with the same sex I mean that's there's
 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.960
with the same sex I mean that's there's
really all it comes down to I think it's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
really all it comes down to I think it's
 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.240
really all it comes down to I think it's
easy for me to say that's such a simple

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
easy for me to say that's such a simple
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.130
easy for me to say that's such a simple
message not only because I live in a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140
message not only because I live in a
 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.920
message not only because I live in a
very urban area but I'm a gay man you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
very urban area but I'm a gay man you
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.630
very urban area but I'm a gay man you
know on the same token I don't think

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640
know on the same token I don't think
 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.540
know on the same token I don't think
it's very easy for you know other folks

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550
it's very easy for you know other folks
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.860
it's very easy for you know other folks
and more conservative parts of the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
and more conservative parts of the
 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.500
and more conservative parts of the
country to accept that message you know

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
country to accept that message you know
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.820
country to accept that message you know
I'm a little bit torn there because I

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830
I'm a little bit torn there because I
 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.580
I'm a little bit torn there because I
think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590
think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be
 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.430
think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be
a platform for any message but then I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440
a platform for any message but then I
 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.650
a platform for any message but then I
also believe it's foolish to imagine

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
also believe it's foolish to imagine
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.440
also believe it's foolish to imagine
that it doesn't you know from from the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450
that it doesn't you know from from the
 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.780
that it doesn't you know from from the
very basic of cutting out smoking for

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
very basic of cutting out smoking for
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.210
very basic of cutting out smoking for
movies and what that did to views toward

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
movies and what that did to views toward
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.320
movies and what that did to views toward
people who smoke you know I think we're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330
people who smoke you know I think we're
 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.990
people who smoke you know I think we're
moving beyond I like to think the token

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000
moving beyond I like to think the token
 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.190
moving beyond I like to think the token
gay character in movies and TV shows but

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
gay character in movies and TV shows but
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.900
gay character in movies and TV shows but
I don't think we're quite there yet but

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910
I don't think we're quite there yet but
 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.850
I don't think we're quite there yet but
I think that's important to show that

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
I think that's important to show that
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.550
I think that's important to show that
even in mainstream movies to have gay

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560
even in mainstream movies to have gay
 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.630
even in mainstream movies to have gay
and lesbian characters who are

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640
and lesbian characters who are
 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.490
and lesbian characters who are
normalized they're not the token gay

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500
normalized they're not the token gay
 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.650
normalized they're not the token gay
character they are another character in

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660
character they are another character in
 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.780
character they are another character in
that movie and I like the idea of

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790
that movie and I like the idea of
 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.010
that movie and I like the idea of
sort of plot lines with in TV and film
