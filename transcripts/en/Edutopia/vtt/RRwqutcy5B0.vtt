&gt;&gt;Jay: This circuit
consists of a speaker,

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:05.756
so you can hear the sounds

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:07.466
when they're made,
a battery for power.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:10.326
If we were to hook the circuit
up to itself with no resistor...

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:11.986
[ high-pitched tone ]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.126
...you'll get that
constant frequency.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.506
If we disconnect the circuit,

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:16.976
then we can hook it
to another resistor.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.126
So, in the case of water...

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:18.996
[ tone descends and ascends ]

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:19.976
...it's a variable resistor.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:23.466
This circuit sends electrons
through the blue alligator clip

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.286
and creates that wave
that makes a sound.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:29.016
Well, what else is a resistor?

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:29.976
Well, the whole world
is a resistor.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:36.716
&gt;&gt;Jay: So, I'll just start.

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:41.086
I'm Jay Silver, and what we're
going to talk about today

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.066
and work with today is that
the world that we live in,

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:49.096
meaning cats, grandmas, rain,
your computer, your shoes,

00:00:49.256 --> 00:00:50.976
everything in the world,
is a construction kit.

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:55.756
&gt;&gt;Jay: It's like the whole
education system is locked

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.276
down from some ancient, you
know, 100-year-old idea,

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:00.906
except for kindergarten.

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:04.616
The very word itself
literally means "child garden."

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:07.886
It means create an environment
where people can mess about.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.836
&gt;&gt;Jay: We're going to forget
that cans are for holding food,

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.006
and we're going to make cans

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.356
and everything else
here do something else.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:15.586
We're going to give
them our own purpose.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:18.686
And so, the first really quick
exercise, each group is going

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:20.066
to grab some junk,
and we're going

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.976
to make some geometric shape.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:26.906
&gt;&gt;Jay: The way kindergarten
was designed was a set

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:30.726
of what we would call toys,
so, blocks, finger paint,

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.996
certain geometrical
shapes, and hoops.

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:35.496
These things help children

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:41.086
at the appropriate developmental
stage of 5 or 6 relate ideas.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.456
What's the appropriate
developmental tools or toys

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:47.196
for a 13-year-old to
learn, share, iterate,

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.976

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.136

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:55.476
&gt;&gt;Jay: So, you call it blocks?

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:55.926
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:56.616
&gt;&gt;Jay: Great.

00:01:57.356 --> 00:01:59.316
&gt;&gt;Jay: I want someone
as soon as possible

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.856
to have a successful experience
with something open-ended

00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:03.976
so that they can look back
and say to themselves,

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:06.500
"I have accomplished whatever
it is we're trying to get."

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:09.136
&gt;&gt;Jay: If I touch one
side of the circuit

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.000
and then the other side...

[ circuit squeaks ]

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:11.666
...it squeaks, okay?

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:12.836
And if I touch it harder...

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:16.500

...it squeaks lower.

00:02:18.777 --> 00:02:19.546
Let's make a little
instrument out of this.

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:20.966
The simplest instrument you
can make is with two people.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.956
&gt;&gt;Jay: The way I believe
people learn is by carrying

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:26.976
out their own processes
in the physical world.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:29.846
&gt;&gt;Jay: So, hold her hand.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:31.426
Now -- yeah, there you go.

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:32.450
[ circuit squeaks ]

00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:32.976
And now, hold tighter.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:33.866
There you go.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Yeah.

[ circuit squeaks ]

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.086
&gt;&gt;Jay: I'm only going to teach
people by creating a situation

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:41.856
where people can then carry
out meaningful projects.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.766
&gt;&gt;Jay: Let's show how you can
invent with a circuit like this.

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:47.266
Let's take a piece of string.

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.356
This is just regular yarn.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.936
We can dope the string
with a certain type

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:54.376
of conductive material,
in this case, water.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:55.736
So, I just dip the
string into water.

[ various tones play ]

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.526
&gt;&gt;Jay: Everyday objects are
in a class of their own, and,

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:12.006
in a sense, anything can be
cast as an everyday object.

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:13.806
But the important thing
about everyday objects is

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:15.296
that people have
familiarity with them.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.856
&gt;&gt;Jay: What you do with the
MaKey MaKey is you take junk,

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.116
you hook it up to your computer,

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:22.096
and you can control your
computer with the junk.

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:24.916
So, let me show you a
little more about that.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.836
&gt;&gt;Jay: But my windows, my house,
you know, my relationships

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:29.446
with people, that's
how inventors think.

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:31.606
That's how artists who
push the limit think.

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:34.236
It's the same as how
scientists make new discoveries.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.716
Scientists don't think
of the scientific method.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:36.976
They're trying to
push what's possible.

by taking a piece of some tofu

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:43.706
that I was just eating.

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:49.386
Oh, actually, I ate
all the tofu.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:50.516
I'll have to take the cornbread.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:55.046
So, you hook up the cornbread to
one of these four buttons or one

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:56.046
of these spacer clips.

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:59.206
So, I'm touching the
cornbread, the video starts.

00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:00.976
I touch it again,
the video stops.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.916

everyday supermarket stuff

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:09.156

in this case, you know,

changed yourself,

creative confidence

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:19.936

we're going to work
towards making an invention.

You're going to make, you
know, stairs into a piano

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.736
or you're going to make your
bench into a Pac-Man controller

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.166
or you're going to take a
book and when you open it,

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.066
it's going to send an email.

Something is going to happen
when you touch something.

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:44.696
&gt;&gt;Jay: You might ask, "Is
this about making a scientist,

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:47.026
or is this about making
someone who's resourceful

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:50.026
and can address problems
in multiple ways?"

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:52.316
And, well, I don't think
there's any difference

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:53.350

What kind of troubles?

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.996

00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:02.156
of what scientists do.

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.606

the answer is to assume

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:40.076
that life is really simple.

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:40.866
But it's not true.

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:45.816
If a little kid comes to you and
asks you, "Why is the sky blue,"

00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:48.436
why may know something
about scattering of light,

you may think you know that
it reflects off the ocean,

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.136
but all of that doesn't matter.

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:54.636
The point is, it's about the
process of them being curious!

00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:56.786
So, don't try to

00:05:56.786 --> 00:05:58.116
