Speaker 1:          00:00          I think, I think the first time we spoke as I had written that thing about Louis and after Louise and the whole news, but Louie [inaudible] you had all that love that piece. But there was so honest. Yeah, it was on Facebook. What's where I did a lot of my best way to explain what you were saying to people that didn't read it after Louis. A lot of people, uh, were rightly criticized and conduct and you know, the whole me too thing. That's all valid and true. 100% needs to happen. But then there were people that were like, you know, Louie was never funny or literally was just, you know, of course he got all these things. He was a white guy or, and I'm like, wait, what? And they were like, well, he said this word I don't like, we'll look at this joke. And I'm like, guys, a week ago he was a comic genius.

Speaker 1:          00:39          We all agreed on that. That was a widely held belief. Now out of nowhere, he's not that funny. And, and these people are tweeting this from parking lots where they're performing some of the shows in la, or I'd like someone's driveway, you know, and which is fine. I do them. I have no problem with that. But they're getting on Twitter and knocking Louis from the back of a parking lot where they're doing a show. But what you, the reason you gave for why? Well, because these, there's, in any industry, people are going to get ahead by being agreeable, by having the right opinions, by crowd sourcing their opinions, by taking the temperature of the room and going, how does everyone feel? And those people are, you know, they're careerists are very good at office politics. They're very good at having the right friends, but their contributions are never really important.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Our long lasting because they never get great because they don't take any risk. Because I think greatness is something you have to risk constantly to get to that level. So a lot of these people do very well. They make money, they're, they're successful, but they are careerist and they're looking for comfort. And so when it was comfortable and safe to attack Louie and to bring Louie down and to elevate themselves, they did it. But they didn't do it when it could have hurt their career a week earlier, you know? So to me it was very disingenuous and the fact that more people weren't calling it out, and I, and I made that point where I said the same thing on the other side of people who styled themselves like I'm a free speech warrior, I'm this anti PC in their whole entire persona is, is that the need to say the n word?

Speaker 1:          02:20          They're like, I can't do a joke if the punchline isn't fact. Like they're like, we have to. Yeah. So those to me are kind of the same people and they're, they're the people that are just trying to arrange the world in a way that allows them to succeed. Those are the types of people also, like you were talking about the actor in the, you mean they're putting on a facade? Yeah. That's not who they've adopted a predetermined pattern of behavior. 100% that predetermined pattern of behavior might be, I'm a guy I drink every night. We go hard. I'm an artist, I smoked cigarettes, I don't give a fuck. I'm not trying to get on TV. Yes. So to me it was like incredibly disingenuous. You had all these people and a lot of them are angry and they're doing fine. Yeah. Like some of them are telling like some of these people are, have their own shows and they're getting angry at Louie and getting angry.

Speaker 1:          03:06          And I'm like, there's a, there's a real, because here's the thing are you should fear told me something made a lot of sense once he goes, it's, it can really be a waste to get into this type of business and ended up in an office writing for show you don't care about in a job. You hate punching a clock. And that stuck with me and always like, it might be harder to go the other way and to build a fan base and to do what you want, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be better in the end and you're not going to be angry. You're not going to be resentful. And I think a lot of the people that were were against shitting on his comedy, not so much his behavior, but it's comedy are people that are, would want more in this than they have.

Speaker 1:          03:45          And they're resentful at guys like Louie because it, it's not fair how talented he is. Well, it's not just how talented he is, his work ethic, every factors, the risks that he does take. I mean, he, he says controversial things. He always has. Whether you agree or not. Like one of the things about the Parkland thing, you know, when he got in trouble about, uh, you know, say that all you did was put some fat kid out of the way. Yeah. That is so consistent with his material. The idea that anybody's saying like, oh my God, he's punching down. Like you need to go review his material. Right. Because he said a lot of risky shit because it was funny and he had really good points about it. Yeah. No. Is that something that I would joke about? Probably not, but he did. You wouldn't talk about fat people?

Speaker 1:          04:32          Uh, yes I would, but I don't think I would joke about kids getting shot. It's a tough take. Yeah. Funny. But that's what I, yeah, but I think he could. I think honestly we were, you're dealing with first of all the embryo of a bit. I mean he's really only been doing standup again for a couple of months. If back then it was even less and I think ultimately his idea that bet is that bit rather is that kids today like they want to be a VA and have them and they have 78 different genders and why am I, why are you interested? You're interesting because you didn't get shot. Right. That is his take on it and he probably with overall reaction and anticipation of reaction probably would have eliminated that part of the bit. Sure. And you know what I'm saying, like you know how it works and destruct. I think part of it is too, I was attracted to comedy because of guys like Bill Hicks or Patricia, that people that can think the things that those guys said. You could only say on a stage if you were really funny. Right. That's what I love about comedy. Me Too. That doesn't mean that everyone has to love that. There's people that love it for a million different reasons. Sure.
