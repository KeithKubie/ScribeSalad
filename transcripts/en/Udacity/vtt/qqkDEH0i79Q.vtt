Let's take the teapot shader and vary its color with location. Here's what the

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:07.814
function should do. You want to multiply diffuse by one half plus one half

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:13.246
times the sine of u scale times position x, y, and z. For this position value,

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.543
use v model position, which is provided. The function here makes sine waves

00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:21.158
through space in three directions. Normally a sine wave goes from negative one

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.344
to one. We want to scale it so that it's between zero and one. So these

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:29.265
one-halves bring that into range. The result will look like this when you're

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.880
done. Try out the slider to change the overall scale of the function.
