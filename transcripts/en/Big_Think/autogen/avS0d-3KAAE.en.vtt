00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.029
when I was young I didn't really notice

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.039
when I was young I didn't really notice
 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.420
when I was young I didn't really notice
that it was asymmetric I didn't notice a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
that it was asymmetric I didn't notice a
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.720
that it was asymmetric I didn't notice a
lot of things when I was young but but

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730
lot of things when I was young but but
 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.200
lot of things when I was young but but
so it wasn't so hard doing you know

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210
so it wasn't so hard doing you know
 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.729
so it wasn't so hard doing you know
trying to do physics and because I

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739
trying to do physics and because I
 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.260
trying to do physics and because I
didn't take it very seriously because I

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270
didn't take it very seriously because I
 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.310
didn't take it very seriously because I
definitely want to be a physicist I

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320
definitely want to be a physicist I
 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.450
definitely want to be a physicist I
didn't have to worry about the fact that

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460
didn't have to worry about the fact that
 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.679
didn't have to worry about the fact that
other people didn't think I was very

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689
other people didn't think I was very
 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.500
other people didn't think I was very
good at it it didn't really matter to me

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510
good at it it didn't really matter to me
 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.819
good at it it didn't really matter to me
in fact what mattered to me was that I

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829
in fact what mattered to me was that I
 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.799
in fact what mattered to me was that I
was interested in it not that what

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809
was interested in it not that what
 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.340
was interested in it not that what
people thought of me amazingly enough

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350
people thought of me amazingly enough
 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.510
people thought of me amazingly enough
lately I worry about what people think

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520
lately I worry about what people think
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.040
lately I worry about what people think
of me I don't know what happened I think

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050
of me I don't know what happened I think
 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.040
of me I don't know what happened I think
it could be the change the life change

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050
it could be the change the life change
 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.090
it could be the change the life change
but the kind of problems I had were ones

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100
but the kind of problems I had were ones
 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.420
but the kind of problems I had were ones
of being it was hard to focus it I

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430
of being it was hard to focus it I
 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.280
of being it was hard to focus it I
didn't have a lot of confidence and and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
didn't have a lot of confidence and and
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.899
didn't have a lot of confidence and and
people were always trying to kiss you

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909
people were always trying to kiss you
 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.620
people were always trying to kiss you
and stuff like that like that you'd be

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
and stuff like that like that you'd be
 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.180
and stuff like that like that you'd be
doing problems that's with somebody and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190
doing problems that's with somebody and
 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.649
doing problems that's with somebody and
you'd be thinking about the physics and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659
you'd be thinking about the physics and
 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.030
you'd be thinking about the physics and
they'd be thinking about your lips

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040
they'd be thinking about your lips
 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.789
they'd be thinking about your lips
alright you know you're whatever and and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799
alright you know you're whatever and and
 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.740
alright you know you're whatever and and
that's complicated

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.590
so I actually I've been there a long

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600
so I actually I've been there a long
 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.300
so I actually I've been there a long
time I've been in Harvard for 22 years

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310
time I've been in Harvard for 22 years
 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.610
time I've been in Harvard for 22 years
and the thing I really like about the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620
and the thing I really like about the
 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.150
and the thing I really like about the
physics department there is that

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160
physics department there is that
 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.160
physics department there is that
everybody is so confident and everybody

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
everybody is so confident and everybody
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.420
everybody is so confident and everybody
think it has such a high opinion of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430
think it has such a high opinion of
 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.130
think it has such a high opinion of
themselves they don't really worry about

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140
themselves they don't really worry about
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.710
themselves they don't really worry about
you know they're not threatened by me at

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720
you know they're not threatened by me at
 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.010
you know they're not threatened by me at
all except when I try it try and be

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020
all except when I try it try and be
 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.720
all except when I try it try and be
really threatening some of them who were

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730
really threatening some of them who were
 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.220
really threatening some of them who were
smaller than I am but but but that's

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230
smaller than I am but but but that's
 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.720
smaller than I am but but but that's
what that's one thing that I really like

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730
what that's one thing that I really like
 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.850
what that's one thing that I really like
about it you know and the other thing is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
about it you know and the other thing is
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.190
about it you know and the other thing is
you know I was the first woman there and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
you know I was the first woman there and
 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.170
you know I was the first woman there and
they they had a little problem I mean

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180
they they had a little problem I mean
 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.760
they they had a little problem I mean
the first woman who had ten years so I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770
the first woman who had ten years so I
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.870
the first woman who had ten years so I
was the first woman who went to for

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
was the first woman who went to for
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.469
was the first woman who went to for
instance a senior faculty meeting of the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
instance a senior faculty meeting of the
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.190
instance a senior faculty meeting of the
senior faculty and I remember after a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
senior faculty and I remember after a
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.260
senior faculty and I remember after a
few faculty meetings professor came up

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270
few faculty meetings professor came up
 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.030
few faculty meetings professor came up
to me and said you know it might be a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
to me and said you know it might be a
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.710
to me and said you know it might be a
little easier for everyone if you just

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
little easier for everyone if you just
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.410
little easier for everyone if you just
talked less because we're really not

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
talked less because we're really not
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.580
talked less because we're really not
used to having a woman at all in the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590
used to having a woman at all in the
 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860
used to having a woman at all in the
room and then one who talks so much is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
room and then one who talks so much is
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.130
room and then one who talks so much is
it it's a little bit disconcerting so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
it it's a little bit disconcerting so
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.350
it it's a little bit disconcerting so
that was interesting people people have

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
that was interesting people people have
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.050
that was interesting people people have
been generally pretty nice but you know

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
been generally pretty nice but you know
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.410
been generally pretty nice but you know
people in physics can be less evolved

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
people in physics can be less evolved
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.530
people in physics can be less evolved
socially than other people so you have

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
socially than other people so you have
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.950
socially than other people so you have
to deal with that
