00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, solving problems using ratios and geometry

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is something that was very popular in the time of Galileo.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today, it's more common to see equations. Isn't that right, Professor?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For Galileo, mathematics was geometry.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You find, for instance, the law of free fall expressed not in an equation

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we're familiar with but in terms of ratios.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is to this as that is to that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, let's review what we've learned about motion.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We've learned what position, velocity, and acceleration are,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and these are the key words we use to describe motion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We've defined them in terms of each other.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
For example, velocity is defined in terms of a change in position.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We've given units to position and velocity.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We'll get there for acceleration.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And now we've found something truly incredible.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A mathematical relationship between time and position for an object in free fall.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, put yourself in Galileo's shoes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Imagine being the first person to realize that nature not only behaves predictably,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but in a way that we can describe using mathematics.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's truly a beautiful thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
From this Galileo actually inferred that acceleration is constant.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What Galileo meant by "constant acceleration" was that no matter where you were in the world,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
whether you were in Pisa or Peru,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
if you drop an object, it will fall at a constant rate.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The acceleration will be the same everywhere and for all objects.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, to better understand this idea, let's talk about the units of acceleration a little bit more.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, the units are meters per second per second.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Notice that these units include both a time interval—a second—

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and a speed—meters per second.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This sort of hints at the definition for constant acceleration,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which just means an object gains equal speed during equal time intervals.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If we drop an object, and it starts at rest,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and after 1 second it has a speed of 10 m/s,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
meaning that it's gained 10 m/s of speed in that first second,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
what will its speed be after 2 seconds?

00:01:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This can be a subtle point, so don't worry if you don't get it right on your first try.
