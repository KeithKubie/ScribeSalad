00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.870
Hey there. I am Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology and today

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.200
we're continuing with pantheons, and one that is likely to be a viewer favorite.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Bring on the ouzo,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.469
pour out some nectar,

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.000
It's the Greeks!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.320
Opa!!!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.000
War,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.500
War, hunting,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.200
War, hunting, metallurgy,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.000
War, hunting, metallurgy, 
the complete inability to deal reasonably with even the smallest bit of conflict...

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.440
and also, rape while disguised as an animal.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.800
And best of all we already know the Greeks from paintings and sculptures,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.060
and those really long books...

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.200
and the Clash of the Titans movies. And also--

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.500
OPA!!

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.200
(crash)

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.100
*Egyptian myth-facts*

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
*Greek myth-facts*

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.600
*Indian myth-facts*

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.500
*Norse myth-facts*

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
*So much myths, guys!*

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
You might be thinking: wait a minute...

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.500
Didn't we already talk about Greek gods in the episode on creation stories?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
--And you're right, we did!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
-And you're right, we did! 
But that was the FIRST set of Greek gods.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.000
Two whole dynasties of divinities had to be overthrown before we get to the Olympians,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.420
But before we get into all the sex, ambrosia and petty conflict, let's define some terms:

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.000
We've been talking about Pantheons as groups of gods,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
mainly because us classics nerds like to show off our knowledge of Greek and Latin.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.900
National Latin Award Scholar right here,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.700
National Latin Award Scholar right here, folks.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.200
Anyway-

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.900
PANTHEON

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.400
PANTHEON
-means-

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.350
PANTHEON
-means-
ALL THE GODS

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.000
Which..

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.200
Which.. is already a little weird.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.790
There are many gods,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.200
and they change based upon which versions of the myths you're studying.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
And then there are demigods, and maybe even some heroes.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Gods, as we are using the term,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.900
are divine immortal beings,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.100
usually created out of the sexual union between other immortal beings,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.320
or sometimes out of some unorthodox nativity--

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.800
--like we saw with Aphrodite..

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.300
--like we saw with Aphrodite..
and the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.800
--like we saw with Aphrodite..
and the bloody

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.720
--like we saw with Aphrodite..
and the bloody testicle foam.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.760
Demigods are minor deities or the offspring of gods and mortals.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.320
They usually have special powers and sometimes can become truly divine.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.320
Heroes are exalted mortals, meaning they can die but they can also perform special feats on Earth.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.240
Sometimes they're the offspring of a god and a human,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.000
sometimes they're just..

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
sometimes they're just.. lucky.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.080
sometimes they're just.. lucky.
You know, like pop stars.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.320
Remember Gaia and Uranos and their offspring the Titans?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.800
Let's refresh.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
These are the first and second sets of Greek gods.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.280
The titans were led by Kronos who overthrew Uranos,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.760
and Kronos was so worried about his own children overthrowing him that he swallowed them.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.980
That did not work out for him.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.940
Whoops.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.820
Then, like father, like son, Zeus, son of Kronos and Rhea decided to overthrow his father.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.740
He and his siblings defeated the Titans and became the first Olympians.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000
Roll-call:

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Hestia, the first child of Kronos and Rhea, became the goddess of the hearth and home.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.460
She's not in many myths,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
but was an important household deity honored with many sacrifices.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.740
Hades was the God of the underworld, who you'll remember from the story of Persephone from episode one.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.660
Kore's mother was Demeter, another child of Kronos and Rhea, and the goddess of agriculture.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
That's right. She has amazing powers over wheat, figs, and olives;

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800
kind of a big deal in an agrarian society.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.340
Poseidon became the Lord of the Seas after the Titans' defeat.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.190
He was associated with earthquakes and horses and was even the father of a famous one: Pegasus,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.200
Whose mother..

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.720
Whose mother.. was Medusa.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.900
(Snake-Hair Lady)

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.400
(Snake-Hair Lady) +

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.100
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover)

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.900
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) =

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.400
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) = (Magic Stallion)

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.200
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) = (Magic Stallion)
So, yeah...

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.000
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) = (Magic Stallion)
So, yeah... it checks out.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.500
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) = (Magic Stallion)
So, yeah... it checks out.  God

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.200
(Snake-Hair Lady) + (Water-King/Horse-Lover) = (Magic Stallion)
So, yeah... it checks out.  God DNA is weird.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.500
Zeus was the last of the Olympians born to Kronos and Rhea and became the most important:

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.000
he's the sky god, controlling storms and wielding a thunderbolt!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.500
Which, I think it's pretty fair to say,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.000
Which, I think it's pretty fair to say,
is a boss thing to wield

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
--which makes sense, because he's also the patriarch of the Olympians,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.000
despite being the youngest.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.290
He was the leader of the revolt over the titans plus

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.560
he was the baby-daddy of so many gods and mortals;

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.020
so he gets to wave his bolt around and tell everyone what to do, I guess.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.240
Zeus was the father of the next generation of Olympians with a variety of wives, consorts and, depending upon

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.800
how you read it, numerous one-night stands..

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.140
..or rape victims.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.200
His first wife was Metis, who was from the Titans' generation.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.900
An older woman, the word 'Metis' means 'skill,' or 'cunning.'

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.000
and she was said to provide wise counsel to Zeus

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.460
and because wise counselors often give advice that rulers don't want to hear,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.060
Zeus swallowed her.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.320
It's possible that Metis is the mother of Athena, although it's hard to know because of how she was...

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.800
um...

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640
um...born?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.800
According to one version of Athena's birth, Zeus had a terrible headache,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.900
and asked his son Hephaestus to help cure it.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.200
Since this is pre-Motrin, Hephaestus literally

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200
Cracked open Zeus' skull..

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.860
Cracked open Zeus' skull..
and out popped Athena,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.100
a goddess of wisdom, war and the arts,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.700
a goddess of wisdom, war and the arts, 
especially spinning and weaving.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.780
She was wearing a full suit of armor, and Athena created the olive tree,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.600
so she's the patroness of Athens and why we now have tapenade.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.800
Incidentally, this is also why

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.300
Incidentally, this is also why
Hephaestus

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000
Incidentally, this is also why
Hephaestus is not

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.500
Incidentally, this is also why
Hephaestus is not the god

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.180
Incidentally, this is also why
Hephaestus is not the god of doctors.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.020
Zeus' second wife was Demeter with whom he fathered Kore.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.500
Hey, gurl!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.000
Hey, gurl!
Remember? Because Kore means..

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.800
Hey gurl!
Remember? Because Kore means.. girl?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.900
Hey gurl!
Remember? Because Kore means.. girl?
(these are the jokes, people.)

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.480
Anyway, that relationship didn't last, and Zeus married her sister, Hera.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.100
Good thing that there's no god of awkwaaard...

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.500
Hera was sometimes associated with childbirth, but mostly her thing was being miffed at Zeus.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.740
Hera and Zeus had four children:

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.380
Hebe, a goddess of youth and the cupbearer to the Olympians, who married Hercules;

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.180
Eileithyia, who was a goddess of childbirth;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.680
the other two children, Hephaestus and Ares, showed up in a number of myths.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.800
Hephaestus, a smith who walks with a limp, is the god of fire and crafts.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.940
Ares is a god of war, more about, like, carnage than strategy, and they both have a thing for Aphrodite.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.320
Because everyone has a thing for Aphrodite.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.820
Zeus' liaisons resulted in other Olympians as well, for instance:

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.580
with Leto, whose parents were Titans, zeus fathered the twins Apollo and Artemis.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.300
Apollo became the god of the sun and music.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.840
Also, moderation, because that was something that Greeks needed a god for.

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.329
Artemis was associated with the moon and with the hunt.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.060
Like Athena, Artemis was a virgin goddess and she'd sometimes tear apart the bodies of men who saw her naked.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.640
The final child of Zeus to become a member of the Olympian pantheon is his son with Maia,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.440
the daughter of the demigod Atlas, who holds up the world.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.320
This is Hermes, the god of the road and of travellers. He's Zeus' messenger, who also leads people to Hades.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.380
Hermes had a winged hat and winged sandals way before Adidas JS wings

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.400
He's a trickster who often makes sharp deals, and he's a god of writing and magic,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.220
which basically makes him the Hellenised version of Thoth. High five, Thoth!

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.320
Get you some feathered kicks, my dude.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.540
The final member of the Olympian pantheon we need to discuss is the one David Leeming calls:

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.440
at once the most ambiguous and the most foreign of the Greek gods:

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.280
Dionysus, the god of wine.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.100
Dionysus had an unusual birth. After consorting with Zeus,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.340
his human mother Semele made a wish to see Zeus in his true form.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.480
Regrettable. When Zeus revealed himself, his godly presence burned Semele to a crisp.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.240
Zeus saved the embryonic Dionysus and sewed him up in his thigh,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.000
from which he was later born. Now, there's archaeological evidence that Dionysus was worshipped

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.440
in the ancient Greek city of Mycenae as early as 1200 BCE, but many stories portray Dionysus as a foreigner.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.900
A bunch of greek gods originated as deities associated with cults from different cities:

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.860
Artemis was probably a great mother goddess in Anatolia for instance, but Dionysus?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.680
homegrown! Or home-sown, I guess. So why is he considered foreign?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:33.100
Maybe it's because Dionysus represents human traits that are very different from the idealized self-control of Apollo

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.840
Dionysus is called the God of wine, but he's more a god of abandon, or disinhibition.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.340
According to Thurry and Devinney, "the Greeks experienced the power of Dionysus not as drunkenness,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.480
but as a kind of fervent inspiration,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.480
a religious experience in which the worshippers' instincts were liberated

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.780
from the bondage of social custom."

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.580
The Romans called this the bacchanal, after their version of Dionysus, Bacchus.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.580
The cultic rituals of Dionysus are performed by women called Maenads, who leave home, go into the woods and

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.780
drink and dance and hunt and tear wild animals to pieces as a sacrifice.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.000
Yeah, it's all beer pong and keg stands until the ladies start devouring the flesh of still living beasts.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.720
No wonder the Dionysus was psychologically challenging for the Greeks.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.180
Before we finish up, I need to mention the Romans,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.120
who borrowed heavily from all of the people they conquered.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.680
They imported some of the Greek gods directly into their pantheon.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.880
Others were native gods reimagined as Greek equivalents.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.240
So Minerva, an Etruscan goddess and patron of crafts, became Athena.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.780
Diana, an Italian woodland goddess was transformed into Artemis the huntress, and so on.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.080
So here's a handy chart of all of the parallels between the Greek and Roman pantheons.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.560
The Romans did have some original gods, like Janus, the god of doors and arches, from whom we get January,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.460
so you can blame him for the bleak weather.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.020
Or Persephone. Or Hades. Or just pomegranates.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.580
And in the imperial period they started turning their emperors into gods.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.600
But the Romans didn't tend to develop their own myths around these borrowed gods.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.040
Their most important myth concerned the history of Rome itself;

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.780
we'll talk about that in a future episode, so for now, let's get back to gods behaving badly.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.540
Take it away, Thought Bubble. Olympian adultery was a lot like the trains in Europe:

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.540
reliable and frequent. For example, Aphrodite was often unfaithful to her husband Hephaestus,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:34.340
but none of her affairs called as much trouble as the time she was caught with the god of war.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:40.940
As told in the Odyssey, Helios the sun god spotted Aphrodite in bed with Ares and told Hephaestus.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:47.420
So Hephaestus created a magical net so fine that it could hardly be seen,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.320
but it was strong enough so that no one could escape it.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.660
He set his trap over the bed and then pretended to go off to Lemnos, where he had his volcanic forge.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.860
Seeing him go, Ares and Aphrodite went to bed.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.220
As they lay together, Hephaestus' gossamer chains fell on them and bound them together.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.680
As soon as Helios told Hephaestus that his wife and her lover were together, he rushed back to his house.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.960
He cried out to all of the gods: "Father Zeus and every other blessed immortal, hither to me, and see a jest

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.820
which is unpardonable. Because I am crippled, Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, does me dishonor,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.920
preferring Ares, beautiful and straight of limb while I was born crooked.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.140
And whose fault is that, if not my parents'? Would they had not brought me into this life!

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.240
Look how these two are clipped together in love's embrace,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.140
here, in my very bed. To watch them cuts me to the heart."

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.160
The rest of the gods showed up and loled heartily as gods do,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.080
both at Ares and Aphrodite caught in the net, but also at Hephaestus himself,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.280
with Hermes and Apollo joking that they would be

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.020
perfectly happy to be caught in such a net with the goddess of love,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.360
because everyone has a thing for Aphrodite.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.820
Thank you Thought Bubble. So this brings us to a question that we haven't really looked at with our other pantheons:

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.840
What does the Olympian pantheon tell us about the Greeks?

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:14.020
According to David Leeming, it suggests how they understood themselves and their society.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.260
"More than any other pantheon, the Greek hierarchy of gods and goddesses is modelled on human families.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.100
The official Olympian gods, the family of Mount Olympus headed by Zeus

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.780
is simply the most powerful of Greek families. Like other members of the rich and powerful classes,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:37.440
the Olympian family is marred by instances of immorality, arrogance and stubbornness...

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.940
They were not to be trusted and they could not be counted on for mercy.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:47.740
They were an exaggerated version of what a human family might become is endowed with infinite power.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.700
They were a mirror of human nature itself.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.400
And it's a good thing, too: mirrors are the only way you can even look at Medusa.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.640
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.
