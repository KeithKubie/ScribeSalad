gassy Jason but yeah Plus at the same
 

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.170
gassy Jason but yeah Plus at the same
time you let's say you are playing God

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180
time you let's say you are playing God
 

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.640
time you let's say you are playing God
you lose track of what some of the

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:47.650
you lose track of what some of the
 

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.380
you lose track of what some of the
characters you're not going to be able

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:49.390
characters you're not going to be able
 

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.090
characters you're not going to be able
to keep track of everything that's going

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.100
to keep track of everything that's going
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.850
to keep track of everything that's going
on like you've had Marceline and Butler

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:53.860
on like you've had Marceline and Butler
 

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.770
on like you've had Marceline and Butler
peppermint Butler what was wrong with

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:55.780
peppermint Butler what was wrong with
 

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.240
peppermint Butler what was wrong with
peppermint Butler he was half gone yeah

00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.250
peppermint Butler he was half gone yeah
 

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.190
peppermint Butler he was half gone yeah
Finn has just kind of lost track you

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.200
Finn has just kind of lost track you
 

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.200
Finn has just kind of lost track you
can't keep track of all of them um you

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.210
can't keep track of all of them um you
 

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.930
can't keep track of all of them um you
know he's not omnipresent he doesn't see

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:06.940
know he's not omnipresent he doesn't see
 

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.760
know he's not omnipresent he doesn't see
and know everything that's going on I

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:08.770
and know everything that's going on I
 

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.200
and know everything that's going on I
remember he even already made the

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.210
remember he even already made the
 

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.810
remember he even already made the
distinction of the c-listers compared to

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:12.820
distinction of the c-listers compared to
 

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.970
distinction of the c-listers compared to
the a-listers and it's like you know

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:14.980
the a-listers and it's like you know
 

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.060
the a-listers and it's like you know
he's no

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.070
he's no
 

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.740
he's no
and I think he finally realized that

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:17.750
and I think he finally realized that
 

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.320
and I think he finally realized that
especially when his own character was

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.330
especially when his own character was
 

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.620
especially when his own character was
like on the edge ready to die well and I

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:23.630
like on the edge ready to die well and I
 

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.990
like on the edge ready to die well and I
think it was clever too that they didn't

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000
think it was clever too that they didn't
 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.730
think it was clever too that they didn't
talk like them they all had the Charlie

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:27.740
talk like them they all had the Charlie
 

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.300
talk like them they all had the Charlie
Brown and all it's a thing even in their

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:31.310
Brown and all it's a thing even in their
 

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.730
Brown and all it's a thing even in their
own point of view you know where Vince

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:33.740
own point of view you know where Vince
 

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.390
own point of view you know where Vince
the cloud got or whatever they I thought

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:37.400
the cloud got or whatever they I thought
 

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.920
the cloud got or whatever they I thought
that's clever because that still creates

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:38.930
that's clever because that still creates
 

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.740
that's clever because that still creates
a little bit of a separation like it's

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:41.750
a little bit of a separation like it's
 

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.130
a little bit of a separation like it's
not quite us yeah and I think then maybe

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.140
not quite us yeah and I think then maybe
 

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.350
not quite us yeah and I think then maybe
cuz if they were talking like us the

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360
cuz if they were talking like us the
 

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.110
cuz if they were talking like us the
whole time I think we'd all seep in is

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120
whole time I think we'd all seep in is
 

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.460
whole time I think we'd all seep in is
just like the biggest most evil person

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:51.470
just like the biggest most evil person
 

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.810
just like the biggest most evil person
in the world or something for him doing

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:52.820
in the world or something for him doing
 

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.730
in the world or something for him doing
all this stuff up because there is that

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:54.740
all this stuff up because there is that
 

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.560
all this stuff up because there is that
distinction of the language and it's

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:56.570
distinction of the language and it's
 

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.320
distinction of the language and it's
it's another filter of understanding

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.330
it's another filter of understanding
 

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.480
it's another filter of understanding
them it makes it a little bit more

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:01.490
them it makes it a little bit more
 

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.370
them it makes it a little bit more
understandable other kind of like toys

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.380
understandable other kind of like toys
 

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.590
understandable other kind of like toys
right or are they I mean they seem to be

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600
right or are they I mean they seem to be
 

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.720
right or are they I mean they seem to be
happy yet wherever they are they're in a

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:07.730
happy yet wherever they are they're in a
 

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.550
happy yet wherever they are they're in a
bag they're not like hey what's going on

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560
bag they're not like hey what's going on
 

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.930

here or unconcerned they're just so

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:10.940
here or unconcerned they're just so
 

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.150
here or unconcerned they're just so
going along with whatever so they're in

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160
going along with whatever so they're in
 

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.580
going along with whatever so they're in
their own kind of environment I thought

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:15.590
their own kind of environment I thought
 

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.010
their own kind of environment I thought
was clever too that you sort of see what

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.020
was clever too that you sort of see what
 

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.450
was clever too that you sort of see what
their environment is too that they see
