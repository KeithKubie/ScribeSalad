ERIC ROBERSON: This song is on
the new album, which is called

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.630
"Mister Nice Guy." And you can
start it, because I want to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.530
talk a little while you
play this part.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.080
But the song was inspired
by my grandfather,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.670
amazing, wise man.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.430
And he lived in North Carolina,
in a little town

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.670
called Stokes.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.190
And in that little town
called Stokes,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.950
there was little house.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.830
And in that little
house was a man.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.980
And that man was my grandfather,
who would have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.080
these amazing talks in the
front of the house.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.040
And one time, he said,
Eric, I'm not

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.660
into hugging in church.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.885
Now, he was a pastor in a little
church down the street

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.680
on a dirt road.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.485
He said, Eric, I'm not into
hugging in church.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.100
So I sat up and said, what?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.620
He said, because I'm a man.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.690
And if you touch me, I'm
gonna feel something.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:11.590
ERIC ROBERSON: Now, now Lourae,
that Lourae in that

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.210
kitchen there?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.426
Oh, I love Lourae.

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:21.310
I love Lourae enough to
understand that I'm a man.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.660
So Eric, sometimes it's just
better to just shake her hand

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:36.915
and walk away, because
it helps me, man.

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:40.510
I want to dedicate this song to
that one particular woman

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.360
in this room who thought she
had a shot with me tonight.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:54.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.465
ERIC ROBERSON: Oh, I apologize.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:01:58.170
Oh!

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.346
I can hear somebody in
the back going, damn.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.690
I apologize.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.786
I apologize for my silliness.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:14.770
God.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.738
OK.

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:17.988
Please come back.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:25.594
OK, so can I stop talking?

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:36.684
