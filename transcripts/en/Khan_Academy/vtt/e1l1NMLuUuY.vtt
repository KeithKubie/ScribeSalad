00:00:00.894 --> 00:00:01.855
- [Instructor] Just for kicks,

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:05.168
let's imagine someone
spinning a flaming tennis ball

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:08.446
attached to some type of a string or chain

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:12.000
that they're spinning it
above their head like this

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.929
and let's say they're spinning
it at a constant speed.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.423
We've already described
situations like this,

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:20.409
maybe not with as much drama as this one

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.919
but we can visualize the velocity vectors

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.746
at different points for the ball.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.044
So, at this point, let's
say the velocity vector

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:29.995
will look like this,

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:33.699
the linear velocity vector
just to be super clear.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.731
So, the linear velocity vector

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:36.335
might look something like that

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.305
and it's going to have magnitude V,

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.780
the magnitude of the velocity vector

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.706
you could also view as its linear speed.

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.428
Now, a few moments later,

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:48.236
what is the ball going to be doing?

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.566
Well, a few moments later

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.521
the ball might be let's
say right over here,

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:53.757
we don't wanna lose the drama,

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:56.219
it's still flaming we're assuming,

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.219
it's still attached to
our chain right over here

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.804
but what would its velocity vector be?

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:07.521
Well, we're assuming it
has a constant speed,

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.253
a constant linear speed,

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:11.410
so the magnitude is going to be the same

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.343
but now the direction is
going to be tangential

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:16.422
to the circular path at that point.

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:19.744
So, our direction has changed.

00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.709
Now, one way to think about this change

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.428
in direction of velocity,

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:25.784
it's a little counterintuitive at first

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.403
because when we first
think about acceleration,

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:31.497
we tend to think in terms
of changing the magnitude

00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:35.120
of velocity but keeping
the magnitude the same,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.168
but changing the direction

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:38.629
still involves an acceleration

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:40.369
and at first, it's a
little counterintuitive

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.181
the direction of that acceleration

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.027
but if I were to take this
second velocity vector

00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:47.097
and if I were to shift it over here,

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:50.824
and if I were to start it
at the exact same point,

00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:53.657
it would look something like this,

00:01:57.957 --> 00:01:59.926
actually, let me do it in
a slightly different color

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:01.896
so it's a little bit more visible,

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:04.979
so it would look something like this.

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:07.963
This and this, they have the same length

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:10.362
and they're parallel, so
they are the same vector

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:11.814
and so, in some amount of time,

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.293
if you wanna go from this velocity vector

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.351
and actually this should
be a little bit longer,

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:18.519
this should look like this,

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.816
it should have the same
magnitude as this one,

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:23.149
so it should look like this.

00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:25.787
So, if in some amount of time,

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:27.860
this and this should
have the same magnitude.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.970
If in some amount of time

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.026
you go from this velocity vector

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.065
to this velocity vector,

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:33.997
your net change in velocity

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:36.624
is going radially inward.

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:40.791
This right over here is
your net change in velocity

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:45.097
and so, in other videos

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:48.241
we talk about this notion
of centripetal acceleration.

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.381
In order to keep something going

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.520
in this uniform circular motion,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.117
in order to keep changing the direction

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.394
of our velocity vector,

00:02:56.394 --> 00:03:00.532
you are accelerating it radially inward,

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:03.471
centripetal acceleration,
inward acceleration

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.246
and so, at all points in time,

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.230
you have an inward acceleration

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.278
which we denote, the magnitude,

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:13.324
we usually say is A with a
C subscript for centripetal.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:17.443
Sometimes you'll see an A
with an R subscript for radial

00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:21.046
but in this context we
will use centripetal.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:23.898
Now, one question that you
might have been wondering

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:25.140
this whole time that we talked

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.807
about centripetal acceleration

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:29.777
is Newton's First Law might be nagging.

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.581
Newton's First Law tells
us that the velocity

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.180
of an object both it's
magnitude and its direction

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.252
will not change unless
there's some net force

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.167
acting on the object

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.590
and we clearly see here

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.323
that the direction of our
velocity vector is changing,

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:47.951
so Newton's First Law tells us

00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.360
that there must be some
net force acting on it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.243
and that net force is going to be acting

00:03:54.243 --> 00:03:58.187
in the same direction as our acceleration

00:03:58.187 --> 00:03:59.486
and so, what we're gonna do here

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:02.986
is introduce an idea of centripetal force.

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:04.810
So, centripetal force,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.070
if it's accelerating the object inwards

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.681
in the inward direction,

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.181
so we have a centripetal force

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:18.368
that is causing our
centripetal acceleration.

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.011
F sub C right over here,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.795
you can view that as the
magnitude of our centripetal force

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.414
and the way that they would be connected

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:27.151
comes straight out for
Newton's Second Law.

00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:29.982
This isn't some type of new,
different type of force,

00:04:29.982 --> 00:04:31.402
this is the same type of forces

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:33.413
that we talk about throughout physics.

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:37.134
We know that the magnitude
of our centripetal force

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:41.336
is going to be equal to
the mass of our object

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:45.503
times the magnitude of our
centripetal acceleration.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:50.242
If you want, you could put
vectors on top of this.

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:52.451
You could say something like this

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:57.125
but we know the direction
of the centripetal force

00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.666
and the centripetal
acceleration, it is inward.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.932
Now, what inward means,

00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.686
the exact arrow's going to be different

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.476
at different points but for
any position for the ball

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:07.183
we know at least conceptually

00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:09.557
what inward is going to be.

00:05:09.557 --> 00:05:11.989
So, this is just to appreciate the idea.

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.097
Centripetal acceleration
in classical mechanics

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:17.544
isn't just going to
show up out of nowhere.

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:18.729
Newton's First Law tells us

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.692
that if something is being accelerated,

00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:23.100
there must be a net force acting on it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.753
and if it's being accelerated inward

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:30.328
in the centripetal direction
I guess you could say,

00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:33.817
then the force must also be acting inward

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:36.606
and they would just be
related by F equals MA

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.450
which we learn from Newton's Second Law.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.217
And to appreciate the intuition for this,

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.664
just remember the last time

00:05:43.664 --> 00:05:47.647
that you were spinning or
rotating a flaming tennis ball

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.395
attached to a chain above your head.

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:53.566
In order to do that, in order
to keep the ball spinning

00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:55.953
and not just going and veering
off in a straight line,

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:59.370
you can keep pulling inward on your chain

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.212
so that the flaming tennis
ball doesn't go hit a wall

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:05.207
and set things onto fire.

00:06:05.207 --> 00:06:08.273
And so, what you are providing
is that centripetal force

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.323
to keep that flaming tennis ball

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:12.990
in its uniform circular motion.
