being classic I'm looking on there and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
being classic I'm looking on there and
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.069
being classic I'm looking on there and
the other thing that's evil about this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
the other thing that's evil about this
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049
the other thing that's evil about this
is that there's actually thirty-one

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
is that there's actually thirty-one
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240
is that there's actually thirty-one
digits and of course thirty one is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
digits and of course thirty one is
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820
digits and of course thirty one is
thirteen backwards isn't it so this is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
thirteen backwards isn't it so this is
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910
thirteen backwards isn't it so this is
this is a fundamentally evil number it's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
this is a fundamentally evil number it's
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250
this is a fundamentally evil number it's
one of a larger class of numbers which

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
one of a larger class of numbers which
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469
one of a larger class of numbers which
are called the Bell figure numbers so a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
are called the Bell figure numbers so a
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990
are called the Bell figure numbers so a
bell figure number is basically anything

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000
bell figure number is basically anything
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.289
bell figure number is basically anything
so B of n so the nth Bell figure number

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
so B of n so the nth Bell figure number
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.340
so B of n so the nth Bell figure number
is a one with n zeros 666 and then

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
is a one with n zeros 666 and then
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219
is a one with n zeros 666 and then
another n zeroes and then a one okay so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
another n zeroes and then a one okay so
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050
another n zeroes and then a one okay so
any Bell figure number as this form you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
any Bell figure number as this form you
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.700
any Bell figure number as this form you
want to be fancy about it and writer a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
want to be fancy about it and writer a
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130
want to be fancy about it and writer a
nice formula for it the formal eight you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
nice formula for it the formal eight you
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410
nice formula for it the formal eight you
would write is this is 10 to the n plus

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
would write is this is 10 to the n plus
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.969
would write is this is 10 to the n plus
3 plus 6 6 6 times 10 to the n plus one

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979
3 plus 6 6 6 times 10 to the n plus one
 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.160
3 plus 6 6 6 times 10 to the n plus one
plus one these are the Bell figure

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
plus one these are the Bell figure
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899
plus one these are the Bell figure
numbers now the vast majority of them

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
numbers now the vast majority of them
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510
numbers now the vast majority of them
and not prime okay so which ones are

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
and not prime okay so which ones are
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940
and not prime okay so which ones are
prime well of course for N equals 13

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
prime well of course for N equals 13
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950
prime well of course for N equals 13
it's a prime number because that's our

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
it's a prime number because that's our
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.100
it's a prime number because that's our
classic Bell figure prime N equals zero

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
classic Bell figure prime N equals zero
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.249
classic Bell figure prime N equals zero
is also a prime number so that's of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
is also a prime number so that's of
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.429
is also a prime number so that's of
course this guy right and this is also

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
course this guy right and this is also
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319
course this guy right and this is also
very this so this is another example of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
very this so this is another example of
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.429
very this so this is another example of
a bell figure Prime and this is the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
a bell figure Prime and this is the
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.650
a bell figure Prime and this is the
classic one but this is another one and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
classic one but this is another one and
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330
classic one but this is another one and
this is quite interesting as well

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
this is quite interesting as well
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670
this is quite interesting as well
for other reasons

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
for other reasons
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.250
for other reasons
so this is the 1928 prime number okay so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260
so this is the 1928 prime number okay so
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.649
so this is the 1928 prime number okay so
this is a prime index and if you take

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659
this is a prime index and if you take
 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.360
this is a prime index and if you take
the numbers from here and add them

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
the numbers from here and add them
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390
the numbers from here and add them
together so one plus six plus six four

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
together so one plus six plus six four
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.490
together so one plus six plus six four
six plus one

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
six plus one
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.490
six plus one
well that's 20 and you take these

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
well that's 20 and you take these
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.780
well that's 20 and you take these
numbers and you add them together like

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
numbers and you add them together like
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.750
numbers and you add them together like
one plus nine plus two plus eight well

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
one plus nine plus two plus eight well
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.490
one plus nine plus two plus eight well
that's also 20 so that's weird

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
that's also 20 so that's weird
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.720
that's also 20 so that's weird
okay that's that's okay well let's not

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
okay that's that's okay well let's not
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.399
okay that's that's okay well let's not
start we're gonna get more tenuous Brady

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409
start we're gonna get more tenuous Brady
 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.610
start we're gonna get more tenuous Brady
though so this is also this one here as

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
though so this is also this one here as
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.619
though so this is also this one here as
well this particular Bell figure prime

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629
well this particular Bell figure prime
 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.589
well this particular Bell figure prime
is also a Republican Prime a Republican

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
is also a Republican Prime a Republican
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.690
is also a Republican Prime a Republican
plot Prime is any number which is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
plot Prime is any number which is
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.259
plot Prime is any number which is
essentially prime to the right okay so

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
essentially prime to the right okay so
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.460
essentially prime to the right okay so
it could be a Republican prime in

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
it could be a Republican prime in
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.379
it could be a Republican prime in
England supposed to be a Tory Prime okay

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389
England supposed to be a Tory Prime okay
 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.490
England supposed to be a Tory Prime okay
so it's prime to the right so you take

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
so it's prime to the right so you take
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.740
so it's prime to the right so you take
the right-hand side of the number not

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
the right-hand side of the number not
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.899
the right-hand side of the number not
count in the middle so in this case here

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909
count in the middle so in this case here
 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.809
count in the middle so in this case here
61 and that's a prime number so it's

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819
61 and that's a prime number so it's
 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.220
61 and that's a prime number so it's
kind of a coincidence that's I don't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
kind of a coincidence that's I don't
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.729
kind of a coincidence that's I don't
know what it says about Donald Trump but

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739
know what it says about Donald Trump but
 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.319
know what it says about Donald Trump but
this Bell figure prior is also a

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329
this Bell figure prior is also a
 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.509
this Bell figure prior is also a
Republican primal will leave you to

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
Republican primal will leave you to
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.490
Republican primal will leave you to
speculate on that yes you do you do

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
speculate on that yes you do you do
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960
speculate on that yes you do you do
that's of course if you take it to the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
that's of course if you take it to the
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330
that's of course if you take it to the
left yes because this is not an this is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
left yes because this is not an this is
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220
left yes because this is not an this is
clearly not a democratic frame because

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
clearly not a democratic frame because
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.099
clearly not a democratic frame because
16 is not not a prime number okay this

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109
16 is not not a prime number okay this
 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.210
16 is not not a prime number okay this
set of numbers these bell for good

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
set of numbers these bell for good
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.159

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.110
axes that he shoved into his computer
and to see if he could find examples of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
and to see if he could find examples of
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.809
and to see if he could find examples of
of prime numbers he came up with with

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819
of prime numbers he came up with with
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.009
of prime numbers he came up with with
there with this one there are a few

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019
there with this one there are a few
 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.199
there with this one there are a few
others there are more obviously N equals

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
others there are more obviously N equals
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.869
others there are more obviously N equals
42 it is one which is pretty interesting

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879
42 it is one which is pretty interesting
 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.270
42 it is one which is pretty interesting
because that's of course the meaning of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
because that's of course the meaning of
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.699
because that's of course the meaning of
life right n equals 506 is the next one

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
life right n equals 506 is the next one
 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.920
life right n equals 506 is the next one
and there's a whole tower of these okay

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930
and there's a whole tower of these okay
 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.890
and there's a whole tower of these okay
are there an infinite number well we

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900
are there an infinite number well we
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.240
are there an infinite number well we
don't know and the reason we definitely

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
don't know and the reason we definitely
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.640
don't know and the reason we definitely
don't know is because this is an example

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
don't know is because this is an example
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.310
don't know is because this is an example
of a palindromic prime so it obviously

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
of a palindromic prime so it obviously
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.159
of a palindromic prime so it obviously
looks the same forward backwards and we

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169
looks the same forward backwards and we
 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.510
looks the same forward backwards and we
don't know if there were an infinite

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520
don't know if there were an infinite
 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.010
don't know if there were an infinite
number of palindromic prime so we

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
number of palindromic prime so we
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.030
number of palindromic prime so we
certainly don't know there's an

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040
certainly don't know there's an
 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.740
certainly don't know there's an
infinite number of Bell figure primes

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
infinite number of Bell figure primes
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.620
infinite number of Bell figure primes
it's also a naughty prime obviously not

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630
it's also a naughty prime obviously not
 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.240
it's also a naughty prime obviously not
just because it's Bell figure it's an

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
just because it's Bell figure it's an
 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.040
just because it's Bell figure it's an
Aussie Prime and nor C prime is one that

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
Aussie Prime and nor C prime is one that
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.830
Aussie Prime and nor C prime is one that
has more notes or zeros than any other

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840
has more notes or zeros than any other
 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.140
has more notes or zeros than any other
number and of course this example does

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150
number and of course this example does
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.970
number and of course this example does
so it's a it's also an Aussie Prime

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980
so it's a it's also an Aussie Prime
 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.350
so it's a it's also an Aussie Prime
Northy prize yeah they're pretty cool

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
Northy prize yeah they're pretty cool
 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.830
Northy prize yeah they're pretty cool
army

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
army
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230
army
well it's lots of things it's a beastly

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240
well it's lots of things it's a beastly
 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.590
well it's lots of things it's a beastly
prime okay so a beastly prime is one

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600
prime okay so a beastly prime is one
 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.350
prime okay so a beastly prime is one
that has a six six six in it now this

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
that has a six six six in it now this
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.850
that has a six six six in it now this
one has it in a very special place right

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860
one has it in a very special place right
 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.740
one has it in a very special place right
in the middle right but a beastly prime

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750
in the middle right but a beastly prime
 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.810
in the middle right but a beastly prime
is one that has six six six so for

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820
is one that has six six six so for
 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.520
is one that has six six six so for
example another beastly prime is this

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530
example another beastly prime is this
 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.420

one six six six one two six six six nine
 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.370
one six six six one two six six six nine

I thought we should try to redress the
balance with a very good but if you'd
