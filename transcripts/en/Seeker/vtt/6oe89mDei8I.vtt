00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.640
I've finally figured it out.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.730
Prince must've been singing about ACID RAIN
that was BLUE.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.140
Because carbonic acid turns litmus paper red…

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.330
Blue plus red equals purple.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.780
If you know what I'm singing about up here.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.840
C'mon, raise your hand.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.000
Hello pH-balanced friends, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.820
If you were to compare environmental issues
to fashion trends—and I mean why wouldn’t

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990
you—then acid rain would be the equivalent
of bell-bottom jeans.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.270
People started talking about it in the 60’s,
then it slowly infiltrated media and pop culture,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.960
and by the mid-1970s’ seemingly everyone
had an opinion on it, but since then, where

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
did it go?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.120
To understand acid rain you have to understand
"pH" levels.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.519
pH means "power of hydrogen," essentially
it measure the kind of hydrogen in a solution.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.799
It's not super important to understand how
it works, but it ranges from zero to 14 with

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:54.260
zero (battery acid) being the most acidic
and 14 (lye) being super alkaline (or basic):

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.109
7 is neutral -- water is 7, milk is 6, sea
water is 9…

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.230
A change in even one number is a big deal,
because pH is measured logarithmically, one

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.250
number represents a 10-fold change!

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.960
Okay, so, acid rain is bad, you guys.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.219
Like really bad.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.460
It toxifies lakes and streams, destroys forests
and threatens entire plant populations.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.229
Acid rain is even harmful to urban environments,
where it eats away at limestone and marble

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.229
buildings.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.799
All because its pH is crazy.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.890
I say crazy, because normal rain is acidic,
just a little bit.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.560
As rain falls from they sky, it picks up carbon
dioxide in the air, creating carbonic acid.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.340
This gives natural rain a pH of about 6, just
slightly on the acid side -- similar to urine

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.409
or saliva.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.590
Regular rain becomes acid rain when it picks
up not only carbon dioxide, but sulfur dioxide

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.319
and nitrogen oxide, which contain much stronger
acids.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.030
These make their way into our atmosphere when
we burn fossil fuels to make energy.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.950
Once natural rain picks up this acid, its
pH can drop as low as 3.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.510
That means that rain that goes from pH 6 to
pH 3 -- it’s 1000 times more acidic!.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.289
Threes are things like citrus, kimchee, or
soda!

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.179
The effects of acid rain entirely depend on
where it lands.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.349
For instance if it falls on limestone-rich
soil, it doesn’t have much of an effect

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.599
because limestone is naturally alkaline; it
has a pH above 7.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.819
So mixing acidity with a lower pH just neutralizes
it.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.549
In fact, to protect cultivated areas from
acid rain damage, limestone can be added to

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.209
soil as a sort-of pH-balancing fertilizer.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.659
Though that's pretty much out of the question
for huge tracts of land in the wilderness.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.180
When acid rain falls on neutral or acidic
soil, or on vegetation, that’s when things

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.269
get bad.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.120
Living things have a hard time in acidic environments
because the acid basically kills their growth

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.220
enzymes -- fish can't swim in orange juice!

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.780
What’s more, hydrogen ions in the acid rain
replace nutrients in the soil like calcium

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.730
and magnesium, which are vital for plant growth.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.579
This is why we preserve things in vinegar,
rather than water because the acid in the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.840
vinegar prevents pickles, or kimchi for all
you foodies, from growing mold.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.849
Keep in mind that we’re talking about ecosystems,
so everything is connected.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.080
Once acid rain infiltrates soil, it flows
into streams and lakes, killing marine life.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.459
Even water-dwelling animals that can live
in acidic environments, like frogs, still

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.239
end up dying, because the acid kills their
food sources.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.549
This sort of environmental damage stems as
far back as the industrial revolution; however

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.049
the public didn’t really catch wind of it
until the 1970’s, after it had already caused

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.560
massive damage -- and that's why you heard
about it.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.890
Why you don't anymore, is because in the early
1990’s the US government passed a series

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.220
of regulations that dramatically reduced sulfur
dioxide emissions, and acid rain sorta fell

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.220
off the radar.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.700
At least in the U.S….

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.380
Acid rain is still an issue in China and Russia,
two countries with lots of factories and few

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.159
environmental regulations.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.770
China is particularly bad, as it’s coal
contains higher-than-normal-levels of sulfur.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.629
Even parts of eastern Europe, Canada and the
United States still have rainwater that’s

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.140
just too acidic.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.990
And even though our rain will likely never
return to a 1960’s level of acidity, the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.739
effects of this environmental disaster will
exist for decades.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.040

So acid rain is still a problem, but what
about the hole in the ozone layer?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140
What ever happened to that?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:36.850
You can find out in this video here.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.580
Should we do a whole video about pH? That's kinda cool right?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.980
Do you have science questions?
