00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.397
Welcome, everybody,
on this snowy Friday.

00:00:18.397 --> 00:00:22.559
At the end of last hour,
and I just want to take a

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.127
minute or two here to finish
this piece up,

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:31.308
we were talking about ways of
writing kinetics expressions for

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:37.000
a particular type of assumed
ligand substitution mechanism.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.529
In particular,
we were looking at dissociative

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:43.745
substitution.
And now I would just like to

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:48.137
take you through what happens if
you don't make the major

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:52.764
assumption that we made last
time, which was that every time

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:57.549
our intermediate five coordinate
complex ML five was

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.000
formed, it would go onto
products.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.605
That was our assumption last
time, one of them.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:08.759
And this steady state
approximation is one that allows

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.424
us to simplify the rate
expression.

00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:15.500
If we don't make that
assumption, what we say is that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.183
the change with time of the
concentration of the

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.848
intermediate is approximately
zero.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:25.767
We know that at the very
beginning of the reaction,

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:30.000
we have this ML five X
species.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.940
X is the ligand that
dissociates to give ML five,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.385
so at time zero there
is zero ML five

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.990
concentration.
And let me just remind you of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.099
this plot of what happens in a
reaction like this.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.878
We have our initial ML five X
species that decays

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:57.000
away, and we have our product ML
five Y that grows in.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.321
And if this reaction goes by
dissociative ligand

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.935
substitution,
which would certainly be

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:06.963
consistent with a d four
high spin electron count,

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:09.931
as we saw last time,
then there may be some

00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.747
intermediate ML five
that at time zero has zero

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:16.785
concentration.
And it may never really build

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:20.107
up very much concentration.
And then at the end,

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:23.710
it goes down to zero,
too, because when the reaction

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.244
is over, all of our ML five has
a Y attached and is

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:32.009
six-coordinate again.
If the concentration of the ML

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.894
five intermediate never
really builds up very much,

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:39.578
which is quite often the case,
it may not be observable,

00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:42.995
the amount of which is produced
during the reaction,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.679
then this approximation is
pretty valid and allows us to

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.899
derive equations for the change
with time of the species that we

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.119
can observe, namely the starting
material that is going away and

00:02:55.119 --> 00:03:00.340
the product that is coming in.
And so this is our

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.452
concentration versus time plot
for the reaction.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:13.865
And with this approximation,
we can then set equal to zero

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:20.627
the expression for the formation
of the intermediate,

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:27.000
which is k1 times ML five X.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.322
This quantity k1,
if you remember back to the

00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:34.475
diagram we were using last time,
k1 is the rate constant

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:38.478
associated with surmounting that
first energy barrier,

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.894
k1 times ML five X.

00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:44.821
That produces ML five,
so this is producing

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.295
it, but when you are in the
middle of the well,

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:52.599
where the intermediate lies,
there are two ways to destroy

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.148
ML five.
You can go minus k minus one ML

00:03:56.148 --> 00:04:00.000
five times X.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.728
This brings you,
then, back over to where you

00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:06.864
started.
And you can also lose it in a

00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:11.779
productive sense by k two times
ML five times our species Y,

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.932
which brings us onto products.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:20.847
And we are still making the
assumption that once you get to

00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:25.254
products, the reaction is done
and you never go back.

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:30.000
That assumption is built into
this analysis.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.148
And if we look at this,
we have set it equal to zero,

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:39.801
meaning that ML five is
not building up.

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:45.841
And so now, what we can do is
we can rearrange this expression

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:50.297
and solve it for the
concentration of ML five.

00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:54.455
And you will see that you can
do that here.

00:04:54.455 --> 00:05:00.000
ML five becomes equal to k1
times ML five X --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.451
That is the expression for the
formation.

00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:21.774
These two brackets should be
done.

00:05:21.774 --> 00:05:28.064
ML five X over k minus one
times Y plus.

00:05:28.064 --> 00:05:31.314
Sorry.
That should be X,

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:33.015
here.
Plus k2, times Y.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:37.731
The expression

00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:42.139
in the denominator here are
those two quantities that take

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.768
us out of the well.
And on the top,

00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:49.407
we have the one quantity that
takes us into the well from the

00:05:49.407 --> 00:05:52.577
starting materials.
And so now, we have an

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:56.984
expression for ML five
that we can plug into our

00:05:56.984 --> 00:06:02.939
expression for the rate.
The rate overall expressed as

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.817
the appearance of the final
product is going to be equal to

00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:13.378
k2 times ML five,
this is going over the final

00:06:13.378 --> 00:06:18.243
barrier, times Y.
And so,

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:22.601
if we take the expression here
for the rate,

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:27.972
this is the value that we
expect for the appearance of

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:31.992
products.
We take that substitute in this

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.691
expression for the unobserved
intermediate,

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:36.362
ML five,
into this.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:40.154
Then we have an expression for
the rate entirely in terms of

00:06:40.154 --> 00:06:43.560
things that we can either
observe, namely the starting

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.544
material, the concentration we
would measure by some technique,

00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:50.372
like spectrophotometry as a
function of time,

00:06:50.372 --> 00:06:53.264
watching an absorbance band for
it decay away,

00:06:53.264 --> 00:06:56.840
for example.
And then also in terms of the

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.710
concentration of Y which we were
talking about as the solvent,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.439
so it would have a large
invariant and known

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.596
concentration.
And then, of course,

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:08.895
since X is being produced in
the reaction whenever it

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:12.005
dissociates from the starting
material, there is a

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:15.431
relationship between the
concentration of X at any time

00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:20.000
and the concentration of our
starting material at any time.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.137
Now we get an expression that
we need to be able to integrate

00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:27.724
in order to actually produce,
given these parameters,

00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:31.448
k1, k minus 1,
and k2, to produce a predicted

00:07:31.448 --> 00:07:34.206
dataset to compare with the
experimental.

00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:37.862
And what one normally does is
you take an experimental

00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:42.206
dataset, you have the equations
that arise from your mechanistic

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:46.206
hypothesis, and you do a least
squares fitting procedure to

00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:49.724
obtain the values of the
parameters, which are these

00:07:49.724 --> 00:07:54.068
phenomenological rate constants
associated with each step in the

00:07:54.068 --> 00:07:57.893
mechanism.
Extract the values of the

00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:02.285
parameters, and see what you
get, see if the mechanism that

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:06.979
you have assumed can give you a
good fit to the data or whether

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.327
it cannot.
That is the end of my

00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:13.870
discussion of an introduction to
kinetic analysis of chemical

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.035
reactions, a really important
subject where differential

00:08:18.035 --> 00:08:20.913
equations really become very
important.

00:08:20.913 --> 00:08:24.850
Today, I want to get onto the
top of extended solids,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.334
and so I am going to talk about
dimensionality,

00:08:28.334 --> 00:08:30.000
here.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And materials.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.979
And I want you to keep in mind
the framework with which we have

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:54.831
been discussing chemical bonding
all throughout this semester

00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.746
because we are going to extend
that today to try to understand

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:02.341
some of the properties of
systems that are not molecular,

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:06.000
but extend infinity in some
number of dimensions.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.727
We talked about the H two
molecule.

00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:15.090
This is a very small molecular
system that we have described

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:20.000
and talked about quite a bit.
This system has a radius,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.181
here, of about 0.64 angstroms,
or internuclear distance of

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:29.818
about 0.64 angstroms.
And then, we can also consider

00:09:29.818 --> 00:09:34.000
molecules that become more
extended.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
There is an example of a
polyene.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.614
And my use of a polyene,
here, should lead you to think

00:09:48.614 --> 00:09:52.228
that when we consider polymer
chemistry, in some cases,

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:55.574
we will be talking about
systems that are extended,

00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:58.519
maybe not infinitely,
but very greatly in one

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:02.000
direction, or maybe more than
one direction.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.980
But polyenes are interesting
species because if this thing

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.680
had all the double bonds,
trans, as I have drawn here,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.079
then what we have perpendicular
to the board would be a set of p

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.710
orbitals, one p orbital
perpendicular to the board on

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.411
each of these carbons.
And all of those p orbitals can

00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:24.064
overlap.
And then, we can start talking

00:10:24.064 --> 00:10:28.324
about the transport of electrons
down a chain like this in one

00:10:28.324 --> 00:10:32.534
dimension.
So I put H two up here

00:10:32.534 --> 00:10:37.430
as an example of what is
approximately a zero dimensional

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.576
system.
Here is a system that extends

00:10:40.576 --> 00:10:45.297
somewhat in one dimension.
And then, as an example of a

00:10:45.297 --> 00:10:49.580
two dimensional system,
let me just draw up here a

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.000
piece of one of the sheets of
the graphite structure.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.749
Graphite is one of the
allotropes of carbon.

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:07.411
And graphite is a really nice
2d structure.

00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:11.160
I can draw in some of the
unsaturation here.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.869
And I don't mean to suggest
that this thing stops here.

00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:20.839
These carbons on the parameter
of the graphite system have

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:26.245
bonds, and the structure looks
very much like what I have drawn

00:11:26.245 --> 00:11:29.994
here, if you repeat outward,
up, down, left,

00:11:29.994 --> 00:11:34.426
or right.
And what that leads to are

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:39.093
two-dimensional planar arrays of
carbon atoms that,

00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:44.600
as with the polyene structure,
here this polyene that I drew

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.519
with six bonds,
is about 13 angstroms long.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:53.840
And then the problem that you
get to with graphite is that

00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.000
these graphite sheets can have
dimensions of millimeters.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.880
You have gone from something
short to something very,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.791
very large.
And we are going infinitely.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:10.597
I am going to show you a little
bit more about this.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:14.552
I am going to let you look at
this website yourselves.

00:12:14.552 --> 00:12:19.029
You are going to find that I
did put into the notes for today

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.014
the website that we are going to
look at.

00:12:22.014 --> 00:12:26.492
And it is for you to go ahead
and look at in three-dimensions

00:12:26.492 --> 00:12:30.000
at the structure of the
graphite.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.907
And also, in particular,
I want you to be able to look

00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:38.703
at the structure of the diamond
framework.

00:12:38.703 --> 00:12:43.888
One of the things that I want
you to be thinking about in

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:49.629
association with today's lecture
are the way that atoms pack in

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:54.259
three dimensions when you make
up a solid material.

00:12:54.259 --> 00:13:00.000
You will see why that is
important in just a moment.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.011
And so we are going to have to
go from bonds to bands in order

00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:10.000
to make this transition.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.312
And that means we are going to
have to talk about band

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:27.422
structure today and where bands
come from.

00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:32.033
This, by the way,
the title for this panel from

00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:37.747
bonds to bands is actually the
inverse of a title that was

00:13:37.747 --> 00:13:43.360
penned for a beautiful article
written by Professor Roald

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.169
Hoffmann.
And he was actually one of my

00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:52.181
teachers as an undergraduate at
Cornell University,

00:13:52.181 --> 00:14:00.000
and he also won the Nobel Prize
for his contributions to theory.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.805
And I refer you to his article
from bands to bonds if you want

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:07.548
to learn more about this topic
because, although the concepts

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:11.353
of solid state physics are often
discussed with very different

00:14:11.353 --> 00:14:15.283
terminology than the concepts of
electronic structure theory for

00:14:15.283 --> 00:14:18.839
molecules, there are a lot of
very important parallelisms.

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:22.395
And one of the things that
Professor Hoffmann is very good

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:25.763
at is in bridging the gap
between different branches of

00:14:25.763 --> 00:14:29.568
science that talk about the same
things but don't realize that

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:33.000
they are talking about the same
things.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.390
And so here we have a system
with a single orbital.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.430
We are going to look at the
number of orbitals.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.436
And here is a system with one.
And this is an energy level

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:49.334
diagram.
We have used energy level

00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:53.022
diagrams for a lot of things.
Last lecture,

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:57.501
we used them to discuss
potential energy surfaces of

00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.804
chemical reactions,
in addition to all these other

00:15:01.804 --> 00:15:05.724
properties.
Here is a system with one

00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:07.793
orbital.
And then, as you know,

00:15:07.793 --> 00:15:11.931
when you have a system with two
orbitals, you can get bonding

00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:15.034
and antibonding.
This is the hydrogen problem.

00:15:15.034 --> 00:15:17.931
This might be a hydrogen atom,
for example.

00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:21.310
Here is an H two
molecular orbital diagram.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.034
And then we can consider a
system that might have three

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:28.000
orbitals populated,
like this.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.709
And then, if we have a system
with four orbitals,

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:38.301
it might be something like
that, four electrons and so on.

00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:44.188
We see that one of the features
is that the energy levels are

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:50.467
starting to come closer together
as we get more and more of them.

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:54.000
There are five.
Here is six.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.701
And then, onto seven.
And you start running out of

00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:10.938
room to draw them.
And so, what people do then

00:16:10.938 --> 00:16:16.523
with this problem,
we are only up to seven and we

00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:22.225
have almost run out of space to
draw these things.

00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:25.716
So what do we do?
We draw them,

00:16:25.716 --> 00:16:32.000
when we get out to infinity
here, as a band.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.916
What the idea is,
is that we have here this band

00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:41.250
diagram, as we are going to call
them, a type of diagram in which

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.916
we are representing field
orbitals down here as some kind

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:49.333
of continuum.
Because there are so many of

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:53.333
them, an infinite number of
orbitals that are all

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:56.916
interacting in some extended
solid material,

00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:01.750
we are going to be talking
today a little bit about silicon

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.500
and germanium and things like
gallium nitride,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.083
in which you have a lattice
that extends periodically in

00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:15.443
three-dimensions.
And so these molecular orbitals

00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:18.518
spread out and cover the whole
material.

00:17:18.518 --> 00:17:23.248
Electrons can be anywhere at
once within this entire extended

00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:26.796
solid by virtue of these
delocalized orbitals.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:30.580
And then, just like in
molecules, there are empty

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.324
orbitals.
And they occur,

00:17:33.324 --> 00:17:37.652
also, in a continuum.
I would like you to get your

00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:43.129
mind around going from both ends
to the same place in that type

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:46.750
of continuum.
And the idea that these band

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.050
structure diagrams that people
use to describe the electronic

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.526
structure properties of extended
materials are really molecular

00:17:57.526 --> 00:18:04.263
orbital diagrams.
And so let's take a typical

00:18:04.263 --> 00:18:13.578
metal, where n equals three,
principle quantum number three.

00:18:13.578 --> 00:18:21.947
The atom has a 1s orbital.
It has a 2s and a set of 2p

00:18:21.947 --> 00:18:27.947
orbitals.
It has a 3s orbital and a set

00:18:27.947 --> 00:18:31.941
of 3p.
And so there is an atom,

00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:34.448
like a sodium atom,
for example.

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:38.977
And here is our energy axis.
What happens is that each of

00:18:38.977 --> 00:18:42.375
these orbitals,
that when you put all these

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:46.338
atoms together into a piece of
solid sodium metal,

00:18:46.338 --> 00:18:49.897
we talked about that earlier in
the semester,

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:53.860
these orbitals overlap,
spread out and form bands.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.875
And there is a band very low in
energy that is derived from the

00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:03.000
1s electrons in a metal like
sodium.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.789
And it is completely full.
And then there is a band from

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:11.185
the 2s and there is a band,
accordingly,

00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:14.755
from the 2p.
And then there will be a band

00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:20.154
from the 3s, and a band from the
3p that I have run out of room

00:19:20.154 --> 00:19:23.985
to draw there.
And notice that the bands that

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:28.775
originate from atomic orbitals
having the same principle

00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:34.000
quantum number here,
2s and 2p, are overlapping.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.084
In the case of a sodium atom,
this 2s band is completely full

00:19:40.084 --> 00:19:45.053
with electrons and the 2p band
is completely full.

00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:49.515
And this 3s band here,
in the case of sodium,

00:19:49.515 --> 00:19:52.050
is half full.
Furthermore,

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:57.526
we are going to call these
filled bands that are at the

00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:02.191
highest energy.
This corresponds to our highest

00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:08.073
occupied molecular orbital.
That will be called the valance

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:10.000
band.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.133
And then up here,
the lowest unoccupied band is

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:26.000
called the conduction band.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.111
And so, in the case of sodium
metal, this 3s band is half

00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:42.000
full.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And, if we go over to
magnesium, this same 3s band is

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.230
now full.
And if we go to aluminum,

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:09.000
that 3s band is full,
and the 3p band is partly full.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.950
And it is a consequence of the
fact that the electrons in the

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.835
valance band are right here at
the same energy as the lowest

00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:25.851
part of the conduction band in a
metal that gives metals their

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.893
luster.
It gives them their 100%

00:21:27.893 --> 00:21:30.000
optical reflectivity,
--

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.084
-- these properties that we
very much associate with metals.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:37.200
And so from analyzing band
structure diagrams,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.523
even simplified ones,
like the ones you will find

00:21:40.523 --> 00:21:44.815
here and in your textbook today,
you can really say a lot about

00:21:44.815 --> 00:21:48.000
the properties of different
materials.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.778
When you have a meeting of the
valance band and the conduction

00:22:07.778 --> 00:22:16.595
band, then your material is a
conductor and is metallic.

00:22:16.595 --> 00:22:22.847
And then, there are other
possibilities,

00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:28.778
of course.
You may have a valance band

00:22:28.778 --> 00:22:40.000
that is separated by some energy
gap from the conduction band.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.310
And if that is that is the
case, then you have a

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.813
semi-conductor,
such as silicon.

00:22:48.813 --> 00:22:53.559
And then, finally,
you can have a large gap

00:22:53.559 --> 00:23:00.000
between your valance band and
your conduction band.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.096
And, in all cases,
like with an MO diagram,

00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:06.414
we are putting these things on
an energy axis.

00:23:06.414 --> 00:23:10.764
We are filling up electrons
from the bottom in this material

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:15.041
from the standpoint of energy,
and so you have a large gap,

00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:16.000
here.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And you have a material that is
an insulator.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.723
And I think you will appreciate
why that is in a moment,

00:23:33.723 --> 00:23:37.651
but I want to bring Boltzmann's
law to bear on the issue of

00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:41.781
electronic structure in extended
networks, like we are talking

00:23:41.781 --> 00:23:43.000
about today.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.411
In materials like the ones I
have drawn over here,

00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:56.962
the ability to conduct
electricity is related to the

00:23:56.962 --> 00:24:01.000
probability of electrons being
in the conduction band.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.962
So we need to know something
about electrons in the

00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:19.253
conduction band.
And, using a Boltzmann

00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:25.101
distribution,
we can write that probability

00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:33.594
as being related to one over (e
to the (delta E over RT)) plus

00:24:33.594 --> 00:24:40.000
one.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.892
And, with an expression like
this, this delta E here

00:24:44.892 --> 00:24:49.210
corresponds to our gap.
And so it is possible,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:54.774
then, to go ahead and estimate
the number of electrons that

00:24:54.774 --> 00:25:00.243
would be present in a cubic
centimeter of your material in

00:25:00.243 --> 00:25:06.000
the condition band as a function
of this energy gap.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.906
And so we can consider that for
materials like carbon or silicon

00:25:10.906 --> 00:25:14.411
or elemental germanium.
In the case of carbon,

00:25:14.411 --> 00:25:18.928
I am talking about diamond.
And you should definitely go to

00:25:18.928 --> 00:25:23.834
that specified website and look
at the diamond structure and try

00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:28.663
to get an appreciation for how
the carbon atoms in diamond pack

00:25:28.663 --> 00:25:32.720
in three dimensions.
From a hybridization

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.795
standpoint, all the carbons in
graphite are sp two.

00:25:37.795 --> 00:25:42.612
Whereas, in diamond all the
carbons are sp three

00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:46.225
and tetrahedral.
And completing this table,

00:25:46.225 --> 00:25:47.000
--

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
-- we can write down delta E in
kilojoules per mole.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.133
The gap for diamond is 524
kilojoules per mole,

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:10.933
for silicon,
117 kilojoules per mole,

00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:16.400
and for germanium,
66 kilojoules per mole.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:23.733
And here is the number of
electrons per centimeter cubed

00:26:23.733 --> 00:26:30.000
in the material in the
conduction band.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.215
And, based on this large energy
gap in the diamond structure,

00:26:37.215 --> 00:26:41.544
this value is on the order of
10^-27.

00:26:41.544 --> 00:26:45.392
Very small.
This is an insulator.

00:26:45.392 --> 00:26:49.000
Diamond is an insulator.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.333
And, on the other hand,
silicon, the number of

00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:01.851
electrons per cubic centimeter
that are in the conduction band

00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:06.747
are on the order of 10^9.
This much smaller gap in the

00:27:06.747 --> 00:27:10.769
case of silicon,
despite the fact that the

00:27:10.769 --> 00:27:15.577
silicon atoms also are
tetrahedrally disposed with

00:27:15.577 --> 00:27:20.777
respect to their bonding,
just as in the diamond case,

00:27:20.777 --> 00:27:23.916
we have a much smaller gap,
10^9.

00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:27.350
And that makes silicon,
as you know,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.035
a semiconductor.
And then germanium,

00:27:32.035 --> 00:27:37.500
10^13, so even more.
It is getting closer and closer

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:43.392
to being metallic as the gap
shrinks as we compare these

00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:45.000
materials.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.393
And, having said that,
we need to talk about the

00:27:56.393 --> 00:28:01.557
different types of materials
that we can have.

00:28:01.557 --> 00:28:08.442
I want you to understand the
difference between intrinsic and

00:28:08.442 --> 00:28:12.000
extrinsic semiconductors.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.965
If a semiconductor material is
an intrinsic semiconductor,

00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:33.000
that means that it is a
semiconductor in its pure state.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.714
And why would we make that
reference?

00:28:51.714 --> 00:28:53.761
I mean normally,
we are always talking about

00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:55.000
pure things.
But, actually,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.857
you will see in a moment that
people do purposely make impure

00:28:57.857 --> 00:29:00.000
semiconductors for very good
reasons.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.860
And we will discuss
semiconductor when pure.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:11.530
And what that means is you have
a system like this with some

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:16.730
kind of a small band gap,
as we have suggested.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:22.608
Here is our energy axis.
And what can happen is that,

00:29:22.608 --> 00:29:28.373
either thermally or upon
absorption of light energy,

00:29:28.373 --> 00:29:34.817
we can have promotion of an
electron from the valance band

00:29:34.817 --> 00:29:42.095
into the conduction band.
And so I will draw that new

00:29:42.095 --> 00:29:46.108
situation over here.
In other words,

00:29:46.108 --> 00:29:52.184
we may have thermal population
of our conduction band.

00:29:52.184 --> 00:29:55.394
And we generate,
accordingly,

00:29:55.394 --> 00:29:58.711
a hole.
In this intrinsic

00:29:58.711 --> 00:30:03.040
semiconductor,
for every electron that jumps

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.382
up into the conduction band and
can then provide conductivity by

00:30:09.382 --> 00:30:12.000
electron transport --

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.226
Down here, in the valance band,
the missing electron generates

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:34.720
a hole.
And that hole can move around

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.976
freely in the valance band.
How does it do that?

00:30:37.976 --> 00:30:41.995
Well, it is a little bit like
the mechanism that we studied

00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:45.598
earlier for translocation of
protons in acidic water.

00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:49.616
If an electron that is nearby
the hole jumps into the hole,

00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:52.872
it creates another hole.
The hole thereby moves.

00:30:52.872 --> 00:30:55.713
And so here,
we can have hole transport in

00:30:55.713 --> 00:31:00.424
our valance band.
You can have conductivity

00:31:00.424 --> 00:31:05.369
occurring freely both in the
valance band and in the

00:31:05.369 --> 00:31:11.090
conduction band for an intrinsic
semiconductor of this type,

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.939
where the number of holes is
equal to the number of

00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:19.818
electrons.
And you might begin to suspect

00:31:19.818 --> 00:31:23.212
that for an extrinsic
semiconductor,

00:31:23.212 --> 00:31:30.000
the number of holes does not
equal the number of electrons.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.755
How does that work?
In these extrinsic

00:31:54.755 --> 00:31:59.297
semiconductors wherein you have
differing numbers of holes and

00:31:59.297 --> 00:32:03.468
electrons, you are purposely
adding a small percentage of

00:32:03.468 --> 00:32:10.075
impurities to your material.
Let me draw two pictures to

00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:17.018
represent this.
Here, I would like to draw just

00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:24.716
a simple tetrahedron.
We are looking at a very small

00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:32.612
part of the silicon structure.
Let me put the silicons in here

00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:35.898
in color.
Each silicon is coordinated to

00:32:35.898 --> 00:32:39.269
four other silicons in elemental
silicon.

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:44.241
It is tetrahedral silicon all
through this three-dimensional

00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:48.202
material in which these bands
have been created,

00:32:48.202 --> 00:32:52.331
and in which we have valance
and conduction bands.

00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:57.640
But what if we have synthesized
our silicon with a little bit of

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.115
boron impurity?
If we do that,

00:33:01.115 --> 00:33:05.975
then boron goes into a position
in the crystal lattice that is

00:33:05.975 --> 00:33:09.958
normally occupied by silicon,
so boron finds itself

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:14.579
surrounded by four silicons,
each of which wishes to donate

00:33:14.579 --> 00:33:18.881
an electron to the boron to form
an electron pair bond.

00:33:18.881 --> 00:33:23.662
But boron only has three of the
needed four electrons to make

00:33:23.662 --> 00:33:29.000
those four two-electron bonds
and to generate the octet.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.716
And so what happens is it wants
to get an electron.

00:33:33.716 --> 00:33:37.207
And where can it get an
electron from?

00:33:37.207 --> 00:33:41.358
It can get an electron from the
valance band,

00:33:41.358 --> 00:33:46.452
from the HOMO of the system,
from what would be able to

00:33:46.452 --> 00:33:49.471
donate an electron in the
system.

00:33:49.471 --> 00:33:54.000
The way this then works is as
follows.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.617
You should think about the
structure of elemental silicon

00:33:58.617 --> 00:34:03.482
with a small number of boron
atoms dispersed throughout that

00:34:03.482 --> 00:34:08.346
structure as creating localized
negative charges that cannot

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:12.221
move because they are localized
on these borons.

00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:16.756
And that generates for you a
band structure diagram like

00:34:16.756 --> 00:34:18.405
this.
You have bands,

00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:23.270
but then you have slipped in
there a little orbital from the

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.300
boron, a little electronic state
here, an intermediate between

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.000
the valance band and the
conduction band.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.537
So you have to choose your
impurity correctly,

00:34:36.537 --> 00:34:41.489
so that it has the right energy
with respect to the valance band

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:46.519
and the conduction band in order
for the process that you want to

00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:48.956
occur.
Here is our boron-derived

00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:53.515
state, here, and it needs that
extra electron because it is

00:34:53.515 --> 00:34:56.895
electron deficient when you put
it in there.

00:34:56.895 --> 00:35:01.375
And so an electron jumps onto
the boron, we will represent

00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:04.519
that this way,
in the material like that.

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:09.000
And this electron is fixed in
position --

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.537
-- because it is associated
with a negative charge that has

00:35:20.537 --> 00:35:25.025
formed on the boron.
And a corresponding hole is

00:35:25.025 --> 00:35:30.562
formed down in the conduction
band, and this hole transport

00:35:30.562 --> 00:35:34.000
can give rise to conductivity.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.476
And so notice that in this type
of semiconductor,

00:35:46.476 --> 00:35:50.860
and this, by the way,
is a p-type semiconductor.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.870
P for positive.
You are putting in a hole on

00:35:54.870 --> 00:36:00.000
that boron, so this is a p-type
of semiconductor.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.807
This thing is stuck on the
boron, and it generates a hole

00:36:03.807 --> 00:36:07.615
that is free to move in the
valance band and give rise to

00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:10.472
conductivity.
And so in this extrinsic-type

00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:13.735
of semiconductor,
you are not necessarily getting

00:36:13.735 --> 00:36:17.952
any conductivity up here in the
normal conduction band but down

00:36:17.952 --> 00:36:21.420
in the valance band due to the
creation of the hole.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.635
And then the parallel situation
to that would be where you have

00:36:25.635 --> 00:36:29.648
something that you dope into the
structure that has one more

00:36:29.648 --> 00:36:34.000
electron than what is normally
in the structure.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.068
Normally, you are putting in
silicon atoms each of which has

00:36:38.068 --> 00:36:41.655
four valance electrons.
You put in a phosphorus atom,

00:36:41.655 --> 00:36:44.620
which isn't nearly the same
size as silicon,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.827
but has five valance electrons.
So you have this phosphorus in

00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:52.827
here, and it is tetrahedrally
coordinated to four silicons.

00:36:52.827 --> 00:36:56.551
And there is only a few
percentage of phosphorous atoms

00:36:56.551 --> 00:37:00.000
doped into this silicon
semiconductor.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.470
And the phosphorus,
what happens is it goes in

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.861
there.
It has an extra electron.

00:37:05.861 --> 00:37:10.411
It wants to give it up so that
it can have just an octet and

00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.650
form these four bonds to the
four silicons.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:17.969
And when it gives up that
electron, the electron goes out

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:22.750
and that forms a positive charge
that is localized and fixed on

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.758
the phosphorous center in the
structure.

00:37:25.758 --> 00:37:30.000
And so, we can represent that
as follows.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.398
Where we have a phosphorus
state that we had chosen

00:37:34.398 --> 00:37:39.765
appropriately in energy to go
ahead and give up that electron,

00:37:39.765 --> 00:37:45.043
it gives up the electron to the
lowest unoccupied orbitals in

00:37:45.043 --> 00:37:50.322
the system, which is the bottom
part of your conduction band.

00:37:50.322 --> 00:37:54.985
This electron jumps up off the
phosphorus and into the

00:37:54.985 --> 00:38:00.000
conduction band,
and that leaves behind a hole.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.489
So you have a hole or a
positive charge,

00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:08.322
there, fixed in position.
And now you can have electron

00:38:08.322 --> 00:38:12.170
transport as your mechanism of
conductivity,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.659
up in the conduction band.
It is really,

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:21.118
I think, quite fascinating to
think about the way in which the

00:38:21.118 --> 00:38:26.487
concept of the octet rule and
our understanding of bonding in

00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:31.588
tetrahedral centers can actually
lead us to understand the

00:38:31.588 --> 00:38:36.868
mechanism of conductivity in
solid materials that are either

00:38:36.868 --> 00:38:42.600
n-doped or p-doped.
Here, it is quite clear.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.911
And then, finally,
I just want to take you through

00:38:47.911 --> 00:38:54.305
the way in which you can put the
positive and negative doped

00:38:54.305 --> 00:39:00.591
materials together to create a
device like a light-emitting

00:39:00.591 --> 00:39:02.000
diode.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.689
LED materials,
these are obviously great

00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:21.034
things because you can generate
light with a lot more efficiency

00:39:21.034 --> 00:39:24.827
in terms of energy than you can
with incandescent bulbs.

00:39:24.827 --> 00:39:27.586
You can get them in all
different colors.

00:39:27.586 --> 00:39:32.000
These are finding application
in so many different ways.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.983
One of the challenges that
chemists have taken on is the

00:39:35.983 --> 00:39:40.257
discovery of light-emitting
diode materials that are made of

00:39:40.257 --> 00:39:43.588
organic molecules,
actually, conducting organic

00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:47.717
molecules that have properties
correct for giving you very

00:39:47.717 --> 00:39:52.063
narrow emissions in the part of
the spectrum that you want to

00:39:52.063 --> 00:39:55.901
have coming out of your
light-emitting diode material.

00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:59.813
So chemistry is really very
strongly involved in making

00:39:59.813 --> 00:40:05.718
next-generation LED materials.
But I just want to tell you a

00:40:05.718 --> 00:40:09.281
little bit about how these
things work.

00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:14.812
The idea is that you have these
two types of semiconductors,

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:18.375
and you juxtapose them at an
interface.

00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:21.656
Let me make the interface with
blue.

00:40:21.656 --> 00:40:25.406
You have a solid chunk of
material, here.

00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:30.000
This will be our N-type
semiconductor.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.655
And over here,
they have a continuous,

00:40:32.655 --> 00:40:35.956
possibly two dimensional
interface here in this

00:40:35.956 --> 00:40:38.468
three-dimensional chunk of
material.

00:40:38.468 --> 00:40:42.488
And you have a P-type doped
part of the system over here.

00:40:42.488 --> 00:40:45.645
And, in fact,
normally this would be the same

00:40:45.645 --> 00:40:49.880
basic semiconductor material on
both sides of the interface.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.330
And it would be just the doping
that changes on the left versus

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.626
the right.
This material might be

00:40:56.626 --> 00:41:02.623
something like gallium nitride.
Now, notice that this is a 3/5

00:41:02.623 --> 00:41:06.822
type of material.
And this is gallium in Group 13

00:41:06.822 --> 00:41:10.845
and nitrogen in Group 15 of the
Periodic Table.

00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:15.131
You add three and five together
and you get eight,

00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:20.466
just the same number of valance
electrons you would if you had

00:41:20.466 --> 00:41:24.664
silicon and silicon.
But these materials have the

00:41:24.664 --> 00:41:30.000
property that they are a direct
band gap material.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.560
And, as direct band gap
materials, when the process that

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.536
we are going to talk about here
takes place at the interface,

00:41:39.536 --> 00:41:43.019
then out of this interface
comes the light.

00:41:43.019 --> 00:41:47.746
And if your semiconductor
material is an indirect band gap

00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:52.058
material like silicone is,
then that is not the case.

00:41:52.058 --> 00:41:56.121
And that has to do with the
solid state physics of

00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:59.687
electronically,
where is the conduction band

00:41:59.687 --> 00:42:04.000
located relative to that valance
band?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.162
Has it shifted horizontally in
solid physics-speak relative to

00:42:08.162 --> 00:42:10.618
the valance band?
That's what makes a

00:42:10.618 --> 00:42:13.552
semiconductor an indirect band
gap material.

00:42:13.552 --> 00:42:17.237
If the conduction band is
vertically situated above the

00:42:17.237 --> 00:42:19.898
valance band,
then you get a direct band

00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:22.628
material.
And so solid state chemists are

00:42:22.628 --> 00:42:26.381
interested in designing new
materials that have a direct

00:42:26.381 --> 00:42:30.338
band gap and that can release
light when this process takes

00:42:30.338 --> 00:42:34.534
place at the interface.
And on both sides,

00:42:34.534 --> 00:42:39.480
I just want to sketch the band
structure for the materials.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.403
And I mean the gap,
actually, to be the same on

00:42:43.403 --> 00:42:47.240
both sides here.
And the difference is what we

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.162
have doped it with.
In the case of the negative

00:42:51.162 --> 00:42:56.620
material, we have an electron up
here in the conduction band that

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.751
came in with,
for example,

00:42:58.751 --> 00:43:03.441
our phosphorus atom and left
behind a hole there that is

00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:08.040
fixed in space.
And down here we have our

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.306
valance band all full.
Over here similar,

00:43:11.306 --> 00:43:16.204
except our material starts out
with a hole down there because

00:43:16.204 --> 00:43:21.265
the electron has jumped up onto
the doped atom and become fixed

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:26.163
in space as a negative charge.
And that left behind a hole in

00:43:26.163 --> 00:43:30.000
the valance band down there like
that.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.466
What you have is your N-doped
material here on the left,

00:43:35.466 --> 00:43:38.846
your P-doped material on the
right.

00:43:38.846 --> 00:43:42.325
And, of course,
what do you do then?

00:43:42.325 --> 00:43:47.990
You attach leads so that you
can connect it to a potential

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.271
difference.
And, when you do that,

00:43:51.271 --> 00:43:57.334
you want your anode to be over
here, so that the electrons can

00:43:57.334 --> 00:44:03.000
flow that way up to the N part
of the device.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.803
And then electrons can flow
this way, which means,

00:44:07.803 --> 00:44:11.039
of course, that holes go that
way.

00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:16.529
And here is your cathode.
And so you can think of putting

00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:21.431
on your potential difference in
a system like this.

00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:28.000
And that has the effect of
ripping electrons out over here.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.568
And, if you rip an electron
out, let's say you take that

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:35.721
negative charge back off of that
boron atom, you pull an electron

00:44:35.721 --> 00:44:39.484
out to go ahead and reduce
something down here in solution,

00:44:39.484 --> 00:44:42.793
if you are using a battery for
this sort of process,

00:44:42.793 --> 00:44:46.816
well, then another electron can
jump up here to take its place.

00:44:46.816 --> 00:44:49.477
But you are building up a
potential, here.

00:44:49.477 --> 00:44:52.721
And so, what happens?
The highest lying electron in

00:44:52.721 --> 00:44:56.484
the system over here in the
N-type semiconductor is sitting

00:44:56.484 --> 00:45:00.118
there right at the junction
right next to where electrons

00:45:00.118 --> 00:45:03.207
are needed.
It jumps across.

00:45:03.207 --> 00:45:05.394
Electrons flow downhill,
here.

00:45:05.394 --> 00:45:09.845
And you can look at it like
this, electrons flow down there,

00:45:09.845 --> 00:45:13.617
across the interface.
And when you hook this LED up

00:45:13.617 --> 00:45:17.842
to your potential difference
supply, the electron flow is

00:45:17.842 --> 00:45:21.085
unidirectional.
As the electrons jump across

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:23.877
the interface,
they are going from the

00:45:23.877 --> 00:45:27.121
conduction band of the N-type
semiconductor,

00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:31.043
they are going down in here,
holes are being created,

00:45:31.043 --> 00:45:35.268
maybe electrons are being
pulled right off of that boron,

00:45:35.268 --> 00:45:39.342
and they are moving right
across here in a process that

00:45:39.342 --> 00:45:45.000
leads to the emission of light
right at the interface.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.473
It is like a waterfall of
electrons taking place all along

00:45:49.473 --> 00:45:52.848
this 2D interface.
Electrons are just moving

00:45:52.848 --> 00:45:56.694
across this interface and
dropping down in energy.

00:45:56.694 --> 00:46:01.247
As they drop down in energy,
a photon that is the energy of

00:46:01.247 --> 00:46:05.563
this energy difference between
the gap of this material,

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:10.430
those photons are released for
each electron that transits this

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:14.443
barrier.
And that is the principle of an

00:46:14.443 --> 00:46:16.886
LED.
And I hope you are enjoying

00:46:16.886 --> 00:46:21.457
seeing this connection between
molecular orbital theory for

00:46:21.457 --> 00:46:25.870
molecules being taken all the
way to solid state physics.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.136
Have a nice weekend and we will
see you on Monday.
