00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.367
Since the parabola is opening upward from this lowest point, when we have this

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.575
sort of u-shaped curve, the vertex is the minimum of the graph. Or in other

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.908
words, the vertex is the point that has the smallest y value. The opposite is

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.463
true if the parabola opens downward. Since every point below this one right here

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:21.611
will have a smaller y value, the vertex has the highest y value, or it's the

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:22.213
maximum.
