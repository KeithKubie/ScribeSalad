Ike grabbed his balls
during his farewell address,

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.788
but he never referenced it,
all right.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.590
-(laughter)
-That was called class.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.259
You know what, guys?
I tell you,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.194
the more I think
about Trump's dick joke,

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.263
the more...
the more it just pisses me off.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.931

-Okay?

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.079
Crass, shame-filled,

-Yeah, that's right.

It may not be...
it may not be classy work,

or work I'm proud of,
but it's honest work

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:06.899
that puts food on my table
and a roof over my head.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.402

Dick jokes. Trump claims
Mexico's taking our jobs.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.280
Well, Trump's taking jobs from
hard-working, low-brow comedians

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:23.616
who would be nothing
without a good dick joke.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.152
And don't give me... don't
give me that bull (bleep) line,

"All jokes matter."
