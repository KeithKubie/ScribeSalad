00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:02.251
- [Voiceover] The following
table lists the values

00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:03.962
of functions f and g

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:06.458
and of their derivatives,
f-prime and g-prime

00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:08.945
for the x values negative two and four.

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:10.751
And so you can see for
x equals negative two,

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.936
x equals four, they gave us the values of

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:15.500
f, g, f-prime, and g-prime.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.249
Let function capital-F be
defined as the composition

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.085
of f and g.

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.733
It's lowercase-f of g of x,

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.776
and they want us to
evaluate f-prime of four.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.309
So you might immediately
recognize that if I have

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.542
a function that can be
viewed as the composition of

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:35.005
other functions that the
chain rule will apply here.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:38.037
And so, and I'm just gonna
restate the chain rule,

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.891
the derivative of capital-F

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.216
is going to be the
derivative of lowercase-f,

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.338
the outside function with
respect to the inside function.

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:47.838
So lowercase-F-prime of g of x

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.343
times the derivative
of the inside function

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:56.074
with respect to x times g-prime of x.

00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.472
And if we're looking for F-prime of four,

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:00.566
F-prime of four,

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.648
well everywhere we see an x
we replace it with a four.

00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:06.481
That's gonna be
lowercase-f-prime of g of four

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.369
times g-prime of four.

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:13.419
Now how do we figure this out?

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:15.784
They haven't given us
explicitly the values

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.420
of the functions for all xs,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.427
but they've given it to us
at some interesting points.

00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:22.161
So the first thing you
might wanna figure out is

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.104
well what is g of four going to be?

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:26.105
Well they tell us:

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.599
when x is equal to four, g of four

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.220
is negative two.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.701
This tells us that the
value of g of x takes on

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.214
when x is equal to four is negative two.

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:38.476
So this right over here is negative two.

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:43.193
And so this first part is
f-prime of negative two.

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:46.360
So what is f-prime, what is f-prime of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.276
negative two?

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.845
Well when x is equal to negative two,

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.845
f-prime is equal to one.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.373
So this right over here is
f-prime of negative two.

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:01.252
That is equal to one.

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:04.468
And now we just have to figure
out what g-prime of four is.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:06.999
Well when, let me circle this,

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.523
g-prime of four,

00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:12.343
when x is equal to four, and
I'll scroll down a little bit,

00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:16.510
when x is equal to four, g-prime
takes on the value eight.

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:19.032
So there you have it.

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:21.819
F-prime of four is
equal to one times eight

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.152
which is equal to eight, and we're done.
