did get a little CGI heavy and it
 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.220
did get a little CGI heavy and it
reminded me of some of the doomsday

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
reminded me of some of the doomsday
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.849

stuff in the end of VBS for some people
 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.979
stuff in the end of VBS for some people
that might be a turn-off but here I

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
that might be a turn-off but here I
 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.900
that might be a turn-off but here I
thought it was handled considerably

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910
thought it was handled considerably
 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670
thought it was handled considerably
better in regards to the way it was all

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
better in regards to the way it was all
 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.159
better in regards to the way it was all
cut together there is a lot of CGI and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169
cut together there is a lot of CGI and
 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.320
cut together there is a lot of CGI and
that's to be expected because Wonder

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330
that's to be expected because Wonder
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.570
that's to be expected because Wonder
Woman is not normal

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
Woman is not normal
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.670
Woman is not normal
so that kind of shit's going to happen

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680
so that kind of shit's going to happen
 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.129
so that kind of shit's going to happen
but since I actually cared about the

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139
but since I actually cared about the
 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.320
but since I actually cared about the
characters this time around I didn't

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330
characters this time around I didn't
 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.570
characters this time around I didn't
mind as much when it got CGI heavy my

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580
mind as much when it got CGI heavy my
 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.159
mind as much when it got CGI heavy my
biggest gripe with Wonder Woman is

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
biggest gripe with Wonder Woman is
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.689
biggest gripe with Wonder Woman is
pretty much the same one I've had with

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699
pretty much the same one I've had with
 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.640
pretty much the same one I've had with
most superhero movies as of late whether

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
most superhero movies as of late whether
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.860
most superhero movies as of late whether
it's Marvel or DC and that's the villain

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870
it's Marvel or DC and that's the villain
 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.749
it's Marvel or DC and that's the villain
characters they're pretty weak there's

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759
characters they're pretty weak there's
 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.180
characters they're pretty weak there's
like two or three in this movie and some

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190
like two or three in this movie and some
 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.409
like two or three in this movie and some
of them are just so poorly

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419
of them are just so poorly
 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.420
of them are just so poorly
underdeveloped and they feel very hammy

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
underdeveloped and they feel very hammy
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.460
underdeveloped and they feel very hammy
which doesn't really fit in with the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470
which doesn't really fit in with the
 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.779
which doesn't really fit in with the
rest of the movie and that was a major

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789
rest of the movie and that was a major
 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.369
rest of the movie and that was a major
disappointment for me the movie is

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379
disappointment for me the movie is
 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.290
disappointment for me the movie is
really long but I think it works for

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300
really long but I think it works for
 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.820
really long but I think it works for
this character you really needed to see

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830
this character you really needed to see
 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.499
this character you really needed to see
her upbringing her roots where she came

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509
her upbringing her roots where she came
 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.050
her upbringing her roots where she came
from why she is the way she is it wasn't

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060
from why she is the way she is it wasn't
 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.629
from why she is the way she is it wasn't
just a bunch of padded scenes and they

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639
just a bunch of padded scenes and they
 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.300
just a bunch of padded scenes and they
also wisely understood which elements of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310
also wisely understood which elements of
 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.520
also wisely understood which elements of
her origin to poke fun at which things

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
her origin to poke fun at which things
 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.129
her origin to poke fun at which things
sounded silly enough to make a joke out

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139
sounded silly enough to make a joke out
 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.200
sounded silly enough to make a joke out
of it and so it wasn't just it was kind

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210
of it and so it wasn't just it was kind
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.189
of it and so it wasn't just it was kind
of like the way they did it with for

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199
of like the way they did it with for
 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.170
of like the way they did it with for
like Thor has some really silly and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180
like Thor has some really silly and
 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.689
like Thor has some really silly and
cheesy origins and they found ways to

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699
cheesy origins and they found ways to
 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.610
cheesy origins and they found ways to
poke fun at it and make it entertaining

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620
poke fun at it and make it entertaining
 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.959
poke fun at it and make it entertaining
enough so that you could at least get a

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969
enough so that you could at least get a
 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.520
enough so that you could at least get a
joke out of it I talked about it briefly

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530
joke out of it I talked about it briefly
 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.260
joke out of it I talked about it briefly
but some of the action scenes are

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270
but some of the action scenes are
 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.330
but some of the action scenes are
genuinely epic like the very definition

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340
genuinely epic like the very definition
 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.180
genuinely epic like the very definition
of epic the score is also really

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190
of epic the score is also really
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.439
of epic the score is also really
exciting and I'm looking forward to

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449
