00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.990
2015 is going to be ANOTHER huge year for
historic space events -- here’s 5 stories

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.959
that I’M most excited about.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:08.969
Hi there!

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.389
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and if you are as huge a space fan as

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.530
I am, you’ll know that 2014 has been an
epic year for space exploration and astronomy.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.110
But what about 2015?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.280
The next 12 months can’t be as crazy as
the last 12, can it?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.390
Let’s find out…

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.940
The biggest piece of 2015 space news on everyone’s
mind is likely NASA’s New Horizon’s flyby

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.190
of mysterious Pluto.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.829
The nuclear-powered robot is currently out
of hibernation and racing toward the icy Kuiper

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.489
Belt -- Pluto’s neighborhood.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.999
The mission is expected to make its historic
close approach in July and then continue its

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.629
journey through the Kuiper Belt, a region
of the solar system we've only glimpsed from

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.629
afar.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.350
We’ll finally get a close-up look at Pluto’s
icy landscape, its family of moons and primordial

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.109
chunks of debris from the earliest formation
of the solar system.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.469
But will the mission change Pluto’s status
from dwarf planet back to planet?

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.469
Probably not, but who cares!

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.140
WE’RE GOING TO SEE PLUTO UP CLOSE FOR THE
FIRST TIME.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660
And that’s just awesome.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.290
Why don’t we call 2015 the “Year of the
Dwarf Planet” … or “Year of the Planetoid”

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.290
… or something.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.780
Yes, next year we are going to visit ANOTHER
dwarf planet… or protoplanet?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.360
Or really, really big asteroid?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.890
(Someone REALLY needs to sort out these definitions!)

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.930
NASA’s DAWN mission, that is currently exploring
the solar system’s asteroid belt, is about

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.200
to make its SECOND stop along its epic solar
system tour.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.140
After leaving massive asteroid Vesta in late
2012, the solar powered robotic probe will

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.780
become the first mission to visit Ceres and
orbit TWO celestial bodies.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.630
DAWN will reach Ceres, the solar system’s
innermost dwarf planet, by early April.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.950
Putting dwarf planets to one side for now,
2015 promises to be another exciting year

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.590
for advances in human spaceflight and one
important event I’ll be keeping a close

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.030
eye on is a long-duration spaceflight experiment
involving NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.030
cosmonaut Mik-hile Korn-i-enko.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.710
The two spacemen will live and work on the
International Space Station for a whole year

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.160
after launch in March.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.770
Although Russian cosmonauts have spent longer
in space in the past during missions on board

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.180
the Soviet Mir space station, this will be
the longest space mission for a NASA astronaut

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.060
and the longest ever stay on the International
Space Station intended to understand the impacts

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.630
long-duration spaceflight has on the human
body.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.469
Next up, a cool development in the commercial
space sector: As you probably know, NASA is

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.709
currently contracting two companies to deliver
cargo to the ISS.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.129
As an extension of these cargo missions, NASA
also hopes to see private companies transporting

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.909
their astronauts into orbit, reducing America’s
dependence on using the Russian Soyuz vehicle

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.319
for rides to the space station.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.829
Elon Musk’s SpaceX revealed its crewed Dragon
space vehicle last May and the company is

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.969
fast developing the means to get US astronauts
back into space after the Space Shuttle was

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.799
retired in 2011.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.659
By the end of 2015, according to official
documents, SpaceX is aiming to carry out its

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.650
first manned test flight -- so watch this
space!

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.060
Now for something COMPLETELY different!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.360
Forget the “scientifically accurate” visualization
of the black hole in the movie Interstellar,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.549
we could soon see the dark void and bright
ring in space generated by a REAL black hole.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.550
Next year, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
will go online and begin collecting data.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.379
After adding the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array, or “ALMA,” to the EHT in 2014,

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.469
the vast interferometer will be sensitive
enough to spy on the fine details of the energetic

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.980
phenomena surrounding a black hole.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.980
Yes.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.980
REALLY.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.139
The EHT interferometer will collect data from
many different radio observatories located

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.279
in different continents, collecting it all
in one place.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:25.919
By doing this, the EHT is simulating one HUGE
radio antennae with the power of one telescope

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.989
the diameter of our planet, making black hole
astronomy a “thing.”

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.180
So does all this get you excited about space
exploration in 2015?
