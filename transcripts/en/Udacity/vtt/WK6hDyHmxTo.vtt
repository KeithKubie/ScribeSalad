00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.810
Amazing work.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.590
You've polished Icicles into a real
playable game, adding scores, a HUD, and

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.740
a difficultly select screen.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.080
Do you realize how much
you've accomplished?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.670
Icicles is a simple game, but
you coded everything from the ground up.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.143
You know Icicles better than
the stickers on the back of your laptop.

00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:19.783
You've had to pay
attention to tiny details,

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:24.520
like how fast the icicles drop and
how big the font in the HUD should be.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.745
This kind of line by line,

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:29.376
pixel perfect mastery, is what it takes
to build something new and awesome.

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:31.872
And you've proved you can do it.

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.320
I can't wait to see what you build next.
