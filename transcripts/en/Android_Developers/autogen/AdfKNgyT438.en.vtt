want to cover a few things first we want
to convey how we think about apk size

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
to convey how we think about apk size
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.019
to convey how we think about apk size
and a couple of metrics that we think

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
and a couple of metrics that we think
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179
and a couple of metrics that we think
you really should should care about for

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
you really should should care about for
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130
you really should should care about for
the success of your app we'll also walk

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
the success of your app we'll also walk
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.720

size today as well as show you a number
of new tools and features that we are

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
of new tools and features that we are
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900
of new tools and features that we are
going to introduce this week that will

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
going to introduce this week that will
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479
going to introduce this week that will
also help you keep your apk size down so

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
also help you keep your apk size down so
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970
also help you keep your apk size down so
let's get started one of the things

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
let's get started one of the things
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.560
let's get started one of the things
you'll see today is that we have a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
you'll see today is that we have a
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819
you'll see today is that we have a
really diverse group of people from

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
really diverse group of people from
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819
really diverse group of people from
Google people from the Android team from

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
Google people from the Android team from
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.400
Google people from the Android team from
the tools team from the Play team

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410
the tools team from the Play team
 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.779
the tools team from the Play team
internal developers at Google and the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
internal developers at Google and the
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.099
internal developers at Google and the
reason we have so many people on stage

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
reason we have so many people on stage
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990
reason we have so many people on stage
with different backgrounds is because we

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
with different backgrounds is because we
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850
with different backgrounds is because we
really think that apk size is super

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
really think that apk size is super
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070
really think that apk size is super
important and it's something that we see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
important and it's something that we see
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600
important and it's something that we see
as something you have to take care of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
as something you have to take care of
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.149
as something you have to take care of
from the design stage the time you build

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
from the design stage the time you build
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.380
from the design stage the time you build
your app the time you publish your app

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
your app the time you publish your app
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.730
your app the time you publish your app
and the time that that app gets

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
and the time that that app gets
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.910
and the time that that app gets
delivered to a device so let me tell you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
delivered to a device so let me tell you
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.230
delivered to a device so let me tell you
a little bit about kind of the two

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
a little bit about kind of the two
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640
a little bit about kind of the two
dimensions that that we think are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
dimensions that that we think are
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.100
dimensions that that we think are
important for apk size first is the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
important for apk size first is the
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440
important for apk size first is the
download size so this is the size of the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
download size so this is the size of the
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910
download size so this is the size of the
application when it's in the Play Store

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
application when it's in the Play Store
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.490
application when it's in the Play Store
and it gets delivered to the device this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
and it gets delivered to the device this
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260
and it gets delivered to the device this
is highly compressed and we'll tell you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
is highly compressed and we'll tell you
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.700
is highly compressed and we'll tell you
more about how we how we do that and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
more about how we how we do that and
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980
more about how we how we do that and
that allows us to save a lot of size on

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
that allows us to save a lot of size on
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.330
that allows us to save a lot of size on
the wire and end-users data now as we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
the wire and end-users data now as we
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760
the wire and end-users data now as we
said download size is pretty small but

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
said download size is pretty small but
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219
said download size is pretty small but
there's another another concept that's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
there's another another concept that's
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620
there's another another concept that's
important which is installed sighs so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
important which is installed sighs so
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.389
important which is installed sighs so
installed size is what happens when you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
installed size is what happens when you
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429
installed size is what happens when you
actually download the app unpack it and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
actually download the app unpack it and
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.670
actually download the app unpack it and
then compile it and optimize it which

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
then compile it and optimize it which
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.730
then compile it and optimize it which
expands the application significantly

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
expands the application significantly
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.520
expands the application significantly
yielding a download size that is

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530
yielding a download size that is
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.719
yielding a download size that is
sometimes two to three times even bigger

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
sometimes two to three times even bigger
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120
sometimes two to three times even bigger
than the download size and so it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
than the download size and so it's
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.289
than the download size and so it's
something to really think about is what

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
something to really think about is what
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.550
something to really think about is what
is the footprint of your application

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
is the footprint of your application
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160
is the footprint of your application
going to be once it's installed on the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
going to be once it's installed on the
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619
going to be once it's installed on the
device now let's talk a little bit about

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
device now let's talk a little bit about
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180
device now let's talk a little bit about
why you should care about both download

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
why you should care about both download
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400
why you should care about both download
size and install size on the download

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
size and install size on the download
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.449
size and install size on the download
size for

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459
size for
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.040
size for
this is something really important

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
this is something really important
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.480
this is something really important
because what happens is when a user goes

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
because what happens is when a user goes
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.220
because what happens is when a user goes
and installs an app they're going to see

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
and installs an app they're going to see
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.990
and installs an app they're going to see
that loading bar and they're going to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
that loading bar and they're going to
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.520
that loading bar and they're going to
see the actual size of the application

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
see the actual size of the application
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.229
see the actual size of the application
and what we see is the larger the app

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239
and what we see is the larger the app
 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.570
and what we see is the larger the app
the more sort of user regret that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
the more sort of user regret that
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.890
the more sort of user regret that
happens and a lot of people will go and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
happens and a lot of people will go and
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.930
happens and a lot of people will go and
actually back out of it and cancel and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
actually back out of it and cancel and
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.479
actually back out of it and cancel and
so what we see is that up to 20% of

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489
so what we see is that up to 20% of
 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.000
so what we see is that up to 20% of
downloads fail or get canceled rather

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010
downloads fail or get canceled rather
 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.640
downloads fail or get canceled rather
when applications are over 100 megabytes

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
when applications are over 100 megabytes
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.680
when applications are over 100 megabytes
and so you really want to keep that the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
and so you really want to keep that the
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.960
and so you really want to keep that the
download size small to ensure that you

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
download size small to ensure that you
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.430
download size small to ensure that you
get as much distribution for your app as

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
get as much distribution for your app as
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.580
get as much distribution for your app as
possible the other one to think about is

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
possible the other one to think about is
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160
possible the other one to think about is
installed size now install size has a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
installed size now install size has a
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.809
installed size now install size has a
sort of a similar phenomenon right so

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
sort of a similar phenomenon right so
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.910
sort of a similar phenomenon right so
users are going to be filling up their

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
users are going to be filling up their
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920
users are going to be filling up their
phones with photos videos more

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
phones with photos videos more
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.600
phones with photos videos more
applications and at some point they're

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
applications and at some point they're
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.800
applications and at some point they're
going to try to install a new app and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
going to try to install a new app and
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.940
going to try to install a new app and
they're going to realize that they don't

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
they're going to realize that they don't
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.979
they're going to realize that they don't
have space for it what's going to happen

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
have space for it what's going to happen
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.270
have space for it what's going to happen
at that point is it going to go hunting

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
at that point is it going to go hunting
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710
at that point is it going to go hunting
they're going to go to their settings

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
they're going to go to their settings
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240
they're going to go to their settings
I'm going to look for their apps or if

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm going to look for their apps or if
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.680
I'm going to look for their apps or if
they're Disqus full and they try to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
they're Disqus full and they try to
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.449
they're Disqus full and they try to
download an app from the Play Store even

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
download an app from the Play Store even
 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.340
download an app from the Play Store even
the Play Store will suggest that they

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:47.739
with sort of finding out what's in it
 

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:51.659
with sort of finding out what's in it
and tailoring to that all right so first

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669
and tailoring to that all right so first
 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.999

here we intentionally look at the apk

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.130
here we intentionally look at the apk
 

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.269
here we intentionally look at the apk
built for xxhdpi density screens which

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279

contains the largest PNG s because this
is the largest apk that we were building

00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959
is the largest apk that we were building
 

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:14.680
is the largest apk that we were building
for this app in this example you will

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:14.690
for this app in this example you will
 

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.420
for this app in this example you will
see that the difference is significant

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:16.430
see that the difference is significant
 

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.269
see that the difference is significant
even when comparing the universal apk to

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279
even when comparing the universal apk to
 

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.430
even when comparing the universal apk to
the largest split that we have and of

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440
the largest split that we have and of
 

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.780
the largest split that we have and of
course the difference is more pronounced

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:22.790
course the difference is more pronounced
 

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.190

and densities we can do even better with

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120
and densities we can do even better with
 

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.160
and densities we can do even better with
vector drawables telling us thanks i so

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.170
vector drawables telling us thanks i so
 

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.269
vector drawables telling us thanks i so
now we just saw that there's a way to

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279
now we just saw that there's a way to
 

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:36.400
now we just saw that there's a way to
deliver a smaller app by chunking it up

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.410
deliver a smaller app by chunking it up
 

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.050
deliver a smaller app by chunking it up
and delivering multiple of those apps

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.060
and delivering multiple of those apps
 

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.019
and delivering multiple of those apps
now that's a great benefit to apk size

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:41.029
now that's a great benefit to apk size
 

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:43.300
now that's a great benefit to apk size
but it does come at a cost for your

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.310
but it does come at a cost for your
 

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.340
but it does come at a cost for your
build process as well as your your QA

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.350
build process as well as your your QA
 

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.050
build process as well as your your QA
process and that might be something that

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.060
process and that might be something that
 

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.720
process and that might be something that
you're not quite ready to to get into so

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:49.730
you're not quite ready to to get into so
 

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.579
you're not quite ready to to get into so
now there's an additional approach you

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:51.589
now there's an additional approach you
 

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.250
now there's an additional approach you
can follow to reduce the

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
can follow to reduce the
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.290
can follow to reduce the
of size you carry with your assets and

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.300
of size you carry with your assets and
 

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.410
of size you carry with your assets and
that's use vector drawables vector

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.420
that's use vector drawables vector
 

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.530
that's use vector drawables vector
drawables would basically serving a

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:01.540
drawables would basically serving a
 

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.760
drawables would basically serving a
vector into your application so there's

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:02.770
vector into your application so there's
 

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.830
vector into your application so there's
a single asset that can serve up all of

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:04.840
a single asset that can serve up all of
 

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.170
a single asset that can serve up all of
the densities for this particular asset

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.180
the densities for this particular asset
 

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.210
the densities for this particular asset
on screen the vector drawable is

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.220
on screen the vector drawable is
 

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.770
on screen the vector drawable is
actually smaller than the smallest

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:10.780
actually smaller than the smallest
 

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.700
actually smaller than the smallest
density PNG so it's it's quite nice and

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:14.710
density PNG so it's it's quite nice and
 

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.110
density PNG so it's it's quite nice and
this is I would consider it to be kind

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120
this is I would consider it to be kind
 

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.670
this is I would consider it to be kind
of a medium complexity vector with

of a medium complexity vector with
 

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.730
of a medium complexity vector with
somewhat complex paths and but not

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:20.740
somewhat complex paths and but not

is that in support library 23 2 we

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320
is that in support library 23 2 we
 

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.140
is that in support library 23 2 we
introduced support for vector drawables

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.150
introduced support for vector drawables
 

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.850
introduced support for vector drawables
backwards compatible all the way to API

14 also in with n we introduced gradient

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:36.670
14 also in with n we introduced gradient
 

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.280
14 also in with n we introduced gradient
support a vector drawable so hopefully

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.290
support a vector drawable so hopefully
 

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.050
support a vector drawable so hopefully
that gives you kind of a wider range of

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:40.060
that gives you kind of a wider range of
 

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.580
that gives you kind of a wider range of
things you can do you can do with

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:41.590
things you can do you can do with
 

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.770
things you can do you can do with
vectors now one thing to keep in mind

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:43.780
vectors now one thing to keep in mind
 

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.020
vectors now one thing to keep in mind
with vectors is that they can increase

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.030
with vectors is that they can increase
 

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.840
with vectors is that they can increase

then you probably want to do kind of bit
of a performance test and make sure that

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:58.510
of a performance test and make sure that
 

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.420
of a performance test and make sure that
you're not sacrificing a lot of

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.110
images with relatively low complexity we
 

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.450
images with relatively low complexity we
see that vector drawables is a little

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:15.460
see that vector drawables is a little
 

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.720

bit better than multi apk that kind of

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:18.730
bit better than multi apk that kind of
 

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.130
bit better than multi apk that kind of
makes sense right because we're carrying

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:20.140
makes sense right because we're carrying
 

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.310
makes sense right because we're carrying
just a single asset in the application

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320
just a single asset in the application
 

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.720
just a single asset in the application
our advice would be that you consider

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:24.730
our advice would be that you consider
 

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.670
our advice would be that you consider
what kind of image assets are in your

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680
what kind of image assets are in your
 

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.230
what kind of image assets are in your
application so if they are relatively

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240
application so if they are relatively
 

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.270
application so if they are relatively
simple and flat you should definitely

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:30.280
simple and flat you should definitely
 

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.810
simple and flat you should definitely
consider it

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:30.820
consider it
 

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.510
consider it
and then that also simplifies your your

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:33.520
and then that also simplifies your your
 

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.030
and then that also simplifies your your
building QA process so that you only

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040
building QA process so that you only
 

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.530
building QA process so that you only
have to produce one apk to upload to

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:37.540
have to produce one apk to upload to
 

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.960
have to produce one apk to upload to
play so let me hand it back to Shai for

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:39.970

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.560
C file as we saw is small but we'll make
it 2 X smaller with one line because we

introduce today we're presenting
downloadable fonts fonts are a source of

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.140
downloadable fonts fonts are a source of
 

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.780
downloadable fonts fonts are a source of
bloat for apps and we know that they're

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:54.790
bloat for apps and we know that they're
 

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.670
bloat for apps and we know that they're
heavy files they're stuck into your app

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:56.680
heavy files they're stuck into your app
 

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.110
heavy files they're stuck into your app
and you need them because you need it

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120
and you need them because you need it
 

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.930
and you need them because you need it
for your UX that's fine we figured out

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:00.940
for your UX that's fine we figured out
 

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.910
for your UX that's fine we figured out
that actually most fonts that you are

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:02.920
that actually most fonts that you are
 

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.410
that actually most fonts that you are
bundling in your apps are not even

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:04.420
bundling in your apps are not even
 

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.540
bundling in your apps are not even
optimized for mobile so about half of

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:06.550
optimized for mobile so about half of
 

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.310
optimized for mobile so about half of
the apk have that file size that you're

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320
the apk have that file size that you're
 

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.590
the apk have that file size that you're
adding is not even something we're going

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600
adding is not even something we're going
 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.460
adding is not even something we're going
to use in Android so that's a shame

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:13.470
to use in Android so that's a shame
 

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.380
to use in Android so that's a shame
also we looked at the Play Store and we

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:16.390
also we looked at the Play Store and we
 

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.660
also we looked at the Play Store and we
figured out that the 25 apps that bundle

your apps run on and but these resources

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320
your apps run on and but these resources
 

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.810

so they take up unnecessary space in

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:42.850
so they take up unnecessary space in
 

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.830

think you can actually figure out the

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720
think you can actually figure out the
 

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.899
think you can actually figure out the
min SDK of your app and get rid of all

00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:51.909
min SDK of your app and get rid of all
 

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:53.580
min SDK of your app and get rid of all
these resources that are unneeded and

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:53.590
these resources that are unneeded and
 

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.440
these resources that are unneeded and
what's more and can collapse the

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.450
what's more and can collapse the
 

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.600
what's more and can collapse the
configurations in your app to reduce the

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:57.610
configurations in your app to reduce the
 

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.279
configurations in your app to reduce the
size of the resources file even further

00:22:59.279 --> 00:22:59.289
size of the resources file even further
 

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:01.139
size of the resources file even further
only including the resources that your

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:01.149
only including the resources that your
 

00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:04.919
only including the resources that your
app actually will need next up we have

00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:04.929
app actually will need next up we have
 

00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:07.769

translations for your app and it happens

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:12.429
translations for your app and it happens
 

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:13.889
translations for your app and it happens
sometimes that in some for some

00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:13.899
sometimes that in some for some
 

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:15.930
sometimes that in some for some
languages for some configurations like

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:15.940
languages for some configurations like
 

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.779
languages for some configurations like
here French and French Canadian mostly

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:18.789
here French and French Canadian mostly
 

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:21.060
here French and French Canadian mostly
the translations will be the same most

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.070
the translations will be the same most
 

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.519
the translations will be the same most
of the words are exactly the same except

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:23.529
of the words are exactly the same except
 

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:25.769
of the words are exactly the same except
for just a few and it doesn't make sense

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:25.779
for just a few and it doesn't make sense
 

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.990
for just a few and it doesn't make sense
to actually keep these duplicate

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000
to actually keep these duplicate
 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.750
to actually keep these duplicate
resources and in the resources file

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760
resources and in the resources file
 

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.779
resources and in the resources file
so what apt - will do now it will find

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:33.789
so what apt - will do now it will find
 

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:35.549
so what apt - will do now it will find
those duplicate resources get rid of

00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559
those duplicate resources get rid of
 

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:37.950
those duplicate resources get rid of
them and let the system default to the

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960
them and let the system default to the
 

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.730
them and let the system default to the
to the default configuration so this is

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:41.740
to the default configuration so this is
 

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.230
to the default configuration so this is
a version collapsing and resource

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240
a version collapsing and resource
 

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.440

resources included in xml files like
 

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:57.120
resources included in xml files like
layouts and the binary resources file it

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.130
layouts and the binary resources file it
 

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.460
layouts and the binary resources file it
has a smart air cruncher this is the

00:23:59.460 --> 00:23:59.470
has a smart air cruncher this is the
 

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.049
has a smart air cruncher this is the
part that reduces the size of your

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:01.059
part that reduces the size of your
 

00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:03.029
part that reduces the size of your
images by optimizing them and if it

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039
images by optimizing them and if it

finds that your images are actually
 

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:06.889
finds that your images are actually
already pre optimized and the output of

apt - crunching would be bigger then it

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:09.909
apt - crunching would be bigger then it

apt - crunching would be bigger then it
just discards there's bigger versions

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:11.380
just discards there's bigger versions
 

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.529
just discards there's bigger versions
and uses smaller ones so we aim to

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.450
really lacking tools that will let them
inspect those problems in detail that's

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:21.460
inspect those problems in detail that's
 

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.740
inspect those problems in detail that's
why we're making some improvements to

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:22.750
why we're making some improvements to
 

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.930
why we're making some improvements to
the apk analyzer in Android studio let

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:24.940
the apk analyzer in Android studio let
 

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.600
the apk analyzer in Android studio let
me show you an example can we switch to

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:27.610
me show you an example can we switch to
 

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.220
me show you an example can we switch to
the demo please so here I have Android

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.230
the demo please so here I have Android
 

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.139
the demo please so here I have Android

sorry I'm gonna walk you through a few

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.070
sorry I'm gonna walk you through a few
 

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.409
sorry I'm gonna walk you through a few
things that we're adding to let you

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:43.419
things that we're adding to let you
 

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:46.409
things that we're adding to let you
better debug program programs but we've

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:46.419
better debug program programs but we've
 

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:49.049
better debug program programs but we've
also added some UI tweaks to the API

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:49.059
also added some UI tweaks to the API
 

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:50.850
also added some UI tweaks to the API
analyzer that hopefully will make it I'm

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:50.860
analyzer that hopefully will make it I'm
 

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.950
analyzer that hopefully will make it I'm
working with it even easier so the first

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960
working with it even easier so the first
 

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.840
working with it even easier so the first
thing you might notice is we now have

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.850
thing you might notice is we now have
 

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.549
thing you might notice is we now have
multi decks support so I can select

00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559
multi decks support so I can select
 

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:59.249
multi decks support so I can select
multiple decks files and actually see a

00:25:59.249 --> 00:25:59.259
multiple decks files and actually see a
 

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:00.990
multiple decks files and actually see a
combined preview of all the code in my

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000
combined preview of all the code in my
 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.090
combined preview of all the code in my
app so this is a very simple example

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:03.100
app so this is a very simple example
 

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.009
app so this is a very simple example
this is not just a peek app this is just

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:05.019
this is not just a peek app this is just
 

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:06.720
this is not just a peek app this is just
an IPA I created for the purpose of this

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:06.730
an IPA I created for the purpose of this
 

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.539
an IPA I created for the purpose of this
demo and and you can see I can drill

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:09.549
demo and and you can see I can drill
 

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:11.310
demo and and you can see I can drill
down to the source code of my app here

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320
down to the source code of my app here
 

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.850
down to the source code of my app here
and actually see all the other classes

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:14.860
and actually see all the other classes
 

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.529
and actually see all the other classes
that I have and the app really has two

00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:16.539
that I have and the app really has two
 

00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:18.090
that I have and the app really has two
parts it's very simple it just has an

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:18.100
parts it's very simple it just has an
 

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.369
parts it's very simple it just has an
activity and it has the fragment the

00:26:20.369 --> 00:26:20.379
activity and it has the fragment the
 

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:23.249
activity and it has the fragment the
thing is the fragment the way I use it

00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:23.259
thing is the fragment the way I use it
 

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:25.409
thing is the fragment the way I use it
is I only use it from a layout XML file

00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:25.419
is I only use it from a layout XML file
 

00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:28.619
is I only use it from a layout XML file
and that will be important later we also

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:28.629
and that will be important later we also
 

00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:30.869
and that will be important later we also
made some other tweaks to the decks

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:30.879
made some other tweaks to the decks
 

00:26:30.879 --> 00:26:33.299
made some other tweaks to the decks
viewer so for example we have some

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:33.309
viewer so for example we have some
 

00:26:33.309 --> 00:26:35.549
viewer so for example we have some
filtering options and I can for example

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559
filtering options and I can for example
 

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:37.700
filtering options and I can for example
disable showing

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:37.710
disable showing
 

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.869
disable showing
classes there are reference from my file

00:26:39.869 --> 00:26:39.879
classes there are reference from my file
 

00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:42.210
classes there are reference from my file
but are not actually defined in it but

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:42.220
but are not actually defined in it but
 

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.789
but are not actually defined in it but
moving onto ProGuard so this is a debug

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799
moving onto ProGuard so this is a debug
 

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:47.249

enabled so I built my release apk I run

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:51.700
enabled so I built my release apk I run
 

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.580

it and the first big problem with the

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:53.590
it and the first big problem with the
 

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.399
it and the first big problem with the
app is it crashes the crashes on startup

00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:56.409
app is it crashes the crashes on startup
 

00:26:56.409 --> 00:26:58.619
app is it crashes the crashes on startup
I don't know why it solves the class not

00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:58.629
I don't know why it solves the class not
 

00:26:58.629 --> 00:27:01.230
I don't know why it solves the class not
found exception and the second problem

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240
found exception and the second problem
 

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.360
found exception and the second problem
is if I actually go and try to debug the

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.370
is if I actually go and try to debug the
 

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.400
is if I actually go and try to debug the

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:04.410
problem
 

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.890
problem
I can see again like shy mentioned that

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900
I can see again like shy mentioned that
 

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.170
I can see again like shy mentioned that
all the names of my types of my fields

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.180
all the names of my types of my fields
 

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.110
all the names of my types of my fields
methods they were all changed to drink

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120
methods they were all changed to drink
 

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.750

like ABC it's very difficult to debug

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760
like ABC it's very difficult to debug
 

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.780
like ABC it's very difficult to debug
the problem here so what I can do now

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:17.790
the problem here so what I can do now
 

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.760
the problem here so what I can do now
with the new Android studio is I can

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:19.770
with the new Android studio is I can
 

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.560
with the new Android studio is I can
actually load the ProGuard mappings that

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:21.570
actually load the ProGuard mappings that
 

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.870
actually load the ProGuard mappings that
were created with them when my ATK was

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
were created with them when my ATK was
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.530
were created with them when my ATK was
built so let me open the program mapping

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:27.540
built so let me open the program mapping
 

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.820
built so let me open the program mapping
folder here and now you can see the text

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:31.830
folder here and now you can see the text
 

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.660
folder here and now you can see the text
viewer changed first I can actually see

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:35.670
viewer changed first I can actually see
 

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.490
viewer changed first I can actually see
all the names of classes packages

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500
all the names of classes packages
 

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.590
all the names of classes packages
everything's back like it was in my

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600
everything's back like it was in my
 

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.370
everything's back like it was in my
original source code second I can

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380
original source code second I can
 

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.040
original source code second I can
actually go here and see now that my

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.050
actually go here and see now that my
 

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.080
actually go here and see now that my
blank fragment is missing that's because

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.090
blank fragment is missing that's because
 

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.510
blank fragment is missing that's because
ProGuard was not able to automatically

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520
ProGuard was not able to automatically

ProGuard yep so I found the black

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080
ProGuard yep so I found the black
 

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.250
ProGuard yep so I found the black
fragment here it was removed i right to

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260
fragment here it was removed i right to
 

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.290
fragment here it was removed i right to
it right-click on it and I can actually

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:12.300
it right-click on it and I can actually
 

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:19.960
it right-click on it and I can actually
generate a pro gradual that I can

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:19.970
 
 

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.940
 
that I can simply copy and paste to my

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:22.950
that I can simply copy and paste to my
 

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.500
that I can simply copy and paste to my
program configuration so I'm going to

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:24.510
program configuration so I'm going to
 

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.510
program configuration so I'm going to
I'm going to choose the first rule it's

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520
I'm going to choose the first rule it's
 

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.220
I'm going to choose the first rule it's
the simplest one I just want to keep the

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.230
the simplest one I just want to keep the
 

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.470
the simplest one I just want to keep the
class and all its members so I copy it

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480
class and all its members so I copy it
 

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.850
class and all its members so I copy it
here I rebuild my app and I open the apk

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860
here I rebuild my app and I open the apk
 

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.950
here I rebuild my app and I open the apk
after after rebuilding it I've loaded

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960
after after rebuilding it I've loaded
 

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.470
after after rebuilding it I've loaded
the program mappings so that we can keep

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480
the program mappings so that we can keep
 

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.990
the program mappings so that we can keep
things brief brief I open it and what's

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000
things brief brief I open it and what's
 

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.240
things brief brief I open it and what's
more I can see that the black fragment

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.250
more I can see that the black fragment
 

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.279
more I can see that the black fragment
is not only here it's shown in bold

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:46.289
is not only here it's shown in bold
 

00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:49.340
is not only here it's shown in bold
which means it was explicitly kept by

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.350
which means it was explicitly kept by
 

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.909
which means it was explicitly kept by
the program configuration so that's

00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919
the program configuration so that's
 

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:55.010
the program configuration so that's
that's the program support and Android

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020
that's the program support and Android
 

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.019
that's the program support and Android
studio and I think analyzer but there's

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:57.029
studio and I think analyzer but there's
 

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:58.760
studio and I think analyzer but there's
more for real power users you can

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:58.770
more for real power users you can
 

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.909
more for real power users you can
actually now go and and figure out how

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919
actually now go and and figure out how
 

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.460
actually now go and and figure out how
how the classes that you use and the

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:04.470
how the classes that you use and the
 

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.620
how the classes that you use and the
dependencies that you have pull even

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:06.630
dependencies that you have pull even
 

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.019
dependencies that you have pull even
more code inside your app so for example

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:09.029
more code inside your app so for example
 

00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:10.940
more code inside your app so for example
I know that in my source code I'm using

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:10.950

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.570
see it it's in the top left second words
can we go back a slide and then we see

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:21.580
can we go back a slide and then we see
 

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.890
can we go back a slide and then we see
it again okay

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:22.900
it again okay
 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.919

got it now let's look at the gzip -6

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:25.929
got it now let's look at the gzip -6
 

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:29.010
got it now let's look at the gzip -6
compressed version of that here's the

compressed version of that here's the
 

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.610
compressed version of that here's the
first blob of text and here's the second

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:32.620
first blob of text and here's the second
 

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.830
first blob of text and here's the second
blob of text and remember we only change

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840
blob of text and remember we only change
 

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.210
blob of text and remember we only change
one character so let's see that again

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220
one character so let's see that again
 

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.520
one character so let's see that again
it's pretty crazy so a compressed
