00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.050
SUBJECT 1: The
dictionary defines love

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.370
as a feeling of strong
or constant affection

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.739
for a person.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.280
In the real world,
though, we can all

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.454
agree that love is way more
complex and nuanced than that.

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:16.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.630
SUBJECT 2: Love is
caring to other.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.740
SUBJECT 3: Caring about
someone else's existence.

SUBJECT 4: Is the most
beautiful word in the world.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.051
SUBJECT 1: These folks
were just a small fraction

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.510
of hundreds who took part
in the Love IS project,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.437
started by socially conscious
designer, Chrissie Lam.

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:33.770
CHRISSIE LAM: The Love Is
project combines social impact

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.980
product, while connecting
people around the world,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.250
through storytelling.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.830
The focus-- for universal
meaning of the word, love.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.310
It aims to put the meaning
behind the message.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.674
These are real people
and their stories.

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.090
SUBJECT 1: But the
Love Is project

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.710
is more than just a collection
of thoughts on love.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.640
At its heart is a
simple red bracelet,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.600
emblazoned with the
universal message--

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.808
SUBJECT 5: Love is Happiness.

00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:56.770
Happiness is Love.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.360
SUBJECT 1: Chrissie's design
firm works with Maasai women,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.050
enabling them to sell
traditional, autimsal crafts

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.084
around the world.

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.709
CHRISSIE LAM: I worked
with Maasai mums

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.990
in Kenya's Great Rift Valley
to design new products.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.510
Finding myself inspired by the
vibrant colors and patterns

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.350
of the tribe, we
developed an idea

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.340
to design a simple, bold,
and scalable message bracelet

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.900
in their traditional beading.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.139
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.180
SUBJECT 1: The Love bracelet
empowers these women

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.830
by providing them with
a sustainable income.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.469
After the first
bracelets were made,

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.760
Chrissie was looking for ways
to highlight the project,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.099
and it was on her travels
that inspiration struck.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.640
CHRISSIE LAM: Just
over a year later,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.440
with the Love bracelet in
hand, on a flight to Russia,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410
I struck up a conversation
with two perfect strangers.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.610
Girls from East
Pakistan and Kogistan.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.360
On a whim, I asked
them about love.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.580
Upon landing at Moscow airport,
inspired by their answers,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.940
I snapped and uploaded a
photo of them wearing the love

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.040
bracelet to Instagram.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.060
The Love Is project had begun.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.890
SUBJECT 1: Since then,
the Love Is project

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.860
has asked over 500 people,
representing 19 nationalities,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.230
what they think love is.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.090
And I've documented them all
wearing the Maasai bracelets.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.800
SUBJECT 6: Love is
healthy and happy.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.246
SUBJECT 7: Family and friends.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:13.287
SUBJECT 8: It's infinite.

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:14.780

SUBJECT 11: It's
all encompassing.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.898
SUBJECT 12: Love.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.770
SUBJECT 1: And after asking
all those people what love is,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.720
Chrissie can definitely
vouch for the idea

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.664
that everyone's perspective
on the subject is unique.

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:31.830
CHRISSIE LAM: Answers vary
depending on the country,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.413
region you're visiting, as well
as the social, economic class,

00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:35.780
and religion.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.830
I think love is a broad concept.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.050
It's open ended.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.420
It can be hard to define,
because it encompasses so much.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.110
SUBJECT 1: Today, the project
continues to inspire and unite

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.960
people around the world.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.900
Its message of love
and empowerment

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.950
has touched many people.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.820
But most of all, the
Maasai women in Kenya.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.320
CHRISSIE LAM: It's
astounding to see

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.280
how big our love has
grown in a short time

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.150
span around the globe.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.705
It's equally extraordinary to
witness the impact of the Love

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:05.429
Is project on lives and
communities in Kenya.

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.720
SUBJECT 1: Sometimes love
means making a grand gesture.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.450

gift for your loved one.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.357
Kay Jewelers-- every
kiss begins with k.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:15.190
SUBJECT 13: Empowering
messages can be found

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.561

SUBJECT 14: You're
already invited.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.020
It was, just like, a pick-me-up.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.860
Like, you're already invited
to, like, kill this day.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.840
To, like, nail it, to
have the best day ever.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.865
Like, it's already
set up for you.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:33.240
You just have to,
like, go do it.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.490

behind that specific works
