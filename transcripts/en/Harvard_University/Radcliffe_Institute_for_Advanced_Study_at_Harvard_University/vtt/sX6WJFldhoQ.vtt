00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.383
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:08.080
- Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm Liz Cohen, I'm Dean here
at the Radcliffe Institute,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.690
and I am delighted
to welcome all of you

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.530
this afternoon to a lecture
by Jane Kamensky, who

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.720
is a professor of
history here at Harvard,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.540
and the Carl and Lily
Pforzheimer Foundation

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.540
Director of the
Schlesinger Library.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.640
Members of the
Pforzheimer family

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.300
have been steadfast supporters
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.420
for Advanced Study
and all of Harvard.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.810
And I'm delighted that we
have Gary and Mary Pforzheimer

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.300
here with us today in the
audience, so thank you.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.525
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:49.090
In fact, there are
many supporters

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.150
of the library and actually,
the entire Radcliffe

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.470
Institute with us today.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.130
I appreciate the
generosity of everyone,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.970
which makes all that we do
here at Radcliffe possible.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.150
And I'm especially
pleased to welcome members

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.480
of both of Radcliffe's
Advisory Councils,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.300
our Deans Advisory Council
and the Schlesinger Library

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.110
Council.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.470
And I am so glad that you
could all be with us today.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.880
Radcliffe is dedicated to
inquiry and research that

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.370
takes place beyond
the curriculum

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.450
and across the boundaries of
academic disciplines we bring

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.870
together scholars and
scientists, artists

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.230
and public intellectuals
from around the world

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.570
to share their work
with each other

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.350
and with a broad,
interested public like you.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.440
Today we are here to look
at a very different time

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.990
from an unconventional angle.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.000
And we could have
no better guide

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.580
than Jane Kamensky,
my fellow historian

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.530
and Radcliffe colleague.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.970
Jane earned her BA and her
PhD at Yale University.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.650
She taught in the
History Department

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.250
at Brandeis for 21 years,
including doing two stints

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.567
as Department Chair.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:02.275
And she survived.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:03.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.650
She also served on the core
faculty in Women's Gender

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.890
and Sexuality Studies at
Brandeis while she was there.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.070
During the 2014-15
academic year,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.760
Jane was the Mary L.
Cornille Distinguished

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.710
Visiting Professor
at the Newhouse

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.190
Center for the Humanities
at Wellesley College.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.520
In 2015, Jane came
to Harvard to serve

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.000
as the Faculty Director of
Radcliffe Schlesinger Library

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.430
and as a member of the
History Department.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.940
But Jane's connections to
Radcliffe go back even further.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.250
We are pleased that Jane was
a Radcliffe fellow in 2006-07,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.040
and a Bunting fellow
a decade before that.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.190
All of Jane's work from her
scholarship, to her teaching,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030
to her leadership of
the Schlesinger Library

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.350
is marked by innovation,
dynamism, and creativity.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.530
These were the qualities
that greatly inspired us

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.230
when Jane interviewed for the
position of Faculty Director.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.190
And in her first year
and a half on the job,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.800
she has brought them to
bear on her ambitious vision

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.510
for the library.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.270
Together with Executive
Director Marilyn Dunn,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.730
Jane has undertaken
impressive efforts

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
to diversify the library's
collections, seeking

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530
to represent a fuller spectrum
of women's experiences

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.830
across class, race,
political perspective,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.120
sexual orientation, religious
experience, and more.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.130
And under her
leadership, with the help

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.680
of the Schlesinger's
very able staff,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.500
the library is fast
establishing itself

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.670
as a pioneer in new ways of
using rich manuscript archives

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.650
in teaching and learning.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.660
No surprise that
it is increasingly

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.110
being sought out by professors
from across Harvard schools

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.640
and departments.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.760
Jane's innovation,
dynamism, and creativity

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.240
have likewise established
her as a leading historian

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.730
of early America and an
interdisciplinary scholar who

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.810
has written on colonial history,
the history of women, gender,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.290
and the family, and the
history of capitalism.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.890
She has also ranged beyond the
conventional by coauthoring

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.970
an historical novel and
co-founding a digital journal

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.300
called Common-Place: The
Interactive Journal of Early

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.370
American Life, and
these are both projects

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.790
that she did in partnership with
fellow Harvard historian Jill

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.350
Lepore.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.890
Interdisciplinary creativity
marks all of Jane's books,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.850
along with her tireless
research, her eye for just

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.480
the right detail and her
elegant writer's voice,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.510
which combines
analytical sophistication

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.970
with a dash of playfulness.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.340
In her first book,
entitled Governing

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.480
the Tongue: The Politics of
Speech in Early New England,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.080
Jane applied insights from
anthropology and linguistics

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.710
to examine speech as a
way of wielding power

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.930
in early America.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.410
For Jane's 2008 book,
The Exchange Artist,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.550
she drew on urban design,
architecture, and economics

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.930
to tell the story of the Boston
Coffee House, at one time

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.170
an important Boston
institution unique to its time

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.780
and place in the early republic.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.540
Jane probes this
fascinating local site,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.020
and at the same time
she reveals its key role

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.790
in the speculative capitalism
of the early American republic.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.350
In 2007, Jane received a
prestigious New Directions

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.020
Grant from the Mellon
Foundation, which

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.620
allowed her to train
in a totally new field

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.770
to expand her
methodological toolkit.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.530
Jane used the grant to
spend a year in London,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.280
immersing herself in the
study of art history.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.910
That retooling contributed
to Jane's latest book,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.390
A Revolution in Color: The
World of John Singleton

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.540
Copley, published last October.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.970
This book delves into
the artistic life

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.970
and the tumultuous times
of a man best known

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.940
for portraits of prominent
figures like Paul Revere

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.970
and Samuel Adams in a
political revolution

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.650
about which Copley himself
remained ambivalent.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.830
True to Jane's commitment
at the Schlesinger

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.430
to embed considerations
of gender and family

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.920
and how we tell
all of our history,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.330
her Copley story locates him
as much in the private life

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.870
of his family and household
as in the public life

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.510
of 18th century
imperial politics.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.390
If Copley was awash
in ambivalence

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.640
about the American
Revolution, there

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.210
has been nothing ambivalent
about the critical response

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.400
to A Revolution in Color.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.160
It has won the American History
Book Prize of the New York

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.340
Historical Society and the
Annibel Jenkins Biography

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.270
Prize of the American Society
for Eighteenth-Century Studies.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.470
It was also named a finalist
for PEN's Jacqueline Bograd Weld

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.230
Award for Biography,
the Marfield

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.340
Prize for Arts Writing, and the
George Washington Book Prize.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.220
I am confident that we
will all benefit from

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.480
and greatly enjoy learning more
about A Revolution in Color

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.040
from Jane today.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.190
So now please join me
in giving a warm welcome

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.935
to Jane Kamensky.

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:26.658
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.850
- Thank you so much for that
gracious introduction, Liz.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.650
I feel like there's
nothing anybody now

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.090
does not know about me.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.614 --> 00:07:46.030
But if anybody wants to hear
about the Hazel Avenue School

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.550
in West Orange, New
Jersey, we started

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.160
after that, I'll tell
you during the Q&amp;A.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.320
Thank you also to
Alison Franklin

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.360
and her colleagues
in communications

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.200
who designed this wonderful
image that you see behind

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.050
me and did the work of
getting everybody here today.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.720
Jess Brilli, who does
these images for Radcliffe,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.600
really is an artist
in her own right.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.140
I think Copley would very much
approve of her crop there.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.270
Thank you to my many
Harvard colleagues

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.490
who I see in the audience
who have contributed

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.070
in various ways, not
just from the History

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.770
Department but from
around the campus,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.340
from the museums and
the libraries as well,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.860
in various ways to
the final stages

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.370
of this book, which took place
after I had come to Harvard.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.520
And then last and
most, to my colleagues

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.990
from the Schlesinger library,
who make it an absolute joy

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.520
to go to work every day and
who have made this book in ways

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.310
that I couldn't have predicted,
and that they couldn't have

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.570
predicted, in part a
story about collecting.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.940
And you'll hear a
little bit about that

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.480
and I think sense a little
bit of Schlesinger's impact

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.160
on A Revolution in Color and my
understanding of Copley's life

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.080
towards the end.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.620
So my talk this
afternoon is a circle,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.860
which is a self-conscious
choice about a way

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.710
to tell a revolutionary story.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.680
After the American
Revolution and especially

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.230
after the French
Revolution a decade later,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.960
the word revolution took on a
new meaning, which is neatly

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.130
captured by Hannah Arendt in
this quotation from her book,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.810
On Revolution.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.640
"Revolutions," she
says, "confront

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.870
us directly and inevitably
with problems of beginning.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.960
For revolutions, however we
may be tempted to define them,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.350
are not mere changes, but entail
'starting with a new beginning,

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.270
a complete change of society.'"

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.720
Americans in the time of
the American Revolution

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.260
adopted elements
of this definition.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.180
The American Revolution
came to be called

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.960
the American Revolution
as early as 1776,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.600
although not frequently
until a generation later,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.950
Jefferson captures
this Arendtian sense

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.580
in a famous letter that he
wrote upon his inaugural

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.220
in 1801, which he
called of course,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.210
a second American Revolution,
where he said in a letter

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.910
to Joseph Priestley,
"We can no longer

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.850
say that there is nothing
new under the sun,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.510
for this whole chapter in
the history of man is new."

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.710
Jefferson was very modest.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.430
My talk is a circle beginning
and ending with this picture,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.530
because Copley, like so many
of his generation on both sides

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.290
of the Atlantic,
hewed to an older

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.810
sense of what revolution
meant, a circular sense based

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.980
in Enlightenment science and in
the agricultural calendar that

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.560
centered on revolving--

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.400
not always revolving to
exactly the same place,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.220
but revolution as
a putting right,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.940
more or less within
a fixed orbit.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.360
Copley embraced in his
work and in his life

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.330
a certain degree of innovation,
but not wholesale invention.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.900
He believed, though he
didn't quite put it this way,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.580
in evolution rather
than revolution.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.420
So this is Copley's grand
picture of his own family,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.550
painted during the
revolutionary year of 1776.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.640
It's what was on his
easel that spring.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.920
A diarist noted seeing it in
his painting rooms in April,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.170
unfinished with
the likenesses just

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.960
coming into focus,
which means it takes

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.570
only a little bit of
poetic license, which

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.140
I hope you will grant
me, to place it there

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.850
on the 4th of July.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.580
It was the largest
and most complex

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.920
picture Copley had ever
painted at that time.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.950
It's about 10 times the size
of his bust-length portraits

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.940
of which we're so fond in
the Museum of Fine Arts.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.330
And it contains within
it what we might say

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.660
is his whole affective world.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.990
His beloved wife,
Susanna, called

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:29.100
Sukey, her little silk-shod
foot perched on a tuffet

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.520
and opposed taken from
Correggio's Madonna of St.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.900
Jerome, which Copley had just
copied over a period of months

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.120
in Parma, Italy.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.680
His stern-faced
father-in-law, Richard Clarke,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.850
who made everything about the
picture and about Copley's life

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:54.120
from this point forward at once
both possible and inevitable.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.260
The artist shows himself
behind as the master planner

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.590
and in ways you can't
quite see in the resolution

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.130
of a reproduction,
just hugely fashionable

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.770
and a beautiful
bottle-green velvet cloak.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.240
And he has a trail of his
natural hair in a long queue

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.970
romantically going
down his back.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.640
And then four children portrayed
in this newly playful gambling

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.240
fashion of the time,
though by the time

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.460
Copley painted the picture, one
of them was dead an ocean away

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.660
and never having been
seen by his father.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.600
The glimpse of countryside
in the background

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.950
is vaguely Italianate.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.060
It closely approximates
the biblical scene,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.380
the biblical backdrop to his
painting The Ascension, which

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.540
was done the year
before in 1775 in Rome,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.590
in a kind of mystical
communion between Copley

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.350
and Raphael's transfiguration.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.030
He wrote a lot about this.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.820
And also with the
palette of Poussin,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.450
which is everywhere in the
way that the colors deploy

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.080
themselves on the canvas.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.180
But if the setting,
the natural setting

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.620
in the backdrop of the
family picture is Italian,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.950
the setting of the
painting was London.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.900
So when I say that
the painting was

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:27.840
on Copley's easel on or
about July 4th of 1776,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.110
that easel was set up in
elegant rented quarters

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.560
at 12 Leicester Square,
just around the corner

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.560
from the studio of
Sir Joshua Reynolds

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.210
and near the British Museum.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.805
So the respectable West
End, not the West End

00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:45.120
of the actors and the whores.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.100
All spring long in 1776,
people came in and out

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.240
of Copley's new home, talking
about the great public topic

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.650
of the day, the American
War, debating pamphlets

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.420
for and against.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.840
On the day that the diarist
Samuel [? Kirwan ?] stopped by

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.450
and saw the family
portrait on the easel,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.680
he carried with him a new
pamphlet entitled An Inquiry

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.890
whether the Guilt of the
Present Civil War in America

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.350
ought to be imputed to
Great Britain or America.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.370
America was the author's answer.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.560
A few days later,
the diarist picked up

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.080
a copy of Richard
Price's Observations

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.160
on the Nature of Civil Liberty,
and the Justice and Policy

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.070
of the War with America.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:37.460
Unjust was Richard
Price's answer.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.080
Here's how Copley described the
war with America when he first

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.380
learned about the
fighting in Lexington

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:51.650
in April of 1775, news which
took until July of 1775

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.920
to reach him in Parma, Italy.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.150
He says, "The flame of Civil
War is now broke out in America,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.400
and I have not
the least doubt it

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.500
will rage with the
violence equal to what

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.440
it has done in any other
country in any time."

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.270
A civil war, as my
colleague David Armitage

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.180
has recently and
brilliantly explained,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.960
is in many ways cast is the
opposite of a revolution,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.980
an expression of spasmodic
violence with unpredictable

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.540
and usually negative
consequences,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.660
distinctly unprogressive,
unrighteous,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.640
a slipping backwards into
atavism and barbarism,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.280
rather than a new beginning.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.640
And yet civil war
is also the genus

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.690
of which revolution, in the
new sense that Copley did not

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:47.360
share, was a particularly
proud species.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.650
At the same time that his Boston
contemporaries were actively

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.520
calling a nation into
being, signing a declaration

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.330
centered on verbs like
dissolve and assume and publish

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.410
and pledge and of
course declare,

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.280
Copley was reveling in
a kind of happenstance,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.940
casting himself as in this
quote from a letter written

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.810
the next month, not as
the agent of destiny,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.150
but as a recipient of it.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.609
Not as a declarer
of independence,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.369
but a creature of
interdependence,

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:26.599
an enmeshment of calling
and character and kin

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.930
that had taken him from the
edge of the British empire

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.430
to the center.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.380
And I think so striking in this
last line, reveling in the fact

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.230
that he now has no
choice left to make.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.660
So I want to think
about what it means

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.510
to look at the world of
the American Revolution,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.330
and even the founding
of the United States

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:54.400
through Copley's eyes and to
see not a revolution in Arendt's

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.200
terms and not independence
in Jefferson's terms,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.770
but rather a quite different
mixture of dependence

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.000
and independence,
choice and accident.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.010
Copley shows us this blend
in particularly vivid ways,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.980
because he was a painter
whose acuteness of vision

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.660
left a lasting material legacy,
including many wonderful things

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.660
here on the Harvard campus.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.930
But as the historian
Kathleen DuVal has recently

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.540
argued in her towering
book Independence Lost,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.400
centered on the American
Revolution in the Gulf Coast.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.100
"Being independent," and
here I'm quoting DuVal,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.690
"being independent would have
been unwelcome to most people

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.030
in 18th century North America.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.120
Men and women
depended on a web of

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.480
economic, social, and
political connections

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.050
that provided stability
and opportunity even

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.590
as they limited complete
freedom of action.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.910
Empires worked in part
because they incorporated

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:06.400
diverse and unequal populations
into a system of beneficial,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.520
if also coercive connections.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.600
For most, advantageous
interdependence

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.330
was a more logical
goal," end quote.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.650
Copley's pursuits sometimes
deliberate, sometimes

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.220
shambling, of
interdependence, which

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.940
was sometimes advantageous
and sometimes disastrous,

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.870
are my subject this afternoon.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.150
But I also want
to think with you

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.680
about how looking at this
particular, and in many ways

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:47.640
peculiar life story changes
the shape of the whole.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.950
So this story of
interdependence is not

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:55.320
the story we usually tell about
Copley, or indeed about Boston,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.430
where we use Copley to
tell a particular story

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.360
and where Copley spent
his first 38 years.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.960
Boston began calling itself
the cradle of American liberty

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.910
as early as 1791.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.970
That's the first printed
usage I've found of it.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.710
And by the American
centennial in 1876,

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.800
that slogan was everything
but trademarked--

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.340
not only part of the
city's sense of itself,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.660
as it still is, but of
its tourist economy,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.480
including the new Museum
of Fine Arts, which

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.110
opened in that centennial
year, which opened on July

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:39.150
4th, of 1876,
facing an open plaza

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:45.900
that came in 1882 to be
called Copley Square.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.440
Beginning in that
centennial generation,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.130
Copley's work came
to play a large role

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.160
in a national and
civic narrative.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.450
We might say that Copley's Paul
Revere, the inescapable Paul

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:06.180
Revere, was the baby in
the cradle of liberty.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.170
That was a laugh line.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.170
It's his most iconic
work, arguably

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.470
the second most famous face
of revolutionary America

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.830
after George Washington,
whom Copley never painted,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.190
which I think was a missed
opportunity for both of them.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.450
He painted this portrait
of the silversmith in 1768,

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.300
a year of renewed
political upheaval

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.920
in British America following
a period of relative quiet.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.750
The painting is small.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.090
This is the size, of
which you could fit 10

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.890
in the family picture.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.880
But it looms large in a
particular liberty narrative

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.220
of the American founding, and
has done that work publicly

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.090
since it came into public
hands in the 1930s.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.940
If you doubt that we place
this in a liberty narrative,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.850
here's how the
Museum of Fine Arts

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.890
displayed Copley's
Revere in 1951,

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.470
between the flags
of the United States

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.290
and the flag of
the Commonwealth.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.260
This is his Liberty Bowl,
Revere's Liberty Bowl,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.950
also fashioned in
1768 in front of it.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.860
And let me just tell you
as a lapsed Catholic girl,

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.595
this is an altar.

00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:24.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.420
And there's a sort of
chalice-like presentation

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.820
of the Liberty Bowl.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:38.090
And American museology has
changed so much since 1951.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:43.360
And the new Art of the Americas
wing at the Museum of Fine Arts

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.090
really is splendid.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.620
And yet we have hung
onto some of the ways

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:56.830
that Revere is working
sacredly in a narrative

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.210
of the American
Revolution, which

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.720
includes this quartet of
Copley's receding back

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.590
into the distance, Sam
Adams, John Hancock perched

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.109
over his account book
as if in 1765 he's

00:23:09.109 --> 00:23:11.650
practicing his signature for
the Declaration of Independence.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.790
11 years later,
Dr. Joseph Warren

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.940
waiting to become the martyr
of Bunker Hill and Mercy

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.720
Otis Warren waiting to
become a generation, hence

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.260
the first historian of
the American Revolution.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.650
The gallery is called
Revolutionary Boston.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.420
My colleague Jill
Lepore has called

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.450
these the Patriot Superfriends.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.840
So a particular story
of Boston and its role

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.770
in the founding of a particular
story of the nation with Copley

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.640
pressed into its service,
when in fact Copley

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.370
grew up in a very
different Boston

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:54.320
with a very different set of
connections and belongings.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.760
So this is a detail from
a map that is reprinted

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.940
throughout the 18th century.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:06.640
This is a 1769 printing,
it's first printed in 1722.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.550
And the whole map
performs for the harbor.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.010
East is the north of this map.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.610
Just as 18th century Boston
performed for the harbor,

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.310
and as indeed every
American seaport did.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.760
These were second tier
British seaports, not

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.570
an incipient Acela corridor.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.780
Copley lived in his
early years in one

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.180
of these ramshackle houses
on the north side of the Long

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.680
Wharf.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.010
It's a very plebeian
space, where his mother

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.790
sold tobacco on the
first floor and family

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:46.870
possessions and living space
was in a sort of second floor

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.370
lean-to.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.610
He was the child of immigrants,
which was not unusual

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.340
in the world of the 18th
century Atlantic, which

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.830
was a very mobile
place, but is quite

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.740
unusual in the world
of New England, which

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:05.110
was by then a very long-lived
settler colonial population.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.670
His parents were
both from Ireland,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.350
in the second substantial
wave of Irish immigration

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.050
to Boston in the 1730s.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.880
His mother was sort of a
Tennessee Williams character

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.380
of fallen gentry
from County Claire,

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.870
and his father in the
way of such tales,

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.680
was a ne'er do
well from Limerick.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.140
In this oceanic
world, if we think

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.930
about where all these
ships were going,

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.790
and this is a question
that we can answer

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.630
by looking at newspapers,
which tracked ships coming in

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.420
and ships going out,
they we're going

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.130
to places like Halifax,
Jamaica, and Barbados,

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.320
which were the three
most frequent trading

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:53.140
partners of Boston to
England, especially to London

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.920
and to Bristol, and more
often to West Africa

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.140
than to Philadelphia
or New York.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.380
So if we're doing
that Saul Steinberg

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.360
cartoon, that famous
cartoon of the view

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.090
of the world from
9th Avenue, the view

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:11.320
of the world from Copley's
Boston was closer to Jamaica

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.480
than it was to Philadelphia.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.570
There's a sort of famous
historian's canard

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.980
that at the time of the
first Continental Congress,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.130
more of the participants
than that Congress

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.920
had been to London than
had been to Philadelphia,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.370
which of course made
sense in their world.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.220
London was the only
capital city recognized

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.050
by all of these disparate
provinces, which

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.230
in British North America at
the time of Copley's birth

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:48.290
numbered not 13, but 21,
and after 1763, numbered 26.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.000
So that's the landscape
of America for him,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.390
is 26 polities.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.790
There is no logical
subgroup of 13

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.370
in the world of his childhood.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.420
And the place that they
call home is London.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.130
London called home even into
the post-revolutionary American

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.750
Atlantic.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.360
Another reason to focus
on the oceanic nature

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.510
of Copley's world besides
connections and trade

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.150
is I think that oceans remind
us of a certain kind of drift

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:26.200
of fatalism, of the bobbing
cork of an individual

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.290
on a sea of life--

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.230
in Copley's case, a kind
of Anglican providentialism

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.280
that's emblemetized in
the no choice left quote

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.740
that I showed you
before, but also

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.820
in print in this first sentence
of a loyalist narrative

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:47.500
in 1782, in which our hero,
Lieutenant James Moody says,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.350
"The choice and
plan, it would seem,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.950
have seldom much influence
in determining either men's

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.130
characters or their conditions.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.070
These are usually the
result of circumstances

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:04.270
utterly without our control."

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:08.860
The importance of this sense
of accidents and contingency

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.490
to biography is true
to the whole genre.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.500
I think one of the
reasons it's worth

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.610
looking at history at the
level of individual life

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.880
is it reminds us that
while we as historians,

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.680
as social scientists traffic
in patterns and choices,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.320
accidents more
than plans make up

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.990
the people who make up history.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.660
And this was a truism
of Copley's life

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.390
and of his American
Revolution as well.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.740
So I'm going to sketch a
couple of tiers of accident,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.350
starting with the personal.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:48.080
I've said that he was the
child of Irish immigrants.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.680
He was also a child who was,
for much of his early years,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.060
raised by a widowed mother
without brothers or sisters.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.040
This is a very
distinctive condition

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.760
in the rabbit hutch of
18th century America,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.820
where especially in the
North, families of 8 or 10,

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.950
12 children are the norm.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.070
The last time I know
his father was alive,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.870
Copley was three years old.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.170
His mother was as
young as 30 and didn't

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:21.160
remarry for a long
time, which is itself

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.330
interesting and
unrecoverable to me.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.080
It's atypical of the time.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.700
So the two of them
shifting together,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:33.520
this very young boy and
this widowed trader woman

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.580
on the Long Wharf for
a long period of time,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.820
I think among the
accidents of character,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.570
it makes him a watchful person.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:46.630
It's a rough and dangerous
space, the Long Wharf, seamen

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.140
and stevedores
and the people who

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.300
serviced them in all of the
ways that they needed servicing.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.310
Another accident--
I didn't want to say

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.904
whores a second time in
the same talk at Harvard,

00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:00.820
but here I've done it.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.780
Another biographical
accident that

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.850
winds up being very
important, and you're

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.190
wondering how Cotton Mather
is going to enter this story

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.360
and here it is, is that when
Copley's mother, Mary Singleton

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:19.450
Copley, remarried in 1748 when
Jack Copley, she called him,

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.830
was 10, it happened to be
to a highly trained artisan

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.700
from London named Peter Pelham,
also an immigrant and also

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.500
with Irish connections.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.870
There's no surviving
image of Pelham,

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.850
but this is the
mezzotint engraving

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.340
that he did of
Cotton Mather soon

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.190
after Pelham got to America.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.250
He came to America, he
got Mather to sit to him,

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.854
a London-trained portraitist
was a good thing,

00:30:44.854 --> 00:30:46.270
and then Mather
did the best thing

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.060
Mather could have possibly
done for Pelham's career, which

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.840
was to die.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.480
And he marketed this mezzotint
print in Boston, at which point

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.500
mezzotint was new enough, which
meant that Pelham's skills were

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.420
distinctive enough
that he had to explain

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.050
in the newspapers what
this form of engraving was.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:06.670
So he got a stepfather
who happened

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:11.170
to be an artisan, really
quite on the cutting edge.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.660
Another accident,
both happy and sad,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.570
is that the couple began to
have children right away.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:22.210
So Jack, at age 10, got a very
beloved little brother, Henry,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.810
known as Harry in this
little candlelight portrait

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.240
on the other side
of your screen.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.450
And there was a
short-lived little girl

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.990
named Helena Maria, who died
before her first birthday.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.300
What's interesting to
me about Helena Maria

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.670
is that is a very
high church name

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:44.670
for an Anglican on the
eastern rim of the Atlantic.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.630
I don't know whether
there's crypto-Catholicism

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.000
in their background.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.250
And then the last
biographical accident

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.130
that matters for this
part of my story today

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:58.390
is that three years after this
blended family came together

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.800
and probably after three years
in which a 10-year-old would

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:08.110
be put to work in his
father's artisanal enterprise,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.440
Peter Pelham died,
so that Copley

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.730
has a male provider in his
life, maybe for the first three

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.880
years of his life and then
for a three-year window

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.420
in his early
adolescence, leaving

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.140
behind a vulnerable young
family with a 12-year-old

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.680
to 13-year-old Copley
as the male provider,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.750
and the rudiments of this very
particular and peculiar trade.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.640
So an accident that
meant that Copley

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.760
had to get to work very
early, and that the work

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:46.120
he had to get to work in was
the work of artisanship and art.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.110
This is one of the earliest
surviving Copley canvases

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.420
from 1754.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.980
It's at the Museum of Fine Arts.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:59.440
It's in store, they don't hang
it, you can probably see why.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.600
I want to say just a couple
of things about this picture

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:10.180
before moving on to a different
type of accidental shaping.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.200
So it's a very ambitious picture
in a lot of ways for somebody

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.480
who is trying out his hand.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.480
It's a copy of a
European print, which is

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.430
a copy of a European painting.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:27.040
And its mythological subject
is Galatea riding the waves.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.220
Like Boston itself, it
depicts an oceanic world.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.700
Several of Copley's
earliest paintings

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.250
are these reproductions
of reproductions

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.980
of European seascapes.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.000
It's very large.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.040
It's two Reveres.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.900
So from the perspective
of a 16-year-old trying

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.480
to fashion himself
as an artist, that

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.270
represents a significant
investment in materials,

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.820
as well as an
investment in time.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.870
And keep in mind that
the canvas, the brushes,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:06.670
the pigments, the oils,
the recipes, everything

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:11.560
but the frame would have
come imported from London.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.520
The other thing that I find
kind of importantly poignant

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.040
about this image is how
faint provincial echoes

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.610
of a very distant
cosmopolitan world

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.520
meant something, so
that seeing the print

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.280
and imagining the colors and
knowing something of not only

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.280
Ovid's Galatea but
that Handel had

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.469
remade Galatea into the most
popular piece of secular music

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:44.230
in 18th century
London, how all of that

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.620
in some game of
telephone way found

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.739
its way into Copley's Boston.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:58.060
So 1754 at the age of 16,
here is an artisan's child

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.140
painting himself into the
world of British empire

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.360
and trying to
imagine it in color.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.760
I think it's metaphorically
quite true to Copley's hunger

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:15.040
and what you could and couldn't
do in the Boston of his time.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.800
The other important
and accidental context

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.350
that he shared with an
entire generation and not

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.530
just fatherless boys
on the wharf in Boston

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.380
was that he lived
in a world of war.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.410
And in this sense, the
American Revolution

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.960
wasn't so revolutionary
after all,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.750
because European imperial wars
played out in North America

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.770
were statistically
the norm of his life.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.450
He lived for 77 years.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:48.610
45 of those years
were spent in wartime

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:54.350
where England, France, and
North America were all involved.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.430
The first of these four
wars of Copley's life

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.520
broke out the year after he was
born, though he couldn't have

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.960
possibly noted, he was born
at the end of the longest

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.160
peace for a century.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.960
This is the Second
Hundred Years' War,

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.860
as some historians call it.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.480
And significantly, I've
said that 1754, 1753

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.420
are his first surviving works.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.820
It was a happy accident
in ways for his career

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.880
that he came to
artistic adulthood

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.470
and to the need for
a manly competence,

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:33.460
as people at his time
would have put it, as the

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.720
Seven Years' War was making
Boston a provisioning

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:44.380
hub of the Northern frontier
of this great global war.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.040
The Seven Years' War killed
an awful lot of people,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.200
not just around
North America and not

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.680
just around the Atlantic,
but around the globe.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.340
But it also made great fortunes,
and it brought the empire

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.080
to Boston in a way that
had never happened before.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.520
The number of
redcoats on the ground

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.990
go from scores to hundreds to
thousands to tens of thousands

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.925
in a period of about two years.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.724
And as the empire collected
in that provisioning hub,

00:37:20.724 --> 00:37:22.140
there were people
who had fortunes

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.811
to have their portraits painted
like John Hancock's Uncle

00:37:25.811 --> 00:37:26.310
Thomas.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.220
That's where his
fortune originates,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.400
is in provisioning ships for the
Northern frontier of the Seven

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.510
Years' War.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:39.270
And there were soldiers
and other men attached

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:44.580
to the British army, who wanted
to have their portraits painted

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.900
in the cloth of empire.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.140
So I put quite a lot
of weight in my book

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.850
on some of these quite formulaic
early military paintings, which

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.490
are not especially
interesting art historically.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.800
They're kind of
much of a muchness.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.900
And yet in terms of building
Copley's strategic world,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.950
showing these men in the
scarlet fabric of empire

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.960
and contributing
to the gift economy

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.730
where a portrait went
to Hancock to thank him

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.440
for his generosity,
were inordinately

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.500
important to a young
artist who wanted

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.680
to break the frame of
provincial Boston, which

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.860
he called this frozen region.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.160
He knew about today, right?

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.800
The strategies, these
paintings tested the networks

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.140
they provided, the
skills that they'd built,

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.410
all became very
important to Copley

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.160
in the post Seven
Years' War world.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.910
This is another one, still in
private hands of Colonel Jacob

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.440
Fowle.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.410
This is painted at the very
end of the Seven Years' War.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.440
The one I just showed you was
painted near the beginning

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.930
so that these red-coated
images are carrying him

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:04.210
through the entirety of this
war, and indeed a bit beyond.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.400
What I wanted to tell you
about this picture is,

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.950
this is a very
old style uniform.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.340
It's an older man who has not
served in the Seven Years' War,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.740
but served in the
war before that.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.020
And yet the new war made
you come and take out

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.130
the uniform of the old war
and show your connection

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.960
to the lineage that looks
backwards over the Hanoverian

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.080
Arc of time, not
forwards anticipating

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:35.240
some American Revolution, which
is literally unimaginable.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.360
The most important
of Copley's redcoats

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.360
over the course of
his entire career,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.060
both historically
and biographically,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.140
is this dramatic three quarter
length history portrait

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.850
of General Thomas Gage, who was
the commander of British forces

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.030
in all of North
America, and who came

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:01.320
to Boston in the fall of 1768
to settle an occupying army

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.310
into its winter quarters.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:07.320
Because that visit was
so closely documented,

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.230
we know almost
exactly when Copley

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.100
painted this picture, which
was within months, if not

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.520
within weeks of the moment
that he painted Paul Revere.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.790
So when we're thinking
about his world,

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.600
we have to think of those
things going together.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.330
We also have to
think of the fact

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:31.550
that Copley at this point,
so 1768 in the Gage portrait

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.970
and 1769 in this
document, which shows

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:39.650
all the attendees of the annual
commemoration of the Stamp Act

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.230
riots by the Sons of Liberty.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.020
So in this document,
Copley is listed

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.490
among the Sons of Liberty.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:50.360
This is Copley here, the
Adams cousins up there,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:56.450
Hancock as usual, first under
the Hs and Revere over there.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.170
So in some social and
political network,

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.530
he is a soft liberty man
as well as the painter

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.980
of the occupying army.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.740
Some historians in the
past have taken this

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:14.240
as a particular deafness
in Copley's character.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.210
I think it shows us that the
sides and the social worlds

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:22.100
were really still very enmeshed
and not very far apart at all,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.590
because these men also
sat down and drank

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:28.010
with Gage's adjutants.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.150
The revolution is not
after all yet come.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.730
Copley continues
painting red coats

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:40.460
in the wake of the Boston
so-called massacre in 1770.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.690
This is Captain John Montresor,
who's one of Gage's adjutants.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.320
Copley paints him
in New York in 1771.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.610
Following that military nexus
from the Seven Years' War

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.760
into the early stages
of the imperial crisis

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.290
and still broadening out these
networks of men in red cloaks.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.440
This is at Detroit
Institute of Arts now,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.840
and it's a really
striking painting.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.940
So a counter-factual question
would be without the Seven

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.890
Years' War and the military and
social and economic connections

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:21.020
it forged, I don't know that
Copley would have begun by late

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:27.620
1764 or early 1765 to ponder
the question that would dog him

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.390
for the next decade and return
in some ways for the rest

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.720
of his life, which was how
would his work stand up

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.300
to the competition at home--

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.460
which is to say, in London--

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.320
and ought he to follow it there?

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.480
This of course,
is the famous Boy

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.420
with a Flying Squirrel,
which hangs at the MFA

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.870
in a kind of pride
of place, though not

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:55.800
so prideful as the
much lesser Revere.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.490
Copley sent it to London
in September of 1765

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.410
in the immediate
wake of the Stamp Act

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.980
riots, which he bemoaned even
though he was a liberty man,

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.990
more contradiction.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.890
He was painting and planning
at that entire year,

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:16.020
if not longer, and building
up a network of sea captains

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.960
and military men
and other conduits

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.470
to get it from the Long
Wharf to the Annual Spring

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.930
Exhibition of the
Society of Artists

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:29.430
of Great Britain, a society
and exhibition program that

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.420
was itself a kind of
artistic nationalism

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.140
catalyzed by the
Seven Years' War.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.550
So I think we might see this
too as a kind of military

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:46.350
painting with Boy with a Flying
Squirrel draped literally

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.420
in the scarlet cloth of empire.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.400
So I painted Copley
largely as a creature

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.670
of drift, which was how
he experienced himself

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.880
and in many ways
continued to be.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.650
But he did one very planful
and absolutely critical

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.750
thing in his life, which was
to marry very well and very

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.860
deliberately in
the fall of 1769,

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.310
about a year after
painting Revere and Gage,

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:22.550
and just a couple of months
after that Sons of Liberty

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:23.900
dinner.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.020
We know that he was tactical
about marriage because he wrote

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.960
about how hard it
was to put it off,

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.900
how hard it was to husband
his energies for his craft

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.860
and stay a bachelor to
the advanced age of 28.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.740
He wound up staying a bachelor
three years longer than that.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.440
So even though we
never know, is somebody

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.450
aware of the
demographic average that

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.640
is the average age of
marriage, he was aware

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.960
that he was getting a
little long in the tooth.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.270
We know it was a love
marriage, or at least it

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:56.360
unfolds on paper
like a love marriage.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.660
Love marriage being the
new fashion of the day,

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.760
would have been considered
quite preposterous

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.520
even 100 years before.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.400
But it was also a tactical
marriage, love and money

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.480
went together, and
maybe even still do.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.770
A huge climb for him
socially and economically,

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:19.550
when we teach the marriage
plot as the common plot

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.220
of 18th century fiction,
I think we too often

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.420
forget that for every
woman who married down,

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.040
there is a man who married up.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.550
And that man was Copley.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:33.740
So he married Susanna
Farnham Clarke--

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.490
you've already met her in
silk in the family portrait--

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:44.360
and gains in her set of family
connections an enormous amount

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.850
of economic wherewithal
and new interdependencies

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.900
and dependencies, some of
which he could imagine and some

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.740
of which he couldn't.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.760
So a kind of independence,
Copley gained the wherewithal

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.000
to purchase land, which
was the only way someone

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.460
could think of
themselves as independent

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:07.580
in the 18th century.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.550
This is why there
were traditionally

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.300
property qualifications required
to be able to cast a vote.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.280
Only if you held
real property did

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.110
you have the capacity to
have an independent opinion

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.610
politically.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.330
So this is a detail taken
from here on this map

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:27.670
so that you can see
that Copley's holdings

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:31.120
in downtown Boston were large
enough to be labeled as a map

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.130
feature, as Copley's hill.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.870
He put together about
14 contiguous acres

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.160
of downtown Boston, going
from in the present just

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.370
next to the Bulfinch
gold-domed statehouse all the

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.580
way to Charles
Street, and then going

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.960
north all the way back to
what was then the riverfront.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.020
So an enormous
gentleman farm, which

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.040
he describes at great length
in a series of letters.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.840
When he is having it
renovated in 1770, 1771,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.240
he calls it Mount Pleasant.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.770
He cultivates potatoes, he does
the whole gentleman farming

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.450
thing.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.690
He also gained from
his marriage, children

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:20.230
born at very regular intervals,
the kind of regular intervals

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.330
that Sukey could
only have because she

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.480
was a fancy enough lady
that she was employing

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.500
a wet nurse, which we know
from his letters that she was.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.730
The first daughter Betsy is
born almost exactly nine months

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.660
after the marriage,
but not one day sooner.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:43.300
And a young John Jr., who they
called Jackie about 18 months

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.770
after that, and a daughter Mary,
called Polly, about 18 months

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.330
after that.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.570
In fact, one of the reasons
that Copley wound up still

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.970
here in the fateful fall of 1773
is because Suki was pregnant

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.790
again.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:07.240
Copley also became a slaveholder
upon his marriage, another kind

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.890
of interdependence that his
growing liberty and capacity

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.670
to exercise independent
judgment, put him

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.690
into the rank of Boston's
slaveholding classes,

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.390
which were not as small
as the cradle of liberty

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.030
likes to suggest.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.240
This was an irony,
this combination

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.370
of slavery and
liberty that was much

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:34.330
remarked upon by
anti-revolutionary forces

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.350
at the time.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:41.950
Most famously Samuel Johnson in
1775, writing, "How is that we

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.050
hear the loudest
yelps for liberty

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.290
among the drivers of Negroes?"

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:51.100
There were at least three
bondspeople in Copley's retinue

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.790
at Mount Pleasant in the
immediate wake of his wedding--

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:59.020
a boy called Snap who was
probably from the Caribbean

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.630
where Sukey's
father had business;

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.510
a girl called Lucy
whom Copley sold

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:10.690
in 1771 into the Pepperell
family whose new mistress was

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.750
therefore the daughter
of Isaac Royall,

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.510
so he joins the Harvard
slavery story that way;

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:22.810
and an older boy or young man
named Cato in that classisizing

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:26.500
way of naming slaves in the
18th century, who we know about

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:32.320
because he married in Boston in
the post-revolutionary period,

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.840
able to take his
independence in a way

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.890
that he couldn't beforehand,
and left a record that way.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.310
We don't know who
this man is who

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:47.080
Copley painted in 1778, by
which point he was in London.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.110
It's an oil sketch,
a study picture

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.730
for the figure at the apex
of Watson and the shark.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:59.950
It stayed in the family, this
oil sketch, into the 1860s,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.640
was known in the catalog
that sold the family

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.560
pictures in 1862 as the
head of a favorite Negro.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.330
So it is a familiar
of the family.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.420
It's also a very
familiar portrait,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.470
which is one of the things that
the showing of teeth means.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.430
I don't know whether Copley had
black servants in his retinue

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.090
in London.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:27.010
They would likely not have been
enslaved after the ambiguity

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:29.800
that the Somerset
decision of 1772

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.970
cast on slavery in Britain.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.410
However, and I'll
come back to this

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.990
when I close my circle
in a little bit,

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:41.200
slavery stayed important
in Copley's story

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.320
from cradle to grave.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.460
Copley's marriage also provoked
him to take for the first time

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.620
a trip abroad in the summer of
1771, which is what he called

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.060
it when he went to New York.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:02.110
London is home and
New York is abroad.

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.830
And among the three dozen
paintings he churned out there

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.140
in a mere six months--
and Copley's known for his

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.440
slowness, by the way,
so this is frantic--

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.720
is this spectacular likeness of
Colonel Gage's wife, Margaret

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:20.200
Kemble Gage, which Copley called
the greatest female portrait

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.700
of his life, and which
certainly deserves

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:29.515
that title, the greatest female
portrait of his life to date,

00:51:29.515 --> 00:51:32.230
it was 1772 when he said this.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:35.440
It's in the tiny, tiny
Timken Museum in San Diego,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.640
it is worth the trip.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:45.670
But if Copley gained
strategically love and land

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:50.710
and slaves and travel, he
also gained accidentally

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:54.430
a very close connection to tea.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.700
Tea was one of the commodities
that Copley's father-in-law

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.230
had made his fortune
trafficking in.

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:03.760
And in 1773 when Britain
passed the Tea Act,

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.470
making it possible to sell
East India Company tea directly

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:10.840
in the colonies
through consignees

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.300
for the first time
at prices low enough

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.350
to compete with smugglers,
Copley's father-in-law

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:21.160
felt that he was very lucky
in getting one of the licenses

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.050
to sell it in Boston.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:28.510
And it turned out of course,
not to be so lucky after all.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.900
So as the tea ships
approached Boston,

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.260
mobs set upon Copley's
father-in-law's house

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.110
on School Street,
nearly destroying it.

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:43.120
And even before the dumping
of the tea, Copley's male kin

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.190
were holed up in
the British fortress

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:48.100
at Castle Island for
their own safety,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.500
threatened daily in
the newspapers with tar

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.910
and feathering and worse.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.470
And when the tea was dumped
into Boston Harbor on December

00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:03.820
16th of 1773, a plurality
of those 342 tea chests

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:06.010
belonged to Richard
Clarke, or it

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:09.190
belonged to the East India
Company in consignment

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:10.780
to Richard Clarke.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:18.250
Copley's kin became personae
non grata after that moment.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:23.410
And it turned out in the
wake of the Tea Party

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.200
that his marriage was the
most important decision

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.340
in his life in a very different
way than he had anticipated,

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.360
which is that he married
his politics and ultimately

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.305
his citizenship.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:44.160
For all of these reasons, family
and war and calling and empire,

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.120
and with only a little
smattering of ideology,

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.170
Copley's revolution led him home
to the place where the family

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:56.850
portrait sat on the easel
in the spring of 1776,

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.800
while many of his
former Boston neighbors,

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.650
including some men like
Samuel Adams and John Hancock,

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.940
whom he had painted and then
grown utterly to despise,

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.280
had begun drafting
a document declaring

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.080
the independence of a nation
and a notion of America

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.210
that Copley would never
see and never share.

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:25.610
Lived and read about
and seen from London,

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.220
Copley's American Revolution
was Britain's American War.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.300
And no choices left--

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.520
war, and soon a losing war.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.460
It's one of the great
ironies of Copley's career

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.480
that the war with
America remained

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:49.180
his context and his subject for
much of the rest of his life.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:52.780
At first in the 1770s
and early 1780s,

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.180
it was a kind of calling card.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:01.210
And then it was a millstone
for a formerly American artist

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:05.830
now at the center of the
London establishment.

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.230
Much of Copley's art
in London was the art

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:12.160
of winning by
losing, where he was

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.430
on the one hand able to paint
as he could not possibly have

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.680
done in British North America.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.210
The pictures got large and
busy and complex, public art

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:26.080
with different kinds
of public patronage.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.510
But the dilemma of
painting public art

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:32.590
in London in the
1770s and 1780s was

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:36.370
how to paint the irresistible
subject of the day

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.990
when Britain was losing.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:41.110
And this became Copley's niche.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.440
The American War, however
much he and his family

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.760
had tried to escape it, was
his great and defining subject,

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.760
his claim to academic
bona fides in the higher

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.500
reaches of British art
and to public attention.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.490
The American War is the subject,
to one degree and another,

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.490
of all of his great
London history pictures,

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.250
including Watson and
the Shark, The Death

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:12.370
of the Earl of Chatham, and the
enormous and very belated Siege

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.710
and Relief of Gibraltar,
which I'll show you just

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.390
in a flicker in a moment.

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:19.720
And I'm happy to talk about
any of those in the Q&amp;A,

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.390
but I want to talk in
a little bit of depth

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:26.410
about just one, the third
and I think the greatest

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:30.010
of Copley's American
War paintings, which

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.950
celebrates a battle
and even a theater

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:36.040
of the American Revolution
that you have likely

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.150
never considered.

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:41.620
So this is a painting called
The Death of Major Pearson.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:46.240
It celebrates an event that
happened in January of 1781,

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.080
and it's displayed
publicly in 1784.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.400
It's the battle of Jersey--

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.990
not New Jersey, but
the Isle of Jersey.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:02.070
It featured no North
American combatants, which

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:04.170
was important to Copley's war.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.870
The Americans were not
necessarily villains,

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:09.030
though the British are heroes.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:12.390
In fact, it featured no
official combatants at all.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:14.520
It's a kind of
unofficial skirmish

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.390
by a rump garrison of
French legionnaires

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:22.770
who leave Brittany and go
raiding on the Isle of Jersey,

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:27.390
resulting in an inglorious
15-minute long battle,

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.340
after which the
governor of the island

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.770
is court martialed
for his dereliction

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:34.970
in allowing it to happen
in the first place.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:37.500
A gallant young
major died in it,

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.660
whom nobody had ever heard of.

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.110
This fellow in the
middle, Francis Pearson,

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:48.750
dying so beautifully in this
image of martial sacrifice

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:52.230
and Christian heroism.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.660
Copley painted it
over two years,

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.930
and it was exhibited after
the Peace of Paris, which

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.220
created the United States, and
ratified that his America, that

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:09.030
seamless oceanic world of 26
colonies, was gone for good.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:13.010
In one of the most striking
passages in the painting,

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.040
Copley celebrates what
he and others of his day

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.590
called not just liberty,
but British liberty

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:21.110
or English liberty.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:24.180
Avenging Pearson's
death is a servant

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:30.140
of African descent shown in
a dramatic blue not uniform,

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:35.840
but servant's livery, a sort
of military style livery.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.060
I've traced him from
the documentary record

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.210
and found that this man is one
of two people in real life--

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.020
IRL, as my kids say--

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.900
someone who was born
enslaved in the Carolinas

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:52.310
and fled behind British
lines to work for the British

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:55.010
in the North American
continental theater,

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:59.720
and then followed his
officer to other places

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:04.460
on the British front lines,
including this odd Eastern

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:07.410
Front in the middle of Jersey.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:11.460
He wound up in London as a
hairdresser, a skilled trade

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.930
that would have been all
but inconceivable for him

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:18.350
as an enslaved man in the
Southern parts of the United

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.020
States, I think one of
the ways that Copley

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.020
shows in several of these
American War paintings

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.230
that Britain is winning
the war for liberty

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:33.210
even as it's losing the
war for its rebel colonies.

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:36.750
The other striking
passage in the painting

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.000
is the presence of
women and children

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.620
in a battle scene,
which is really

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:45.300
quite anomalous in the
genre of battle painting.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:50.250
And this little group of
noncombatants fleeing in terror

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:54.870
at lower right is in fact,
Copley's family, his wife,

00:59:54.870 --> 01:00:00.660
his son, and his baby daughter,
all sort of emblematic exiles

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.290
and their maidservant
over here, emblematic

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:10.510
exiles in something of the
way that they were in life.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:12.970
So I'll close my
circle by talking

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:15.910
about the question of how
much he sees and doesn't see

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.850
about the future,
and how much we see

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:22.590
and don't see about the future.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:27.170
In that same letter
from August of 1775

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:28.550
where he's saying
how relieved he

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:33.460
is that he has no choice left,
he comments about "how short

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.370
a way we penetrate into
the secrets of futurity?"

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.330
He's pretentious.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.015
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:42.890
It's not just 18th century,
he's the sort of pretentious,

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.660
ambitious fellow.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.930
And I think one of the
things that a close view

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.620
of the world of revolution
through ambivalent men

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.960
like Copley reminds us of is
that it is very different to be

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.310
looking at history forward
than looking at it backward.

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.560
This is especially
true of the world

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.020
of the American
Revolution, which

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.770
has come to take on in
retrospect within the United

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:15.510
States an aura of destiny
that also gives it

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:22.780
a kind of tidiness and
linearity, a mythic founding.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.290
Like the rest of us,
Copley saw into the future

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:29.780
both well and poorly.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.010
For example, at the time he
wrote this letter in the summer

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:38.750
after Lexington, he was certain
that when the bleeding stopped,

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.350
quote, "the Americans will be
a free, independent people."

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.180
He did not mean this
as a compliment.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.710
But nobody at the time
thought that America

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:52.680
would win, certainly
not George Washington.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.100
Yet as he went on to
explain, the strife

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.010
would not end with independence.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:02.820
The country, he said, would
be torn in pieces twice--

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.160
first by the quarrel
with Great Britain

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.250
till it is a distinct
government, and then

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:11.400
with civil discord till
time has settled it

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.980
into some permanent form.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.250
Whether that form would be,
he said, free or despotic

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.370
was beyond the reach of
human wisdom to decide.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.230
And I think we're
actually still waiting.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.480
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.600
Pictorially, Copley
grasped the future poorly.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.900
As I've said, he hung onto the
American War much too long,

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.680
in part because he painted much
too slowly and deliberately.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.800
So this is that last Great
American War picture, The Siege

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.030
and Relief of Gibraltar.

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:43.710
It's the largest picture he
ever painted, 18 by 25 feet.

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:47.570
It hangs in Guildhall
in London right now.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.476
It was painted for Guildhall.

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:51.600
It was so much too big that
they had to cut it down

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.540
to fit in its
purpose-built gallery.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.080
And it took him so
long to paint it

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.530
that it was not exhibited
until almost 10 years

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.520
after the siege was
broken, by which point

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.370
all of the eyes of
England had moved on

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.350
to the next imperial war, to
painting Nelson and thinking

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.685
about Napoleon,
which Copley missed.

01:03:17.685 --> 01:03:21.330
It is an accident of his life
that he missed both Nelson

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.380
and Washington, who were the
great subjects of either side

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.610
of their Atlantic for the day,
and hung on to what for Britons

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.990
was a mercifully fading memory
of the loss of Americans

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.720
and his own losses, too.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.400
But I think the
realm in which he

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:46.370
was most deliberate and planful
and successful about futurity

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:47.930
was the realm of family.

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:51.830
He said during his grand tour
that launching his family

01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:53.900
into the great world
with reputation

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:59.030
was what he was doing it for,
and that he did very well.

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:01.520
So this is his son,
the little fleeing

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.150
boy at the edge of the
death of Major Pearson,

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:10.460
all grown up as Lord Lyndhurst
Baron and Lord High Chancellor,

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.790
peer of the new
creation, painted here

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:17.120
as the aristocrat
and man of state

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.050
he had become by the 1830s.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:26.210
Copley's son visited the
young United States in 1796

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:29.150
to see if it was safe for
the women and children.

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:32.870
He thought briefly about
building a Western estate there

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.410
with hundreds of acres for
his parents and their dotage,

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:40.960
and then decided after
all, it was dicey.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.774
He wrote, "If you want to
be cured of your Jacobinism,

01:04:43.774 --> 01:04:44.690
come to Philadelphia."

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.770
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:51.070
Copley's daughter
Betsy also succeeded

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.610
in some ways more grandly,
and in others more darkly.

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:57.850
She too, was married late
and tactically at the ripe

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:03.680
age of 30 back to America,
not Copley's America,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.310
and back to Boston.

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.200
Like her father,
she also married

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.760
into slavery, a slaving fortune
in the demerara sugar trade

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.640
with the planter,
Gardiner Greene.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.210
They lived on Beacon
Hill in grand style.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:22.480
Their money, Greene's
slaving wealth,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.910
is what funded the rise of the
son into the ranks of lawyerdom

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:30.160
and then the peerage,
and also what

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.110
saved the Copley's from
penury in his declining years.

01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:37.000
Betsy and her husband
Gardiner Greene

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.190
had a large staff of
servants including

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.250
several free African-Americans,
and at least one

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.220
enslaved named Harry, who was
also Gardiner Greene's son.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.360
When Gardiner
Greene died in 1832,

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.210
his will manumitted
Harry, which I

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.870
think means that Harry
Greene was one of the last,

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:04.220
if not the last
enslaved man in Boston,

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:06.020
living about two
blocks down from where

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.630
The Liberator was published.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.110
So slavery at the core
of Copley's ability

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:18.320
to self-make and self-sustain
from first to last.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.780
Betsy Copley, Gardiner
Greene's wife,

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.620
lived for decades after
her husband passed.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:28.580
Here she is in a studio portrait
taken in Boston in 1862.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.550
I love the parrot.

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.100
And this matters in
a variety of ways,

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.370
because she saved the
archive that wound up

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:39.630
enabling me to tell this story.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.860
It's at the Massachusetts
Historical Society.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.460
And also because she made
sure to get the pictures.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.610
And it is her collecting efforts
that brought Boy with a Flying

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:58.280
Squirrel and The Ascension, The
Izzards, Watson and the Shark,

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.330
and the family picture
to the United States.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:06.110
Which we might call
a repatriation but

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:10.130
they would call an expatriation.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:13.160
The family portrait hangs
today in the West Wing

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.330
of the National Gallery,
set very appropriately

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:22.100
alongside the works of Joshua
Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough,

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.300
and others of
Copley's peers who,

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.840
like him, were British
artists from cradle to grave.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.340
Thank you.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.759
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.920
- My name is Arthur Grove.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.250
I'm one of a number of the
people in your audience

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:59.020
who are museum guides at
the Museum of Fine Arts.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.990
I'm very pleased
to read your book,

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:03.420
I'm very pleased
to hear you speak.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.290
You combined the opportunity to
have both an educational point

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:09.450
of view and a very
entertaining way

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:11.490
of presenting your material.

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:15.750
I wanted to ask one question
that I was unaware of until I

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:16.859
read your book.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.460
And that is the dispute
between Paul Revere

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.450
and his half brother,
Harry or Henry Pelham.

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:27.951
Which when you go in to see Paul
Revere and look to the right,

01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:29.700
you can appreciate the
fact that these two

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.399
people who should
have been good friends

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.939
were not such good friends.

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:36.170
- Yeah, thank you for that.

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:39.630
Revere and his family
and Copley and his family

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:43.109
are part of the
same world of men

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.899
who work with their
hands and their heads.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:51.899
We know that Revere borrows
some of the specialized press

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:55.020
implements that
allows him to run off

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.569
his engravings from
the Pelham family,

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:02.399
probably a way that Mary Pelham
monetized some of her husband's

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.260
legacy by lending it to Revere.

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.120
We also know that
Revere was a thief.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.700
Just in the totally
expected way that

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.540
in a world before copyright,
the way that you took images

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.609
was to borrow bits and pieces.

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:20.069
Revere couldn't
draw worth a dime,

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:22.859
but he knew well what to copy.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:25.859
And when the Boston so-called
massacre [CLEARS THROAT]

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:32.130
occurred in March of 1770,
Revere working closely with

01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:32.910
the firebrand--

01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:36.540
Boston printers Benjamin
Edes and Moses Gill,

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:42.330
knew that an image to make that
incendiary event come alive

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:45.569
for readers was very important.

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:48.660
And it so happened that
Harry Pelham had drawn one

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.870
and was rushing his own
engraving into print.

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:56.610
Revere had better channels
and Revere got the engraving

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.230
into print first.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:01.350
And Pelham wrote him just
an excoriating letter

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:04.270
saying, how could you?

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:06.600
Pelham had staked
a fortune on being

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.850
able to produce this
thing an earn out.

01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:13.440
And Revere took and
used his better networks

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.050
and some slightly
better details.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:21.270
Revere changes the name of the
custom-house to butcher's hall.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:26.220
So that very iconic image
of a world coming apart,

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:30.270
Revere's massacre image, which
until George Washington's

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:33.360
portrait begins to circulate,
is the most famous image

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.180
of the revolutionary
project in the world,

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.520
is stolen from
Copley's half brother.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.950
I think it's incontrovertible.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:46.770
And Harry Pelham was
an immoderate guy,

01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:48.180
he was a hothead.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.060
And he hated Revere after that.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.400
And I don't know what
Copley thought of Revere,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.180
but I think he would have
picked up his half brother's

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.370
side of this feud.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.050
He wrote and said, give me
the pieces of the press back.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:06.090
- In 1770, Harry Pelham
was only 21 years old.

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:07.814
Paul Revere was 36 years old.

01:11:07.814 --> 01:11:09.480
So there was a great
deal of difference.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.594
Harry Pelham was trying
to start his career.

01:11:11.594 --> 01:11:13.260
Paul Revere was already
an established--

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.595
It's It's not very nice. of him.

01:11:14.595 --> 01:11:16.250
- --successful man.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:19.620
But my question I wanted to
ask was, I have your quote,

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.540
I'm not going to
read the whole thing.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.990
But Harry Pelham's
letter to Paul Revere,

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:29.370
and I'm just going to read
the last line from your book.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.380
"I will leave you to
reflect upon and consider

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:35.370
of one of the most dishonorable
actions you could well

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:36.750
be guilty of."

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:42.290
Now the question is, did Revere
respond to that criticism?

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.710
- Pelham saved letters.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.870
That's how I've
got so much that's

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:53.010
so good to work with
in textual form.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:56.670
I can't imagine that Pelham
wouldn't have saved and indeed

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:58.590
publicized Revere's response.

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:00.949
So my guess is that
Revere did not respond,

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.365
but the response
has not survived.

01:12:02.365 --> 01:12:04.362
- Thank you very much.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:06.900
- I'm Sasha Tipper.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.370
I'm a professor emeritus from
Nichols College in English.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:15.390
I have a few trivial
questions to ask.

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:20.820
First of all, I'm interested
in wives and mothers.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:26.235
And I'm also interested in--

01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:29.550
I wonder whether his
mother, you talked

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:32.910
about and the two
fathers' influence.

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:36.780
Did the mother have any
influence upon him at all?

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:41.430
Was he a spoilt child,
or was it the poverty

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.430
that put an end to that?

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:50.100
And also, you didn't
talk much about the wife.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.510
Why was she willing
to go to London

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.795
with her husband, for instance?

01:12:54.795 --> 01:12:55.870
- Thank you.

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:57.990
Some of my best friends
are wives and mothers.

01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.710
And both of those women matter
tremendously to this story.

01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:10.630
So I think his mother
brought everything of culture

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:13.780
that he would have
known to his world

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:21.040
until Peter Pelham joined their
household when Copley was 10.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.540
She came from a beautiful
house in County Claire,

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:28.450
it was on sale at the
time of my writing

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:34.150
my book for 1.3 million Euros
in a kind of Gothicized version.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:37.690
She had the education of a
daughter of the landed gentry.

01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:40.000
We know she has a
very fine lady's hand.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.620
She has a much better
education than her son does.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:50.960
When her first husband's
estate was probated,

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.060
it's an estate worth
about 97 pounds, which

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.820
would be on the lower
end of accumulated

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.370
property in the colonies.

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:02.310
And yet it in it is a looking
glass and a suite of six

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:04.650
framed prints and pictures.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:08.520
So I think there is a
hunger for culture that

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:14.160
must come from her in a way that
I can't see in his early life,

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.930
but I can see her shaping
hand in his later life.

01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:21.990
He was also-- and forgive
me for saying something

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:25.980
so entirely [INAUDIBLE] he
was incredible mama's boy.

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:34.440
When he goes to London,
he takes the grand tour,

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.450
launches from
London, and travels

01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:39.990
with another really
sort of third tier

01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:41.910
British painter
named George Carter.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.580
And George Carter writes
this picturesque narrative

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.240
of their travels in which
he says about Copley,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.090
"He has been too long the
hero of each little tale."

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:54.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:58.890
I take that to be first of all,
it's a kind of cliche, right?

01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:03.180
The country bumpkin
in the cosmopolis.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.510
It's also a story about
Boston, upon small enough

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.410
that Copley was the most
talented person within 3,000

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:11.040
miles.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.793
But I think it's
also a family story,

01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:21.060
making much of that he took from
his household into his career.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.850
And Carter goes
into, there's never

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:26.100
a plate has passed that he
doesn't take the biggest

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:30.750
chicken leg first, or take three
before everybody else has one,

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:35.196
that he sighs and
swoons over the bedding.

01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:38.370
I think he is much
doted on, and I

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:42.600
think that is a shaping
influence of his character.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:49.770
In many ways, the
question of the wife,

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:53.160
I think there's an interesting
tension between the ways

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.380
that her identity
is covered by his

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.140
and the way that everything
about 18th century history

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.030
would lead us to expect.

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:02.880
The custom and law
of coverture is she

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.980
loses even her name, her
ability to own property.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.210
But in other ways he
is covered by her.

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:11.610
It's her political identity.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:15.310
It's the shaping hand
of her kin network

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:20.730
that takes him to London
and keeps him there.

01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:26.010
You know, she goes to
London because the going

01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:29.850
has gotten so hot that he
really can't come back.

01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:33.120
By the time she goes
to London, Boston

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.370
is under siege by
the Patriot forces,

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.460
the new Continental Army.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.190
They are some of the
last loyalists out.

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:45.270
He is not an exile,
but she is an exile.

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:48.660
And that politically
comes from her father,

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.390
the desire to stay
in London is his.

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:56.850
So she goes there in flight,
not without his connivance.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:17:01.770
And she stays there because
it remains his home.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:06.420
Her kin all come to London
as loyalists during the war,

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.840
and all return and take up
their lives and fortunes

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.790
in the new United States,
which as my colleague MiaMaya

01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:15.210
Jasanoff has written
about, is one of the things

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:16.430
that loyalists did.

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.220
Some of them resumed.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:22.960
And Copley chose not to, and
she was governed by that choice.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.180
So it's an excellent question.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:25.750
- Hi.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.800
I'm Sarah Friedman, and
I had a question about,

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.090
you mentioned that in 1831,
that Henry was manumitted.

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:34.820
- 1832, yeah.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.590
- 1832.

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:41.270
I was wondering, because
that kind of surprised me.

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:45.020
Because we know at
least the 1790 census,

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.875
there are no slaves.

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.030
- And never again.

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:50.770
- Right, so were
you able to find

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:56.120
in the 1820 census, 1830
census under that household,

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.620
was he listed?

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.910
Was there anything else
that corroborated this other

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.170
than the word manumitted?

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:08.690
- So I think that this is a
lacunae in our understanding

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:16.520
of slavery in the North
where as you know,

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.120
slavery is abolished by
custom and legal precedent

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.850
in Massachusetts in
1783, with the freedom

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:24.950
suit that Quock Walker brings.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.930
And from 1790 forward, there is
never again an enslaved person

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.000
censused as enslaved.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.670
And yet manumissions continue.

01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:37.510
I think if I had
Gardiner Greene here,

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:40.850
Gardiner Greene
would say, and Harry

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.430
is interviewed in various
Boston publications

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:50.990
when Gardiner Greene dies
as his faithful man Harry.

01:18:55.142 --> 01:19:00.470
It's not said that it's his
son, but it's very clear.

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:03.370
He lives as if a free man.

01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:05.050
And I think what
this means is when

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.770
the census taker comes
to your door you say,

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:08.800
oh, it's a free man.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.950
He's living as if a free man.

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:17.140
There is a bequest
that Gardiner Greene

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:21.760
makes to his mulatto
Harry in the will,

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.130
to establish him in
a house of his own

01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:27.850
which is 10 feet by 10
feet, a tenement worth $400.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:34.180
Gardiner Greene's household
is worth $1.5 million in 1832.

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:40.240
So I think the gray area
between bondage and freedom

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:46.780
lasts longer, is grayer than our
conventional stories of the end

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.070
of slavery in Boston allow.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:51.430
He's very late.

01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:54.710
He's after gradual
abolition has ended slavery

01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:58.480
in most of the North,
even for the longest-lived

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.592
after this date, and
you have to reach 25.

01:20:01.592 --> 01:20:03.550
I just think we would
have to look places other

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:06.838
than the census
records to find it out.

01:20:06.838 --> 01:20:09.530
- So please join me in
giving a round of applause

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:11.930
to Jane for her
wonderful lecture.

01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:14.330
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:18.280
