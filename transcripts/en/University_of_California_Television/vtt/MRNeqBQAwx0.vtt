- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bi-pedal, naked large brained. Long the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.640
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.620
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.320

we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Richard] I am absolutely thrilled to be
here. But more so I'm thrilled as skin

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.630
researcher for the last 20 years and as
chair of the department of dermatology

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.860
that this group has decided to focus on
skin and recognize the benefits of this

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.020
organ to understand more about who we are
and what ourselves really are made of.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.500
And, of course, the first picture I'd like
to do is to show a couple different hands

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.880
that we have in our cover. And these are
the types of hands we like to look at. The

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.880
type of skin we like to look at. We have
impressions about ourselves and our health

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.010
that's really dictated by the skin. Now,
of course, we recognize ourselves by our

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.110
skin. And that's the most obvious function
of all, of what the skin is. There's no

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.990
doubt that this is a different species,
perhaps a chimp. And years ago, in the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.650
field of dermatology, there was a very
well-known dermatologist in the name of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.520
William Montagna did quite a bit of
comparative anatomy. Looking at the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.650
histology of different species. And
published a series of fascinating papers

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.880
which described many similarities and many
differences between different species in

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.110
terms of elements of the skin. And perhaps
what was most interesting about this work

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.820
is that this focus of those papers were
really specifically to try to understand

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.080
more about ourselves by studying skin
because of primates. Because at that time,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.330
it was easier for him to get primate skin
than it was for him to get human skin. We

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.880
also have more rare disorders that, and
somehow, perhaps emphasizes our common

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.880
origin, evolutionarily. On the left is an
unfortunate gentleman in China with

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.520
something called a large, hairy congenital
nevus. And on the right, is a primate that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.710
has alopecia.
And you wonder if there's some convergence

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.200
here, when you look at these types of
photos. And then our government and the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.330
technology-rich world around us exploits
the skin for many things that you may or

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.380
may not be aware of. And this is an image
that shows assessing blood flow and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.110
temperature in skin of individuals in an
airport. And it's used actually as a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.380
covert lie detection system to look for
people who might be flushing, nervous. And

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.550
it's also used during disease outbreaks
for disease surveillance. This was

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.710
particularly prevalent during the SARS
epidemic; trying to pick people who might

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.500
have a fever out of a crowd. So the skin
has been exploited by many, many different

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.910
ways just from the outside. Sometimes,
looks can be deceiving, and the skin can

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.810
fool you. And we take it for granted in
terms of what's going on underneath there.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.230
So I'd like to show you, as skin
biologists, some of the techniques and the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.530
approaches that we use to understand more
about the skin. And to do that, we need to

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.560
look more closely what's down deep within
the skin. This is an illustration of what

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.640
would happen if you cut a little cube out
of the skin, captured four hair follicles.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.650
The top here is the surface of the skin.
And as we look below the surface, we see

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.100
many, many different cell types. In fact,
this is probably the most complex organ

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.830
that we have in our body with blood
vessels, nerves, endocrine functions, it

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.130
can sweat, it can produce oils, it does
all of this and it must do it in a way

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.140
that protects itself from the outside
environment. And as we look more closely,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.330
we see wonderful things going on in these
different cell types within the skin. On

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.300
the right, here, is a time-lapse
photography of a live hair follicle

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.730
showing how the cells are constantly in
motion, constantly differentiating,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.110
actually regenerating the organ over and
over again. And much of what we've learned

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.560
about basic developmental biology, about
stem cells, comes from studying some of

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.910
the phenomenal interactions that cells
undergo in this simple little thing of a

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.650
hair.
Another way to look at the skin, instead

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.400
of cutting through the skin vertically, is
to cut across the top of the surface of

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.080
the skin horizontally. And if you did
that, you shave just the top of the skin

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.790
and stained what's in there, you see this
network of immune cells. These are called

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.290
dendritic cells. And our entire surface of
our skin is covered by this net of cells

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.600
that's interacting with the outside
environment. And the classic thoughts

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.850
about how those cells interact with the
environment is illustrated in this little

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.410
movie. Maybe some of you have seen this.
This actually was a film made in the 1950s

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.830
and it was really the dawn of our
understanding of host-immune defense and

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.040
how immune cells work. And it shows a
macrophage-like cell, and this little dot

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.370
over here, is a bacterium. And it's basic
concept of the time is that we device

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.610
specific cells that went out and could
recognize bacteria as bad, as an external

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.270
part that we don't want, could chase it
down, as you could see in this movie, the

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.010
macrophage is actually changing direction
while it's swimming amongst all these

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.980
blood cells and chasing down the bacteria
until it finally can engulf it and kill

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:35.190
it. Well, what we learned about 20 years
ago, now, is that our system that our skin

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.530
uses to defend against the outside
environment is more than just specific

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.810
cells that are tracking down bacteria. But
that our skin surface also produces

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.620
natural antibiotics, we've named these
AMPs, or antimicrobial peptides. And this

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.150
is a slide from some work I did when I
was, I guess about 5 years old, because it

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:02.990
was 20 years ago, that shows a brown
staining of the first known mammalian skin

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.440
antibiotic.
And this isn't produce by specific immune

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.790
cells, but it's actually produced by the
cells that form the surface of the skin,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.310
suggesting that there's more to the way
the skin interacts with the outside

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.860
environment that we may otherwise think.
In fact, I want to show you an example of

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.560
a wonderful experiment that demonstrates
just how important those surface

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:33.500
antibiotics are to us. And on one side
here, you see a picture of an agar plate

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.790
and the way this experiment is done, is
they investigate a very carefully washed

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:43.600
the surface of their hands, touched a
bacteria. And in one case, the bacteria is

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.150
Staph.aureus. That's a bacteria that
normally can make infections on the skin.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.290
We know it's dangerous to our skin. And if
you touch those bacteria, wait a few

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:58.080
minutes and then go back later and touch a
plate, you'd see that the bacteria were

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.470
able to live on the surface of the skin,
that's why the fingerprints show up, all

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.650
those little dots are the bacteria that
lived on the surface of the skin and that

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.850
got transferred to the plate. But if you
do the exact same experiment, but now when

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:17.080
you wash your hands instead of touching a
skin bacteria, you touch an intestinal

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.870
bacteria like E.coli. This is a pathogen,
too, but it doesn't cause disease in the

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.430
skin. You see that when you go back later
and touch your fingers to a plate, all the

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.210
E.coli are dead. So this is a great
example and somewhat explains certain

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:38.300
diseases. It explains why Staph.aureus can
be a disease causing organism on skin

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.580
because it survives, and why E.coli is
never found as a disease causing organism

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.990
in the skin situation, because the skin
makes specific antimicrobials. What's

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.340
particularly interesting about this
experiment, though, is the all-important

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.340
control. And the scientists love controls.
And that is to do the same experiment that

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:02.400
have sterile surgical gloves on.
So you see what happens, when you have

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.210
sterile gloves on and you'd touch
Staph.aureus, and wait a while, and touch

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.960
your glove-covered bacteria on the plate,
some of the Staph.aureus survived but

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.950
they're not as, they're not doing so well.
They actually missed the fact that they

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.320
were on the surface of our skin. But look
at what happened with the E. Coli. These

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.620
gloves touched the same number of E.coli
as the bare fingertips did. And you can

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.900
see the E.coli survive very, very well
when the gloves are on your hand. So, what

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.210
does that mean practically for our
everyday life, thinking about the skin?

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:48.530
Well, it means that gloves protect
bacteria from us. Particularly, bacteria

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.950
that cause intestinal diseases. And you
should think about that when you go

00:10:53.950 --> 00:11:01.210
through the cafeteria line. So, that's my
segue into some of our research that I

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.470
like to talk about, I hope you'll agree
with me, or at least think about the fact

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.670
that perhaps how we think about ourselves
as humans shouldn't just be this

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:15.220
antagonistic relationship between us
defending against them. But as you'll hear

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.970
later in the afternoon, there's quite a
bit of information that's coming from the

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:24.340
field of microbiome research that says
that these bacteria that are on us,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.150
perhaps they're not all so bad. And is it
possible that a lot of the skin bacteria

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:36.410
that normally survive on us are not just
bystanders? And what I want to lead to is

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.810
to ask you to think about the question,
“Should we really completely rethink

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.840
established approaches to the study of
human origin based on these observations

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.630
made in the skin?” Classically, we think
about this type of tree of life in

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:56.530
evolution where single-cell organisms
evolved into complex organisms like

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.010
humans.
But I propose to you, that perhaps we

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:07.400
should flip this on it's head and think
about it, really, that we have evolved to

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.040
serve the master microbes. And we're all
these little different types of organisms,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.000
some dropped off the evolutionary tree,
and some survive. But we're here, in part,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.640
to serve the microbe and perpetuate it's
survival. And I think you would agree that

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.070
with the expansion of humans, the
expansion of the microbes that we carry is

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.870
going to be just as successful, so it's
good for them, too. So what's the evidence

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.860
to support this kind of crazy thinking?
Well, has human skin and microbe really

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:45.620
co-evolved to serve each other? Are the
microbes one of our own cells, not just

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.650
something foreign, but is this part of us?
And there's lots of evidence now to

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:56.970
really, I think, very clearly show us that
specific types of bacteria, specific

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.270
microbes on the skin are absolutely
essential to human health. How could this

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.630
be? Well, one way we understood this is
when we realize that the microbes aren't

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.530
just living outside on the surface.
They're not outside the door but they're

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:16.050
really integral in that little piece of
skin that I illustrated to you earlier.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.870
This is some work done by a couple of
scientists in my lab over the last few

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.520
years showing how microbes are not just at
the surface, and that's these little tiny

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.400
purple dots, and the epidermis is the top
layer of the skin. And if you look down in

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.020
the hair follicle, you see lots of
microbes, that wasn't such a surprise. But

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.060
what was a surprise to us and many others
is that if you look in areas that we

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.180
thought were sterile, even in healthy skin
that hasn't been injured, that's normally

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.940
working, there's collections of microbes
that live down amongst our inner fat, in

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.260
the tissues between our blood vessels. And
they're there in a place where they could

00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:00.090
be interacting with the rest of our body.
One of the ways that microbes benefit us

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.500
on our skin can be illustrated by an
experiment just like the one I showed you

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.220
before, but with a little bit of a twist.
So, this is an experiment, again those

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.460
three lines are fingertips. And now the
investigator was a graduate student in my

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.010
lab, Anna Cogen, who washed her hands very
carefully of the normal bacteria and

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:23.120
touched a type of bacteria known as Group
A Streptococcus. This is also known as the

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.870
flesh-eating bacteria. So normal ones
would be very dangerous. This was a type

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.760
of bacteria that we attenuated so it's
relatively safe. Well, why we used these

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.410
bacteria is that they are a pathogen, so
they're a foreign bacteria, we don't want

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.560
them. And secondly, that they have a
unique capacity to lyse red blood cells.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.730
So, you can see them really obviously when
you touch a plate that has blood in it. It

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:52.410
lyses it, that's why it's all clear. So
what happens if she has on her fingertips

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.360
not the bad guys, the flesh-eating
bacteria, but these are normal fingertips

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.780
colonized with a type of bacteria that you
all have on your skin right now at a

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.860
concentration of somewhere between 10,000
and 100,000 per square centimeter. You

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.200
have a lot of these bacteria, known as
Staph.epidermidis, epidermis for the skin.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.180
So these are not disease, this isn't
dirty, this was normal. And if you touch

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.450
this plate with skin that's populated with
those, you can see those bacteria because

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:28.020
they make these little tiny dots here,
shadows. So now, here's the question. What

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:34.160
happens if Anna, instead of washing her
hands really carefully before touching the

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.560
flesh-eating bacteria, just had let the
normal bacteria survive on her skin, the

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.350
healthy type of bacteria? Well, this is
what happens. She touched the same amount

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:52.120
of bacteria, it's on the far right here.
But now, in this case with your healthy

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.730
bacteria there, it's fighting, it's
helping you resist the flesh-eating

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.860
bacteria. And she'd gone on to actually
identify new antibiotics from these types

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.290
of bacteria.
And there are many hundreds of new

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:07.000
antibiotics that can be discovered just
within our own ecosystem, on our surface

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.700
of the skin. Another way that bacteria
control us, is they influence how much of

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.690
a rash, or how much inflammation you can
have. And this is a very dramatic

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:23.750
experiment, again, using this model of the
skin cartoon that shows if you cut your

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.630
skin or scratch your skin, and it's
absolutely sterile and you have no

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.680
bacteria on it, the amount of swelling and
redness and scaliness is much, much

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.680
greater than if the skin has a normal
microbiome. And you can see that here in

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.860
this microscopic image how thick a sterile
wound it as opposed to non-infected but a

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.040
normal skin wound with a normal microbial
community. So the microbes are defending

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.010
us against flesh-eating bacteria, some
microbes are controlling our immune

00:16:54.010 --> 00:17:00.150
system. And this is some very recent work
that we've done to look at a very common

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.740
type of disease known as atopic
dermatitis. Here's a picture of a child in

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.540
the corner here on the bottom with a
complication of this disease. It's a type

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.120
of eczema and these patients
unfortunately, very often get

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.950
Staph.infections, that was that bacteria
that we showed you in the glove

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.980
experiment. And when you look at normal
population, this is several thousand

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:27.560
samples, most of the normal bacteria on
healthy individuals produce these

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.420
antibiotics that kill Staphylococcus
disease causing bacteria. But in patients

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:40.250
with eczema, there's very few, actually,
of the normal type of bacteria. They're

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:46.080
displaced by another bacteria. It's
neither disease causing, nor normal. It's

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.030
kind of inert. It doesn't do us any good.
And when that happens, these individuals

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.310
then start to get Staph.infections.
There's a very, very strict correlation

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.220
between the capacity to get a
Staph.infection and whether or not you

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.170
have these bacteria.
So, what can you do with this type of

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.100
realization? Well, you can try to help
people, which is ultimately why we do our

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.520
research. And this is showing an
experiment, this is beginning of a large

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.710
clinical trial, we're doing a number of
cities. This is now eight patients, but

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:22.320
kind of show you what happens. This is the
average result. And on the blue side is

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.180
before treatment. And then amount of
Staph.aureus. And the red side is after

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.610
you put a treatment on. So, first is the
control, you just put a moisturizing cream

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.520
on. And you see the amount of the infected
bacteria, if anything it goes up a little

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.790
bit, doesn't really change. And what if
you put one of these inert bacteria like

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:45.600
are found in patients with the disease?
Oh, nothing happens. If you put a cream

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.700
that has those bacteria on it, the
patients stay the same, they still have

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.930
less, a lot of Staph.aureus. But now
here's strain two. This is a bacterial

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:59.400
strain from a normal person, that's
transplanted onto the disease skin. And

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:05.650
you can see this bacterial strain just in
a single application causes over 100 fold

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.800
decrease in the amount of infectious
bacteria. This has worked actually to

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.350
every single patient we tried so far. So
we better stop the study now, right?

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.560
Before we find out it doesn't work. But
we're very excited about it. And I think

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:23.040
it's further showing how some microbes,
not all microbes, are our friends. And

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.590
some microbes are clearly our enemies. So,
how should be think about this in this

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:34.190
conference? Well, I'd like to propose to
you the concept of the super organism. We

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.870
probably only inherit, of our total
genetic makeup in our bodies, probably

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:43.360
only about 10% of it really comes from our
parents, because 90% of the organisms that

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.450
we carry around from us are microbes. So
that means, when you think about it, most

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.240
of the genetic material we're carrying
around, we can exchange. We're not stuck

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.420
with the things our parents gave us. We
can exchange bacteria just by shaking

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:03.410
hands. And if anybody is really healthy
here, I'd like to shake hands with you.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.610
And what it really also means of course,
we realize this already, but our

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:11.500
environment can directly influence who we
are. And this now starts to get us to a

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.400
molecular and genetic explanation for
something we've observed for a very long

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.970
time. Certain environmental situations
affect health and that might be because

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.480
those environmental situations are
affecting the health of the cells on us

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:30.280
that are microbes. So with that, I'd like
to suggest that understanding the pro- and

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:36.970
anti-microbial systems of primates and
humans can better define who we are. And

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.054
thank you very much for your time.

♪ [music] ♪

00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:51.860
- [Michael] Today's talk, what I'm going
to discuss really, are properties of human

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:59.780
skin that support thermoregulation. Humans
have an exceptional capability to protect

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.450
against rises in body temperature, or
minimize heat storage when performing

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:11.340
physical work in hot environments. This
great thermoregulatory capacity probably

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.760
provides several selective advantages.
One, and these have been pointed out by

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.210
Dr. Dan Lieberman, that in early hominins
that the ability to forage safely during

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.430
peak heat times allow them to gather food
where the hunters that would use the

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:32.720
humans as prey, basically had to sit and
use behavioral thermoregulation because

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.770
they couldn't do muscular work in the heat
of the day. Another potential selective

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:43.760
advantage is that some humans may have
participated in persistence hunting. This

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.820
required them to perform at a fairly
substantial metabolic rate for extended

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.860
durations to move animals probably of
larger size and maybe herbivores for

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.660
extended periods of time until these
animals suffered high body temperatures

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.170
and succumbed from heat stroke and thus,
then became food for the hunters.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:08.720
So the question really arises then, why
can humans thermoregulate in hot

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.190
conditions while foraging and hunting? Now
remember, we're talking two things, the

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.760
skin for thermoregulation, but also
somehow the skin not only dumping the

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.660
heat, but also maybe participating in the
ability to sustain exercise. So humans can

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.010
do this because they have, really from a
thermoregulatory point of view, two unique

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:34.390
features. The first is the ability to
regulate a steady state core temperature

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.790
during physical exertion. That's pretty
much dependent on the metabolic rate and

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.580
reasonably independent of the environment.
We won't talk much about that today. But

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.990
that's very much made possible by the
skin's capacity to support a very high

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.600
heat loss. Now, what I've done here is
I've constructed a table that I'm going to

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.340
address in the subsequent slides, "Factors
that support high skin heat loss." If you

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.580
look on the left here, where we have the
different factors, you'll notice that four

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.270
of these obviously relate to heat
exchange, upright posture, which I'll

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:18.620
explain, skin blood flow, sweating and
large surface area. Now, these provide

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.670
certain advantages but on the other hand,
as I'm going to show you a little later,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.420
they provide also problems for the body
particularly cardiovascular nature. And

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.460
there's properties of the skin or organs
within the skin that help offset these

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.430
disadvantages, such as sodium
reabsorption, and several different

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:42.180
reflexes which I'll talk. So, the skin can
provide large heat exchange but it also

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.940
can present problems when trying to
perform sustained work in the heat. Let's

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.920
talk first about upright posture. The
advantages of an upright posture are

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.800
fairly obvious. First of all, you have a
smaller surface area exposed for solar

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.310
radiation.
As a result to that, you don't absorb the

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:06.550
solar radiation as much. So you have less
of environmental heat stress. Second, and

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.990
not as obvious, if you're upright and your
skin's exposed and I'm locomoting and

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.700
moving forward, I'm going to have more air
movement across my skin than if I was

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.010
haunched over. And as a result of that, I
improve both the convective and

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.830
evaporative heat capacitie, or the
abilities for heat loss. And third,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:31.360
bipedal locomotion also results in lower
efficiency, so lower metabolic rate and

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.790
rate of heat production to be dissipated.
Now before I go on, I'm just going to give

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.240
some very basics of heat balance. When an
individual performs physical exercise, the

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.400
amount of heat they produce is
proportionally to how hard they exercise,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.730
because when muscles contract, only
roughly 20% of that energy goes into

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.930
contractal shortening. The remaining 80%
is heat that needs to be dissipated by the

00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:01.660
body. Now, I showed the brain here because
as the body stores heat, unfortunately

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.880
there's a lot of myths that humans have
selective brain cooling. They don't. That

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.990
the brain is pretty much either similar to
arterial blood pressure or arterial blood

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.610
temperature, our recent evidence shows it
might be slightly higher, is that as body

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:20.710
temperature increases, we really rely on
the skin for heat loss. So that the

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.050
central nervous system acting through the
sympathetic nervous system has a

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:30.600
proportionate physiological
thermoregulatory system that, A, increases

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.720
skin blood flow that allows radiative and
convective heat loss, and two, increases

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.890
sweating which allows, if adequate
biophysics, evaporation. Let's first

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:47.770
discuss active vasodilation. Humans,
compared to most species, have very highly

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:54.160
vascularized skin. And for you sitting in
a room at a room temperature maybe 20 some

00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.130
degrees, 22 degrees, you probably have
your subcutaneous vessels constricted.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:04.830
So normally, if we look over here, we have
constricted cutaneous vessels. Now, when

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.360
an individual goes into the heat, two
things occur. First of all, the skin

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.260
becomes warm, and that takes away the
constrictor effect. And second, which is

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.470
very unique to humans, at least to my
knowledge, is that you have active

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:24.880
cutaneous vasodilation. That sympathetic
innervation through a variety of different

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.580
pathways, cause active vasodilation of the
skin in proportion to the heat load of the

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.920
body. So, the greater the heat load, the
greater the vasodilation. And thus, then

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.490
is this warm blood moves to the surface of
the skin, if the temperature gradient is

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:46.370
from the skin to the ambient conditions,
we now can have convective and radiative

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:54.550
heat loss. So, in this figure cartoon, we
show the impact of skin blood flow and

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.320
this is whole body skin blood flow as a
function of core temperature. What you can

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.650
see is this, if an individual is resting,
you can achieve very high skin blood

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.060
flows, up to eight liters a minute, which
is extremely high because we know in a

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.060
temperate environment, cardiac output is
only about five liters per minute sitting,

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:17.880
average human. With exercise, we find
again that at a given threshold, that the

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.820
skin temperature will increase but it
cannot increase as high as it can when

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.690
you're sitting at rest. And this is
because of this blood pressure problem

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.020
that you have constrictor tones so that
you don't have as high as a vasodilation.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.950
But you probably can have skin blood flows
maybe in the range of five to six liters.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:40.350
Now, the second avenue of heat loss is
through eccrine sweating, eccrine sweat

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:48.070
glands. Eccrine sweat glands, at least in
their number and dispersion, are fairly

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.400
unique to humans. We have about one and a
half to four million. They're located over

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.880
the entire skin. They're sympathetically
cholinergic innervated.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.510
They secrete a very hypotonic fluid to the
surface of the skin. Obviously, as this

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:10.680
fluid evaporates, it then results in
cooling of the superficial areas of the

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.970
skin and also the blood within the
capillaries. So, eccrine sweat glands are

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:22.370
different from the apocrine glands which
are often located with hair and again,

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:28.180
they're located over the entire body. Now,
humans can have very high levels of sweat

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.340
rate. And as a result, if that sweats
evaporate, they can have tremendous

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.330
amounts of evaporative cooling. And this
is why they can live in environments where

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:42.090
the ambient temperature is higher than
their skin temperature. Here we have some

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:49.050
data cartoon of a plot of whole body sweat
rate as a function of exercise intensity.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.430
As we move this way, people are running
harder, and it's going from a cool to a

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.570
hot condition. The first point I want to
make is this, we've all seen crazy numbers

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.990
in the literature about how much people
can sweat. Generally it's not unusual if

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.440
you're doing sustained hard work in the
heat to have a sweat rate of one liter per

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.180
hour, maybe a liter and a half. The
highest sweat rates that I've seen doing

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.120
thousands of experimental bodies, about a
little over two liters. People do report

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.840
in literature two and a half to three and
half liters per hour. I haven't seen them.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.900
I assume it's possible and it's very
extreme athlete for short period of time.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:31.500
But high sweat rates can be sustained in
the areas of a liter and a half. Now, when

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.360
you have these high rates of water flux,
you have to remember that the sweat comes

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.870
from the interstitial fluid which comes
from the plasma. So as you sweat, you're

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.020
going to decrease water in your plasma in
your interstitial space and your

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.280
extracellular fluid volume. So as a
result, if you're sweating and you're not

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.400
replacing fluids, your blood volume with
decrease as you dehydrate. So now, what we

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.700
see is that as an individual is exercising
in the heat for whatever purpose, of

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.240
foraging or hunting, that we have this
great capacity for heat loss, but we have

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.540
two penalties, and this is shown in a
cartoon.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.450
The first is that if we look, what we have
here, is the blood distribution in a

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.370
person standing like myself in a cool
environment. You can see that the blood's

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.740
pretty much distributed in the thoracic
area, it's easier to return blood volume

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.800
to the heart so that you can sustain
cardiac output, or how much blood flow

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.230
goes per unit time. Now, with heat stress,
you have two things that occur first. One

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.290
is you have the increase skin blood flow.
But what I also didn't mention, if the

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.740
superficial veins become warm, they become
compliant, so the blood sits in the

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.730
periphery. This means that the blood is
not in the thoracic area, it's more

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.280
difficulty to return to the heart, reduces
filling and makes it more difficult to

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.720
sustain cardiac output while
simultaneously performing exercise. So

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.470
one, the displacement. Two, that second
problem is that as I had told you, that if

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:01.420
you decrease your total body water and
dehydrate, the liquid portion of your

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:06.510
blood decreases so your plasma volume,
your blood volume reduces. All at the same

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.780
time, is when I'm standing upright, so I
have to work against gravity to perfuse

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.590
the brain, and I'm exercising and have to
perfuse skeletal muscles. So this really

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.650
causes a conundrum in terms of the human
body. Well, the skin helps to address

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.850
this. And I'm going to give several ways
that it does this. First of all, not only

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:31.070
do eccrine sweat glands secrete hypotonic
fluid, but they have the ability to

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:38.080
reabsorb sodium. That, basically you have
a reabsorption duct. So that as the sweat

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.350
comes down, that humans can reabsorb
sodium. And how much sodium they can

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:48.730
reabsorb depends on how well they're
acclimatized to the heat. Here's some data

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:55.390
that shows local sweat rate over an area
of skin, and the sodium concentration in

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:01.620
the secreted sweat in one, people that are
unacclimatized to the heat, people that

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.550
live in Boston in the winter time.
And people that are acclimatized in the

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.190
heat, people that live in Atlanta, where I
live currently, in the summer time. And

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:14.690
what you can see that obviously the higher
the sweat rate, the less efficient the

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:19.510
active transport is because the sodium is
moving by and you can only retake up so

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.230
much. But with acclimatization, you can
greatly reduced the amount of sodium in

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:30.030
the sweat. And in fact, you can basically
have as third as much...a third less

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:35.010
sodium in the sweat after acclimatization.
So it may not be unusual at all to see

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:40.010
sodium in secreted sweat on acclimatized
person, maybe 50, 60 mili-equivalents and

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.710
10 maybe, not 10, but 20 mili-equivalents.
Well, this is important because this

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:51.430
sodium that's reabsorbed goes back into
the interstitial, into the plasma and into

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:57.190
the extracellular space. And when we look
at the extracellular fluid space, the

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.580
volume in that space is very much
dependent on sodium concentration. That's

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.870
the primary cation that's the difference
between the intracellular space. So as we

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:13.050
absorb sodium back into our plasma, our
extracellular sodium concentration

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:18.010
increases and this results in an osmotic
gradient that causes you to pull water

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.280
from inactive muscle, where water is
plentiful. So this retention of sodium

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.360
then, allows the inactive muscle to pull,
act as a reservoir. So this is a way that

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.640
you can defend your blood volume or your
plasma volume by moving water throughout

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.030
the body. So, it's very important because
at a given level of dehydration, plasma

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:42.930
volume would be reduced less. Now, what is
also not as obvious in, as being much more

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.860
well understood lately is that skin
provide sensory information that supports

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.980
thermoregulation. And just simplistically,
I'm going to call these cold receptors,

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:58.810
warm receptors, and mechanical receptors.
But through these receptors, we can sense

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.670
wetness, and we also can sense
thermocomfort, or thermal sensations.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:08.480
The wetness sensation, I'm going to show
you in a minute, is very important because

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.230
as the skin is wet, that means that skin
is not evaporating that helps you

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.580
basically reduce your sweating rate so you
have less wasteful sweating to defend your

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:22.850
body water. And thermal sensations are
extremely important, is that A, they drive

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:27.880
behavioral thermoregulation, skin
temperature, skin wetness, as well as

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.160
heart rate are what drive that. And in
addition, I'm going to show you a reflex

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.820
that's probably related to the skin that's
not often appreciated that can actually

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.940
drive the core temperature to help reduce
skin blood flow requirements. Let's first

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.190
move and look at the impact of wet skin on
sweat suppression. Here we have on the

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:53.700
Y-axis, total body sweating rate during
minutes of exercise where individuals are

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:59.230
performing a given metabolic rate of
exercise over a 30 minute duration. One

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.230
time, they are not acclimatized to the
heat and the other time, they're

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:07.480
acclimatized. During this period of time,
the investigators are continually ramping

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:13.260
up humidity. So, here in the beginning,
it's dry, and here at the end, it's very

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.210
humid, it keeps getting more and more
humid. First thing is that, you can note

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.150
that if humans acclimatize to the heat,
they can have a much higher sweating rate.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.520
So you see a much higher sweating rate in
acclimatized individuals. But second, and

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.560
very important is that you can see that as
the humidity increases, the sweating rate

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.040
decreases, whether they're unacclimatized
or not. So the body is sensing that the

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.860
skin is wet, that the sweat is not being
evaporated, it's being wasted, and as a

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:45.450
result, I'll tune down my wetedness. And
this really can have a lot of important

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.930
implications. Here are some old studies
that were done, where they got a large

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:54.220
number of people and they had them perform
the same amount of physical activity,

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.930
outdoors, in a desert and a tropic
environment. So, they had the same

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:04.010
metabolic rates, so they had roughly the
same amounts of heat to be dissipated.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:07.670
But on one condition, the tropics, the
skin is wet, and then the other condition,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:12.710
the desert, the skin is dry. What you can
see that for 24 hours, sweat rates for

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:17.440
this population, it greatly reduced the
water requirement from about maybe five

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:22.640
liters down to two or three, so half the
water requirements. So, by reabsorbing

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.970
sodium, I can move water into, from
reservoirs within my body to defend blood

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:32.970
volume, by having skin wetedness, I can
sense that and I can reduce how much I

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.710
lose and how much I dehydrate. So, skin is
very important, then, for allowing

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:44.190
individuals to minimize the effects of
dehydration. Now, I don't have a good

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.090
slide to show this. If I did, I would take
my 10 minutes to explain it, but when

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:55.310
humans basically perform exercise under
most environmental conditions, how high

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:59.110
their core temperature lies is a function
of metabolic rate. And it's pretty much

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:03.940
independent of the environment. But what
you see, as the environment gets warmer,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.920
and the skin gets warmer, there is a point
where the steady state core temperature

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.610
will elevate. So, the core temperature
will elevate, but there is still

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.570
sufficient biophysics that you can just
maintain that. So for some reason, and

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:21.140
it's been known for a long time, that
humans then will somehow pick to have a

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:26.140
higher core temperature at times. And this
really kind of befuddled physiologists

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.820
because back in the old days, they used to
think high core temperature's bad, low

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.690
core temperature's good, sort of like
Animal Farm, "Four legs good, two legs

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:41.180
bad." So what Dr. Rall, Larry Rall from
University of Washington pointed out very

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.220
elegantly is that this actually provides
an advantage. And here I'm going to show

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.110
you a table. Here we have an individual
exercising in the heat, three different

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:55.770
times, same metabolic rate, same amount of
evaporative heat loss. But here we have

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.580
now a core temperature of 38, skin
temperature of 34.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.890
So we have a core-to-skin temperature
gradient of four degrees. What we see,

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.240
then, is if we do the calculations, you
would require a skin blood flow of about

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.990
two and a half liters. Now, if it got
warmer outside, and the skin temperature

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:19.650
went up, you have a smaller gradient and
now it requires more, because you have a

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.820
smaller gradient now from the skin to the
ambient, so you have to move more blood

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:29.240
through the skin to have the same amount
of heat loss to defend core temperature.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.350
So what happens is when core temperature
actually rises up, it widens the

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:38.370
core-to-skin temperature gradient, and it
reduces the skin blood flow requirement

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:43.600
thus relieving some of the cardiovascular
stress. So in summary, I think that when

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.620
we look at the skin and how it supports
thermoregulation, we not only have to

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.030
think about heat loss, but we have to
think about the other functions that it

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.840
does that supports the cardiovascular
system. I think we've established that

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.820
skin has an exceptional heat loss
capability. That you probably can have

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.470
maximum skin blood flows up to eight
liters. That would be for a seated person

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:11.240
in the heat, but very substantial. That
you can have a very high sweating rates at

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.590
least in maybe the unique Olympic athlete
up to three liters per hour, but are

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.930
probably generally must be lower in other
individuals. And that skin supports blood

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:26.670
pressure regulation, one, through sodium
conservation, which pulls water from the

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.330
intracellular spaces particularly in
active muscle, to help support blood

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:35.960
volume. Two, by suppressing the weted skin
so that we don't have wasteful sweat. All

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.390
of these acting against dehydration. And
then through thermal sensations, by one,

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.060
working to allow behavioral
thermoregulation so that the individual

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:49.380
could titrate the work load, or seek shade
so they don't work too hard. But also

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.880
probably combined with information from
baroreceptors within the cardiovascular

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.950
system to allow the thermoregulatory
system to allow core temperature to drift

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:02.828
up and reduce cardiovascular strain. Thank
you.

♪ [music] ♪

00:40:12.916 --> 00:40:18.870
- [Sarah] So as we all know, mammalian
skin is decorated with diverse appendages

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:25.490
including our mammary glands, and hair
follicles with our associated sebaceous

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:31.710
glands, and apocrine glands which are
found in hair follicles mainly in the

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.710
axillary regions in humans. And also,
eccrine sweat glands which play an

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:42.180
extremely important regulation in human
thermoregulation. So the questions I'd

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:47.370
like to address in this talk are: Firstly,
“How did these organs evolve?” And

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:53.270
secondly, “Do they have a common
evolutionary origin?” For the most part,

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:58.950
skin has not left us with a fossil record.
And so, this makes it very difficult to

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:03.980
answer these types of evolutionary
questions. But one approach to addressing

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:11.110
these issues, is to ask whether the
development and genetics of these organs

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:17.920
can give us some clues to their evolution.
So during embryonic development, it turns

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.610
out that the very early stages in the
formation of mammary glands, hair

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:27.510
follicles, and sweat glands, are
morphologically very similar. So the

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:35.150
mammary gland develops from the ectoderm.
This is the outermost layer of the embryo

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.240
and it's diagrammed here in pink, and
underlying mesenchymal cells which is

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:47.410
shown as black dots. And the first sign of
glandular development is a localized

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.040
thickening in the ectoderm, which is
called a placode and this then buds down

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:58.080
into the mesenchyme and induces the
formation of a fat pad. After that, the

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.540
mammary sprout continues to grow downwards
and starts to branch and develops a lumen.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:08.570
If we look at hair follicle development,
we find that this is also characterized

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:13.960
firstly by the formation of a localized
thickening in the ectoderm followed by

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:20.040
formation of a bud. And after that stage,
the development of hair follicles diverges

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:26.950
from the that of mammary glands. The last
organ to develop in embryonic life out of

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:32.140
these three is the eccrine sweat glands
which form around birth. And these also

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.910
form first through thickening of the
surface ectoderm, budding into the

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:43.680
mesenchyme and then further down growth,
which in this case involves curling of a

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:49.010
tube to form the gland and the development
of the lumen. Another thing that these

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:54.890
organs all have in common is that we know
that it's extremely important that the

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:00.180
cells of different types are able to
communicate with each other. So in each

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:06.570
case, the epithelial and mesenchymal cells
engage in extensive cross talk between

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:13.830
these different cell types. So this cross
talk is made possible by the secretion of

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:19.430
signaling factors from one cell that is
then received by another cell and cause

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:26.570
changes in this receiving cell that can
include changing its proliferation status

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:32.210
or its fate. Two of the really important
cell-cell signaling pathways that are

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:37.590
involved in early stages of appendage
development are the Wnt signaling pathway,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:44.250
and the ectodysplasin or EDA signaling
pathway. In each case, these involves

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:51.690
secreted Wnt ligans, secreted ligans that
are received by a receptor. In the Wnt

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:57.780
pathway, the ligan is known as Wnt. So
this is made by another cell and it floats

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.480
out and then starts to interact with
receptors on the receiving cell.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.980
And this causes a whole series of
intracellular changes that end up with the

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:16.100
activation of target gene expression and
these genes then can cause a change in

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:21.830
fate of the cell. Ectodysplasin signaling,
similarly involves a secreted ligan, in

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:27.460
this case called EDA, and this interacts
with its receptor and causes a different

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:35.520
set of changes intracellularly. But these
also result in expression of target genes.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.830
So it turns out, that Wnt signaling is
absolutely key for the formation of all of

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:47.650
these different appendages, if its absent,
they completely fail to form. And if you

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:53.610
over activate this pathway using genetic
tricks in mice, we see that you get extra

00:44:53.610 --> 00:45:01.350
appendages forming. Downstream of Wnt
signaling, the ectodysplasin pathway is

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:07.620
activated. And this requires Wnt in order
to get started, but then takes over from

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:14.250
Wnt in further promoting the formation of
these organs. So both the similar

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:19.200
morphology and the similar molecular
pathways involved in the formation of

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:26.220
these diverse organs suggest that they may
have a common origin. If we look during

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:33.590
evolution, our ancient ancestors, the
sauropods, had, at least some of them,

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:43.770
were thought to have a glandular skin. And
this was selected for in the therapsids.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:50.320
And these animals lacked scales, in fact,
and had completely glandular skin. And

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:58.310
people have argued that one of the
functions of this glandular skin was to

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:04.950
provide moisture through skin secretions
to the eggs of these creatures, which are

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:11.210
known to have been very thin-walled and
would likely have dehydrated otherwise.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:18.590
The development of hair has been argued to
be possibly a specialization that could

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:24.900
have led to...that could have aided in the
delivery of glandular secretions to eggs.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:30.620
So the mammals that exist today, fall into
several classes of which the Monotremes

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:38.480
still lay eggs and they lack nipples and
suckle their young via specialized hairs.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:45.660
And these animals include the Spiny
Anteaters and Platypus. Whereas marsupials

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:54.080
do have nipples, but these "nipple
primordia" actually co-form hair follicles

00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.320
and mammary glands during development as
I'll show you in a minute. The placental

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.400
animals which include ourselves have
developed hairless nipples. And these

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:11.340
probably facilitate the suckling of
newborns. So there is also some molecular

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:19.140
evidence for this kind of a scheme. So, it
was thought that the mucus secreting

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.870
surface epithelia make anti-microbial
enzymes as an important function of these

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:32.110
epithelia, and these include xanthine
oxidoreductase and lysozyme. And as glands

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:39.220
developed in order to more effectively
secrete these antimicrobials and

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:46.030
eventually forming mammary glands. At the
same time as this development or evolution

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:53.980
occurred, the gene in coding lysozyme
actually became duplicated. And one of the

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:59.070
copies evolved into the alpha lactalbumin
gene and this encodes an important

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:07.690
component of milk and is also involved in
the manufacture of lactose, another

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:13.040
important component of milk.
It's also been shown that xanthine

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:19.050
oxidoreductase has a secondary function in
addition to its antimicrobial properties.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:23.860
It's also important in encasing fat
droplets in milk and allowing their

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:30.590
secretion. So, these enzymes seem to have
adopted additional functions that allow

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:37.890
them to help in milk production. Another
piece of evidence that...for a common

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:43.480
origin for mammary glands and hair
follicles came, as I already mentioned,

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:52.230
from studies of marsupial mammary
development. So in marsupials, the nipple

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:57.260
develops, as I mentioned already, from a
thickening in the ectoderm. And this

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:02.510
elongates and develops two types of
sprouts, a primary sprout and secondary

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:09.430
buds. And these secondary buds go on to
form mammary glands whereas the primary

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:14.830
sprouts develop into hair follicles with
associated sebaceous glands. So this is

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:21.160
all happening during the embryonic
development of the marsupial. And the last

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.130
stage of development, the nipple actually
everts and it retains these sebaceous

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:31.400
glands and of course the mammary glands,
but the hair follicles degenerate in most

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:39.660
marsupials. Although it is known that
koala bears actually have hair still

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:45.950
emanating from their nipples. So, this
common development of these different

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:53.710
types of organs in the same structure
really provides support for the idea that

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:59.230
these things may have co-evolved. So of
course, the numbers and locations of

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.420
mammary glands have evolved to fit the
litter size and feeding position.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:10.990
So in humans, we generally have one baby
and we have two mammary glands. The babies

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:15.990
are usually, we usually hold our babies to
our chest and that's where the mammary

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:24.260
glands are located. By contrast, pigs have
very large litters with an average size of

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:31.890
10 and they have 12 to 14 nipples or tits.
They tend to feed in a lying position and

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:38.370
their nipples are located all along the
side of their body. Cattle, generally have

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:44.290
a litter size of one and only four nipples
or tits. And they feed standing up with

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:51.900
the mammary tits in an inguinal position.
So, what are the mechanisms that may have

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:58.240
permitted these adaptation of mammary
gland numbers and locations to fit the

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:05.630
needs of these species? So in many
mammals, the embryonic mammary glands

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:11.680
actually form along a line between the
fore- and hindlimb buds in the embryo and

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.620
this is known as the milk line or mammary
line. And it gradually becomes fragmented

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.960
resulting in the formation of mammary
buds. And this is diagrammed for a mouse

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:29.000
embryo. We can see something very similar
in the rabbit embryo. And this is a

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.330
scanning electron microscopy that allows
us to actually visualize this raised

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:42.270
mammary ridge. And this can also be seen
in human embryos. So as I mentioned, the

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:47.450
Wnt signaling pathway plays key roles in
the initiation of mammary gland

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:52.920
development. So there's no mammary
development without this signal. And if we

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:58.230
over activate it, you can get extra
mammary glands. And we can visualize this

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:03.110
nicely by looking at one of the Wnt ligans
called Wnt10b, and here we're using a

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:08.930
technique called [inaudible 00:52:04] to
look at where the Wnt10b mRNA is being

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.790
made and this appears as a reddish brown
stain.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.380
So we can see the stains all along the
milk line and is elevated in the

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.290
developing mammary buds. And
interestingly, in mice which lack a

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:15.020
secreted inhibitor protein, which would be
expected to result in excess Wnt

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.740
signaling, we find that these developed
extra nipples and extra mammary glands. So

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.120
these findings suggest that changes in the
pattern of Wnt signaling activity could

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.430
underlie the adaption of mammary gland
location and number. So, like the mammary

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.830
gland, our hair and sweat gland formation
varies greatly between mammalian species,

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:29.860
but also, varies within species. So if we
think about humans, of course we have nice

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.270
long hair on our head and very short, fine
hairs over the rest of our body. But

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.380
within our species, that hair can vary
greatly in its texture and its thickness.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.290
Our apocrine glands, as I mentioned, are
mostly axial and we have eccrine sweat

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:42.020
glands all over our body. By contrast, a
polar bear has hair that's of rather

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:47.230
similar length over most of its body, but
this hair is specially adapted and it has

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:57.710
a large air pockets that allow much better
thermoregulation for the polar bear in

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:13.380
cold conditions. It also, interestingly,
has apocrine glands on the soles of its

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:39.540
feet and leaves a scent trail with these.
And its eccrine glands are confined to the

00:53:39.540 --> 00:54:04.560
soles of the feet unlike in humans.
Horses apparently completely lack eccrine

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.930
glands and instead they sweat by a
different mechanism that utilizes apocrine

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:16.420
glands which are located all over the body
of the horse. And when these are active

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:22.090
you get this lathering appearance that we
see for instance in race horses. And the

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:26.930
hair of the body is mostly...the hair of
the horse is mostly short but has

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:34.210
specialize appearances on their tail and
the mane where it's very long. So there's

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:39.910
an incredible amount of variation here.
For both hair follicles and eccrine sweat

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:45.650
glands, the ectodysplasin signaling
pathway plays various key roles at early

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:51.320
stages of development. And indeed, loss of
function of this pathway in humans leads

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:57.730
to syndromes where there is really an
absence of all these organs. More relevant

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:02.430
to evolution, though, it turns out that
there's a variant of the receptor for

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:10.170
ectodysplasin which is associated with
increased activity of this receptor. And

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:17.120
in Asian populations, this variant
receptor is specifically seen in people

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:23.540
who have thick, straight hair, and
increased numbers of eccrine sweat glands.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:29.830
Particularly in the Lee and Han
populations, this variant is extremely

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:36.760
predominant. And this is illustrated here
using a...looking at Asian populations and

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.920
individuals who have either straight or
non-straight hair. And you can see that if

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:49.410
you have the 370A variant of EDAR, you're
much more likely to have straight hair.

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:54.390
Whereas individuals with non-straight
hair, have more or less equal chance of

00:55:54.390 --> 00:56:01.190
having either that A or the V variant.
And we can model this in mice by

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:09.980
genetically replacing the V variant of the
gene with an A variant and this in mice,

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:15.500
as well as in humans, results in the
formation of thicker hair, and also an

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:21.640
increased number of sweat glands. So, here
we're looking at the foot pad of a mouse,

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.130
actually several mice, and these are
stained with blue stain to reveal the

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:31.650
glands. And you can see the greatly
increased numbers of these glands in the A

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:38.840
variant. So mutation of EDAR to a more
active form may underlie a subset of human

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:44.790
variation in hair thickness and
straightness, and sweat gland density. So

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:50.950
just to summarize what I've told you,
evidence from development, genetics and

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.540
evolutionary studies suggest that mammary
glands, sweat glands and hair follicles

00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:01.200
may be derived from a common precursor.
The function of this precursor may have

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.900
been to hydrate and protect thin-walled
eggs and later developed nutritional

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:15.040
functions as well. Mammary gland evolution
preceded the birth of live young. And

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.550
mammary gland adaptation may have occurred
in part through altered control of Wnt

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:24.260
signaling. Whereas variation in hair
thickness and sweat gland density are

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:30.290
associated with altered ectodysplasin
signaling. Now, there's an awful lot that

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:35.570
we don't know. Some very straightforward
questions such as, “What controls the

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:41.660
formation of different types of appendages
in specific regions of the body?” “How and

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.700
why did human eccrine glands becomes
ubiquitous to over our body and

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:50.410
intermingled with hair follicles?” And
very straightforward questions like, “Why

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:56.390
is human scalp hair longer than body
hair?” And of interest to many men in the

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:01.160
audience, “Why do many human males lose
their hair in a particular pattern?”

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:06.780
And I'm sure you can think of many
additional questions that we really don't

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:12.810
know the answers to yet and would like to.
So just to reiterate, that in future

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:18.940
studies, because of the relative dearth of
fossil records for mammalian skin, these

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:23.490
types of developmental and molecular
approaches to skin evolution can be

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:29.440
particularly useful. And this is just my
lab who contributed to some of the work

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.647
that I showed you. And thank you for your
attention.
