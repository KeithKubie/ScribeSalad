&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.690
I'm very happy to see
all of you tonight.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.550
My name is Grant Harris.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.820
I'm chief of the European
Division here at the Library.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.300
We're now in the
Madison building,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.580
but the European Division is
over in the Jefferson building,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.330
the oldest of the
three buildings.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.650
The mic is on, all right.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.910
Okay. So what we're here
tonight for is for the symposium

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.060
on Italian Americans before
and during World War II.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.540
The European Division is very
pleased to cosponsor this event

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.290
with the greater
Washington DC region

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.810
of the National Organization
of Italian American Women.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.120
That's a long mouthful for me.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.790
That organization
gets all the credit.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.170
I like to take credit
for things,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.050
but that organization
takes all the credit

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.920
for initiating this
event and bringing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.180
to us tonight three really
distinguished speakers.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.360
So now a little housekeeping,
I remind you now

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.130
to turn off your cell
phones and recording devices

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.610
for the duration
of this program.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
Also, please note that this
event is being recorded

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.290
for a future Library
of Congress webcast.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.650
When we have the question
and answer session

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.860
after the main presentations,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.610
understand that if you ask a
question, you are consenting

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.840
to be part of the webcast.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.580
We hope you enjoy this symposium
and the treasure display

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.880
that we have after that.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
In a bit, I'll have Lucia
Wolfe, our specialist for Italy,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.360
come up here and
say a few words.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.400
Just please know that the
collections of the Library

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.770
of Congress are for you.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.070
They're for everybody.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.530
These are open to the public.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.880
Our specialist for Italy
Lucia will tell you something

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.180
about them in a bit.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.500
And I look forward to you
all seeing the exhibit,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.360
the display afterwards.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.860
So by all means, contact Lucia

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.410
if you ever have questions
concerning research and Italy.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.450
But before Lucia comes
up, I have the pleasure

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.080
of interesting Diana
Femia who is president

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.120
of the greater Washington
DC region

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
of the National Organization
of Italian American Women.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.890
I made it.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.190
I made it.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.090
It is Diana who suggested
this event to the library.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.690
And I'm very pleased
to work with you.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.020
We both are, Lucia and I both.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.320
So thank you.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.510
So I now give the
floor to Diana.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.800
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.200
&gt;&gt; Diana Femia: That's
right, you're taller than me.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.240
Well, I don't have to
introduce myself, and in order

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.820
to make it easy for you,
we use NOIAW as the acronym

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.680
for the National Organization.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.830
We are an organization that was
established in 1980 in New York.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.730
It was a group of women who
were looking for an organization

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.180
that only Italian
American Women were.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.410
Most organizations you will
find are male organizations.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.850
And so the women just
hang on somewhere.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.490
But we are the only
one in the country

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.480
that has Italian American
women, and I have to say

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.500
that we have Italiophiles
in our group.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.870
They are not all
Italian Americans.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.860
They are other nationalities,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.580
one of them sitting
right here today.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.350
And the reason they decided

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.810
to start this organization
is basically to unite

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.340
and connect women of
Italian American background,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.380
and to promote cultural
and educational events.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.030
And this is basically
what we do.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.210
And I would say about 12 years
ago, they started indicating

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.380
that maybe we should
have some regions.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.010
And so we have a
region in Rhode Island

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.140
and we have a region
in Connecticut.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.220
There's the metro
regions in New York.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.150
And then Washington DC.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.040
We were the first one of
the regions to come about.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.150
And I have to say, it
has been really a great

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.450
learning experience.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.070
I think even for me, whose
father continued to tell her

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.270
that she came from the
greatest group of people

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.850
in the world, the Italians.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.810
So it's really interesting.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.590
And if you're interested
in the organization,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.700
I have some brochures here

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:27.100
which gives you information
on what we are.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.000
Every year, at our
national luncheon,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.690
we give out about four
or five scholarships.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.030
And they are to young women,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.630
either undergraduate
or graduate students.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.980
And we also try to promote
the Italian language.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.500
So in promoting the Italian
language, we always try

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.050
to give a scholarship to
a person who is majoring

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.680
in Italian; Italian literature,
the Italian language.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.280
Because let's face it,
we want to promote this.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:14.440
And basically, we have
events, probably monthly.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.170
We try. Actually, next month on
November 7th we're having a tour

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:26.130
of the Jefferson building
by the tour group there.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.340
And we were there about
five or six years ago

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.060
and there were members who
told me this was a great tour,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.460
"Can't we do it again?"

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.640
So we're doing it again.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.940
And I hope some of you will be
able to join us, because it is

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.760
at 11:00 in the morning.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.730
They don't want to
do tours at night.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.330
And believe me, with
the traffic,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.880
I don't think so either.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:07:00.770
But anyway, we are also
working right now to start

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.060
on our epiphany celebration
which is

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.750
where we honor three
Italian American women

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:15.250
as three wise women,
versus three wise men, okay.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.650
And we've already
actually identified three

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.030
for this coming year in January.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.020
And we generally have an event.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.590
It's going to be on
January the 10th.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.480
And if you're on our mailing
list, you will see it.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.340
And I will say that our
moderator this evening is one

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.440
of the first ones we had
in DC, Connie Morella.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.450
She's a great friend of NOIAW
and I don't think there's anyone

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.330
who doesn't know Connie
who's from this area.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.730
Anyway, if anyone is
actually interested or wants

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.150
to know more, I have
more brochures

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.870
and I will give them to you.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.450
And I welcome you.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.330
I am so glad that some of
you managed to get here.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.820
And I look forward
to this evening,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.650
because I'm very
interested in this topic.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.180
So thank you very much.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:42.100
[ Applause ]

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.940
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolfe: I am going to
be really brief because I want

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.830
to leave it to the speakers,
to the presenters tonight.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.460
So can you hear me?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.360
And I'm even shorter than Diana.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.590
I am Lucia Wolfe and I'm
the reference librarian

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.130
at the European Division
who is responsible

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.180
for the Italian collections.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.630
And those are especially
the general collections;

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.370
that is the books
and periodicals

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.640
that are published
from 1801 onwards.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.110
So just to give you
an idea of the scope

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.190
of the Italian collections,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:23.030
I will say that at large they
are 800,000 and more items.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.260
Not only the general
collections,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.730
but also other formats.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.490
We have prints and photographs.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.980
We have newspapers.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.070
We have manuscripts.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.460
I think I'm forgetting --
oh, music scores, webpages,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.920
sound recordings, motion
pictures and I could go on.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.160
Linda will do a better
job later.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.940
So I wanted to say that
because it gives you an idea

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.840
of the scope of the Italian
collections in general.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.000
But for two years now I've
been trying to focus in also

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.970
on the Italian American
collections.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:05.140
It is very hard to separate
the two collections,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.610
because for a great part in
the 19th century and beginning

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.880
of the 20th century, many

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.010
of the Italian American books
were actually printed in Italy

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.460
and then printed
also in America.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.360
So I believe they're classifying
and dividing the Italian

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.020
and the Italian American
collections at that point

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.400
between the end of the 19th
century and the beginning

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.720
of the 20th century
could be problematic.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.000
I have been working with some --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.530
we also hire some
wonderful interns and some

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.210
of them will be outside
at the display.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.440
Mostly, I work with Italian
America interns from all

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.600
over the United States
of America.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.130
And what we have been
doing lately is focus

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.810
on the Italian American
periodicals,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.880
one of the most consistent
and extensive parts

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.250
of the collections, of the
Italian American collections.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:10.180
But we are also working on
collecting data about books

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.720
and other items in
the collection.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.800
So I just wanted
to say that because

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.200
in the next few years we will
also publish some research

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.500
guides online.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.690
And for further information,
those will be very useful

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:32.380
to orientate you about the
Italian American collections.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.490
Two words about the
display, I have tried

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.720
to put together a display

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.330
that represents the period
we are talking about,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.060
but I moved a little
bit onward to the 1970's

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.170
and past the 1970's,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.510
so it doesn't really
reflect our theme completely.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.390
But there are various sections.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.580
The earliest section is about
books by politicians, statesmen,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:05.700
vice consuls from Italy
who traveled to America

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.030
and in general try to do surveys

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.640
and also record their
impressions

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.170
of the Italian American
communities throughout a

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.420
continent in some
interesting travel journals

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.990
that you will see out there.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.270
Those books are principally in
Italian because there were a lot

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.010
of Italian politicians and
diplomats who were coming

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.400
in from Italy and
doing these surveys.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.570
The next group is
education and literacy.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.800
I try to represent
that, number one,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.170
because I am biased
as a librarian.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.970
Many of the educators

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.210
of the first Italian Americans
were actually librarians.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.420
And you will find out some of
the books and some of the prints

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.220
and photographs identify this.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.080
So I am extremely
proud about that.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.170
And I have also highlighted
literature and art

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.580
in Italian Americans'
interpretation.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.250
One case is the translation

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.840
by John Chardy of
the Divine Comedy.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.200
I did not include
that in the display

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.910
because I needed to select.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.770
But I did include a beautiful
translation of the divine comedy

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:26.270
with artwork by Umberto
Romano, a very important

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.790
and particular original
Italian American artist.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.320
I don't want to go on for
too long, but I did want

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.200
to highlight how the
display moves through time.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.710
And I included some photographs

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.480
that also Lind has shown
in her splendid book.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.140
Some of the photos I displayed
are not in Linda's book

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.870
because I didn't
want to overlap.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.410
So I hope you will take
some time and enjoy

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.810
and look at the display.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.190
And I will be out
there to explain

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.490
and answer your questions.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:10.510
Thank you very much and
now to the speakers.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:15.300
[ Applause ]

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.340
&gt;&gt; Diana Femia: I would like
to introduce you formally

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.230
to our moderator.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.960
Connie Morella, Constance
Morella, is a faculty ambassador

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.090
in residence for Women
in Politics Institute

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.470
at American University.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.590
She served as a member
of Congress

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.730
in Maryland's eighth
district from 1987-2003.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.620
And as the permanent
representative

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.650
to the Organization of
Economic Cooperation

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:54.060
and Development,
OECD, from 2003-2007.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.810
She was appointed to the
American Monument Commission

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:02.570
by President Barack
Obama in 2010.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:08.050
She is also a caballera
official, order of merit,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.830
the Republic of Italy.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:16.560
And she is a NOIAW member
as well as our 2010,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.480
one of our wise women.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.480
And she was there with us just

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.460
about every year at
our presentation.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.170
So I am giving you
Connie Morella

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.780
who will be moderating tonight.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.580
Thank you.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.120
[ Applause ]

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.420
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
If I can make it

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.750
up here without the steps.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.050
I can do it.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.610
Yeah. Okay, got it.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:49.040
Got it. Well, I want to
say to you, benvenito.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.990
Thank you for coming.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.940
I know it is not that easy
to get to a specific building

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.450
in Washington DC
during this time

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.310
of the evening, right
by the capital.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.270
But we are in the
Madison building.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.630
James Madison, the father
of the Constitution.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.890
And so it's pretty
special that we are here.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.010
Well, I am Connie Morella
and I approve this message.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.310
[ Laughter ]

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.030
Now you know, that
actually comes

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.700
from Senator Joh McCain's
campaign finance bill

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.680
that he and Finegold had.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.670
I was on the House
side with Chris Shays

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.380
where it was disclosure.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.480
So that's why you have
heard that constantly.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.910
But I must say, it's a great
honor for me to be here

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.450
with this wonderful group

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:41.360
to celebrate Italian
American heritage month

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.360
and to take an historic
and important look back

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.800
to listen, to learn, to lead.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.140
That's what I plan to do with
the speakers that we have.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:59.470
I want to thank Diana Femia,
not only for her introduction

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.220
and her comments,
but her leadership,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.340
the fact that she is the
godmother of this event tonight.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.120
She truly is.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:14.180
Its genesis, its development,
implementation and its reality.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.520
So thank you, Diana,
for all the work

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.740
that you've done to
make this happen.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.500
I also want to thank
the Library of Congress.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.550
It's very special to me, you
know, when you're in Congress,

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.320
you really do rely on all
the different resources.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.130
Whether it's the RS or whatever,

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.050
the European Institute,
whatever it is.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.320
We rely on it very heavily
and we're so proud of it,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.760
and I'm pleased that it is now
headed by a woman from Maryland.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.770
And she's doing a very good job

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.370
from what my experts
here have told me.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.120
And she has great
professionals working there too,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.170
such as Grant Harris and
Lucia Wolfe, among others too.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.060
Well, my role as moderator
is really no heavy lifting.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.850
It is to introduce our
two outstanding speakers

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.420
and to allow you an opportunity
for Q and A and for discussion

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.530
after their presentations.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:14.270
It is an honor for me to present
them to this August group.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:19.500
The theme, Italian Americans
before and during World War II.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.650
And it's very timely.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.750
And as a matter of
fact, I was thinking,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.030
having been on the Battle
Monuments Commission,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.490
this is the 100th anniversary
of the end of World War I.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.860
Remember, that was the war
to end all wars, right?

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.890
And personal disclosure
on my part,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.530
my parents were both
born in Italy.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.130
So I am first-generation.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.320
My three older brothers
all served

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.650
in the United States
Army during World War II.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.000
I was much younger,
but nevertheless,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.120
my parents would have
me write those V mail.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.400
Anybody remember V mail?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.550
My mother would dictate to
me, "I want you to write

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.920
to your brothers and I want you

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.060
to tell them this
and tell them that."

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.920
And so we operated that way
and we were very proud to have

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.040
on our window that flag
with the three blue stars.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.500
Thank God they weren't gold,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.840
but the three blue stars all
commemorating World War II.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.140
So I'm just so very honored
that we have this event tonight

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.760
so that we can look back, we can
reflect and we can move ahead.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.570
Our first speaker is
Linda Barrett Osborne.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:47.030
She's an award-winning
writer, editor, book reviewer

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.100
for the Washington Post
and the New York Times,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.630
and a senior writer/editor
for the publishing office

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.270
of the Library of Congress.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.110
She has received
numerous awards,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.100
such as the Penn
Syndicated Fiction Award.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.880
She's authored a
collection of books

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.540
for school students and adults.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.380
I love the titles of them,
because they say so much

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.360
about her and how she
feels about our country.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.250
For instance, This
Land is Our Land.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:22.650
Come On In, America
is another one.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.370
Miles to Go for Freedom
is another one.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.870
Traveling the Freedom
Road is another.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.990
And to me, they show her
love and promise of America.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.430
We feel particularly close
tonight to the thesis

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.970
of the book that she coauthored
called Explorers, Immigrants,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:50.330
Citizens: A Visual Look at the
Italian American Experience.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.370
As Shakespeare wrote, a beggar's
book outworths a noble's blood.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.690
And I think you have
exemplified that so well.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.110
And also, what's in a name?

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:08.540
Well, Linda's maiden name was
Bocucci, changed in the 1940's

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.730
to avoid discrimination.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:16.840
So I present to you -- I'm
going to present each presenter

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.260
and then I will introduce
the other one afterwards.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:26.280
So I am going to present to
you Linda Boccucci Osborne.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:33.390
[ Applause ]

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.080
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: Hi, welcome
everyone, and thank you

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.060
so much for being here.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.720
I want to thank Grant and
Lucia for all the work they did

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.990
to put this program
together, and of course Diana

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.040
who is a force of nature

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.670
when she decides she
wants a program to happen.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.860
I also have the privilege
of being here with Connie

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.490
and Father Ezio to talk to
you about the experience

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.830
of Italian American immigrants.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.010
Let me just explain
a couple of things.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.060
First of all, I no
longer review.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.310
I did about 250 reviews
for the Post and the Times,

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.160
and I did work at the Library
of Congress for 15 years.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.460
I'm retired.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.260
What I've been doing since
then is not only this Italian

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.330
American book which you
can see outside that I did

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.870
with the Library of
Congress and which is

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.410
out of print, unfortunately.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.530
Although I think there are
a couple of copies left

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.680
in the book shop here.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.580
Since then, I've written
some young adult books.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.080
One called This Land is Our
Land, which is on the history

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.610
of immigration in this country

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.150
from before we were
a country to 2015.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.500
And it deals not only
with Italian Americans,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.250
but with every ethnic
group, Asians, Latinos

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.910
and refugees as a group.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.700
And one on the United
States in World War I.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:56.400
And I am now working on a book
on the history and the meaning

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.140
of freedom of the
press in this country.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.270
I like to do books
that deal with some

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.870
of the more negative
aspects of American history.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.130
And that as I understand
it, is what I'm going

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.970
to talk about tonight.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.860
I want you to know
that my books are full

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.240
of the positive experiences
of American history.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.790
Because I am always amazed
and impressed by the way

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.880
that any group -- African
Americans for some of my books,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.390
Italian American immigrants --

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.610
have overcome the obstacles

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.970
that have been placed
before them to succeed.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.940
And so as I say,
it's a combination,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.700
but without knowing exactly
what they had to overcome,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.120
I don't think we get a complete
history of the United States.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.010
One more thing about
the Library of Congress,

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.090
the Jefferson building was
put together pretty much

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.950
by Italian artisans.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.950
In fact, a lot of
the public monuments

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:03.030
in this country were done
by people who had the skills

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.620
who were brought
over from Italy.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.210
That's one of the positive
things in the book.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:15.970
Anyway, I will start now
with my talk with a photo.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.270
I hope I get this right.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.740
Did it go?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.340
Now I did this --
oh there we go.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.640
This is a photo

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.300
of my great-grandfather,
Nicolas Faleri.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.350
Let me explain the Bocucci part.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.640
My parents actually
changed their names in 1941,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.620
'42, before I was born.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.290
So I was never Linda Bocucci.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.190
I was always Linda Barrett.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:45.340
But all of my great-grandparents
came here from Italy

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.640
and I will explain that.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.940
This is Nicolas Faleri.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.270
Yeah, and this is his wife
Josephine Faleri who was one

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.160
of my great-grandmothers.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.620
And as I said, the
immigrated here

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.960
from Bologna in the
19th century.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.260
Now all eight

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.690
of my great-grandparents
were Italian immigrants.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.420
So the Bocucci's, the
Moreno's and the Charoni's.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.840
The reason the name was
changed in the 1940's was

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.910
that my father felt that he was
being discriminated at work.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.190
He was working for General
Motors, an American company.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.360
Anyway, whether that
was true or not,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.330
it was very common unfortunately
for Italian Americans

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.530
to change their name in that
period and to try better

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:36.300
to assimilate into the
model of a pure American

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.680
which also included I'm
afraid losing the language.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.590
But not the food or parts
of the culture, okay.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:49.440
Now, my great-grandparents
came in the 1880's or 1890's.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.290
And I show you these
because the story

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.010
of Italian immigration is
personal to m. You see,

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.760
they are not just
statistics or stereotypes.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.060
These are my family.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.170
This is my heritage and that
might be a good thing to keep

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.520
in mind when we think about
immigration in general

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.120
in this country and
in the world.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.020
A large influx of Italian
Americans to this country began

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.030
in about 1870 when most of Italy
north and south became united.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.320
And although you might expect
conditions to have improved,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.210
they actually worsened
in southern Italy.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.930
The country was ruled from
Piedmont to the north.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.310
I won't get into Italian
politics at the time.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.310
But they considered the
south somewhat barbarous.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.570
And they imposed higher taxes
on basics like mules and salt

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.520
and unemployment was rampant.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.010
Extreme poverty, that's
what drove tens of thousands

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.240
to leave southern Italy to
find economic opportunity

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.190
in the United States.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.980
Now leaving Italy was not easy.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.210
It meant leaving home,
family and culture behind.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.010
It took a great deal of courage.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.480
Most immigrants, and
as far as I know,

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.070
all eight of my
great-grandparents,

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.500
came by steamboat at steeridge.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.250
The average time at sea in
the 1890's was 7-10 days.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.120
In the 1860's it was
something like 51 days.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.200
So the passage had improved.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.440
Now, passage in steeridge, which
is the third and lowest class

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.730
of travel, is almost universally
acknowledged to be miserable.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:26.370
In 1907, a Neopolitan
immigrant wrote,

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.980
"How can a steward's
passenger remember

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.420
that he is a human being when
he first must pick the worms

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.940
from his food and eat in
a stuffy, stinking bunk

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.960
or in the hot and
fetid atmosphere

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.130
of a compartment
where 150 men sleep?"

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.320
I love using direct
quotes and stories,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.280
interviews, primary sources.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.790
There will be a bunch
of them in this talk.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.740
It's not just me saying
that it was tough to cross.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.870
It's the person who
actually did that.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.350
And I see my great-grandparents
too,

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.500
telling you what it was like,
what the experience was like.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:09.740
However, nothing -- not even
the miserable ocean-crossing --

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.570
engendered more fear in
immigrants than the possibility

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.870
that they would be turned away

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.690
at Ellis Island when
they arrived.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.340
It's also interesting to
me that if you came second

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.720
or first class, you went
directly into the United States

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.270
without going through
inspection stations.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.280
It was assumed that
you had enough money

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.670
and that you would never
become a public charge,

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.970
which was a big fear

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.450
of Americans living
here at the time.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.750
Okay?

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.080
The new arrivals
were most afraid

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.180
of the medical examination.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.090
Here they are being
examined for traucoma

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.840
which was an eye disease which
is the illness or disease

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.100
that sent most of them back.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.550
I'm going to have a quote
from Forello Laguardia

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.180
who actually worked
as an interpreter

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.470
on Ellis Island when
he was young.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.150
"Many were found to be
suffering from traucoma,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.860
and their exclusion
was mandatory.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.870
It was harrowing to
see families separated.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.380
Sometimes, if it was a
young child who suffered

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.030
from traucoma, one of
the parents had to return

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.210
to the native country with the
rejected member of the family.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.090
When they learned this
fate, they were stunned.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.380
They could see all right, and
they had no homes to return to."

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:32.960
Now if you came after
1886 when the Statue

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.790
of Liberty was dedicated --
that's actually fairly late

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.510
and Ellis Island didn't
open until 1892 --

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.160
you were greeted by the Lady.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.390
Once you made it into
the country, however,

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.810
unfortunately most
Italian immigrants were met

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.170
with prejudice and
discrimination.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.950
And this is an Italian
family arriving in the period

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.020
around the turn of the century.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.100
Not only Italians, but Jews

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.190
and Slavs among many
Americans in this period.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.120
Earlier, Germans and Irish
immigrants had alarmed

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.510
many Americans.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.830
Later, Asians and Latinos would.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:13.080
Right? That's a theme throughout
our country's history, okay?

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.910
It's politicians, the
press and the public,

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.480
wide socioeconomic
variety of people,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.530
who called for preserving
the United States

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:32.340
for English descendants of
what they called Anglo-Saxons.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:40.190
Okay. These people who were
against immigration by people

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.850
from many, many countries,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.540
called themselves
native Americans.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.930
This was before we used native
Americans the way we do now.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.290
This was in the 19th century.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.850
And those who opposed
immigration

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.650
by any other ethnic group
were called nativists.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:58.490
And I sometimes use that as a
quick way of describing people

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.190
in this country against -- well,
Americans who were born here

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.650
who believe that only people

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.940
of Anglo-Saxon heritage
can become real Americans.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.370
These are lodged members.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.290
In 1902, they are dressed

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:16.550
in what they believed
was Anglo-Saxon costume.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.160
And they were serious
about this.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.770
They also felt that
the traditions

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.580
of English government
were the only traditions

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.430
that were worth preserving
in this country.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.560
Okay, nativists thought
that the flood of eastern

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.370
and southern European immigrants
which started in the 1870's

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.740
and continued into World War
I could never be assimilated

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.920
into American society
and culture.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.080
Okay? These newcomers
looked different, dressed

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.240
and spoke differently,
lived in crime-

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.370
and disease-ridden,
filthy neighborhoods.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.140
And never mind that most
Americans didn't want them

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.740
in their own neighborhoods.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.800
And one of many examples used

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.220
to describe Italian Americans
appeared in the Review

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.830
of Reviews in 1891,
which called them,

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.860
"The refuse of the murder
reeds of southern Europe."

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.170
These are my great-grandparents,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.890
and this is the time
they were coming.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.120
Many Italian immigrants
stayed in New York.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:21.520
A classic scene of tenements in
Little Italy in New York City.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.420
And almost universally,

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.920
they lived in immigrant
neighborhoods.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.380
And this was partly because
they were more comfortable

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.310
and secure living with
others from their hometowns.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.720
And of course partly because
most Americans did not welcome

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.490
them in their neighborhoods.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:39.020
Living inside Little Italy's
had serious disadvantages.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.540
It isolated Italian
immigrants from other Americans.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.650
They could avoid
learning to speak English

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.920
or adopt American customs.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.620
And it limited their
opportunities, okay?

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.920
But here's a happy one.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.220
I snuck in a happy one.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.110
This is a festival
in Little Italy.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.940
In fact, I could give
a whole other talk

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.190
on how wonderful the Italian
American culture developed,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.160
not only in New York, but
cities across the United States

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.830
and even in small towns.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.540
Just to give you an
idea of the crowding --

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.550
well, I'm about to give
a quote about the men

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.530
who lived in Little Italy.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.830
This is interesting.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.840
I don't know if you can see it.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.090
This was also during a festival,
guys staying on the streets.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.200
The tenements were
above the shops.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.410
There's a giant candle
on the left side

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.310
of the photograph,
and the right.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.160
And they were carried
in the festivals.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.690
So I thought it was
a need picture.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.770
In any case, whether they
were learning English or not,

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.970
whether they were being
assimilated or not,

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.360
the immigrants when they
first arrived worked the

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.350
poorest-paying jobs
and were crowded

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.110
into the poorest
slum neighborhoods.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.850
And malnutrition affected
children in adults.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.340
In 1908, one Italian write
pictured, "A little Colavia

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.560
across the ocean where
immigrants returned

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.770
to their homes, and after
a very frugal meal go

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.330
to their poor beds huddled

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.620
against each other
for little rest.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.500
Everyone can imagine
how these tired

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.770
and undernourished beings
might easily develop the germs

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.320
of diseases, especially
tuberculosis."

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.900
Jacob Reese who was a journalist
and social reformer noted,

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.790
"In a block of tenements
which totaled 132 rooms,

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.660
1,342 Italian immigrants lived.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.690
Mostly men, Sicilian
laborers, sleeping more

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.400
than 10 people per room
for an entire block."

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.560
Okay. Okay, in New
York's tenements in tiny,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.860
overcrowded apartments, women
and children did piece work.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:48.420
There's an apartment
in New York.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.720
There the kids are not working.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.280
In my next picture,
they will be.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.510
And they often sewed
garments or notion sequins,

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.830
feathers, all kinds of things.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.150
All the children and the
women, to support families.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.820
Okay, another one
with everybody sitting

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.160
around the table working.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.530
The National Child Labor
Committee described one woman

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.780
of the hundreds and
thousands who did this,

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.080
living in "a poverty-stricken
home

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.730
and making a pittance
for finishing pants."

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.200
Now child labor was common in
the late 1800's and early 1900's

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.450
and even after World War I, not
only among Italian immigrants.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:40.240
For poverty-stricken
families, this was a necessity.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.160
This picture shows a group --
I have many pictures outside

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.770
of New York in the book,
but here is one of them

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.160
in Mississippi in 1911.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.410
And the youngest worker
standing on the box,

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.130
you can see, is five years old.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.450
Okay. Nativists and even
many other Americans

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.750
who were less politically vocal
held four widespread stereotypes

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.870
about Italian Americans.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.770
They were Catholic,
which isn't a stereotype;

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.650
it was perceived as a problem.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:20.790
Sorry. Ignorant, criminals and
anarchists or labor agitators.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.990
Nativists were extremely
anti-Catholic

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.640
and they believed Americans
should be Protestant.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.310
Here's an example of an
altar in an Italian church.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.070
This is not Protestant.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:36.350
The idea of fests

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:43.750
and celebrating saints
was a little too exuberant

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.520
for many traditional Americans.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.560
In any case, nativists also
believed there was a papal plot

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.170
to take over the United States.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.570
And I can't show you all
the illustrations I have

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.590
of our cartoons showing the
pope about to devour Manhattan.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:04.490
But one of the things
they worried about was

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.260
that Catholic influence would
menace American traditions

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.160
such as public education
because many Catholics went

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.460
to Catholic schools.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.570
However, most Italian kids
actually went to public schools.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.880
I wish I could spend more
time on it, but you know,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.750
even as late as 1960,

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.170
John Kennedy was
considered possibly nonviable

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.070
as a president because
he was Catholic.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.610
So this was a persistent
stereotype

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.480
that covers more than Italians.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.270
Now the Italian organ-grinder,

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.770
which is entertainment
during the early decades

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.120
of mass immigration, became
a stereotype reflecting an

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.020
unsophisticated, even
base foreign culture.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.090
And the Italian accent when
speaking English was mocked.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.100
One example, in the
silent movie, The Italian,

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.780
which was produced by
an American company

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.970
that had absolutely no
involvement with Italians

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.520
or Italian Americans,
the dialogue appeared

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.420
to be a mashed-up English,
supposedly spoken by Italians.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.070
Not sure I can even
say this right.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.770
"I must geta dee milk
or my babe is die."

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.390
And that's the image that
many people had of us.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.190
Probably the most damaging
and persistent stereotype was

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.810
of southern Italians as violent.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.310
"The disposition to
assassinate in revenge

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.290
for a fancied wrong is a
marked trait of the character

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.020
of this impulsive
and inexorable race."

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.580
That's the Baltimore
News in the 1890's.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.560
We're not just talking
about fringe elements.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.590
We're talking about mainstream
press saying these things

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.270
about us.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.200
Okay. The strength
and pervasiveness

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.000
of criminal organizations
like the Black Hand

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.680
and the Mafia however,
were vastly exaggerated,

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.030
especially by the news media.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.530
Sensational stories
fed on public prejudice

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.750
at the same time
they reinforced it.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.690
They were more interesting I
think to sell copies of papers

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.680
than Vermini's Capital.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.960
You know, a painting
in the capital.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.020
These stereotypes were
exposed officially.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.000
In this cartoon,
rats -- see them --

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.460
representing different
countries leaves the shores

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.760
of the old world.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.060
The European leaders

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.570
on the shore are
delighted to see them go.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.200
The one in the foreground,
the very front in the middle,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:31.600
holds the infamous letter of the
Black Hand between his teeth.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.260
Soon, the Black Hand became
synonymous with crime,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.730
particularly Italian crime

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.940
and Italians were actually
treated as criminals.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.560
In March 1891, 11 Italians
in New Orleans accused

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.480
of murdering the local
police chief were lynched

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.430
after a jury had
acquitted them of a crime.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.620
Okay. The event led
to the suspension

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.680
of diplomatic relations between
Italy and the United States,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.680
the only time in history before
World War II that that happened.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.140
Lynching Italians was all too
frequent in the American south

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.140
in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.590
They hold the unenviable
record for the most lynchings

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.720
of any ethnic group
after African Americans.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.890
I can give you a lot
of other examples,

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.920
but not now with my time limit.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.040
Early Italian immigrants also
included political exiles

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.710
who had fought for Italian unity

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.730
and against monarchist
governments,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.670
and they were anarchists
and workers

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.780
who became a strong
voice in union organizing

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.790
and the American labor movement.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:37.210
Both were viewed as
disruptive and dangerous.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.340
This picture shows Joseph
Caruso, Joseph Ature,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.210
and Arturao Juvenicci who
were trade unionists arrested

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:48.220
on false charges for murdering
actually an Italian worker

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.880
protestor, Anilo Proso,
during the Lawrence,

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.650
Massachusetts textile
strike of 1912.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.320
Ature was one of the
promotors of the strike.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.710
According to a Chicago
newspaper,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.680
it was "chiefly the
result of his efforts

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.330
that 275,000 New England
textile mill workers are getting

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.820
better wages."

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.860
The mill owners had put Joe in
jail to get him out of the way.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.990
And the three were kept in
jail for several months even

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.290
after the strike ended.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.810
And again, when they
finally went

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.590
to trial, they were acquitted.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:21.870
So they weren't doing the things
they were being accused of,

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.360
partly for political reasons.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.220
In the early 20th century,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.380
agitation to restrict
immigration grew,

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.430
and some groups were thought
to be unassimilatable.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.840
By the time of World War I,
which the US entered in 1917,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.750
many Americans had come to
believe that if a person thought

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.640
of themselves as a German
American or Irish American

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.870
or obviously Italian
American instead of totally

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.710
as an American, he or she
would not be fully loyal

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.390
to the United States.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.020
Theodore Roosevelt said
that all true Americans,

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.500
no matter where they were born,
should believe in "the simple

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.870
and loyal motto,
America for Americans."

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:03.090
And the idea of 100% Americanism
left little room for immigrants

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.030
who could not adapt
quickly to American ways.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.420
I'm hoping you'll
see the parallel

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.850
in the things I'm quoting

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.750
without making a
big point about it.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.800
That's what amazed me

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.870
when I first started
doing this research.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.920
The same issues and
the same problems

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.660
and the same language
have been used for 250 --

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.770
even before we became
the United States.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:33.130
Benjamin Franklin complained
that the German immigrants --

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:36.940
this is 1752 -- were
ruining Pennsylvania

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.850
because they wouldn't
learn the English language

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.160
and they had their own schools.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.630
Anyway, there were many attempts
to restrict or halt immigration

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.210
from undesirable countries.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.450
Unfortunately, Italy was one of
them in the early 20th century.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:54.840
And the first significant
drive focused on passing a law

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.270
that could keep immigrants
who could not read or write

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.970
from entering the country.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.820
There, okay.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.470
Massachusetts Senator
Henry Cavetlage called

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:10.470
for a literacy test
as early as 1896.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.890
His quote, "The literacy test
will bear most heavily upon the

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.370
Italians, Russians, Poles,
Hungarians, Greeks and Asiatics

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:21.100
and very lightly or not at all
upon English-speaking immigrants

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.760
or German, Scandinavian
and French.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760
In other words, the
races most affected

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.230
by the literacy test are
those whose immigration

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.150
to this country has begun
within the last 20 years

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.150
and swelled rapidly to
enormous proportions,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:38.400
races who are most alien to
the great body of the people

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.210
of the United States."

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:45.140
Okay. I want to say
two things about this.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.430
One is that the literacy
test did not have

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.730
to be passed in English.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.370
It could be passed
in your own language.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:55.050
Two is that women did not
have to pass the literacy test

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.360
if they were accompanied
by a man.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.460
And in fact, if they
weren't accompanied by a man,

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.220
they were often sent back
for a lot of reasons.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.000
And the third thing is
that it didn't really work,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.570
because most immigrants who
were coming were literate,

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.520
even though some were from
southern and eastern Europe.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.660
Here is a part two.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:19.440
The literacy test, it's actually
against the literacy test.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.690
The American east -- and this
is what the caption reads.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.160
"The American east wall
as Congressman Burnett,"

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.290
one of the supporters,
"would build it."

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:33.200
Interesting that it's a
wall to keep -- you know.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.900
And this is the 1890's.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.410
To keep people out.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.480
The pens are weapons
pointing out.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.070
And the roof of the
wall are books.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:51.200
It is true that immigrants had
entered into the United States

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.150
in more or less unrestricted
numbers.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.890
Between 1905 and
1914, for example,

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.510
almost 9.9 million
European immigrants had come

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.230
to the United States, most from
southern and eastern Europe.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.190
So Congress sought to establish
a quota system limiting

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.310
immigration by country.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.930
In 1921, it passed the
Emergency Immigration Act,

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.340
setting the total
number of immigrants

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.920
from all countries
at 355,000 a year.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.320
And basing each country's
allotment

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.310
on a complicated formula which
reflected how many immigrants

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.210
of that country had
lived here in 1910.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.840
Okay. Nativists still
thought the quotas for eastern

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.400
and southern Europeans
were too high.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.440
They feared that jobs would
be taken away from Americans,

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.040
that communists, labor
agitators, other radicals

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.780
and criminals would
enter the United States

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.700
and too many immigrants
could not be assimilated

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.900
and would change the
character of the country.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.570
This is a quote, "The old
Americans are getting a little

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.170
panicky and no wonder.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:55.670
America, Americans

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.590
and Americanism are being
crowded out of America."

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:03.650
And this was from a reader to
the New Republican in 1924.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.640
Now Albert Johnson,
a congressman

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.290
from Washington State, led
the fight for tougher quotas.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:14.930
He said -- the quote above
is part of what he said.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:19.000
He said, "Today, instead of a
well-knit homogenous citizenry,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.630
we have a body politic
made up of all

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.430
and every diverse element.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.100
Our capacity to maintain our
cherished institutions stands

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.880
diluted by a stream
of alien blood.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.150
It is no wonder,"
remember, this is talking

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.330
about Italian Americans,
"therefore that the myth

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.850
of the melting pot
has been discredited.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.490
The day of [inaudible]
welcome to all peoples,

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.210
the day of indiscriminate
acceptance

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.750
of all races has
definitely ended."

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.740
When Congress passed the
Johnson-Reed Act in 1924,

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.080
it used the 1890 census for
the basis of quota elevations

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.290
because in 1890 there
had been more northern

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.430
and western European
immigrants and fewer southern

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.980
and eastern European immigrants
living in the United States.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.840
Congress and much of the
country wanted the United States

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.240
to return to its English roots.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.710
And that meant having immigrants
from Britain or western

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.140
and northern Europeans
be recorded in the census

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.620
as the largest group
in the population.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.940
Okay, the total number
of immigrants

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.970
from every country
was drastically cut

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:29.400
to 150,000 per year
with this quota act.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.370
The yearly quota for the United
Kingdom, which is England,

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:38.370
Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, was 65,721.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.570
After he 1920's,
the yearly quota

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:47.010
for Italians was 5,802 a year.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.590
Now Father Ezio is going to
talk to you about the internment

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.230
of Italians during World War II.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:57.690
But let me skip past that
just to say two things.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:59.680
One is that Italian
Americans served

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.130
in great numbers
in World War II.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.380
They had become Americans,
very patriotic Americans.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:11.720
And this picture shows women at
a flat-raising ceremony in 1942.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.540
As for the quota
system, in 1952,

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.370
the McCarron-Walter Act
changed the way quota numbers

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.670
were figured.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.040
And I know the details
can be boring,

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.700
but the important thing was
it kept the country quotas.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.950
And McCarron said, "We have

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.310
in the United States today
hardcore, indigestible blocks

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.580
which have not become integrated
into the American way of life

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.420
but which on the contrary
are its deadly enemies.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.930
Today, as never before, untold
millions are storming our gates

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.250
for admission and those gates
are cracking under the strain."

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.980
It wasn't actually until 1965

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.910
that Congress passed
the Hart-Seller Act,

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.190
and that eliminated
all national quotas

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.180
and it emphasized having
immigrants come here based

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.790
on family connections
to those already here

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.860
and having special skills.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.460
Okay. Finally, this
last picture is

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.330
of Lilian Claire,
my first grandchild.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.510
And this is an opportunity
to show her

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.030
to a large number of people.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.040
[ Laughter ]

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.970
She was born this
year on August 9th.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.300
Now I have a reason though.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.090
I started with photos of
my great-grandparents.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.560
Here is their descendant.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.250
Lily is the sixth generation

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.370
of my family story
in the United States.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:35.210
You see, despite the language
that demeaned Italian Americans

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.540
and the discriminatory
obstacles that were put

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.900
in their way, we did assimilate.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.470
We are Americans.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.710
I hope you will keep in mind the
experiences of Italian Americans

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.910
when thinking about
immigration today.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.510
Thank you.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:50:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.340
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Come
on up if you want.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.760
So I've been told a
rather technical way

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.080
of possibly helping with this,

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.330
is to shake this
podium a little bit.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:14.510
So let's see if it --

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.080
[ Applause ]

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.500
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
The magic touch.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.740
Thank you very much, Linda.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.730
I learned a lot from that too,
from the photographs, visually

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:29.830
and verbally, hearing about
and seeing your grandchild too.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:32.700
Isn't it scary when you think

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.160
about how history is repeating
itself, when she talked

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.020
about stereotyping immigration,
the wall, America for Americans?

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.820
So we have a task ahead of us.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.910
And so I now have
the great pleasure

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.140
of introducing our
second guest speaker.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:56.070
And he is somebody that we
have been looking forward

00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:04.180
to hearing from,
Padre Ezio Marchetto.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.170
He has been, as you know --

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.710
he's been the pastor
of Holy Rosary Church

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.040
for the last five years.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.290
And not only that, he's
taken on the arduous task

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.840
of a tremendous production

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.680
that is taking place
around Casa Italiana.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.120
As a matter of fact,
I think in addition

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.940
to his spiritual
responsibilities,

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:33.090
he chairs the Board of Casa
Italiana Sociocultural Center,

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.390
which is now involved

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:39.180
in large-scale redevelopment
in this area.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.830
Incidentally, it is going to
also include the establishment

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.440
of an Italian American museum.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.200
From what I understand
from Father Ezio,

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.020
it's going to be basically
Italian Americanism

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.900
in the greater Washington area.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.180
So it will have a specificity

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:02.200
which will give it even more
pleasure for the viewers.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.440
Padre Ezio is multilingual.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.860
He speaks Italian, Portuguese,
English and Canadian English.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.960
Probably speaks other
languages too.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.400
You know, I've always
thought when they say

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.250
that you are multilingual, like
he is, you speak many languages.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:24.670
And then when you're bilingual,
you speak two languages.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:29.510
And when you speak one
language, you're American.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.090
[ Laughter ]

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.040
But he's multilingual.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.970
He has of course as you know --

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.710
he studied in Italy,
Portugal and Canada.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.220
And he's a man who really
understand the media and how

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.090
to get a message across.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.380
He's a good communicator,
and that's very important.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.920
His experiences in
speaking, writing,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.760
participating have
certainly enhanced that.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:02.630
Well, I think particularly
pertinent today is his expertise

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.250
on global immigration.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:07.220
Global immigration.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.950
He served as an official
observer at the United Nations

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:15.700
on the issues of international
migration, something certainly

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.270
that we care about now.

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:23.510
So it's my honor and pleasure to
present Father Ezio Marchetto.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:45.590
[ Applause ]

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:46.890
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto:
Good evening, everyone.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.910
Thank you for the organizers
and all of you for being here.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:57.730
Let me start by saying what
my presentation is not.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:02.590
It's not an exhaustive
presentation on the internment

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.800
of Italian Americans,
for two reasons.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.920
First, very little
material is available.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.400
For those who are
interested, I have a page

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.230
and that's all the
resources that we have

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:18.530
about the internment
of Italian Americans.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.030
The user entry of
Wikipedia, about three books,

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:29.560
a few articles, one video
and one fiction book.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.860
That's all.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.760
So there is another
element which is many

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.100
of the information are a little
confusing for this reason.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:46.350
As you will see later on on
the numbers, one camp says

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:51.280
that Italian American
internees were 250.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.110
Another one says
they were over 1,000.

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.880
The reason is these
are a chapter

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.830
of Italian American history
which seems to be forgotten.

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:08.490
How many of you know that 55,000
Italian POW's were brought

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:14.380
to the United States
during World War II?

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.040
Thank you.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:21.540
55,000. That seems to be
one of those just forgotten,

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.780
"Let's not talk about
it" situations.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.010
But let's start with
our topic tonight.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.580
The title For Memory
[inaudible] is taken

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:34.420
from the diary of
Prospero Chaconi.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.910
That's the first
page of his book.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:42.980
It recalls all the different
moments of his truly statements

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.320
of the cross, the painful
journey through internment.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:52.060
Let's just start with
some basic facts.

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.010
Fact one, between 1876 and 1930,

00:55:56.010 --> 00:56:00.430
5 million Italians moved
to the United States.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:02.290
5 millions.

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:09.620
Fact two, in 1942,
beginning with the war,

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:18.720
there were 695,000 Italian
citizens present n the

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.020
United States.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:27.680
Three, during World War II,
more than half a million --

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.060
some numbers go up
to 1.5 million,

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.800
but there's not a
complete list --

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.500
but over half a million Italian
Americans were in the Army.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.750
Now remember, the whole
army was about 12 million.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:48.650
So about half a million and over
was quite a remarkable number.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.650
Number four, during the war,

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:55.330
no person of Italian descent
was ever charged with,

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:59.510
much less convicted
of, espionage, sabotage

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.870
or any other hostile action.

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:04.960
These are facts.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:12.020
Finally, fact one, the
executive order 9066 called

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.460
for compulsory relocation
of more

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.980
than 10,000 Italian Americans.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.030
And at the same time,
restricted movement of more

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:27.210
than 600,000 Italian
Americans nationwide.

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:32.670
So let's take a look now at what
happened, how they went there.

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:36.580
In the beginning, there was a
lot of admiration for Mussolini.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.230
Here we have two
quotes from Roosevelt.

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:42.980
"I am interested
and deeply impressed

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:47.990
by what he has accomplished by
his evidenced, honest purpose

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.160
in restoring Italy and seeking

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.040
to prevent general
European trouble."

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.550
He made the covers
of Newsweek and Time.

00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:01.200
A few weeks later, "I don't
mind telling you in confidence,

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.810
I am keeping in fairly
close touch

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:08.460
with the admirable
Italian gentleman."

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.920
[ Laughter ]

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.920
It was a time when Italian
Americans start to succeed,

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.840
to be recognized,
to reach the level

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.590
when a community
becomes noticeable.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:31.160
And as always, politics is a
great indicator of the position

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.220
in society of a specific
ethnic group.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.570
It was a time when
Congressman Feralo Laguardia,

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:42.280
Victor Mark Antonio, Mayor
Frank Orizio, Joseph Felioto,

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.300
[inaudible] Marciano,
Jody Margo --

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.220
this was the time
when they start to be

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.090
in the news in a positive way.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.440
At the same time, trouble
was brewing in Europe.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.860
Roma-Berlin Axis became a
military alliance in 1939.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.520
Their pact was sealed and
they were the three powers,

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.810
Germany, Italy, Japan.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:19.230
War. A date which will live
in infamy, December 7th, 1941.

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:21.890
And that's when everything
fell apart.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:28.680
What is interesting is that
on the night of December 7th,

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.430
right after Pearl Harbor,

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:36.830
and before US declared
officially war to Italy,

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.910
the FBI arrested a
handful of Italians.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:42.570
You see the map, and
you see the date.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.070
The Sanborn Nine.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:53.950
They had a list of
suspected dangerous aliens.

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.550
December 11th, the
official declaration of war,

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.260
Germany declared war
on the United States

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:09.710
and immediately the US president
Roosevelt announced America was

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:14.260
at war with Japan
and the alliance.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:18.720
So Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini made this declaration

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.020
from [inaudible] Rome,

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:26.040
the powers of the pact
were determined to win.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.560
And of course we have
the message of Congress,

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.420
requesting a recognition
of state of war

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.540
with Germany and Italy.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.230
There had never been a greater
challenge to life, liberty,

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:40.870
civilization than that
created by the Axis Powers,

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.700
Germany, Italy and Japan.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.380
It was determined therefore
to have the forces of justice

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.410
and righteousness
prevail over the forces

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:53.900
of savagery and barbarism.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:58.420
So all of a sudden, all the
immigrants from Germany,

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:03.990
Italy and Japan found themselves
as at war with their homeland.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.350
Again, as I mentioned before,

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.490
the enemy aliens were
taken into custody.

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:17.880
Less than two weeks later,
General DeWitt commanded

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.570
that all aliens under 14 years

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.450
of age be removed
to the interior.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:27.190
This had a great effect
especially in California.

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.550
They were expecting Japan

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:32.480
to attack the United
States from the west coast.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.560
So they insisted to move
inland all the enemy aliens.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.870
Then in 1942 the status of enemy
alien was extended to all aliens

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:50.460
of Italian descent,
which is over 600,000.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:54.840
These individuals were
required to register

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.470
and reregister to
the post office.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:03.510
There are four dates that
are the turning points.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:06.960
Of course, December
7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.910
January 25th, 1942, immediately

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.210
after Pearl Harbor the
Rabas Commission was trying

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:16.710
to figure out what went wrong.

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.010
And some of the suggestions

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:20.980
that came back were
there were fifth columns

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.780
within the United States.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:30.790
And January 29th, 1942, we have
the first enemy alien relocation

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.090
that was issued.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:37.660
Then the executive order 9066.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.890
So all people were excluded
from specific areas.

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:46.090
This is the notice
to alien enemies.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:53.610
About 4 million aliens,
which means citizens

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:58.240
who kept their Italian,
Japanese or German citizenship.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.600
So after Pearl Harbor --

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.290
I'm sorry, those were the
immigrants at the time.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:09.460
About 1.1 million of these
immigrants were still citizens

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.880
of Germany, Italy and Japan

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.160
and automatically
became enemy aliens.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.150
And that's the notice that
went around the country,

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:24.650
both in English, Japanese,
Italian and German,

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:30.580
telling them they must register
and move out of specific areas.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.820
So here we have about 122,000
men and women and children

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.630
of Japanese ancestry were
evicted from the west coast

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.040
of the United States and held
in American concentration camps,

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.420
the internment camps
if you want.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.720
Americans with Italian

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.760
and German ancestry were also
targeted by these restrictions,

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.460
including internment of 11,000
people of German ancestry,

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.110
and about 3,000 people
with Italian ancestry.

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.450
Along with some Jewish refugees,

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.430
because they were
coming from Germany.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.080
The major internment sites for
Italian Americans were Port

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.580
of George, Maryland; [inaudible]
in Oklahoma for some years,

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.650
in Texas and Tennessee.

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:25.670
The largest number were
at Fort Visola in Montana.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:27.940
And here's where the
numbers get confused.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.530
Because a large number

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:33.320
of the Italian POW's
were also at that camp.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.230
So the numbers go from, you
will see later one of the signs

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:42.480
that there were over 1,000
Italian Americans interned,

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.220
but that's not really true.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:50.330
It was the mixing of Italian
POW's and Italian Americans.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.510
So --

01:04:52.510 --> 01:05:19.070
[ Speaking Italian ]

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:22.280
You have the three languages,
Japanese, Italian and German.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:29.530
This is a copy of
one of those cards.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:33.950
What was also very sad is this:

besides to carry all the time
your identification card,

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.050
there were travel restrictions.

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:45.210
You cannot travel
more than five miles.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:49.340
They were required to hand
over all the contraband,

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.640
which means cameras, weapons,
flashlights that can be used

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.490
to signal across the ocean.

This was a very sad time.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.270
There was an instance
on the west coast,

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.600
a number of people
committed suicide.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.090
One man went to the barn

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:16.590
and asked his friend
to please shoot him.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.910
Because his friend
refused, he walked out

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:22.220
and threw himself under a train.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.040
Because he had his family
there and grew up there,

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.200
he felt he was American.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.500
He felt betrayed.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.330
All the Italian schools
were closed,

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.960

Don't speak the enemy language.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.150
Ultimately, about 600,000
Americans were arrested.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.810
250,000 were interned.

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:07.390
Once you are arrested, you
have the right to go in front

Also, you have to remember this:
enemy alien prohibited areas.

The fact that you could not go

down to visit his
son's restaurant

01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:22.200
because it was outside the
area he was allowed to travel.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:29.630
[Inaudible] that 52,000 Italian
aliens cannot leave their homes

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:33.250
between 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:38.270
So all those who
work in bakeries,

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:41.820
they just lost their job.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.040
There were about 1,400
Italian American fishermen

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.410
in San Francisco and
again, they cannot set foot

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:58.430
on their waterfront after
February 24th, 1942.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:04.260
And this was the crazy part: the
fishing industry was considered

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:09.080
to be a national priority.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.200
Seafood was providing
food for the nation.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.580
And here we have 90%

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:21.760
of San Francisco being either
sequestered by the Coast Guard

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.340
or left idle because people
cannot access the waterfront.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:31.410
Even one of the newspapers
said, "Fishermen with 23 sons

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:37.120
in the Army and Navy are bound
to wharf while boat lies idle,

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.470
and the seafood is needed."

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:42.100
I mean, it was so evident.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:48.400
Yet months would pass before
the restrictions were rescinded.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.680
This is just one example
of how confusion happens.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:00.790
From 1841-44, [inaudible] as
a detention center for more

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:04.450
than 1,000 Italians,
more than 1,000 Japanese

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.110
and 22 German nationalists.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:11.130
The Italians were the fair
workers and civilian seamen,

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:16.220
who were bounded at the outbreak
of the war against the Japanese.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:23.540
So about 250 Italian Americans
were put in internment camps,

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:28.500
but the biggest was the
curfew and the restrictions.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:36.610
Then they started to realize
the Italians were not really

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.680
so great enemies.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.150
And the reason was so many
families had their sons

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.530
in the Army.

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:49.060
Over a million, or as some
numbers put it, over a million.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.470
So try to backtrack.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:56.160
And in July 1942,
President Roosevelt started

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.520
to consider some
form of restitution,

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.320
the lifting of restrictions.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.730
And they even said, "Well,

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:08.960
we're going to pay you $20
unemployment for each week

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.320
that you were out of your job."

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.010
Of the more than 2,500
Italian American detainees,

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:17.240
about 300 took the offer.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.460
For them it was a
slap in the face.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:26.860
So on Columbus Day,
October 12th, 1942,

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:32.870
the attorney general Francis
Biddell, here with Laguardia

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:35.670
in New York, signed
the document.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:40.430
The Italian nationals in the
US will no longer be classified

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.680
as enemies.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:50.450
It was just a move to help
support the war effort.

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:53.710
Then we have this, Mr.
Speaker arrives today

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:57.270
to introduce a bill that will
cause the president on behalf

01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:00.490
of the United States government
to formally acknowledge

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.000
that the civil liberties

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.380
of Italian Americans were
violated during World War II.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:11.490
Congressman Rick Lasio and Eliot
Angle together introduce this.

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:20.070
So it finally became a
public law number 106-451.

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:23.060
It passed the Congress, 1997.

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:28.550
And these are what the
commission that was formed

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:33.630
with that law tried to achieve.

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:37.540
One, to formally acknowledge
the violation of civil liberties

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.130
of Italian Americans
in World War II.

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:44.960
Two, to encourage a federal
agency to support projects

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.980
that will heighten
public awareness

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.390
of this forgotten episode.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.680
Three, to provide
direct national support

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.670
for a documentary film.

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.210
Four, formation of
advisory committee

01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.510
to assist the collection

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:02.110
of relevant information
regarding the matter

01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:05.000
as it relates to
public policy matters.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.070
Finally, to publish a
report regarding the role

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:10.050
of the government
of the United States

01:13:10.050 --> 01:13:12.780
on this unfortunate occurrence.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:17.940
It was passed in the
year 2000, October 24th

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.020
with the Senate's amendments.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:24.640
So on November 7th, 2000,

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.030
the US Congress passed
the Wartime Violation

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.640
of Italian American
Civil Liberties Act,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:37.300
and those are the
groups that came

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:43.490
into this US Congress statement.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.860
Why isn't this such
an easy topic

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.210
in Italian American history?

01:13:55.210 --> 01:14:02.280
I'm not a psychologist,
but I believe the reason is

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.650
for Italian Americans, there
was some kind of mixed feeling.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.950
In one sense they felt
betrayed, especially those

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:14.450
who were detained, or those
who had their boats confiscated

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.240
or they lost their jobs,

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.970
families that were separated
while their sons were at war.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.840
At the same time, they
were still living here.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.390
They wanted to be
Italian Americans.

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:29.460
They wanted to be Americans.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.230
So for many of the
older people, they said,

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:33.530
"Let's not talk about it.

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:34.830
The past is gone.

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.580
Italy was at war.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.240
They are not saying
it was our fault."

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.830
But they have mixed feelings.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:43.030
Guilty in one sense
because Italy declared war

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.020
on the United States,
betrayal in the other

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.710
because they felt not recognized
for who they truly were.

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:58.570
Not one single person was
ever convicted or accused

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:03.700
of any anti-American action.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:09.350
So it was one of those
things that is gone, is past;

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.610
let's not talk about it.

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:14.000
But personally, I
believe it's part

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.490
of our Italian American history.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:20.410
So I hope tonight not to
give you all the answers,

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.870
but just to awaken
your curiosity.

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:26.580
And these copies
of the bibliography

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.970
or the resources are available.

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.630
It will be a great topic
for any dissertation

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:35.080
that I hope one day someone
will take the time to do.

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.430
Thank you very much.

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:38.510
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Thank you.

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:44.040
[ Applause ]

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.160
I think it's a very
good point, Father Ezio,

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.630
that somebody could
take this topic on

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.000
and do all kinds
of things with it.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.270
A dissertation, a lengthy
essay; there's so much

01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:59.050
that can be done with it.

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:04.810
I do want to point
out that in 2010,

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:11.170
the California legislature
passed a resolution apologizing

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.290
for the United States'
mistreatment

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:19.720
of Italian residents in
the state during the war.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.980
Noting restrictions
and indignities as well

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.380
as loss of jobs and housing.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.080
I guess California because
they were the most affected

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.330
by these indignities
and these crimes.

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.980
And then a member
of Congress now --

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:41.530
in fact, I served with her --
Zoe Loftgren from California,

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.620
she has presented legislation.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.920
She couldn't be here tonight

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.600
because of course,
they're campaigning.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.730
Every two years is ridiculous.

01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:55.120
But the Senate wouldn't change
it to make it four years,

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.160
of course, because
they have six years

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.060
and might have competition.

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:02.390
But Zoe Loftgren in
the 115th Congress

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:06.170
which we still have going on
now, introduced two pieces

01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:14.670
of pertinent legislation, and
they are HR-1706 and 1707.

01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:18.010
Pretty reminiscent of
what we had discussed.

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:22.910
1706 would authorize the
secretary of education

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:27.500
to provide grants for education
programs on the history

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:33.330
of the treatment of Italian
Americans during World War II.

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:41.180
HR-1707 would ask for an
apology for the treatment

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.040
of Italian Americans
during World War II.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.340
I have copies.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.270
Her office sent copies
of those two bills

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:52.120
if anybody would
like to look at them.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.500
And so now, ladies and
gentlemen, I'd like to open it

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.470
up to questions you may have.

01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:00.290
I think I'd like to
maybe just start off

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:05.920
and ask our two presenters if
they would like to ask questions

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.770
of each other, or make
any final comments.

01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:12.070
Linda, do you want
to mention anything,

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:14.430
or wait for the questions?

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:15.850
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: Only

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:19.970
that Italian internment
during World War II is

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:23.490
in our book, so we
didn't miss it.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.990
There's a whole page on it.

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:28.630
And it was not something
that I had any idea

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:32.870
about until I had
researched this book.

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.170
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
Which shows the need

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:35.470
for a forum like this.

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:36.770
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: Yes.

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.740
And I thought your
presentation was wonderful.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.600
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Any
comments you'd like to make?

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.900
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto: Yeah,
I've been in North America

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.840
for about 30 years,
even though most

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.800
of my time was spent in Canada.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:51.010
But it also amazes me how
little history is known.

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.910
A while ago I was talking

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:56.780
to some people about
Sacrament City.

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.430
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: I
was thinking of them, yeah.

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.420
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto: I
mean, such an integral part

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:11.030
of so many topics from
unionizing to the freedom,

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:15.240
but very few people new
about Sacrament City.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:23.600
So we have to know more about
how history, all aspects,

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.760
the good ones and the
negative ones, because that's

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.930
in this balance that we
keep growing, learning

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:33.710
and avoiding hopefully
similar mistakes.

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.010
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Very true.

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:36.450
Okay, folks.

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:39.130
You came, you listened,
let's hear from you.

01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:40.430
And you know what
we're going to do.

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:45.540
Because this is being taped,
I'm going to ask one of us

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.170
to repeat your question.

01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:50.640
&gt;&gt; My question is this.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.500
My parents were born here,
but their parents weren't,

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.930
and obviously my
great-grandparents weren't.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:03.010
But I remember my father
relating to us as we got older

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:07.200
that his grandmother
lived in this country.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:13.410
And she had a photograph
of Mussolini in the home,

01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:15.240
and it was a real
point of contention

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.400
between my father
and his grandmother.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.210
And my question is,
how common was that?

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:25.550
How common was it
for the Italians

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:28.630
who were here from
the old country?

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.080
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto: So the
question is, how often was it

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.980
that in some families you
still even today find a picture

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.560
of Mussolini with
a little candle

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.360
in front or a little light?

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.660
Why is that?

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:45.890
The reason is this: when
Mussolini took over, took power,

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:52.660
he felt that Italians should
show themselves as coming

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:57.040
from a great country
and a great race.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.190
Mussolini did a number of
very good things for Italy.

01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:04.130
For example, almost all nations
where [inaudible] was present,

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:07.890
they would establish
Casa Italiana.

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:11.170
It would be the cultural center
for the Italian community.

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:14.910
It was so powerful
that in Montreal,

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.940
in one of the churches,
the Madonna [inaudible],

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:27.780
there is in the ceiling a
fresco of Mussolini on a horse

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.540
with all the [inaudible].

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:32.200
It's still there.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.330
So in a couple of the churches.

01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:39.800
So people felt that
Mussolini was helping them,

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.240
supporting them, providing
them and brought back Italy.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.130
It was a period where the
mafia controlled Italy

01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:51.620
across the ocean,
came with [inaudible].

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.670
So there were many
things that were

01:21:55.670 --> 01:22:02.410
to represent the Italians abroad
as coming from a great country.

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:05.280
So people admired
Mussolini for that.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.520
And that's why especially older
generations will still keep

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.430
that picture of Mussolini,
because of that period.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.450
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne:
Not only Italians

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:21.760
or Italian Americans thought
Mussolini was good for Italy.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.930
You pointed out Roosevelt
had flattering things to say.

01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:29.970
If you look at periodicals
and newspapers from the 1920's

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:34.540
and the early 1930's, full
of praise for bringing order,

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.870
for bringing prestige and pride.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.980
One of the big turning
points in the world was

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:47.900
when Italy invaded Ethiopia
and used poison gas.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.420
Then people began to question.

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.480
But for at least 15 years, he
was considered a positive force

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.550
for most of this country.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:00.920
A symbol, yeah.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.890
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
One, two, yes.

01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:06.150
You may want to also
mention your name.

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:09.580
&gt;&gt; Yes, my name is
Mary Ann Guantano.

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.880
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Excellent.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:20.980
&gt;&gt; My father was one of
those 55,000 prisoners of war

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:32.240
who spent time in this
country during World War II.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.130
And my mother and
grandmother came

01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:40.850
through Ellis Island in 1920.

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:47.780
So I'm a first-generation
American Italian,

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:51.630
and probably a dual
citizen of Italy as well.

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:56.780
My question though
regards the social clubs

01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.470
that you spoke about, Father.

01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:01.060
My sense was that
some of them came

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:05.990
about because Italian
Americans wanted

01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:10.880
to prove their loyalty
to the United States.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.000
Or maybe that's the way
they evolved after the war.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.500
Can you speak about that at all?

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:26.830
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Repeat
the question as best you can.

01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:31.020
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto:
Let's see, the social clubs

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:35.490
that were formed before
and after the war.

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:39.940
How do they react to
that transition period?

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.570
When the war started, they
were looked with suspicion

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:46.660
because they were financed
by the Fascist government.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.570
They sent money and
material for them.

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:53.010
There is a book, Fascist
Activities in the United States.

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:55.690
I think it was Lagumina
the author.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:58.330
You can find it.

01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.440
Just put the title Fascist
Activities in the United States,

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.770
in Italian communities.

01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:09.080
So as the war started,
all those were dissolved.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.310
After the war, there
were especially groups

01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:15.150
of Italian Americans, veterans.

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:19.390
Even here in this city
there was a very active one

01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:21.220
for a number of years.

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:24.950
So that's how the
Italian American clubs

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:29.440
and society started again,
with the veterans first.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.900
Then immediately after
the war, groups had formed

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.200
to help Italy, rebuild Italy.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.330
So they were sending everything
from clothing to medicine

01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:39.530
to whatever was needed.

01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:42.460
So that's how everything
started again.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:48.270
So that's how I see it
as one of the motivations

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:53.180
for starting again the
Italian American clubs.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.480
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
Okay, very good.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.780
Excellent.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:00.480
All right, any other comments
or questions that you may have?

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.780
Yes?

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.080
&gt;&gt; Will Amatruda.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.490
With regard to the sympathy
that some Italian Americans had

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:08.560
for Mussolini before World
War II, during the time

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.000
when that legislation went
through and during their time

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.680
in Congress, there
was an exhibit in --

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.780
I don't remember whether it
was in the capital or in one

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.080
of the House and
Senate office buildings.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.380
But there was an exhibit called
[Italian name], A Secret Story.

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.680
And as I was going through it,

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.980
I noticed that it included a
publication of the Grand Lodge

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.280
of California of the
order Sons of Italy.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.580
And it was in Italian
which I can read.

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.880
And it was from 1938.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.180
And it had a reference to
Mussolini which described him

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.770
as -- and I translate -- second
only to the man of Nazareth.

01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.050
[ Laughter ]

01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:37.090
Now as a commentary about
the idiocy of the scare

01:26:37.090 --> 01:26:42.610
about Italian American
disloyalty after Pearl Harbor,

01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:51.640
the opera singer, later the star
of South Pacific, Ezio Pinza was

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.940
in the process of applying
for American citizenship.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.120
And he was within four months

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.350
of the five-year
residency to get it.

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:10.470
Well, he was interned, and the
rationale was that when he sang

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:15.920
at the Metropolitan Opera,
he could modulate his voice

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.030
to send signals to submarines.

01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:21.040
[ Laughter ]

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.030
Well, since a lot of important

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:27.400
and wealthy people were
opera fans, they went to bat

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.120
for him and he was released.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.540
So it helps to have
influential friends.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.840
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto:

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.180
I think your voice is loud
enough that they heard.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:43.870
Thank you for mentioning
that book, A Secret Story.

01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:45.450
Now it used to be an exhibit.

01:27:45.450 --> 01:27:49.130
It was published as a book,
several different books.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.690
I have here the list of
the three books published

01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:57.800
about the internment, and
you're free to take copies.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.690
The video is quite good as well
because it gives all the images.

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:05.280
So A Secret Story started as
an exhibit that we brought

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.670
to back some interest in
what was done in Congress.

01:28:09.670 --> 01:28:14.550
As one of the consequences
of that exhibit,

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:18.550
it now has been published in a
book titled La Story Secreta.

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:22.710
The book is branded,
a similar book.

01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:25.470
So those are the books that I
would suggest for whoever wants

01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:28.920
to get a little more
information about this period

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.650
of Italian American history.

01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:32.950
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: I should point

01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:35.840
out that there was an
anti-Mussolini press

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.270
that dated back before
Mussolini.

01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:43.250
There was a very active,
vibrant left-wing communist,

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.760
socialist, Italian-based press.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.880
It wasn't just against
Mussolini.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.220
It was against our
participation in World War I.

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.880
It was against our
participation in World War II.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.450
And again, I told
you the stereotype

01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:03.590
of the anarchist
was very strong.

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:09.740
And so was the presence
of these publications.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:13.140
During World War
II, both fascist

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.490
and leftist publications were
censored in various ways.

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.810
For example, they couldn't
be sent through the mail.

01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:20.720
But it wasn't uniformly that.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.680
And we have several pages
in the book on the vigor

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.100
of the leftist Italian
American press.

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.030
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: That
was a fascinating story

01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:37.960
about Ezio Pinza and how people
appreciating his music got him

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.590
out of the possibility
of internment.

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:44.680
&gt;&gt; One more question, please.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.690
In the mid-1800's, a lot

01:29:46.690 --> 01:29:49.180
of Irish families came
to the United States.

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:52.070
And many of the women tried
to get jobs and they couldn't,

01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:54.280
and they ended up
being prostitutes.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:30:00.670
Did that happen with the
Italian immigration that came?

01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:02.340
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne:
Interesting question.

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:06.590
Were Italian American women
who immigrated here forced

01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:08.180
to become prostitutes?

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.620
Or was that widespread?

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:15.610
Actually, as opposed to the
Irish, Italian American men came

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:20.040
in much larger numbers
than the women did.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:25.390
And if they did come,
they were often wives

01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:28.410
and were parts of families.

01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:33.930
So I don't know of any
widespread Italian prostitution,

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.580
simply because the numbers
were so overwhelmingly

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.360
in favor of men coming here.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.290
Italians also went
back and forth more

01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:46.160
than other immigrant groups,
called birds of passage.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.000
They came here and went back
and forth maybe within the year,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.810
but they also came
for several years

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:52.110
and then went back to Italy.

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:53.820
They didn't always bring
over their families.

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.140
So I don't think we need to
worry about that as a problem.

01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.400
But it reflects the
particular nature

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.230
of Italian immigration
in the period.

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:06.870
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto: If
you want to get more information

01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:11.010
about that period when Irish
and then the Italians came in,

01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:13.760
read the Five Points, the book

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.460
about the Five Points
in New York.

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.700
And it tells you from
when it was mainly Irish

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:22.820
to slowly Italian
to majority Italian.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.710
It will explain the
work of the children,

01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.530
work of women, work of men.

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:29.140
That's a very good book.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.630
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
Very interesting.

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:36.030
&gt;&gt; Linda, I'm the Italian
wannabe that Diana spoke about.

01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:38.040
[ Laughter ]

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.440
But my background is German
Jewish, and my dad wrote a book

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.090
on Jewish immigration
into Baltimore.

01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:48.930
And my father is not a scholar,
but he did a lot of research.

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:51.470
And there was not a
point that you made

01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:54.220
that was not almost identical.

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:57.810
And so you know, if you talk
about immigration, you can look

01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:00.760
at it now, same thing
that's going on.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.880
But immigration is
the large issue,

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.010
not actually the nationality.

01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:11.410
And it's a longstanding
history into the United States

01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:14.990
of immigrants and the path

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:19.050
to not only citizenship,
but to assimilation.

01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:20.350
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: Right.

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.160
You mentioned that your
family has a Jewish background

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.550
and they experiences some of
the same things I talked about.

01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:29.590
And that's absolutely true.

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:33.760
I in fact often in the
talk, I hope, said eastern

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.790
and southern Europeans.

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:39.310
For various political
reasons back home

01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:42.560
and economic reasons
back home, after 1870,

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.770
a lot of southern Italians came.

01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:47.130
A lot of Jewish people came,

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:51.390
a lot of eastern European Slavic
people came who were Christians.

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:54.450
They were all bunched
together as undesirable

01:32:54.450 --> 01:32:57.560
for the same reasons
Italian Americas were:

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.990
they didn't speak English.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:03.090
They were poor when they came
here, the dressed differently,

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:05.700
they tend to live in their
own neighborhoods and so on.

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.980
But yes, the whole
story involves --

01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.190
and I had isolated for this
group to be Italian Americans.

01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:15.680
But yes, it was.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.670
I grew up on Long Island where
lots of Italian Americans,

01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:22.570
lots of Jewish Americans,

01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:25.110
and our experiences
seem almost identical.

01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:27.860
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: It's kind
of hierarchical too, isn't it?

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:32.850
I mean, whoever's on top doesn't
want the next one to rise.

01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.170
And you're always going
to have a lower spot.

01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:37.190
We could look now
in our country,

01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:40.310
those who are most
discriminated against.

01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:43.480
We had a question here, yes?

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.780
&gt;&gt; Hi. Angela Fricci.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.800
So I'm thinking about the wave
of immigration on the later end,

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.100
the late 1950's, early 1960's.

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.530
Firstly, on my mother's side,

01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:58.020
my great-grandparents
came from Ellis Island.

01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:01.370
My father came in
the late 1950's.

01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:03.600
So I guess the question is,
thinking about that later wave

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.030
of immigration, and if you
could comment on the impact

01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:10.860
of World War II on how that wave
of immigration was perceived.

01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:14.770
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: Not an
expert on all immigration,

01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:21.280
but how did World War II have
an impact on later immigration?

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.240
As I mentioned, in 1952,

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.400
there was another immigration
law passed, the McCarron law.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.830
And it did not take
away national quotas.

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:35.810
So it talked about trying
to reunite families here.

01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:37.110
No, no, sorry.

01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:39.870
It did not take away the quotas.

01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.230
They still remained low.

01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:44.870
People found ways to come
here outside the quota system.

01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:49.860
We began to take refugees,
although actually unfortunately,

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:52.280
very few after World War II.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:58.010
But those would mostly
have been Jewish refugees.

01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:02.720
I don't think the same
psychological obstacles were

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.890
there towards people coming.

01:35:05.890 --> 01:35:10.640
But the rules were
there until 1965.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:16.280
And that's when they
abandoned the quota system.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.400
And I know people who
came in that period,

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:22.060
too often they were -- for
one thing they were often not

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:25.630
poverty-stricken from the
19th century with no hope.

01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:29.380
In Italy they were
educated, they were skilled.

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.870
And they could fly here.

01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:34.550
It was just a very,

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:37.250
very different group
of people applying.

01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:40.800
But in terms of the numbers,
the actual numbers, I'm not sure

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.800
that there was an enormous
difference until after '65.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.360
I'm not sure though.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.660
Good question.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:52.860
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Do we have
any other comments or questions?

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:56.510
How about a comment about
how great the panel was?

01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:59.050
[ Applause ]

01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:01.510
They really were.

01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:04.040
[ Applause ]

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.720
Diana, do you have
any final comments?

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.030
&gt;&gt; Diana Femia: My final
comment is thank you.

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:10.820
Thank you to Grant and Lucia,

01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.050
and thank you to
the great panel.

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.640
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: And
the audience who's great too.

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.510
And our timing was perfect.

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:18.810
Thank you.

01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:20.110
&gt;&gt; Father Ezio Marchetto: So
gain, if anybody is interested

01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:23.830
in a bibliography or a list
of sources, it's there.

01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:25.130
Thank you.

01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:26.430
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: And I
will make one more pitch.

01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:28.890
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella:
Yep, this is your chance.

01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:30.560
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: This
is my young adult book.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.860
This Land is Our Land.

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:35.950
It was published in 2016 as
the campaign was going on.

01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:38.430
It has done very well,
probably because of that.

01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:41.650
It is, and I'm told by my
editors and other people,

01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:43.630
considering that I
have a point of view,

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:46.700
it's a fairly unbiased
look at immigration

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:49.360
from all parts of the world.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.660
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: Fantastic.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.190
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: So thank you.

01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:54.610
&gt;&gt; Constance Morella: How long
did you have to work on it?

01:36:54.610 --> 01:36:56.090
How long was it in the making?

01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:58.230
&gt;&gt; Linda Osborne: A
little over a year,

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:00.390
and you know, this is amazing.

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:02.820
It was supposed to come
out a season early.
