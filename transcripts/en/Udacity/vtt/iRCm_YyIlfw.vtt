00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.460
Now, I'm going to ask you a question. Given this

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.630
very simple, implementation of the barrier decrementing count and count

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.610
becoming zero resetting it to N by the last

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.230
processor and all the other guys waiting on the count

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
not being not yet being zero, do you see

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.960
any problem with this algorithm? And this is an open-ended

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.440
question. So I want you to think about it

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.330
and see, could this lead to any raise condition. And,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.010
and I mentioned to you when we talked about

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.670
mutual exclusion algorithm itself that raise conditions are the bane

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.229
of parallel programming. So, when

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.780
you're implementing synchronization algorithms you

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.699
better be absolutely certain that there are no raise conditions.
