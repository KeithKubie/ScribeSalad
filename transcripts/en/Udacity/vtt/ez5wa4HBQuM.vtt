00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
Before we talk about the abstractions in

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.760
an operating system for managing the processor and

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.160
memory, I want to throw another fun quiz at

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.670
you. Now in this quiz, I'm going to ask

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.129
you the following question. The computer, regardless of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.990
which platform you're using, seemingly runs several programs

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.060
in parallel. You may have an email program

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.080
running, a browser you may have music playing,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.930
maybe you're watching a video clip and so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.090
on, but supposed it is, only one CPU inside.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.830
Let's assume, that your computer system has exactly

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.610
one CPU inside. How is it possible that it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.040
is running several programs in parallel? I'm going to

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.580
give you multiple choices. The first choice is, even

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.590
though there is only one CPU, there are

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.410
multiple cores within the CPU, and there's one core

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.100
for each of the applications that you're running,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.550
and that's how we're able to run multiple applications

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.110
in parallel. So that's your first choice. The second

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.422
choice is, I'm trying to trick you, that this

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:07.680
is a trick question, actually there's only one

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.700
app that is running at a time and the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.910
premise of the question itself is wrong. So that's

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.500
your second choice. The third choice says that there's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.030
only one CPU, there are multiple applications,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.300
but these applications share the CPU through

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.425
the operating system so that for different

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.680
time units, different applications are running on

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.355
the CPU. So, for instance, in time unit t1 application one is running, time unit

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:42.040
t2 application two is running, and so on. And this is what is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.845
making it appear as though there are several programs running on the CPU

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:52.550
simultaneously. What is going on is that the operating system is multiplexing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.530
the CPU among these applications. So these are the choices I'm giving you,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.500
and I want you to pick what you think is the right choice.
