00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:16.377
Nameste.

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:17.562
I'm from India,

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.752
and India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.276
It has contributed to the world

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:25.456
concepts such as yoga,

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:26.657
ayurveda,

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:30.225
spicy chicken tikka,

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.157
and Vedic math.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.005
Vedic math is one of the world's easiest

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.501
and simplest way to do math.

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.852
We are going to combine together

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:41.011
and do some number crunching today.

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.838
So what we are going to first do is multiply by 11.

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:46.564
We're going to do it together,

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.911
so if you blink, you're going to miss it.

00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:51.777
So just watch it, OK.

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:54.960
So we're going to do 32 times 11, OK.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.021
So we split 3, and we split 2,

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.823
and we add 3 and 2 and paste it on top,

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:03.848
and we get the answer as 352.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.296
That's it.

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:12.573
Let's try another sum.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.896
45 times 11.

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:16.358
Let's hear it.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:20.576
Exactly, that's 495.

00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:23.943
And 75 times 11.

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:28.182
So it gives you 7,125,

00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:33.364
1 gets carried over and it becomes 825.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.288
That's how simple it is.

00:01:38.288 --> 00:01:41.191
OK, this is the principle behind it

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.928
where a is the coefficient.

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:47.701
Let's move on.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:54.712
OK, now what we're going to do is the base method.

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:57.586
OK, this is used to multiply numbers

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:59.671
very close to the powers of 10,

00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.554
like 10, 100, 1,000, and so on.

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.491
So we have a sum here, say 99 times 97.

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:12.098
OK, now tell me, is 99 more than 100 or less than 100?

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.231
Less by how much?

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:18.377
So we write minus 01.

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:22.059
And 97 is less than 100 by how much?

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.862
So we write minus 03.

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:25.613
So what we're going to do is

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:27.265
we're going to cross subtract

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:31.026
and get the first part of the answer, like this.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.934
We're going to do cross subtraction.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.819
97 minus 01 would give us

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.834
96.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:42.233
and we multiply 03 times 01 vertically,

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:46.382
and we get an answer of 03.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:47.522
Let's check another sum.

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.891
Try and do it yourselves.

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.056
We got 98, which is,

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.526
is it more than a 100, less than 100?

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:57.843
By how much?

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:00.295
And 97 is 3.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:01.677
So we got 98,

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:03.094
we go crosswise,

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:04.999
we got 98 minus 3,

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.699
or we can do 97 minus 2,

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.103
they'll all give you the same answer.

00:03:09.103 --> 00:03:12.108
So that would give us 95.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.557
And the second part would be

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:16.103
06.

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.403
So that's our answer.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.016
OK, let's take a bigger number.

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:24.183
Let's try this one.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.094
Here the base is 1,000.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:31.001
So we got -004,

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.828
and 997 would be

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:35.114
-003.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:37.830
We go crosswise like this,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.787
and we get 996 minus 003 would give us

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.135
993,

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.610
and 004 times 003 would give us

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.890
012.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.302
And that's our answer.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.969
Thank you.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.015
14 times 12.

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:04.741
OK, here the base is 10.

00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:09.111
OK, so is 14 more than 10 or less than 10?

00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:11.647
More, so we got plus 4,

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:14.614
and 12, we got plus 2.

00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:16.360
Again, we apply the same rule,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.459
so we do 12 plus 4,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.620
which gives us 16, like this.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.485
And we multiply 2 and 4, that gives us 8.

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:29.674
So now, all of us here,

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:32.508
we're going to do mental squaring, OK.

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:34.566
Everybody is going to participate here,

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.811
and we're going to do squares of numbers

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.778
more than 100 mentally right now.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.036
So we got 101,

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:43.106
OK, now visualize on the board,

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.869
what's going to be on the right hand side.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:51.982
Plus 01, so we got that.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:54.448
OK, now we add plus sides, right?

00:04:54.448 --> 00:04:55.959
Yes? No?

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:58.589
So we got 101 plus 01,

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.741
that would give us

00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:02.232
102,

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:08.034
and, see here, like this.

00:05:08.034 --> 00:05:10.474
And 01 is getting squared, right?

00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:11.713
So that would give us

00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:15.817
01, and that's your answer.

00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:17.310
Try the next one.

00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:23.293
Let's try 102 squared.

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.643
Let's try, everybody.

00:05:26.643 --> 00:05:27.924
So 100,

00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:31.866
so 102 would be

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.176
10404.

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:37.523
OK, now the next one, try it everybody together.

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:39.950
I'll give you 5 seconds.

00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:45.609
OK, let's say it together, let's say it together, OK.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.636
[10609]

00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:51.754
10609 and that's the answer.

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:53.285
Woo!

00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:59.398
104 squared, how much would that be?

00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:02.329
Calculate it, 5 seconds.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:06.017
Come on, girls in the back.

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.126
OK, so the answer would be

00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:13.107
10816.

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:16.669
OK, let's do the next one: 105 squared.

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.084
Oh, no, no, no, no,

00:06:22.084 --> 00:06:24.919
we're going to try over, we're going to try over, OK?

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.691
OK. I'll give you 5 seconds, just think about it.

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.600
OK, now we're going to go, OK?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.931
11025.

00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.727
OK, let's going to do the next one, 106 squared.

00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:41.497
Try it, come one, everybody, it's simple and easy.

00:06:41.497 --> 00:06:44.631
[11236]

00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.213
OK, let's do it one more time.

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:50.698
11236.

00:06:50.698 --> 00:06:53.539
Now 107, think, hold on, don't say anything out loud,

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.773
just think mentally,

00:06:55.773 --> 00:06:57.575
107 squared.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:00.978
OK, now let's say it out loud.

00:07:00.978 --> 00:07:05.547
11449.

00:07:05.547 --> 00:07:08.025
And 108 squared.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:12.396
[11664]

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:15.276
Fantastic, give yourself a round of applause, come on!

00:07:20.337 --> 00:07:23.465
And this is the principle behind this,

00:07:23.465 --> 00:07:25.501
where a and b are the excesses

00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:29.395
or the deficiency from the base.

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:30.419
I'm going to teach you

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.809
in Vedic math, there are 16 sutras,

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.712
or word formulas, OK.

00:07:35.712 --> 00:07:36.980
They are very visual

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.716
and one of them is called, "vertically and crosswise,"

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:43.203
through which you can multiply any number

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:45.866
by any number in a single line.

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:50.203
So I'm going to do a two-digit by a two-digit multiplication.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.313
Let's do this.

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:54.179
So we got 31 times 12.

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:55.689
OK, so we're going to apply

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.384
the vertically and crosswise sutra.

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:02.755
So we're going to do like this:

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:06.129
vertically, and then we're going to go crosswise,

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:09.765
and then we're going to do vertical again.

00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:12.105
So, 2 times 1 gives us

00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:13.557
[2],

00:08:13.557 --> 00:08:15.085
2 times 3 gives us

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:16.576
[6],

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:17.721
and 1 times 1 gives us

00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:18.791
[1].

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:19.532
6 plus 1,

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:20.451
[7].

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:23.667
1 times 3 gives us

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.210
[3].

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.116
And that's it, and that's our answer.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:39.282
No more tedious calculations,

00:08:39.282 --> 00:08:41.454
no more going through the rough work,

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.919
it's simple in one line.

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:47.273
I want to show you a sum again,

00:08:47.273 --> 00:08:48.962
this time with carry-overs.

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:53.163
The same formula, all of us here can do this, OK.

00:08:53.163 --> 00:08:54.399
Same formula.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.769
So let's get started.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.089
4 times 2 gives us

00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:58.992
[8].

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:02.024
OK, now we go crosswise like this,

00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:04.238
so we're going to multiply 4 times 1,

00:09:04.238 --> 00:09:05.373
[4],

00:09:05.373 --> 00:09:06.441
and 3 times 2,

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:07.446
[6]

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:08.643
4 plus 6 gives us

00:09:08.643 --> 00:09:09.311
[10].

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:11.613
So we put down 0, carry the 1.

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:13.086
And 3 times 1 gives us

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.062
[3],

00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:14.892
plus 1,

00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:15.687
[4].

00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:18.914
Exactly, that's our answer, 408.

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:22.405
OK, thank you for being such a participative audience,

00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:24.564
and we had a great time number crunching.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.991
Now I want to end with a question:

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:31.004
whether you'd like math to be dull or boring,

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.872
or fun and interesting?

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.506
The choice is yours.
