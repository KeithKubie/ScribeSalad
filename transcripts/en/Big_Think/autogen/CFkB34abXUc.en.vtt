more optimistic if I felt other people

more optimistic if I felt other people
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.810
more optimistic if I felt other people
were less irrationally optimistic I

we face and because of that are overly

we face and because of that are overly
 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.960
we face and because of that are overly
complacent and I think that's that seems

to me is a recipe for dramatically
 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.150
to me is a recipe for dramatically
increasing the probability something

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
increasing the probability something
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.190

very bad bad happening but but you know

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.260
it's very hard to know and you know it's
very hard to know which choices are

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
very hard to know which choices are
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
very hard to know which choices are
going to be the critical ones and how

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
going to be the critical ones and how

these things are precisely and work out

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
these things are precisely and work out
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.900
these things are precisely and work out
because the world's a big place a lot of

make a if you held a gun to my head and

we're headed towards you know 20 30

years of incredible chaos and turmoil

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940
years of incredible chaos and turmoil
 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.999
years of incredible chaos and turmoil
and then at the tail end of who will

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
and then at the tail end of who will
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.080
and then at the tail end of who will
emerge with a world better than any weak
