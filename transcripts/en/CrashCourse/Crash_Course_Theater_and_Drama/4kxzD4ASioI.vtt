00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.120
Hey there! I’m Mike Rugnetta, and this is
the LAST episode of Crash Course Theater.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.790
So get ready for like, 9 curtain calls at
the end. But for now, we’re grabbing our

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.639
Playbills and our Twizzlers to spend an episode
with America’s greatest theatrical invention:

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.589
the singing, dancing, orchestra-in-the-floor
sensation that is… wait for it… the Broadway

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.599
book musical.
Why does the Broadway book musical matter?

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.130
Well, it’s changed theater as we know it.
Along with Hollywood movies, it’s America’s

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.090
most influential entertainment export, a billion-dollar
industry that has zoomed its way across the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.250
world, to every continent except Antarctica,
and onto cruise ships, too.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.360
Today we’ll focus on the Golden Age of the
Broadway musical, trying to figure out how

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.480
song, story, and the occasional dream ballet
come together to create this singular sensation.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.280
Lights up!
INTRO

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.119
Theater and music have always been closely
intertwined. Greek tragedies were mostly sung

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.409
and danced. Liturgical dramas had key musical
components. Melodrama was originally a musical

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.350
form. And most styles of traveling or folk
theater were strongly musical—not to mention

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.750
the nineteenth-century rise of the opera—and
pretty much every style of Asian theater we’ve

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.479
studied.
American theater, of course, has its own musical

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.750
theater traditions, including the troubling
and unfortunately VERY popular minstrel show,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.350
which we looked at in an earlier episode.
In terms of imported forms, America also went

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.000
big for vaudeville, pantomime, operetta, and
comedy burlesque—which is different from

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.779
the modern tell-dirty-jokes-and-take-your-clothes-off
sexy burlesque.

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:49.630
In the 1860s, we got what some consider the
first American musical, “The Black Crook.”

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.400
“The Black Crook” basically happened because
a theater burned down, and a Parisian ballet

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.849
troupe was stranded. So some enterprising
producers were like, well, we can’t just

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.909
put French girls in flesh-colored tights onstage
and leave them there? The people demand a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.780
story! Do they?
Anyway, the producers paired the dancers with

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.650
a totally incomprehensible play about black
magic and fairies and a really weird New Year’s

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.290
Eve. And they tricked it out with scenery
and songs. The total package! … that lasted

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
five hours and made nooooo sense.
The first American musical comedies on Broadway

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.930
were created in the 1870s by a duo called
Harrigan and Hart. They started with a variety

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.100
act that made fun of drunk neighborhood militias—armed
and hilarious!—and then expanded these sketches

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.340
into song-filled shows like “The Mulligan
Guard.”

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.250
They poked fun at all sorts of working-class
types, and they never met an ethnicity they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.790
couldn’t mock. Stereotyping was huge, and
the songs didn’t have anything to do with

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.590
the plot. But these shows made audiences hungry
for more, more, more musical farces with more,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.880
more, more irrelevant songs.
At around the turn of the 20th century, there

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.430
was a vogue for African-American musicals,
which we discussed in our episode on the theater

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.830
of the Harlem Renaissance.
In 1907, the Follies were born and musical

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.010
theater got very leggy. The Follies were evenings
of loosely linked sketches and popular songs,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.430
but the big draw was the chorus of Follies
girls.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.100
Each year, producer Florenz Ziegfeld assembled
a group of beautiful chorines who had to have,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.510
he said, “beauty of face, form, charm and
manner, personal magnetism, individuality,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.410
grace and poise.”
The scripts? They’re not great. In the first

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.050
Follies, Captain John Smith and Pocahontas
drop in on 1907 New York and meet all kinds

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.400
of people. Yeah.
The Follies walked the line between titillating

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.331
and classy pretty much perfectly. They were
girlie shows that men could perv out to. While

00:03:55.331 --> 00:04:01.880
sitting next to their wives. Because middle-class
wives enjoy a kickline, too?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.010
Between 1907 and 1931, there was a Follies
every year, each leggier and more sumptuous

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.500
than the last. Oh, and Ziegfeld’s Follies
were the tame version. Other producers just

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.870
threw a bunch of nude showgirls and raunchy
comics on the stage and called it a day.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.989
Broadway could have gone on forever with classic
girlie shows and questionably hilarious ethnic

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.120
stereotyping. But thankfully, instead something
wonderful happened: The birth of the book

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.341
musical.
The father? That would be Jerome Kern, a guy

00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:35.660
who got his start fixing up imported British
musicals. The songs he contributed were really

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.500
good, usually a lot better than what he’d
been handed. The melodies were catchy, and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.490
the lyrics conversational.
At the Princess Theater, Kern and the lyricist

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.180
Guy Bolton started writing charming, low-key
musicals, which became even more charming

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.470
when comic mastermind P. G. Wodehouse joined
them. Notable shows included “Oh Boy!”

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.710
“and “Oh Dear!” Oh wow!
Maybe they seem like piffle now, but at the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.710
time book musicals were revolutionary: the
characters were recognizable. The situations

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.940
were contemporary. The plot, lyrics, and style
of song actually /went together/!

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.900
Bolton told an interviewer, “Every line,
funny or serious, is supposedly to help the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.490
plot continue to hold.” Whoa! Now I know
what some of you are thinking. Gilbert and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.840
Sullivan already did this. And you’re not
wrong, but those were operettas, mostly sung

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.310
through. And they involved fantastical situations.
The Princess Theater musicals were different.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.780
By the late 1920s, this newfangled idea that
maybe the songs should have something to do

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.790
with the plot and the plot could be minimally
coherent was really catching on. More than

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.620
fifty revues and musicals crowded Broadway
every year.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.400
And there were so many new composers and lyricists!
Like Richard Rodgers or the romantic Lorenz

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.010
Hart. Or the astonishingly witty Cole Porter,
a man who could rhyme anything. And, oh my

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.240
god, George and Ira Gershwin, s’wonderful,
people! And hey, look, Irving Berlin!

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.419
Probably the first thoroughly modern musical
was the 1927 “Show Boat,” which is tricky

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.830
to revive today because its racial politics
are … a mess? But as written by Jerome Kern

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.449
and Oscar Hammerstein and set on a Mississippi
showboat, it pushed the musical in a more

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.050
serious direction, towards an honest examination
of racism..

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.210
It offered rich roles for African-American
actors and gave them character-driven songs

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.949
like “Old Man River” and “Can’t Help
Lovin’ that Man,” which are still standards.

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.210
The Broadway musical made it through the Great
Depression. And while World War Two was being

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.700
waged, the musical leveled up again, entering
a twenty-year Golden Age.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.540
The musicals of this era were defined by their
wit, sophistication, extremely hummable songs,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.419
and dazzling and often athletic choreography—and
by their willingness to allow genuinely complex

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.760
characters to exist.
Now we’re going to take a look at the American

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.330
musical that finally put it all together—music
and lyrics and book scenes and ballet—to

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.830
tell a distinctly American story. Welcome
to “Oklahoma!” Note the exclamation point!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.090
This one is exciting, people! Even though
it’s set in …Oklahoma. No offense to my

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.220
Okies out there.
This 1943 musical, written by Richard Rodgers

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.840
and Oscar Hammerstein, is based on Lynn Riggs’s
1931 play “Green Grow the Lilacs.” The

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.550
exclamation point wasn’t all they added.
The play opens in 1906, when Oklahoma is still

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.449
a territory, and a surrey wagon is a plausible
way to get around town. Help us out, ThoughtBubble!

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.610
Cowboy Curly comes forward and sings “Oh,
What a Beautiful Mornin’” as though chatting

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.610
to the audience. The Times critic, Brooks
Atkinson, wrote that after a magnificent song

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.300
like that
“the banalities of the old musical stage

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.830
became intolerable.”
Curly and farm girl Laurey clearly like each

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.370
other, but can’t seem to get along. Laurey
has another suitor: Loner farmhand Jud Fry,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.540
who is basically a Golden Age incel. The guy
is bad news.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.040
To make Curly jealous, Laurey agrees to go
to the box social with Jud, even though she’s

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.800
kind of afraid of him. Curly takes the news
well, so well that he goes to see Jud and

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.320
sings a joke/not joke song suggesting that
Jud kill himself. Jud, also a really mature

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.169
guy, decides that he’s going to marry Laurey—whether
she wants to or not!

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:20.890
Laurey is so confused that she buys a magic
potion from the Persian peddler Ali Hakim.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.820
She takes it and falls asleep, and that’s
when we get a fifteen-minute dream ballet,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.300
where Laurey imagines marrying Curly and Jud
murdering Curly. That is a bad dream. And

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.770
a good ballet. When she wakes, Laurey is too
frightened to reject Jud, so they go to the

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.419
box social.
There’s a scuffle between farmers and cowmen,

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:45.570
and some comedy subplot stuff. Jud and Curly
fight over Laurey. And Curly sells all his

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:51.000
things to win her heart. Jud confesses his
feelings. Laurey rejects him and then fires

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.210
him.
Curly and Laurey are married, but drunk Jud

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.461
shows up and tries to kill Curly, which is
not good wedding etiquette. They tussle, and

00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:04.980
Jud falls on his own knife. And Curly and
Laurey get to go off on their honeymoon. A

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.050
happy ending! Except for the dead guy!
Thanks, ThoughtBubble. It’s hard to get

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.460
across how innovative “Oklahoma!”—a
musical that includes a number like “The

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:19.460
Farmer and the Cowman”—actually is. Rodgers’s
melodies had a distinctly American sound.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.010
And Hammerstein wrote the lyrics first, which
meant that the songs were way more integral

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.790
to the story and were written in the voices
of the characters.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.080
Even more than “Showboat,” every song
had a purpose, and so did every dance number.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.810
Agnes de Mille’s dream ballet took the musical
to a daring, expressionist place. The story

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.420
was allowed to exist with a level of tonal
and character complexity that no one thought

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.520
a musical could handle. But the musical /could/
handle it. It’s so good!

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.940
As we’re filming this in late 2018, a number
of American theaters have recently staged

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.790
“Oklahoma!,” interrogating its depictions
of sexuality, violence, conflict, and community.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.899
These are radically different interpretations.
But maybe that’s one of the signs of a great

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:06.230
work of art—that it can stand up to all
kind of interpretations and still tell us

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.010
something truthful. With a fringe on top.
Oh, and this was also the show that pioneered

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:16.930
the original cast recording, which is NOT
a small deal. You’re welcome.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.740
After “Oklahoma!,” the Golden Age continued
until the early 1960s. Maybe there were no

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.310
other great musicals named after states and
territories, but Rodgers and Hammerstein followed

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.800
“Oklahoma!” up with “Carousel,” “South
Pacific,” “The Sound of Music” and “The

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.150
King and I.” Shall we dance, Yorick?
At the same time, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.820
Loewe wrote “Brigadoon” and “My Fair
Lady.”

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.420
And let’s not forget “Guys and Dolls,”
“On the Town,” “Wonderful Town,” “Kiss

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.570
Me Kate,” “Damn Yankees,” “West Side
Story,” because somewhere there’s a place

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.810
for us...
and “Gypsy.”

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.230
Whew! There is sooo much more that we could
talk about! The counterculture musical! The

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.060
mega musical! The concept musical! Sondheim!
There’s so much to say about Sondheim. Yorick

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:03.209
loves Sondheim! I’m lukewarm myself but
NO SHADE, well.. Except...maybe literal shade...

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:06.500
Because it’s time for our curtain call.
This is our final episode of Crash Course

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.160
Theater and yet we have forty or fifty years
of theater history and contemporary performance

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.690
still to go. Maybe we’ll meet again for
a reprise down the road.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.730
Still, we wanted to leave you with the book
musical, not just because it’s a hugely

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.260
popular and influential theatrical form, but
also because it’s how a lot of us who make

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.770
Crash Course Theater got hooked in the first
place. We saw a musical or a movie musical

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.720
when we were kids, and it just knocked us
out. That’s right. Musicals are the gateway

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.500
drug. First “Guys and Dolls” Then Artaud.
Book musicals are sometimes sexist and sometimes

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.560
racist and sometimes really dumb. But they’re
also virtuosic and hopeful and big-hearted.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.350
Like many of the things in life we love, they
are big, and they are complicated.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.560
Speaking of love, We can’t actually see
or hear you, but you’ve been a great audience.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.310
Thank you for staying in your seats while
we explored more than two thousand years of

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.030
people trying to put their world onstage.
We wish we could sign at the stage door, but

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.000
you may have to settle for … like, VidCon
or … twitter I guess?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.080
We’ve seen sad theater, funny theater, dangerous
theater, avalanche theater, theater that wants

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.890
to burn it all down, and theater that wants
to build a new and better world. So give yourselves

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:33.010
a hand. And take 
a bow, Yorick. That’s right, cue ball. You’ve

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:55.010
earned it. And for now, for 
the last time… curtain!
