good say okay so what you can see though
 

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:16.450
good say okay so what you can see though
is they've actually got a whole list of

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.460
is they've actually got a whole list of
 

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.850
is they've actually got a whole list of
all the plays that happen in a game it's

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:18.860
all the plays that happen in a game it's
 

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.800
all the plays that happen in a game it's
a little it took awhile to figure it out

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:20.810
a little it took awhile to figure it out
 

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.050
a little it took awhile to figure it out
but these are the orange circles

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.060
but these are the orange circles
 

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.480
but these are the orange circles
basically means are some ball movement

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.490
basically means are some ball movement
 

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.240
basically means are some ball movement
and then you get i think a triangle for

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.250
and then you get i think a triangle for
 

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.560
and then you get i think a triangle for
a turnover um you get if it's blue it

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:32.570
a turnover um you get if it's blue it
 

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.779
a turnover um you get if it's blue it

it feels like a pretty obvious icon to

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:06.460
it feels like a pretty obvious icon to
 

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.490
it feels like a pretty obvious icon to
use instead would be in fact a video

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:08.500
use instead would be in fact a video
 

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.500
use instead would be in fact a video
camera or something like that sure yeah

absolutely you know or some sort of a
 

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.760
absolutely you know or some sort of a
bookmark icon I think would be fine as

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:14.770
bookmark icon I think would be fine as
 

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.770
bookmark icon I think would be fine as
well some sort of indicator because you

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:16.780
well some sort of indicator because you
 

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.360
well some sort of indicator because you
know clicking here kind of assumed that

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.370
know clicking here kind of assumed that
 

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.920
know clicking here kind of assumed that
it's going to be a drill down are you

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:19.930
it's going to be a drill down are you
 

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.630
it's going to be a drill down are you
gonna get more detail on that particular

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640
gonna get more detail on that particular
 

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.400
gonna get more detail on that particular
play right whereas the video is probably

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.410
play right whereas the video is probably
 

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.710
play right whereas the video is probably
better but this sort of no clue now the

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720
better but this sort of no clue now the
 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.270
better but this sort of no clue now the
other thing that I would love to have is

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.280
other thing that I would love to have is
 

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.470
other thing that I would love to have is
some sort of sorting ability you can

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480
some sort of sorting ability you can
 

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.150
some sort of sorting ability you can
sort for instance on scores but you'll

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160
sort for instance on scores but you'll
 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.220
sort for instance on scores but you'll
notice that that removes the bookmarking

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.230
notice that that removes the bookmarking
 

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.320
notice that that removes the bookmarking
functionality absolutely that's a shame

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.330
functionality absolutely that's a shame
 

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.550
functionality absolutely that's a shame
so that's kind of gonna be the highlight

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560
so that's kind of gonna be the highlight
 

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.680
so that's kind of gonna be the highlight
that you in a look absolutely you know

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:40.690
that you in a look absolutely you know
 

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.870
that you in a look absolutely you know
like for me I'm all about the passing

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
like for me I'm all about the passing
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.910
like for me I'm all about the passing
game so I'd really like to just see all

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920
game so I'd really like to just see all
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.980
game so I'd really like to just see all
the big passes sure that makes sense and

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:46.990
the big passes sure that makes sense and
 

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.570
the big passes sure that makes sense and
I found myself literally for this game

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:48.580
I found myself literally for this game
 

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.100
I found myself literally for this game
just sort of scrolling through and

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.110
just sort of scrolling through and
 

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.100
just sort of scrolling through and
looking for like a yardage number yeah

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.110
looking for like a yardage number yeah
 

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.780
looking for like a yardage number yeah
Oh 15 yards down maybe I want to see

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:54.790
Oh 15 yards down maybe I want to see
 

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.460
Oh 15 yards down maybe I want to see
that well it seems like there's a lot of

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:56.470
that well it seems like there's a lot of
 

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.110
that well it seems like there's a lot of
information going on in this on the

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120
information going on in this on the
 

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.050
information going on in this on the
screen but what really isn't clear is

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.060
screen but what really isn't clear is
 

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.400
screen but what really isn't clear is
exactly like you have to kind of read

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410
exactly like you have to kind of read
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.220
exactly like you have to kind of read
everything in order

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.230
everything in order
 

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.620
everything in order
anything I know it reminds me of it

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:05.630
anything I know it reminds me of it
 

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.940
anything I know it reminds me of it
reminds me of trying to read the

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:08.950
reminds me of trying to read the
 

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.570
reminds me of trying to read the
scrolling output from like a

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:10.580
scrolling output from like a
 

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.400
scrolling output from like a
role-playing game or something right oh

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.410
role-playing game or something right oh
 

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.340

it's the same sort of thing where you
have sort of constant you know six balls

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.250
have sort of constant you know six balls
 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.740
have sort of constant you know six balls
and over it's just constant whatever

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:23.750
and over it's just constant whatever

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.660
that you have the power on this show we
do listen to reader comments or viewer

so you have the power to stop the

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.400
so you have the power to stop the
 

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.030
so you have the power to stop the
cricket madness Oh indeed to force the

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040
cricket madness Oh indeed to force the
 

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.010
cricket madness Oh indeed to force the
cricket madness if that is in the eighth

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:48.020
cricket madness if that is in the eighth
 

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.410
cricket madness if that is in the eighth
one nation in d so anyway so the point

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.420
one nation in d so anyway so the point
 

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.880
one nation in d so anyway so the point
is is that you know a lot of people

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:51.890
is is that you know a lot of people
 

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.650
is is that you know a lot of people
follow the cricket just by watching the

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:53.660
follow the cricket just by watching the
 

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.690
follow the cricket just by watching the
live commentary and so they've kind of

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:55.700
live commentary and so they've kind of
 

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.910
live commentary and so they've kind of
optimized that process of having the

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920
optimized that process of having the
 

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.650
optimized that process of having the
most important thing first so the number

00:11:59.650 --> 00:11:59.660
most important thing first so the number
 

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.900
most important thing first so the number
of runs scored off each particular ball

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:01.910
of runs scored off each particular ball
 

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.360
of runs scored off each particular ball
is the first thing you see if the person

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
is the first thing you see if the person
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.800
is the first thing you see if the person
was out and that's the first thing you

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:05.810
was out and that's the first thing you
 

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.540
was out and that's the first thing you
see in it I'd like to see the same thing

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:07.550
see in it I'd like to see the same thing
 

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.390
see in it I'd like to see the same thing
here so the the distance past seems like

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:10.400
here so the the distance past seems like
 

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.650
here so the the distance past seems like
that would be the most important thing

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:11.660
that would be the most important thing
 

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.840
that would be the most important thing
on a completed play yeah or in fact

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:13.850
on a completed play yeah or in fact
 

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.280
on a completed play yeah or in fact
scoring seems like it should be

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.290
scoring seems like it should be
 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.920
scoring seems like it should be
something that should be you know fairly

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:17.930
something that should be you know fairly
 

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.780
something that should be you know fairly
obvious yeah but you can see it feels

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:19.790
obvious yeah but you can see it feels
 

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.750
obvious yeah but you can see it feels
like they they actually haven't taken a

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760
like they they actually haven't taken a
 

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.250
like they they actually haven't taken a
huge amount of care here because if you

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:24.260
huge amount of care here because if you
 

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.080
huge amount of care here because if you
look at this it actually even repeats

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.090
look at this it actually even repeats
 

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.240
look at this it actually even repeats
some information you know this is a time

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:28.250
some information you know this is a time
 

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.800
some information you know this is a time
on the clock and then time on the clock

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:29.810
on the clock and then time on the clock
 

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.210
on the clock and then time on the clock
is the first thing you see here is why

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.220
is the first thing you see here is why
 

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.000
is the first thing you see here is why
so I think this this feels like they're

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.010
so I think this this feels like they're
 

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.320
so I think this this feels like they're
just pulling it off their newsfeed of

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.330
just pulling it off their newsfeed of
 

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.080
just pulling it off their newsfeed of
some kind yeah at the same time although

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.090
some kind yeah at the same time although
 

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.900
some kind yeah at the same time although
it could be presented in a slightly

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:40.910
it could be presented in a slightly
 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.640
it could be presented in a slightly
nicer format this is some great

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:42.650
nicer format this is some great
 

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.590
nicer format this is some great
information absolutely it really is just

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600
information absolutely it really is just
 

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600
information absolutely it really is just
a presentation thing at this point and

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:46.610
a presentation thing at this point and
 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.430
a presentation thing at this point and
the app itself is obviously hugely

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440
the app itself is obviously hugely
 

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.460
the app itself is obviously hugely
useful to any sports fan it's really

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.470
useful to any sports fan it's really
 

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.130
useful to any sports fan it's really
just a case here of trying to you need

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.140
just a case here of trying to you need
 

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.240
just a case here of trying to you need
to make this text bigger you need to

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.250
to make this text bigger you need to
 

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.950
to make this text bigger you need to
make the touch targets bigger and then

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:56.960
make the touch targets bigger and then
 

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.480
make the touch targets bigger and then
expand the text because I think all of

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:58.490
expand the text because I think all of
 

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.790
expand the text because I think all of
you guys watching can see that you'd be

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800
you guys watching can see that you'd be
 

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.050
you guys watching can see that you'd be
pretty lucky you can read any of this

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.060
pretty lucky you can read any of this
 

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.210
pretty lucky you can read any of this
from the camera and in fact as soon as

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.220
from the camera and in fact as soon as
 

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.730
from the camera and in fact as soon as
you sort of sit back from it you're

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:05.740
you sort of sit back from it you're
 

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.780
you sort of sit back from it you're
checking to make sure your prescription

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:07.790
checking to make sure your prescription
 

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.600
checking to make sure your prescription
is still valid right it's small yeah and

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:10.610
is still valid right it's small yeah and
 

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.360
is still valid right it's small yeah and
on a nexus 7 it's it's even

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.370
on a nexus 7 it's it's even
 

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.490
on a nexus 7 it's it's even
I can imagine is very very difficult a

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:15.500
I can imagine is very very difficult a
 

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.800
I can imagine is very very difficult a
pretty big tablet as tablets go these

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:17.810
pretty big tablet as tablets go these
 

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.120
pretty big tablet as tablets go these
days so you really want to have that

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.130
days so you really want to have that
 

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.670
days so you really want to have that
bigger and in fact there's no there's no

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680
bigger and in fact there's no there's no
 

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.470
bigger and in fact there's no there's no
need like what they've kind of optimized

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480
need like what they've kind of optimized
 

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.560
need like what they've kind of optimized
for here is to have as many plays on

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:26.570
for here is to have as many plays on
 

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.900
for here is to have as many plays on
screen at a time and that's probably not

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:28.910
screen at a time and that's probably not
 

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.280
screen at a time and that's probably not
what you want to optimize for all right

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.290
what you want to optimize for all right
 

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.050
what you want to optimize for all right
yeah I think you're right i think it

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.060
yeah I think you're right i think it
 

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.000
yeah I think you're right i think it
rather than seeing a huge number of

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.010
rather than seeing a huge number of
 

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.490
rather than seeing a huge number of
plays where i have to carefully read

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:36.500
plays where i have to carefully read
 

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.190
plays where i have to carefully read
each one I'd rather have the information

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.200
each one I'd rather have the information
 

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.500
each one I'd rather have the information
presented so that I can scan it so

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:41.510
presented so that I can scan it so
 

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.930
presented so that I can scan it so
quickly that flicking this up and down

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:43.940
quickly that flicking this up and down
 

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.700
quickly that flicking this up and down
will actually be useful yes absolutely

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:45.710
will actually be useful yes absolutely
 

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.430
will actually be useful yes absolutely
you know so if I see and and you can see

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440
you know so if I see and and you can see
 

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.600
you know so if I see and and you can see
they've done a little bit like I can

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.610
they've done a little bit like I can
 

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.700
they've done a little bit like I can
flick this up and down and when I see

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:51.710
flick this up and down and when I see
 

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.460
flick this up and down and when I see
this little bluish green color go by

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:54.470
this little bluish green color go by
 

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.010
this little bluish green color go by
even if it's moving very fast I can see

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.020
even if it's moving very fast I can see
 

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.870
even if it's moving very fast I can see
that because stands out from the rest of

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880
that because stands out from the rest of
 

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.850
that because stands out from the rest of
everything yeah so so bravo on that

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:00.860
everything yeah so so bravo on that
 

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.360
everything yeah so so bravo on that
count now take that idea and extend it

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.370
count now take that idea and extend it
 

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.490
count now take that idea and extend it
out to the rest of this particular you I

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:06.500
out to the rest of this particular you I
 

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.990
out to the rest of this particular you I
and I think you've got a real winner and

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000
and I think you've got a real winner and
 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.250
and I think you've got a real winner and
in fact what I would say is you've

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.260
in fact what I would say is you've
 

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.920
in fact what I would say is you've
actually got the right idea here so if

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:11.930
actually got the right idea here so if
 

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.480
actually got the right idea here so if
you look over here on this side you can

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.490
you look over here on this side you can
 

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.530
you look over here on this side you can
actually see that they've got this

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.540
actually see that they've got this
 

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.050
actually see that they've got this
really rich and large touch targets

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:17.060
really rich and large touch targets
 

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.699
really rich and large touch targets
that's probably about the size you want

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:18.709
that's probably about the size you want
 

00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:20.890
that's probably about the size you want
and the same way that they've got their

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:20.900
and the same way that they've got their
 

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.350
and the same way that they've got their
sort of background bleed image that'd be

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360
sort of background bleed image that'd be
 

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.150
sort of background bleed image that'd be
kind of cool than having this done here

should all be in an overflow menu and it
 

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.610
should all be in an overflow menu and it
shouldn't be this weird drop-down pop-up

that right right okay so you don't
actually have an excuse not to use the

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:58.490
actually have an excuse not to use the
 

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.830
actually have an excuse not to use the
action bar because you don't have to

00:15:59.830 --> 00:15:59.840
action bar because you don't have to
 

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.180
action bar because you don't have to
worry about backwards compatibility you

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.190
worry about backwards compatibility you
 

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.470
worry about backwards compatibility you
don't have to worry about how your menu

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480
don't have to worry about how your menu
 

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.900

just make it an action bar and so this

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800
just make it an action bar and so this
 

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.680
just make it an action bar and so this
all of this stuff it's fair enough to

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:08.690
all of this stuff it's fair enough to
 

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.420
all of this stuff it's fair enough to
perhaps put this in settings but

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:10.430
perhaps put this in settings but
 

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.950
perhaps put this in settings but
settings should kind of always be in the

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:11.960
settings should kind of always be in the
 

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.170

something like yeah see because it gives
 

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.050
something like yeah see because it gives
you that indication of whether you know

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.060
you that indication of whether you know
 

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.490
you that indication of whether you know
how far along you are and obviously at

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:20.500
how far along you are and obviously at
 

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.140
how far along you are and obviously at
this side it's obvious that there isn't

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.150
this side it's obvious that there isn't
 

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.020
this side it's obvious that there isn't
anything before pronoun see there is and

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.030
anything before pronoun see there is and

that's interesting so well it's wrapping

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.370
that's interesting so well it's wrapping
 

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.730
that's interesting so well it's wrapping
around it is particularly so I'm a pre

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:29.740
around it is particularly so I'm a pre
 

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.140
around it is particularly so I'm a pre
week one and it seems intuitive that

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.150
week one and it seems intuitive that
 

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.550
week one and it seems intuitive that
there isn't anything before the first

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:32.560
there isn't anything before the first
 

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.110
there isn't anything before the first
pre week but there is you know we've got

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120
pre week but there is you know we've got
 

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.360
pre week but there is you know we've got
the Hall of Fame and then we're back to

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.370
the Hall of Fame and then we're back to
 

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.000
the Hall of Fame and then we're back to
pre week for which is again kind of

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.010
pre week for which is again kind of
 

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.620

funny oh yeah your wrap around I don't

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.630
funny oh yeah your wrap around I don't
 

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.760
funny oh yeah your wrap around I don't
know that you want if I wouldn't have

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:41.770
know that you want if I wouldn't have
 

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.140
know that you want if I wouldn't have
made that choice no you know whatever

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.150
made that choice no you know whatever
 

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.930

because they're not making any more of
them true enough so the other thing I

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:03.370
them true enough so the other thing I
 

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.770
them true enough so the other thing I
point out as well as I mean this is a

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:04.780
point out as well as I mean this is a
 

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.800
point out as well as I mean this is a
pretty fast device and this scrolling is

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:07.810
pretty fast device and this scrolling is
 

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.620
pretty fast device and this scrolling is
not the smoothest so there might be

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:10.630
not the smoothest so there might be
 

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.150
not the smoothest so there might be
something you can do that o to optimize

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160
something you can do that o to optimize
 

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.620
something you can do that o to optimize
that scroll speed in anything which

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:13.630
that scroll speed in anything which
 

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.350
that scroll speed in anything which
makes the app feel a little janky really

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360
makes the app feel a little janky really
 

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.330
makes the app feel a little janky really
destroy detract from the user experience

so you know when you are designing

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:19.510
so you know when you are designing
 

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.630
so you know when you are designing
things everything should be as smooth as

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640
things everything should be as smooth as
 

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.180
things everything should be as smooth as
it possibly can be yeah and this

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.190
it possibly can be yeah and this
 

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.940
it possibly can be yeah and this
a lot of times what we see is people are

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:26.950
a lot of times what we see is people are
 

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.810
a lot of times what we see is people are
either using a regular view and

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:30.820
either using a regular view and
 

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.639
either using a regular view and
efficiently or they're using a web view

00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:32.649
efficiently or they're using a web view
 

00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:34.799

hmm to do some of this the other thing

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:34.809
hmm to do some of this the other thing
 

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:38.669
hmm to do some of this the other thing
that's actually a good tip for many

00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679
that's actually a good tip for many
 

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:41.009
that's actually a good tip for many
devices they're not all which also

00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:41.019
devices they're not all which also
 

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:42.720

happens to line up nicely with our

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:42.730
happens to line up nicely with our
 

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.090
happens to line up nicely with our
design guidelines is if you put a little

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.100
design guidelines is if you put a little
 

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.070
design guidelines is if you put a little
less emphasis on the gradients here

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080
less emphasis on the gradients here
 

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.669
less emphasis on the gradients here
especially if that's something that

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679
especially if that's something that
 

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:52.169
especially if that's something that
you're adding in after the fact in

00:19:52.169 --> 00:19:52.179
you're adding in after the fact in
 

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:55.740
you're adding in after the fact in
general most android apps and the you

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:55.750
general most android apps and the you
 

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.070
general most android apps and the you
android UI tries to be simplified and

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080
android UI tries to be simplified and
 

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.499
android UI tries to be simplified and
flat we don't go for the bubbly look

00:20:01.499 --> 00:20:01.509
flat we don't go for the bubbly look
 

00:20:01.509 --> 00:20:04.169
flat we don't go for the bubbly look
yeah and there are devices in the field

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:04.179
yeah and there are devices in the field
 

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:07.259
yeah and there are devices in the field
that possibly because of that are not

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:07.269
that possibly because of that are not
 

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.909
that possibly because of that are not
actually very good at drawing gradients

00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919
actually very good at drawing gradients
 

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:11.519
actually very good at drawing gradients
mm yeah this is true I did an experiment

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:11.529
mm yeah this is true I did an experiment
 

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:13.860
mm yeah this is true I did an experiment
myself with a compass app and just you

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:13.870
myself with a compass app and just you
 

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.180
myself with a compass app and just you
know if you do it flat it'll renders

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.190
know if you do it flat it'll renders
 

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.440
know if you do it flat it'll renders
really quickly as soon as you try and

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.450
really quickly as soon as you try and
 

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.600
really quickly as soon as you try and
put like a glass top on top of it

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:18.610
put like a glass top on top of it
 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.950
put like a glass top on top of it
everything slows down but you got to

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960
everything slows down but you got to
 

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.399
everything slows down but you got to
remember that anytime you're drawing a

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:23.409
remember that anytime you're drawing a
 

00:20:23.409 --> 00:20:26.310
remember that anytime you're drawing a
gradient or a glassy look or anything

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320
gradient or a glassy look or anything
 

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.869
gradient or a glassy look or anything
like that you're you're touching the

00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:27.879
like that you're you're touching the
 

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:31.499
like that you're you're touching the
pixels twice as often yeah and in many

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:31.509
pixels twice as often yeah and in many
 

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:33.869
pixels twice as often yeah and in many
cases device and feel bound and that

00:20:33.869 --> 00:20:33.879

00:20:33.879 --> 00:20:36.419
cases device and feel bound and that
literally does make it half as fast let

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:36.429
literally does make it half as fast let
 

00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:38.970
literally does make it half as fast let
you go all right so the only other thing

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:38.980
you go all right so the only other thing
 

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.289
you go all right so the only other thing
we've got here so we've got these tabs

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:40.299
we've got here so we've got these tabs
 

00:20:40.299 --> 00:20:41.970
we've got here so we've got these tabs
this should probably be actual tabs

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:41.980
this should probably be actual tabs
 

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.180
this should probably be actual tabs
rather than these weird pseudo tabs and

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.190
rather than these weird pseudo tabs and
 

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.830
rather than these weird pseudo tabs and
again basically this idea of that the

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840
again basically this idea of that the
 

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.080
again basically this idea of that the
text being difficult to pass easily

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.090
text being difficult to pass easily
 

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.350
text being difficult to pass easily
being small and and not of high contrast

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360
being small and and not of high contrast
 

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.249
being small and and not of high contrast
is probably something you want to look

00:20:53.249 --> 00:20:53.259
is probably something you want to look
 

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:55.350
is probably something you want to look
out throughout yeah all right shall we

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360

quite true all right let's have a look

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:25.330
quite true all right let's have a look
 

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.180

at a foot mob pro which I think was one

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.190
at a foot mob pro which I think was one
 

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.409

of the top

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:28.419
of the top
 

00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:31.259
of the top
on the top resulting ones try and go

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:31.269
on the top resulting ones try and go
 

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:35.369
on the top resulting ones try and go
back to the home screen so looking at

00:21:35.369 --> 00:21:35.379
back to the home screen so looking at
 

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:36.659
back to the home screen so looking at
this straight away so this is this is a

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:36.669
this straight away so this is this is a
 

00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.729
this straight away so this is this is a
popular app and I would suggest that one

00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:38.739
popular app and I would suggest that one
 

00:21:38.739 --> 00:21:39.779
popular app and I would suggest that one
of the main reasons for that is because

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:39.789
of the main reasons for that is because
 

00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:42.090
of the main reasons for that is because
it's very useful you can get all the

but clicking it should take you to
 

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.399
but clicking it should take you to
something I kind of assumed it would be

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:04.409
something I kind of assumed it would be
 

00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:07.200
something I kind of assumed it would be
rankings which makes sense the very fact

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.210
rankings which makes sense the very fact
 

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.580
rankings which makes sense the very fact
that it didn't appear for the MLS

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:08.590
that it didn't appear for the MLS
 

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.129
that it didn't appear for the MLS

right now let's do that it seems

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440
right now let's do that it seems
 

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.849
right now let's do that it seems
reasonable enough all right uh so yeah I

00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:32.859
reasonable enough all right uh so yeah I
 

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:35.159
reasonable enough all right uh so yeah I
don't know why that's not showing up but

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:35.169
don't know why that's not showing up but
 

00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:36.869
don't know why that's not showing up but
it's just failing to hold down the

00:22:36.869 --> 00:22:36.879
it's just failing to hold down the
 

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:38.639
it's just failing to hold down the
dollar and so you want to have some

00:22:38.639 --> 00:22:38.649
dollar and so you want to have some
 

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:40.229
dollar and so you want to have some
indication here that it's loading all

00:22:40.229 --> 00:22:40.239
indication here that it's loading all
 

00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:42.149
indication here that it's loading all
right now I'm not a big fan of loading

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159
right now I'm not a big fan of loading
 

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:43.499
right now I'm not a big fan of loading
dialogues or anything like that but

00:22:43.499 --> 00:22:43.509
dialogues or anything like that but
 

00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:45.389
dialogues or anything like that but
there should be some indication that hey

00:22:45.389 --> 00:22:45.399
there should be some indication that hey
 

00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:46.769

it fails saying I tried to but for
whatever reason I can't get the

whatever reason I can't get the
 

00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:53.070
whatever reason I can't get the
information yeah now i will set the

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080
information yeah now i will set the
 

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.379
information yeah now i will set the
iconography of this interface is a

00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:55.389
iconography of this interface is a
 

00:22:55.389 --> 00:22:56.639
iconography of this interface is a
little puzzling to me and you're gonna

00:22:56.639 --> 00:22:56.649
little puzzling to me and you're gonna
 

00:22:56.649 --> 00:22:57.869
little puzzling to me and you're gonna
have to you know just check me on this

00:22:57.869 --> 00:22:57.879
have to you know just check me on this
 

00:22:57.879 --> 00:23:00.869
have to you know just check me on this
because obviously I you know I don't

00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:00.879
because obviously I you know I don't
 

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:04.499
because obviously I you know I don't
actually follow soccer uh you know maybe

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:04.509
actually follow soccer uh you know maybe
 

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:07.529
actually follow soccer uh you know maybe
this is all totally old hat to you but I

00:23:07.529 --> 00:23:07.539
this is all totally old hat to you but I
 

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:10.529
this is all totally old hat to you but I
see this this thing here and I think

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:10.539
see this this thing here and I think
 

00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:13.229
see this this thing here and I think
well maybe looks like a list i don't

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:13.239
well maybe looks like a list i don't
 

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:18.029
well maybe looks like a list i don't
know that open up apparently what I did

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039
know that open up apparently what I did
 

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:19.619
know that open up apparently what I did
there then I get touches on it and then

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:19.629
there then I get touches on it and then
 

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:22.229
there then I get touches on it and then
apparently this baby over here that it

00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:22.239
apparently this baby over here that it
 

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:24.479
apparently this baby over here that it
to me looked like a what I would call a

00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:24.489
to me looked like a what I would call a
 

00:23:24.489 --> 00:23:26.099
to me looked like a what I would call a
soccer ball but I'm just gonna go with

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:26.109
soccer ball but I'm just gonna go with
 

00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:28.129
soccer ball but I'm just gonna go with
leaden actually the top scorers

00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:28.139
leaden actually the top scorers
 

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:30.479
leaden actually the top scorers
interesting signif wouldn't have been

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:30.489
interesting signif wouldn't have been
 

00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:32.489
interesting signif wouldn't have been
obvious to me that really yeah no

00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:32.499
obvious to me that really yeah no
 

00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:33.899
obvious to me that really yeah no
definitely not I would have thought

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:33.909
definitely not I would have thought
 

00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:35.700
definitely not I would have thought
maybe the opposite like if its top

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:35.710
maybe the opposite like if its top
 

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.299
maybe the opposite like if its top
scorers would have been person

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:37.309
scorers would have been person
 

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.430
scorers would have been person
maybe even a person kicking well maybe

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440
maybe even a person kicking well maybe
 

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.169
maybe even a person kicking well maybe
even a goal I don't know there's a few

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:41.179
even a goal I don't know there's a few
 

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:42.730
even a goal I don't know there's a few
options there but definitely the

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:42.740
options there but definitely the
 

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.830
options there but definitely the
iconography needs work the idea of

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840
iconography needs work the idea of
 

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.570
iconography needs work the idea of
having the action bar here is reasonable

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:46.580
having the action bar here is reasonable
 

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.519
having the action bar here is reasonable
but again i would go with a more

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:48.529
but again i would go with a more
 

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:50.289
but again i would go with a more
standard up affordance rather than this

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:50.299
standard up affordance rather than this
 

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:53.259
standard up affordance rather than this
pseudo back button confusing is it an UP

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:53.269
pseudo back button confusing is it an UP
 

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:54.789
pseudo back button confusing is it an UP
button is it a back button is it

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799
button is it a back button is it
 

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.080

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.420
really the navigation is probably your
biggest challenge but otherwise I'm in

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:50.430
biggest challenge but otherwise I'm in
 

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.100

the app itself is pretty good you know

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.110
the app itself is pretty good you know
 

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.690
the app itself is pretty good you know
you've got your stats you've got your

you've got your stats you've got your
 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.730
you've got your stats you've got your

really the key here is that this whole

really the key here is that this whole
 

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.750
really the key here is that this whole
app just kind of needs a navigation

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760

an overflow moaning okay there you go

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:54.269
an overflow moaning okay there you go
 

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:55.489

perfect so this is the overflow menu

00:32:55.489 --> 00:32:55.499
perfect so this is the overflow menu
 

00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:57.169
perfect so this is the overflow menu
here let's try and just get to the

00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179
here let's try and just get to the
 

00:32:57.179 --> 00:32:59.930
here let's try and just get to the
standard action bar if we can so here

00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940
standard action bar if we can so here
 

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.340
standard action bar if we can so here
we've got the action bar this is your

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:01.350
we've got the action bar this is your
 

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.450
we've got the action bar this is your
typical actions and then everything

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460
typical actions and then everything
 

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.060
typical actions and then everything
which is behind that menu button is the

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.070
which is behind that menu button is the
 

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.889
which is behind that menu button is the
overflow menu so that's where you want

00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899
overflow menu so that's where you want
 

00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:09.289
overflow menu so that's where you want
to put things which users need to get to

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299
to put things which users need to get to
 

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:11.239
to put things which users need to get to

but it's probably not the most important
 

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:13.700
but it's probably not the most important
thing so settings anything like about

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:13.710
thing so settings anything like about
 

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.799

other flow exactly and it's worth

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840
other flow exactly and it's worth
 

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.509
other flow exactly and it's worth
mentioning that the overflow menu

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519
mentioning that the overflow menu
 

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.820

you'd actually see more action icons

00:33:32.899 --> 00:33:32.909
you'd actually see more action icons
 

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:35.330
you'd actually see more action icons

in general what you want to do is think

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:11.409
the second major portion of your action
 

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.619
the second major portion of your action
bar which is the action piece and that's

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:13.629
bar which is the action piece and that's
 

00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:17.010
bar which is the action piece and that's
going to be a set of icons if if you

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.020
going to be a set of icons if if you
 

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.020
going to be a set of icons if if you
want you can put text here as well

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.030
want you can put text here as well
 

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.369
want you can put text here as well
although that's usually not quite as

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:20.379
although that's usually not quite as
 

00:34:20.379 --> 00:34:21.570
although that's usually not quite as
effective it certainly takes up more

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.580
effective it certainly takes up more
 

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.820
effective it certainly takes up more
horizontal space now and then the

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:23.830
horizontal space now and then the
 

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.169
horizontal space now and then the
overflow now you will also see on some

00:34:28.169 --> 00:34:28.179
overflow now you will also see on some
 

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.270
overflow now you will also see on some
devices on some abs a menu that looks

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280
devices on some abs a menu that looks
 

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.090
devices on some abs a menu that looks
like the overflow menu down here in the

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:33.100
like the overflow menu down here in the
 

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.010
like the overflow menu down here in the
corner now we call that the menu button

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.020
corner now we call that the menu button
 

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.800
corner now we call that the menu button
of shame and the reason is the only time

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:37.810
of shame and the reason is the only time
 

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.810
of shame and the reason is the only time
you see that menu button is when you

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:39.820
you see that menu button is when you
 

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.990
you see that menu button is when you
haven't updated your app for an SDK a

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000
haven't updated your app for an SDK a
 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.270
haven't updated your app for an SDK a
target SDK that's greater than honeycomb

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280
target SDK that's greater than honeycomb
 

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.879
target SDK that's greater than honeycomb
absolutely and the most so now this is a

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:47.889
absolutely and the most so now this is a
 

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.830
absolutely and the most so now this is a
possible change so there's there's two

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:49.840
possible change so there's there's two
 

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.570
possible change so there's there's two
versions of this there's the the

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:51.580
versions of this there's the the
 

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.210
versions of this there's the the
unfortunate version where you've got a

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:54.220
unfortunate version where you've got a
 

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.610
unfortunate version where you've got a
nap and you have an updated it yet and

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:56.620
nap and you have an updated it yet and
 

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.050
nap and you have an updated it yet and
so you haven't figured out how your

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:58.060
so you haven't figured out how your
 

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.470
so you haven't figured out how your
pre-existing menu is going to work with

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480
pre-existing menu is going to work with
 

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.600
pre-existing menu is going to work with
an action bar and so that takes a little

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:03.610
an action bar and so that takes a little
 

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.430
an action bar and so that takes a little
bit of thought so that's not good but

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440
bit of thought so that's not good but
 

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.070
bit of thought so that's not good but
what this is is the real the real button

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.080
what this is is the real the real button
 

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.990
what this is is the real the real button
of shame which is here and it does

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000
of shame which is here and it does
 

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.210
of shame which is here and it does
absolutely nothing it's all you need to

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:12.220
absolutely nothing it's all you need to
 

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.590
absolutely nothing it's all you need to
do is change your target SDK and that

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:13.600
do is change your target SDK and that
 

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.880
do is change your target SDK and that
will go away you know the worst thing is

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:14.890
will go away you know the worst thing is
 

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.530
will go away you know the worst thing is
on some devices with with custom ui's

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540
on some devices with with custom ui's
 

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.660
on some devices with with custom ui's
having that button there will actually

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:20.670
having that button there will actually
 

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.390
having that button there will actually
do a bunch of layout changes oh wow

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400
do a bunch of layout changes oh wow
 

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.340

button it's nice so having that be empty
 

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.090
button it's nice so having that be empty
is extremely unfortunate me now you just

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:33.100
is extremely unfortunate me now you just
 

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.290

features come into play well I think

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:28.340
features come into play well I think
 

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.160
features come into play well I think
that's this is the this is the issues

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.170
that's this is the this is the issues
 

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.010
that's this is the this is the issues
that if you request certain permissions

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:33.020
that if you request certain permissions
 

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.650
that if you request certain permissions
then for legacy reasons that implies a

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:35.660
then for legacy reasons that implies a
 

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.720
then for legacy reasons that implies a
feature requirement as well on GPS is

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:37.730
feature requirement as well on GPS is
 

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.090
feature requirement as well on GPS is
one of those if you request either fine

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:40.100
one of those if you request either fine
 

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.830
one of those if you request either fine
or coarse locate well know if you

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:41.840
or coarse locate well know if you
 

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.470
or coarse locate well know if you
request fine location then the system

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480
request fine location then the system
 

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.630
request fine location then the system
will imply that well actually you can

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640
will imply that well actually you can
 

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.300
will imply that well actually you can
probably meant to require GPS as well

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:49.310
probably meant to require GPS as well
 

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.520
probably meant to require GPS as well
yeah so you're absolutely right you know

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:51.530
yeah so you're absolutely right you know
 

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.400
yeah so you're absolutely right you know
being unable to install that on a system

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:54.410
being unable to install that on a system
 

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.380
being unable to install that on a system
that doesn't have a GPS is an indication

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:56.390
that doesn't have a GPS is an indication
 

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.570
that doesn't have a GPS is an indication
that the app has done something that we

00:36:58.570 --> 00:36:58.580
that the app has done something that we

optional permission that are an optional
 

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.570
optional permission that are an optional
feature but more importantly they're

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:10.580
feature but more importantly they're
 

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.160
feature but more importantly they're
requiring fine location which is unusual

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.170
requiring fine location which is unusual
 

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.620
requiring fine location which is unusual
and almost always indicates that they

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:17.630
and almost always indicates that they
 

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.359
and almost always indicates that they

have an ad network that's attempting to
 

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:21.849
have an ad network that's attempting to

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:21.859
track you at an inappropriate level yeah
 

00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:23.109
track you at an inappropriate level yeah
this is true i mean it obviously it's

00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119
this is true i mean it obviously it's
 

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.190
this is true i mean it obviously it's
going to depend on the app and you're

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200
going to depend on the app and you're
 

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.900
going to depend on the app and you're
gonna have to figure out based on you

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:25.910
gonna have to figure out based on you
 

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.340
gonna have to figure out based on you
know what they offer that makes sense

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:27.350
know what they offer that makes sense
 

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.010
know what they offer that makes sense
and I suspect if it's you know if it's

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.020
and I suspect if it's you know if it's

may be using the fine location to figure
out where you are to make sure that they

anything they do is if you if you are

anything they do is if you if you are
doing that then that's it's totally

doing that then that's it's totally
 

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:49.720
doing that then that's it's totally

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520
could be hijacked so easily so I think

you get around this you can simply
specify a user's feature and specify a

and the rear facing camera is what you
 

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.380

that's a little confusing on us it can

the rule of thumb is don't ask for a

the rule of thumb is don't ask for a

the rule of thumb is don't ask for a
feature or permission unless your app

feature or permission unless your app
 

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.310

depends on it that's it that's what your

talked we looked at the one app that had
some things we didn't like about it and

some things we didn't like about it and
 

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:39.200
some things we didn't like about it and
I think it'd be fair to look at some of

I think it'd be fair to look at some of
