LISA JACKSON: Because you
came here for an education.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.630
And as the years
go by, you're going

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.990
to realize that you
absolutely got one.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.600
Maybe no education is
important as learning

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.440
that being part of a diverse
community takes work.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.510
And it takes practice.


00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.350
And give and take on both sides,
and compassion for each other,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.020
above all.

SANJEEV KULKARNI: The process
of mastering a discipline

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.000
and contributing something
new to a body of knowledge

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.260
with a deep focus is, in fact,
broadening and liberating.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620
It enables one to pursue
new directions, new fields,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.220
or entirely new endeavors, with
the abilities and confidence

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.850
not just to succeed,
but to excel.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.520
Congratulations on
your accomplishments.

MISHA SEMENOV: Even as we
celebrate our accomplishments

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.590
here, we must begin a lifelong
journey of applying our

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.210
chustvitelnost, our
child-like openness

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.440
to our everyday
interactions-- sharing

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.870
the gifts we have been
given with others,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.220
with those who are forced
to grow up too soon.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.110
With those who helped
make possible our standing

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.800
here today.

CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: My
colleagues and I on the faculty

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.750

fellow alumni and trustees

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.530
hope you carry the spirit
of Princeton into the world.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.420

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.530
to meet the challenges
that lie ahead.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.440
For in this special
and auspicious day,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.620
you our graduate students and
our undergraduates seniors,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.390
