00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.860
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For a vertical line, the slope is not defined. Remember that if we want to

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.021
find slope, it would take the difference between two y coordinates along this

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:12.117
line, But then, because all of the x coordinates are the same, we would have to

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:16.045
divide by 0, which we know is a major no, no. Or, at least, not allowed, if we

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:17.479
want to define this slope.
