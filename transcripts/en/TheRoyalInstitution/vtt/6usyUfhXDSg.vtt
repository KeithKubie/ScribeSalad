00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.970
If you haven't seen this before, it's a really simple thing to set up.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.689
I had vinegar in the bottom of the
bottle and bicarbonate of soda in the balloon.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.619
When you mix them by tipping it in, they react

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.799
to form carbon dioxide and that's what's
inflated the balloon.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.620
It's a really fun way to blow
up a balloon,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.159
but we can use this very simple reaction
to do a slightly longer activity that

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.260
gets the children really thinking about
science.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340
This is an activity that I call 'fizzy cubes'. I've just got an 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.180
ice cube tray and I've put bicarbonate
of soda in half the tray,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.399
roughly similar amount in each cube, and
in the other half

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.410
I've put in edible ingredients from around
kitchen. I've got soy sauce,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.310
honey, lime juice and apple juice, orange
juice, and vinegar.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.640
Now the activity itself is
really simple we're just gonna spoon the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.740
bicarbonate of soda

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.100
into into each ingredient and look
really closely at what happens.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.420
What's it doing?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.610
Fizzing up!

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.040
What's coming out? Bubbles!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.650
This activity is all about observing
what happens when you mix two things

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.540
together,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.750
so it's a good idea to ask questions to
make sure children notice the different

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.470
behaviours

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.900
when the bicarbonate of soda is added to
the different ingredients.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.370
Is that one fizzing more or less than the soy sauce?

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.360
More. Woah it's nearly coming out!

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.229
The fizzing is a result of a chemical
reaction.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.380
In simple terms this is when two things
come together

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.140
to make something new. It's useful to
point out that the new thing being

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.220
produced in this reaction is a gas,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.110
carbon dioxide, which is what makes the
fizz, or tiny bubbles.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.160
Is it still doing it? As you add more is it still fizzing up?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.380
The amount of fizzing depends on how acidic the other ingredient is.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.240
The bicarbonate of soda doesn't react with ingredients that are not acidic.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.320
You can use this activity to get into
the balloon inflation by asking

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.250
whether making gas like this could
be useful, and then suggest inflating

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.780
a balloon using the best reaction.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.280
It's not generally a
good idea to eat your science experiments.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.760
But it's yummy!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.760
Put some powder in and then some vinegar,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.049
and we mix them in the bottle, and put the baloon on top.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.739
I found that blowing up the balloon once before the experiment

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.310
to pre-stretch it really helps, as does
making a paper funnel

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.860
to get the powder into the balloon. Okay
how many spoons shall we put in?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.420
Four. Why four?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.580
If you've got time, and don't mind the mess, you can investigate howmuch of the ingredients

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.840
are needed to blow up the balloon well.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.360
I use about 8 teaspoons of bicarbonate,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.680
and fill the bottle about a third of the
way up with vinegar to make sure the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.959
balloon inflates properly.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.599
Perfect, that's it.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.329
What's it filled with now? Air.

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.849
Do you think it's the same as the air that we breathe?

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.769
No. Why not?

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.700
Because it's made out of this, and air that we breathe isn't made out of this.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.980
Ah, very good!

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.760
Now I know that we've looked at chemical
reactions,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.810
Viola's a bit too young for that but it
doesn't really matter.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.980
What we both got out of it is is that we
were

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.370
looking closely at what happened during
the reactions, and had a good time doing it.
