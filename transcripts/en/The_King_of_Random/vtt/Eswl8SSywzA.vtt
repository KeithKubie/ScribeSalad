00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in the past

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.129
We've done a few different

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.240
experiments using clay

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.559
Including making our own clay that we found on the side of the riverbank and a couple of tests of firing clay in a barbecue

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.809
Today we're gonna try and build something specific out of clay and see if we can get it to work for this project I do

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.300
Have some commercially available

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.260
Ceramic clay instead of using the river clay the reason

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.940
The reason I'm doing that is I might want to try firing the project we do today

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.920
And I want to make sure that I'm using some clay that has the proper mixture of grog or other additives to make sure that

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.920
It fires correctly without cracking too much our River clay can fire, but so far

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.680
It's got some serious problems with cracking

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.829
And I haven't quite nailed down the formula of what to do to stop that from happening

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.960
There's plenty of places where you can buy ceramic clay commercially a lot of hobby stores carry or I got this

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.079
25 pound block on Amazon where surprisingly cheap we'll put a link down in the description if you prefer to do that the goal is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.499
To take this clay in to shape it into a functional musical instrument

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.280
We're going to try to make a clay

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.849
Ocarina all we're going to need is a handful size ball of clay a little bit of water and a few popsicle sticks

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.339
This is a water-based clay, so it can dry out

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
So I'm just gonna break off the piece that I need and then seal the plastic bag so the rest of it doesn't go bad

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.400
There we go this ball slightly smaller than my fist is probably more than enough, so we'll just set that aside

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Close up the rest this play

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.519
Sort of just trying to squeeze extra air out of the bag now

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.560
That we have our clay

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.610
I want to prep our popsicle sticks to shape them just a little bit into more useful tools

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.639
The shaping on these sticks is going to be very basic and quick

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
I want a flat edge on one end of the popsicle stick so let's cut it to the shape we need

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.379
Now let's just take a little bit of sandpaper smooth that cut down and taper it on one side so it's sloped

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.259
You can now see that the front of this popsicle stick

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.659
Sort of slopes down into a chisel shape that'll make it easier to get some of the details we need in our clay

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.209
Let's do the same thing to the other three popsicle sticks

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.180
You might only need two of these, but I like to have a couple of backups

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.539
Before we start sculpting the clay into the shape of our ocarina. Let's spend a couple minutes

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.130
Just throwing it down on the table. This will help force out any air bubbles that could cause problems when you fire it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.170
There we go our clay is pretty well wedged

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.350
I think meaning most of the air bubbles have been forced out of it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.339
And that's what we want that means it's a lot less likely to burst when we put it in the kiln

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.749
So now let's start by breaking our clay up into three pieces one smaller piece

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.360
Which we'll set aside for a moment smaller than a golf ball

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
bigger than a marble penny in between those two

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.580
Now we want to take the rest of our little play ball and divide it in half

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.979
Doesn't need to be perfectly in half just mostly in half will work pretty well

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.239
Now what we need to do is form our clay into the shape of the body of an ocarina

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.609
I am going to try to get a sort of teardrop shape for my ocarina and see if we can get that to work

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.909
Just start by rolling it at a little bit of a taper. That's gonna give us narrow. End and a wide end

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.579
Then just can use my thumb and pinch this out, so we have sort of a long

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.970
teardrop shaped dish

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.459
and go that looks pretty good just

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.559
Flip it up head down and press it down a little bit so our edges are all meeting the table

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.820
That means you're gonna have one flat plane surface now that we've got our first half made. Let's make another one just like it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.960
That's a pretty good nice hollow

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.669
Shape let's do the same thing flip it upside down and make sure that the edge is coming all the way down to the table

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.350
All the way around it now

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.190
This is looking pretty good

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.010
But I think I actually want to spread it out and make it a little bit flatter and wider, so I'm gonna try doing that

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.250
sort of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.529
Widen it up a little bit on both of them

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.810
there we go if we can just

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.830
Visualize putting those two together. I think we're starting to see a pretty decent ocarina shape now we have our two halves

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.780
I'm just gonna smooth them out a little bit

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.880
It'll probably end up getting a little bit messed up later as we're adding on other parts and making it all work

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.149
But just for the heck of it. Let's smooth down the outside a little bit

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.879
There we go we've got our two halves and now what we need to do is put them together and get them to stay connected

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.199
Really well one thing that really helps with this is if we score the two sides of clay

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.200
I'm just gonna take the back of this knife

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.019
Make some scratch marks all along the outside Ridge here

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.589
Now I'm going to add just a little bit of water going all the way around one side

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.720
Now let's press the two sides together add just a little bit of pressure

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.120
We really want them to stick pretty well sometimes you can even see a little bit of water starting to ooze out

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.750
It's a good sign

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.140
Now I'm just going to use my fingers and thumbs

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.989
Try and smear the clay down over the seam, so we have a nice permanent bond

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.960
Now this sort of

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.919
Teardrop or almond shaped piece of clay is full of air the whole thing's Hollow would probably float if we put it on water

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.639
Right now, but it's a water-based clay, and that could sort of make it dissolve a little bit

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.229
So I'm not gonna do that but this is where we're trying to get to we now have a hollow piece of clay shaped somewhat

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.109
Like a teardrop or almond moving on to the next stage

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.190
We're gonna grab our little piece of clay that we set aside and one of our popsicle stick tools

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.980
Let's form the piece of clay into a sort of flattened cylinder so first. I'm just going to roll it that's longer than we need

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.060
Press it down

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.510
Pull it again there. We go. This is just a little bit over an inch long

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.989
You can see it's a good sized little cylinder now

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.370
I'm just going to take a couple of fingers and smush it down a little bit flat. Not all the way

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.530
It's somewhat flat so what we're going to do is this is going to be our mouthpiece

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.450
Which attaches to our ocarina about right here the side of our ocarina is sloped?

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.279
So let's take a knife and cut our mouthpiece at a similar angle so that will fit nicely on to the side

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.630
There we go we can see that's a much better matchup than when it was just the square end

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.150
Now before we attach it we want to take our popsicle stick get it wet in our cup of water

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.220
And then we want to run the popsicle stick through the length of this piece of clay that's going to be our mouthpiece

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.779
There we go we have that popsicle stick going in one side traveling all the way through the mouthpiece

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.570
And sticking out about an inch on the other side now holding onto the popsicle stick not the mouthpiece itself

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.639
We're going to push the popsicle stick through the side wall of the body of the ocarina

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.749
Once you actually punched through the clay wall sort of has a lot more give to it

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.350
And we don't want our mouthpiece sticking straight out from the side

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.820
We want it kind of angled down this way the popsicle stick inside the mouthpiece is

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.140
Angled so that it lines up approximately with the roof of our ocarina

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.210
We have that hole now

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.500
I'm just going to do the same scoring on this clay that I did when I put the other pieces together

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.490
Water

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.369
There we go now we're gonna press this back on

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.220
I'm gonna try and press our mouthpiece into the clay we want to get it to bond, but of course

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.520
We don't want to push it so hard that it collapses the body of the ocarina

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.820
At this point what we have is a hollow body that will be in the sound chamber for our ocarina and a tube coming off

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.570
Of it and that's where we're gonna blow the air into the instrument just to check

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.909
I'm gonna see if we can still slide this popsicle stick

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.300
in and out

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.720
Because we don't want it to grip too hard on to the size of the clay you can see that as the popsicle stick has

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.619
Absorbed water it started getting more of the clay stuck to it. I'm just gonna scrape that off

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.230
Now I'll dip the stick in our water again, and I'm gonna put it back into the mouthpiece in ocarina

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.670
Just the same way it was before

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:48.119
We now want to take a second popsicle stick and use it to start carving out a hole for the music will be played

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.429
So let's get that popsicle stick wet the same way we did it the first one and now we need to start using it to

00:07:53.430 --> 00:08:00.060
Cut into our clay just barely after where the mouthpiece meets the body of the clay we want to cut down into the clay

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.949
lined up with where our first popsicle stick is you can see if the

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.629
Edges of this popsicle stick were visible. It'd be about right here and

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.410
here

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:18.089
so I'm gonna take this popsicle stick and cut down into the clay and try and hit the first popsicle stick and

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.869
Go this should cut through the clay fairly easily

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.940
And then of course it stops when it hits the popsicle stick so we now have a little slot going down in there

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.950
This is tapered so it's just hitting in one point. You can't see either popsicle stick down in that. Hole yet

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.759
What we want to do is about the same width of our popsicle stick

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.059
We then want to cut another slot that goes down

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.299
And hits the first possible stick

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.779
In fact we can go on all four sides. We just want a square piece here. That's kind of cut out now

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.239
I'm going to use this popsicle stick and just sort of scoop out the piece of clay

00:08:54.370 --> 00:09:00.239
That we've just cut at this point you can see a little bit of the popsicle stick that's running through the mouthpiece into the body

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:06.360
Let's just try and carve away the clay down in there until we can see a nice square piece of popsicle stick

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.990
Now we've got the body

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.950
We've got the mouthpiece

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.479
And we have a hole that leads down into the popsicle stick which is a channel from one to the other

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.409
at this point let's take one of our popsicle stick tools and try and add a

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.650
45-degree slope from the top of the ocarina

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.799
Down to the point where this hole meets the popsicle stick

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.849
This side of the clay meets the popsicle stick right here at the back of our square hole

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.960
And that's where we want the base of our slope to be so we're going to slope from this point

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.660
Back to about right here

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.620
Start taking a little bit of clay off at a tone

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.909
We can now see the clay running from the top of the ocarina

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:54.079
Sloping down at about a 45 degree angle to where it runs into this popsicle stick

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.380
Now let's try to gently slide the first popsicle stick out of the ocarina body and mouthpiece

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.250
One thing we want to do is verify that the very edge

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.649
At the bottom of our slope is nice and straight

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:10.099
You can see that as I pulled the popsicle stick out it got a little bit

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.209
Wavy, so, I'm just gonna use the tools and see if I can straighten that out a little bit oh

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.830
That's not perfect, but it's a fairly straight edge. I'm down here at the bottom

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.989
There's this shelving plate and one thing we want to make sure is that it sticks farther into the ocarina body

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.070
Than this piece of clay on the top at this point if everything has been done correctly

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.379
We should be able to blow into it and get a musical tone

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.730
Hey, we got it to work

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:45.289
Beautiful, I'll let you know this one actually worked on the first try which is I think the first time I've ever had this succeed

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.980
The first time I did it

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.010
this setup is very finicky and

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:54.200
Fiddly and a lot of the time you're going to need to tinker with it and toy with it a lot before you really get

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.539
a nice tone if you blow into it, and you just get a

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.839
Sound then you're just going to need to keep playing with it and make sure you have every different point lined up

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:04.839
Just the way it needs to be

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.350
Sounds kind of like a train whistle

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.980
Not bad

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.250
Ceramic clay is non-toxic if you actually eat any of the clay it might plug up your digestive tract a little bit

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.570
And that's not gonna be comfortable, so you don't want to eat your clay, but if it gets on your mouth a little bit

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.239
It's not something you have to worry about this actually works fairly

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.479
Well, so let's do a little bit of cosmetic clean-up to make it look nicer on the outside

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.189
At this point our ocarina is functioning, but it only plays one note

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.100
So it's really kind of more of a whistle than an ocarina

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.700
What we need to do is add some finger holes that will let us change the tones

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.280
I'll admit I'm actually not an expert on where how many what size of holes should be put into an ocarina?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.830
To really get the best variety of notes

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.820
So I'm just gonna take a drill bit

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.160
Start carefully adding some holes to it and see if they'll help me change the tone at all

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.590
Trying to sort of figure out where I'd put my fingers, and I'm just gonna try putting holes in that spot well

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.590
Here's one right here. Let's see what happens if a

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.880
Drill a nice little hole right here

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.819
Well the first hole works, let's see if we can add a second one

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.220
I'm gonna try putting this hole over where this finger should go

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.250
It's a different tone, but it's only a very slight change

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.020
I wonder if I need to make that hole a little bit bigger to get the higher pitch that I'm looking for

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.630
It's definitely higher

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.580
It's not beautiful

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.279
it plays and it makes different notes which are

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.430
Definitely important features as you can hear it's not like the nicest richest tone

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.190
And I think part of that is that even though I've been using a drill bit

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.710
some little bits of clay are now sticking down into the body of the ocarina and that doesn't help with the

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:28.169
Sound really flowing through it very nicely. I'm gonna see if I can take my exacto knife

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:35.280
I'm gonna try and cut a hole into the body of the ocarina and smooth out the surface where I drilled the sound holes

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:42.779
All right, I think I managed to smooth down the area around the holes a little bit now

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.749
Let's use this same piece of clay and plug up the hole that we cut

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.930
All right, let's see if it still plays after we cut the bottom off

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.289
Yeah, I think that's pretty good, I think that really did help bring out the tone again

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.250
Doesn't quite work for the Zelda songs

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.270
That's the best, it sounded yet, well, I think if I keep adding holes to it. I might ruin it

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:13.950
like I said

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.259
I'm not a professional ocarina maker

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:21.299
This is just sort of a fun toy instrument that you can make at home just using some clay

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.849
And I'm pretty happy with how this one has turned out. It's got a good shape to it. I've got four different tones

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.310
I might even try adding a few more holes once. It's dried out more when the clay is more dry

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.609
I should be able to drill into it without pushing it out the bottom

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.260
It will act more like a particulate

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.289
Which the drill bit should be able to get out easily if you're trying to make your own ocarina

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.849
And you're having problems getting it to produce a tone. I've made a little diagram that might help you troubleshoot

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:52.930
What the problem is this whole image is a cross-section of the ocarina if we were to take a very sharp knife and cut?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.229
It from this point all the way back through

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.259
This is what we would see if we looked at it on the side, so this right here is the mouthpiece

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.059
This right here is the 45-degree slope that we have in our ocarina

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:13.088
This is the inside of the chamber a couple of things we need to look out for this distance right here is

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.209
Approximately the same as the width of your popsicle stick this will give us a nice square shape looking down into the hole

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.859
We have made in the ocarina the bottom piece of clay should extend out farther

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.820
than the top piece of clay you should be able to look down into the ocarina and

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.300
See this little lip of clay sticking out farther than this bit

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.849
another common problem is for this edge to be the wrong shape it needs to be a nice clean line and

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:43.450
Approximately a 45 degree angle there are two important things going on with this point of the clay as well

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:51.159
the first is that this point needs to be in between the top of our air channel and the bottom of our air channel I

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.359
Found I have a little bit more success if it's slightly above the middle

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.560
But it should be lower than the height of the top of our air channel

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:04.419
The other point to look out for is that the air needs to be traveling into the ocarina

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.089
split on this 45 degree angle

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:12.458
And then be traveling right along the roof of the ocarina where it will swirl around in the side

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:16.629
What we can't have is for the air to go in and then have a large

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.989
Cavity that goes up we don't want this 45 degree angle to be pointing down into the cavity

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:26.949
So this is what we don't want we don't want our air to come in

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:34.630
hit the angle of the clay and then have to go up and around you can see here that it travels in and

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:38.289
Can go right into a smooth swirling motion here

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.589
When it goes in and gets split against our 45 degree angle you would have to go up into the chamber before it started moving

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:51.039
So we need to avoid that and make sure we follow this the way we do that is when we're first putting our popsicle

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.200
The inside the clay body we don't want it pointed at this angle

00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:01.379
We need to make sure that it's lined up so that the popsicle stick is resting against the roof of the ocarina inside

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.610
There you have it now

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.059
You know how to make a working?

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:10.139
Ocarina using just a little bit of ceramic clay and some popsicle sticks this might work pretty well with other types of clay as well

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.359
I haven't personally tried any air dry clay

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:19.529
Or baked dry clays I should warn you I do not recommend you try this with any polymer clays likes kopi or fimo as those

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.729
Can be toxic and you really don't want to be putting them in your mouth? Thanks for joining us for this project today

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.860
We look forward to the next one talk to you then I

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Need another hole to keep playing the song

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.609
Can't go high enough to finish it pressing clay down into the body of the ocarina and messing with the tone

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.990
Hey guys if you are on twitter come follow me on twitter at the king of random

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.990
It's a great place to connect with me one on one

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.079
That's all I'm gonna say about that because if you want to you will and if you don't you won't
