00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.230
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So, let me
welcome you all to the African

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.840
and Middle Eastern
Division on this beginning

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.330
of spring season and New Year.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.010
Happy Nowruz to all of you.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.200 position:56%
And I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, the Chief of
the African and Middle East Division

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.500
and I'm delighted to be
able to greet you this way

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.070 position:56%
since we have Professor Fatemeh
Keshavarz with us to open the season

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.420
with her new book, Lyrics
of Life: Sa'di on Love,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.400
Cosmopolitanism and Care of Self.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.480
What could a more auspicious title
with which to start the New Year.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.120
As most of you already
know our division is made

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.400
up of three sections, the
African, the near east

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.870
and the Hebraic sections were
responsible for materials

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.590
for 78 different countries in
the near east, Central Asia,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.830
the Caucasus, as well as
from the entire continent

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.670
of Africa, North and Sub-Sahara.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.290
And we're very active in
acquiring, developing collections,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.170
briefing visitors coming from
all the countries of the region.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.020
Organizing programs,
symposia, workshops, exhibits.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.410 position:56%
We also invite scholars and experts,
we have researched and down work

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.870
on our areas of responsibility.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.350
And we invite them to share
with us their ideas, their work,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.600
their research, so that
we learn from them.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.120
And so, that our collections
come a live.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.860
And who could best put
the Persian collections

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.910
and make them alive than Fatemeh.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.410
And although Hirad is
going to introduce her,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.620
I want to say just briefly, a few
things, a few personal things.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.510
I got to know Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780
on the Persian book
exhibit a few years ago

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.680
and discovered what an
extraordinary woman she is.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.190 position:56%
She is a really SAS woman, a poetess
of incredible talent, a writer,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.950
a thinker, an artist, scholar,
a woman of so many dimensions

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.870
that it is difficult
to find the words.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.730
And I'm going to let her speak in
her own way to say those things.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.870
And so that you can have
a sense of who Fatemeh is.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.460 position:56%
But, so you would end for the treat.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.060
I'm telling you this.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.550
And, now Hirad is going to
officially introduce her, so Hirad.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.360
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank
you, thank you very much.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.130
Thank you, Mary-Jane for
a wonderful introduction.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.480
I'm delighted that you could make
it here in the middle of a workday.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.900
It's-- I know not easy to get to
the Library, not that convenient.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.760
This is the season for Nowruz and
New Year, the arrival of spring.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.580
I want to wish everyone who
celebrates Nowruz a happy spring

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.440
as well as to other folks who enjoy
seeing nature come back to life.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.330
This is a tradition celebrated
all the way from the western gates

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.230
of China if you like
Central Asia, Afghanistan,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.350
Iran, into Anatolia the Kurds.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.730
And it is a age-old tradition
that this entire region celebrate.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.310
I would like to also say that it is
quite wonderful to see that Iranian

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.430
and Afghan and Central Asian
communities here making this a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.700
tradition that has become part

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.840
of the American culture
in recent years.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.320
And every year you have more

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.300
and more extensive
gatherings and ceremonies.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.160
You would also like to then switch
to our wonderful collaboration

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.870
with Dr. Keshavarz and the
University of Maryland.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.510
I could not have put together
the exhibit without the expertise

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.710
and the help of Dr. Keshavarz and
the wonderful staff that she has,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.160
at UMD at University of Maryland.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.240
I would take a second
and read her bio.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.050
She really doesn't
need an introduction.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.250
Everyone knows who she is, but it
would be right here to at least

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.280
and would be a right thing
to do to introduce her.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.210
Let me quickly put up
the program as well.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.360
Today's program is
focusing on the new book

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.860
that Dr. Keshavarz has put out.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.170
And she will be speaking to you.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.080
Her accomplishments are extensive,
so I'm going to quickly go over it

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.230
and I'm sorry if I don't cover
everything, my apologies.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.360
Fatemeh Keshavarz is a director
of the school of languages,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.130

and the chair and director

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.940

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.810
And Dr. Keshavarz was born and
raised in the City of Shiraz,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.290 position:56%

where she chaired the Department of
Asian and Near Eastern Languages,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.850
literatures from 2004 to 2011.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.390
In 2012, Dr. Keshavarz has
joined the University of Maryland

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.630
as a Roshan Institute chair in
Persian Studies and director

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.450
of Roshan Institute
for Persian Studies.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.740
Dr. Keshavarz is author of
award winning books including

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.050

She has also published other books
and numerous journals and articles.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.130
She has a published poet in
both Persian and English,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.560
an activist for just
justice and peace.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.200
And she was invited to speak
at the UN general assembly

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.930
on the significance
of cultural education.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.790
Her NPR show, "The Ecstatic Faith

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.290
of Rumi" brought her the
Peabody award in 2008.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.260
And the same year she received
the Hershel Walker Peace

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.620
and Justice award.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.270
I think I said long enough list.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.320
There is more, but I would like
to invite her so she can speak.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.670
Thank you very much.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.310
OK. Thanks very much.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.610
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Thank you so much.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.640
I'm really speechless.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.440
Thank you.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:05.340
I hope that what I present
meets the expectation after all

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.420
of this love and, you know,
amazing words given to me.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.210
Let me just briefly say that the
collaboration with the Library

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.320
of Congress is being equally great
joy for me and for University

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.440
of Maryland just being in this
amazing space dedicated to learning

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:35.360
and to supporting those who work
to learn is in itself epic really

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.040
and we're wonderful to be--

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.620 position:56%
feel wonderful and wonderfully
fortunate really to be a part of it.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.920
So thank you so much.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.420
So, today I'm going
to talk about Sa'di

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.300
and although I'm speechless
he never was.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.680
So hopefully something
beautiful and wonderful will come

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.410
out of everything that
he has said in his life

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.580
and there was plenty
that he did say.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.740
And what I'm hoping that by the end
of this hour you have is a taste

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:17.610
of what the title of this talk
is giving which is whose idea

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.710
as a lover, as cosmopolitan
traveler, and as an educator

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.500
as a person who care
about helping people build

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.150
and rebuild their selves.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.240
I'm hoping that you get a
taste of his words and the pure

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.170
and strong sensuality which is a
very important part of his work.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:43.130
The spiritual capacity that
he brought through his words,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.120
the ethical values that he
put forwards the cosmopolitan

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.280 position:56%
consciousness that he supported, the
social awareness that was connected

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.410 position:56%
with his work, the very lively humor
and I'm going to put a little bit

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.110
of emphasis on that and of
course, his poetic precision

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:07.740
about which I'm going to say
a few words at the very end.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:17.580
So, let me say why I'm saying,
a taste, because I really think

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.720
that there is not enough
room to do any kind

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.370
of in-depths dipping to his work.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.740
But, what I'm hoping is that you'll
do that afterwards, that everybody,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.160
they would be looking for
translation of Sa'di's work,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.150
that you would be looking for
everything that people wrote on

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.980
and because of the
taste that I have given.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.880
Let me also by way of a
methodological note say

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.080
that I believe that every work of
criticism of analysis has to go

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.460
in two different directions.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.720
It has to analyze and criticize the
subject matter that it is focusing

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.930
on and it-- at the same time
has to stay critical of itself.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:11.940 position:56%
In other words, it has to-- what you
are doing, and why you're doing it,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.040
and the way you are doing
it as the analytical person,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.530 position:56%
as the person providing the analysis
has to be at the same time more

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.190
or less even on the same level

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.500
that your analysis of
the other work goes.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:36.170
So, why am I doing-- why am
I writing Sa'di for example?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.990
He is virtually unknown
to English speakers.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.560
He was a trendsetter.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.800 position:56%
Now, a lot of people will say, there
are many ways to study literature,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.570
you don't have to just go
to big names, great man,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.860
particularly most of
them were big man.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:59.330 position:56%
But I would say that many traditions
have their great people not

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.850
yet known, not yet brought
out in to the consciousness

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.490
of the literary consciousness
of the world.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.230
At large and Sa'di is one of them.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:14.750
And that he represents in
many ways a very diverse

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.950 position:56%
and very complex literary tradition.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.710
So it's not just him,
it's what he carries

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.090
with him through the centuries.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.240
He's also very keen on
experimenting with a wide range

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.550
of generic possibilities.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.190
So, it almost leaves no
generic form and touched except

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.180
for I think [inaudible]
they showed quite traits.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.450
I don't know that he
ever really showed

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.370
that much interest in that form.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:50.180
And he penetrates this
temporal distance

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.280
that we have which is 800 years.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.580
It's not a joke.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.360
And he really speaks with you
as if he's a poet sitting next

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.920
to you writing his words today.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.260
And despite all of these, he
went through the 20th century

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.510
as not only-- not really
very well-known

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:14.390
but heavenly criticized
particularly by Iranian critics.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:20.440
But many others as well, and as we
look at the work that he produced

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.130
that should come to the surface
why that happened in part was

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.390
because he had such
mastery of the language.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.210
It almost seemed magical.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:35.990
And so people began to think of
him as something of a wordsmith,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.120
something of a magician with words

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.010
and really didn't do much
focus on the content.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.470
Others criticized him for
praising kings and we are going

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.780
to talk about that a little bit.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.140 position:56%
So, for all these reasons I thought
that here is somebody to talk about.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.390
Besides the fact that it
was really a great joy

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.880
to read him again and
to write about him.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.330
Now, in terms of dates,
his dates are 1210 to 1291.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.320
We are not absolutely certain
about the date of his passing.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:18.240
That's true of many
people of that era, also,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.250
because it became a
legendary figure.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.410
I mean, it was really
impossible to be a Persian speaker

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.770
and not know something of Sa'di.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.560
There are so many anecdotes
where you go somewhere

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.790
and somebody discovers in
Tajikistan, in Uzbekistan,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.830
in India that you are
a Persian speaker

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.090
and the first thing they
say, [foreign language],

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.960
what do you know of Sa'di's works?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.920
So, when you get to that
level, people give you the kind

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.310 position:56%
of velvet cloak of invented stories.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.190
So, there's also a lot of
inventive stories about him.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.060
Fourteen trips to Mecca, you know,
who knows if he really traveled

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.200
to Mecca 14 times or not.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:09.320
But, we're going to try to see
who he is through his work.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.690 position:56%
And I think that is a good decent
way of doing it, although, you know,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.910
not everything that everybody
creates is absolutely,

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.070
factually true about who they are,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.150
but it's a version of
telling themselves.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.120
So, it's a important version
of telling themselves.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.450
So, the other methodological point
I'm brining to your attention is

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.670
that I'm going to foreground
his poetry.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.100
And I'm going to go with that.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.430
Now, there's analysis,
there's theoretical discussion,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.640
but I'm not good in
foreground those.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.090
I don't think those
are there in order

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.620
to be the main topic of discussion.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.020
They're kind of there to
help you move forward,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.370
to find your way around.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.410
And I try to keep them where
I believe they need to be.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.970
Now, the first thing, Sa'di
is a lover par excellence.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.270
He is lover.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:05.420
Nobody can ever argue
with that, that sensual,

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.440
this wordly as well as spiritually.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.110
And it's fantastic that
he doesn't really try

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.170
to separate the two
that drastically.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.890
And, you know, that is actually
true of some other medieval poets

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.700
of the Islamic tradition as well.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.990 position:56%
And that's a different story all by
itself that the division of the body

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.380
and the soul as they exalted
as-- and base happens later on.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.820
And it's much more a kind of
European influence on that debate,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.610
but let's go back to that.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.510
He is a lover par excellence.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:16:18.880
[ Foreign Language ]

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.370
"Tonight that my sweetheart is
holding me tight, if they'd burn me

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:31.570
like al of wood, I'll feel
nothing but the light.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.850
When you have what you
want, death has no meaning,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:40.120
arrows of hardship fell
in me, I will not fight.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:46.170
Tonight, my moon and I are
ecstatic being together.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.820
Tell the heavens to close
its gates on sunlight.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.040
Has the star of dawn risen?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.010
Is this really you?

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.860
Or are my eyes deceiving me?

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.710
Perhaps this is the night
of power, that luckiest

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.570
and most blessed of nights.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:12.120
Oh, how I want us to sleep in the
orchard and taken the garden scent

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.220
if the birds of dawn
wouldn't agitate

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.250
and wake us before
the morning light.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.700
With these eyes, with
these eyes that are looking

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.960
at you this wonderful
moment, tell me,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.480
how do I ever contemplate
any other sight?"

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:43.890
"Talk to me there are no
strangers here just the two of us.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.990
All right, there is that candle.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:51.370
I'll cut his tongue and
take away its light.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:57.030
Now, there is nothing between
us except this garment.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.890
If it keeps us apart I'll tear
it open with love's joyful might.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.720
And I just want to tell you

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.190
that this is ghazal [assumed
spelling] that, you know, you--

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.430
almost any educated Iranian
would, no, at least partly

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.550
by heart, [foreign language].

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.660
And I initially translated
this as a gift

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.650
to my wonderful student Matthew
Miller [assumed spelling]

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.730
and his wife when they got married
and I read it on their wedding.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:32.970
But, the very last one,
[foreign language], the garment,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.860
there's only this garment
between you and me.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.410
And if it keeps up apart, I'm going
to tear it open with love's might.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.400
That's written on my
father's tombstone.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.650
He requested that.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.290
He requested that because he
saw the body as the garment

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.990
and he saw the passing as
an embracing of the beloved.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.640
I just want to give you
a taste of how diverse,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.610
how versatile this understanding of
the line can be and how this idea

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.800
of being a lover moves in
many different directions,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.330
not just one linear way, in
many different directions.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.930
And Sa'di is indeed one of the
best literary embodiment of it,

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.500
keeping the body and the
soul together, the wedding

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.280
and the passing together.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.330
Life in all it's complexity.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.590
Now, the next thing I would
like to say about Sa'di is

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.880
that he was a season traveler.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.200 position:56%
For 30 years in his life, like or
when he was very young he left Iran,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.030
he went to Baghdad,
he studied there,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.370
and he actually became a
professor in the Nezumia [phonetic]

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.720
of Baghdad, but then he left.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.430
He left and he traveled
for almost 30 years.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.980 position:56%
We are told and in many ways it's
quite possible that he went westward

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.030
as far as Africa and
eastwards as far as China.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.450
There are fictions
about the travels.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.220
So he wrote about them too.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.480
And, you know, he said himself
that, [foreign language],

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.790
those who travel much
tell tall tales.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.070
So, right, OK, don't
take everybody I say.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:29.080
Everything I say as factual which
I think is absolutely wonderful

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.150
because it says that he understood
factuality in a different way.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.410
He understood his perception
of what he saw on the way

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.270
and around the world as his
way of bringing the world

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.960
to his leadership whether
it wasn't always absolutely,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.220
factually accurate or not
did not matter as much.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:59.300
Now, that also gave him sense
of the world which I think much

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.600
of the world did not come to
develop until far later than that.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.510
I'll give you a story.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:17.130
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.510
Something like that.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.340
OK.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.640
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.440
That's what I want.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.670
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.630
So, somebody came from the sea of
Oman and he had traveled a lot.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.040
He had seen Arabs,
Turks, Tajiks and Greeks.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.030
And what's the next line?

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.690
So, in his pure soul, he had
collected a lot of knowledge.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.300
In other words, see these people
were not barbarians they weren't

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.760
just strangers out there.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.090
We didn't know anything
about, they new things

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.330
and you could learn from them.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.570
I have the Persian written here,
right, fondly I had looked.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:15.770
OK. So when he comes back after the
30 years of traveling he comes back

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.720
to Fars, to the province of
Fars in [inaudible] Shiraz

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.630
and where Abukbakzad Gersneji
[assumed spelling] is the ruler.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.710
And so, he begins to compose some
of his great works like Gulistan

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:33.110
and Bustan to actually dedicate
to the ruler and to the brother,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:42.370 position:56%
public, which is he is very aware of
in terms of wanting to see his work.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:49.730
Now, when he does this, with it,
there is also praising of the kings

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:57.420
which was very, very common at that
time and its part is that process

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:04.200
of math and he talked about
how powerful they were.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.190
He also talked about
who they should be.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.960 position:56%
Something that a lot of other people

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.790
of his time didn't have either the
weight or the courage to do, now,

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.750
the critics didn't take
lightly to this somebody

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.660
like Jan Repka [assumed spelling]
for example, since what can I say

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.910
about somebody who
praises Halahkuh [phonetic]

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.560
and also praises the person who
kills halahkuh and, you know, but,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.280
I think that what we missed in this
is actually look at these words

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.720
of praise and see what they are.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.020
What are they about?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.810 position:56%
And I'm going to give you a taste of
a little bit of that because, again,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:46.270
now we're talking about Sa'di,
the praise writer for the kings.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:54.220
So, in 1290-- I'm not
actually sure if it's 1291,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.640
because that would be
very close to his passing.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.070
But it's a date given usually.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.440
He wrote this famous Qasidas
[assumed spelling] that, again,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.510
a lot of Iranians know by heart.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:21.770
[ Foreign Language ]

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:27.580
So, he wrote this beautiful
poem dedicated

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.550
to Olko [assumed spelling].

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:35.790
And you can tell from the beginning
of this, "much has the world turned

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:41.060
and turn it will, the wise
do not get attached to death

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.880
which does not keep still.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.360
Do whatever you can
when you are able

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.640
to before old age takes
the strength from you."

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.120
So, this is the beginning
is a clearly addressed

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.940
to a much broader audience then and
to a newer, any other, you know,

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.730
other ruler or great person.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.610
And then he does something
which is also very traditional,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.460
which is going back to
the authoritative voice.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:18.970
That is the old fables
and books of kings.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.780
Sorry, that in the old
fables and books of kings.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:28.200
There are tales of Rostam, immortal
Esfandiyar and such things is

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.970
for the rulers and the owners
of wealth to understand

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.720
that the world was before
them in other people's hands.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.040
So, like he's going
to get to the praise

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.760
at some point but this
is before that.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.430
There are-- those are all gone, but
blinded with greed, we do not seem

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.260
to learn a lesson to take hit.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.170
So, still talking to people,
OK, and Jan was there too.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.970
And by now, he has established the
power of his voice and the power

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.400
of his work and it's really
through the majesty of the words

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.950
that he has the authority to do it.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.160
The king knows how much
people value this, OK?

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.920
Sa'di also know there is something
called, too much advice to those

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.140
in possession of power, so
he's kind of watches his steps.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:32.740
I am talking to you, who
were an oblivious cell,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.710
then group into a suckling
babe and who could tell

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:42.190
that in no time you would be
grown and already to greet life

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.320
as a Cyprus faded beauty.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.620
More time passed, you made
yourself a name as brave

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.400
on the battle field as
in any hunting game.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.600
What ever you saw did
not stay still.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.800
Do not think that it
now or ever will.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.060 position:56%
So, you know, you want to read it as
talking to people, but battlefield,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.260
you know, all these beginning
to really address the king.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:17.530
Sooner or later, this form of yours
so beauty as unfair will be dust

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.680
and even then scattered in the air.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.790
Surely, the gardener will
pick the flowers all and those

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.550
which he does not pick
perish and fall.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.370
This all amounts to nothing.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.120
Things which you cannot
own happiness, victory,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.100
being in command, sitting
on the thrown,

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.610
indeed leaving a good
name behind is much better

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.920
than an old made palace
adorn with gold and silver.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.940
So, there is now no doubt
who is being addressed,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.730
and Sa'di becomes more specific.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:28:00.000
What will next year bring,
nobody would know or the friend

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.780
that we had last year
where did he go?

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.690
And so, you know, that
is also very much inline

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.640
with the historical
events in Shiraz.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.660
I mean, people are
being coming and going

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.240
and you all know he's
very aware of that.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.870
So, before the passage
of time and the turning

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:24.290
of the wheel takes the range from
your hands and you lose the deal.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.880
So, your seeds for the
harvest, do not idly sit.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.530
If you want a treasure,
get working for it.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.000
Since God has given you
greatness and power,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.570
do not look down at the
poor from your ivory tower.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.980
Since the heavens have given you
the upper hand to those who are

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.960
under you be gentle and kind.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.080
Those who come to apologize

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.950
and to confess protect their
lives, show them forgiveness.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:04.970
And then, he becomes even more
specific because the kings used

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.080
to defame people who
came before them.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.370 position:56%
So, he says, you know, do not defame
the good names of other people.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:20.090
Think of those who come
after you and so on.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:25.620
And, finally, finally, Sa'di,

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.600
say whatever you know
without hesitation.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.770
The truth must not be
told except in the open.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:39.870
The one who is not held back by
fear or greed speaks in the face

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.750
of the enemy without heat.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.500
I pray for the Nazent
fortune of our great king.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.940
Now, we've got to the praise.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:56.190
To be on the rise and long
lasting, our just monarch,

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.520
our elastious Amir
[assumed spelling],

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.730
the noble anchiano [phonetic],
the ruler without fear,

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.890
others bring our sovereign
gifts of sweet meat,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.760
I pour the jewels of
my words at his feet.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.480
People usually praise
and panegyrize the ruler,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.290
I offer him my simple
words of prayer.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.870
Oh, Lord, please steer
him towards kindness

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.620
and make his life long
and prosperous.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.710 position:56%
May forever your wishes be fulfilled

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.430
and your enemy vanquished
in the battlefield.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:36.970
I think that really rest the
case for praise, because--

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.880
no, there is a lot more to that
poem, I really shortened it

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.320
because we don't have time.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.790
For all of that at some point
God comes into the picture,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.000
but it becomes like a triangle
people, God, ruler, it's not--

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.470
it's that kind of a very complex
interaction between the two.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.870 position:56%
And I want it from there, I want to
take us to Sa'di a teacher of ethics

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:08.070
who is really an extension of what
you saw, but it's far more fun

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.540
to read because what he
decides is that I'm not going

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:18.840 position:56%
to just give another boring book of,
you know, directions and guidelines.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.610
I'm going to tease people out
of the situations they are.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.170 position:56%
And so that they begin to think
and, you know, he's very foucauldian

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.980
in the sense that power
flows in the society.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.010
There are what, freedom
also flows in this society.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.380
You have to find your ways
to navigate your freedom.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.650
You learn your rules of decency.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.100
Sometimes you just evade
something if you need to,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.260
it's very practical
and very open about.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:52.400
But in all of it, his teach--
his teaching his ethics.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.390
There's a long story that I'm
not going to really get in to

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:01.280
and that is there is this king,
he's drunk and he's singing

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.840
and then he sing saying
that, you know,

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.340
there is no better
moment in the world.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:16.810
I'm having this great time and, of
course, there's this homeless man

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:24.620 position:56%
who is sitting outside and hearing
the king and he says, "Oh, you know,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.060
if the king doesn't have
any worries on his mind?

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.640
May he have some for the likes
of me, you know, we are in need."

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.300
And the way that you
hear the homeless man

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.680
and really accept him is

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.210
because Sa'di gives him
the exact same eloquence

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.510
that he gives the king.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.140
So, you have to hear him.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:48.070
He has this powerful poetic, logic
of that about which I'm going

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.930 position:56%
to say a little bit at the very end.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:54.890 position:56%
So the king says, he gets very
embarrassed then he says, "You know,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:02.420
hold the-- your cloaks so
I can throw a pouch of gold

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.800
or whatever down for you."

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.770
And he says, "Oh, I would
if I was wearing one."

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.670
And so, he doesn't have
really good clothes on either.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.580
So the king goes down
and gives him something.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.470
And then this guy turns
into, of course,

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.160
he doesn't know how
to spend his money.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.950
He has never had money
to know how to manage it.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.130
So he spends and it comes
back and makes the king angry.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.910
And then the vizier comes in and
says, "You made a lot mistakes.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.270 position:56%
First of all, you gave him too much.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.920
Secondly, you gave him
all at the same time.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.890
Thirdly, you cannot be kind
and then when people come

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.120
to you turn then away with anger.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.580
That doesn't describe
greatness," you know.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:52.300
So, in that one story, you actually
see all the different dimensions

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.270
of how to communicate,
how to deal with--

00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:01.020
at the larger society
if you own something.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.330
So when people say, "Sa'di wrote
a lot about rich people" yes,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.670
but he talked about how they
should live their lives as well.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.620
And he also had a lot of
room for non-rich people.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.610 position:56%
And then not everything that he says
is really quite as elaborated that,

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.350
sometimes it's very brief.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:34.260
There is this young boy who
wakes up every morning and prays

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.110
and he's very proud of being able,
before sunrise and pray and that's,

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.390
of course, very difficult
for a young person and one--

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:43.680
and probably Sa'di
himself, I don't know.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.240
So he turns to his father at some
point in the morning and he says,

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.940 position:56%
"None of those folks rise to offer
a humble morning prayer to the Lord,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.620
so deep, are they in
their heedless slumber

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.090
that they might just well be dead?"

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:03.690
And the father does not rest a bit,
he says, "If you have reason to spy

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.710
on others judging by
what you just said,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.150
you too my dear son would
be better off in bed."

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:15.810
So, it really is-- these moments,

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:20.150
these very brief moments I cannot
tell you how many Iranians actually

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.570
know this.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:26.890
And so, he's kind of penetrating
the consciousness of a much larger,

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.960
much more complex body
of people who hear it.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.780
Similarly, there's a story.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.080
I love this one.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.110
There are two boys talking.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:41.410
One of them is rich and the other
one is poor and the rich boy says,

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.360
"I like you father's tomb."

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.450
He brags, my father is decorated
with beautiful calligraphy written

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.120
on the halfty piece of marble
in laid with turquoise.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.050
How interesting, observes
the poor boy,

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:02.150
before you dad moves beneath the
way to mine has reached paradise.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:09.680
So, if you have Sa'di the
ethical teacher or the ethicist,

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:17.390
really using a language which is
very reachable, very beautiful,

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.730
very humorous, and that
is what keeps the work,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.920
that the book is still taught in
schools in Iran, in university

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.150 position:56%
and in schools because you can
really go to it at different levels.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.600
But I'm going to focus for the
ending of this pretty much on,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.610
what I described as
Sa'di the comedian.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.920
And I really mean the comedian.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:46.160
Excuse me, I'm piercing
in, ending of a cold, so.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.220
And I even thought about
calling him a jester,

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.400
because he does a lot jesting.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:37:01.190
But, I didn't go for the word
jester because jesters are usually

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.690
in courts of kings
and that he did not do

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.590
that for it isn't in that setting.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.870
So, jester would not
have been the right word.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.970
I went for comedian
because he's very humorous,

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.330
jesting, he runs around you.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.800
You never know where he's going
to show up next in the next line.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.930
You know, he's talking to
you, he's suddenly talking

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:26.870
to somebody else very, very
playful, but also he's very alert,

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.870
very witty, street wise, he uses
a language that he doesn't use

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:36.100
in the other more formal
kinds of ghazal writing.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.730
And, he's a survivor.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.590
I'm going to tell you
why in a second.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.020
So, this is-- for this he uses
a form called [inaudible] is

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:51.060
like a ghazal, you read a body
of like poetry then you come back

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.740 position:56%
to a refrain that gets repeated, OK.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.740
So this refrain keeps the whole
thing together, very tightly,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.760
but allows you to move around
in the middle of the ghazals.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.700
So it's a combination of freedom
and also being bound by rules.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:13.510
Now, a lot of you Iranians
are going to recognize this.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:36.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.910
OK, let me give you a
translation in a second.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:48.910
So, this comes finally-- actually
let me give you a translation first

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.240
because it helps then
putting it together.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.170
A figure so fine it
cannot tolerate close.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:01.730
Tearing them open like a
pod blooming into a rose.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.430
Standing on the rooftop
where the moon will appear,

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:09.130
who can tell if it
is the moon or her?

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.360
An arm full of flowers.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:18.860
No, no, she's a full garden and not
just any, but the Garden of Eden.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.640
Are those fragrant polo balls
she hides under her dress

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.260
or is it the aroma of her
breath sweet as [inaudible].

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.580
So, this is the sensuality
I'm talking about.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.720
It just runs through
the whole thing.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.510
But then you come to
the refrain which is--

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:46.910
[ Foreign Language ]

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:52.710
So, every ghazal is ended with
a go about doing my own things.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:57.180
Waiting patiently for
whatever life brings.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.480
No commitments.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.780
No-- I have nothing to lose.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.150
I'm just this very plain
poor ordinary person.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:13.840
And inserted into this
is extreme moments

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.770
that other forms of
lyric do not allow.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.570
Like--

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.500
[ Foreign Language ]

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.680
May every Cyprus tree on the edge

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.090
of a stream be a sacrifice
to your beauty, so pray.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:34.960
So you-- it's a-- that
exaggeration is on the surface.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.260
It wants you full grounded.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.410
It wants you to see it.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.880
And then there is that lot of also,

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.010
"I'm an outcast, nobody
cares about me.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.510
Everybody is blaming me."

00:40:47.510 --> 00:41:05.710
[ Foreign Language ]

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.780
So they blame me.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.800
They said, "Don't go after her,
she's going to ruin your life"

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.020
and I tell them, "You are having
the heart and weak and emotion.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.760
Is this what you call loyalty?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.520
Is this what you call devotion?

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.630 position:56%
That I go about doing my own things?

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.200
Waiting patiently for
what life brings".

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.880
So, see how the refrain
this, completely transformed.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.630 position:56%
A moment ago, it was I'm going to go

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.330
about doing my own things
and, you know, I don't care.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.450
Now, he said, are you telling me
to go about doing my own things?

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.680
At this every, every
ghazal opens a new window.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.010
Suddenly we find our selves in
the company of animals, you know,

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.370
I am like a bird that went after
a sea and fell into a trap.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:03.380
You know, like a wolf
who coveted the sheep

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.360
and of course got caught, you know.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.820
And wonder why is he doing this?

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.240
What are we getting at?

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.810
What is this doing in the
middle of this love story?

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.630
And you, suddenly, by the time
you come to the end, you realized,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.780
he is telling as each
one of us is a zoo.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.820
Watch it. You know, feel your
feelings, and know who you are.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.990
Otherwise, you are going to face
this bunch of animals that you are.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.690
Who in many ways are lovely
and lively and beautiful,

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.080
it's not basic but watch it.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.380
This is who you are.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.910
Know yourself.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:44.160
Or, suddenly, in another stanza,
he starts focusing in Arabic.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:50.530
Uses this exaggerated Arabic terms
that, I'm sure Arabs wouldn't use.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:55.290
And Arab speaker really, you know,
and even Persians using Arabic,

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:59.190
if you can see the exaggeration
and you think, yeah, but,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.820
what are you up to, you know?

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.590
And then suddenly get
to the point, you know,

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:11.850
I'm eloquent in all the
languages that I speak.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:17.020
When I begin to describe you,
I sound like a dumb fellow.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:22.310
And so, you go back then you see,
so what is he doing with language?

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:29.240
She's brought, there is opening up
of the possibilities of what we do

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.640
with language and particularly
a criticism of flowery

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.040 position:56%
and exaggerated language, but people
quoted Arabic in order to show

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.760
that they are highly educated.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.610
Now, I'm aware that we're
getting fairly close.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:45.110
So, not going to extend
as far too much.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.460
Let me just give you
another, another example.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.270
Everyone once in a
while he makes a puzzle.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:56.540
You know, and this is in the area
of still Sa'di the comedian, OK.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.410
So, he is like-- he-- I always have
a feeling that from some corner

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.030
of the book he's laughing
at you as you're doing this.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:06.300
It's like for example
he says, "Cruel you are.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.060
You did this to me, did this
to me" and then it ends.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:14.200
From now on, do not do what you
have done so far for if you do,

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.290
I swear to God, that I will
henceforth-- " and I'm like, oh,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.410
"What is he going to do?"

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.530
You know, go about doing my
own things waiting patiently

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.160
for whatever life brings.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:35.800
So, again, he just tells you
that that little refrain,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.760
these moments in life where
we always jump back to,

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.230
could be translated into
so many different things

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.870
by what comes before and what comes
after, and there is a lot more

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:55.960
to language than what the kind of
dictionary meaning looking up that

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.460 position:56%
where you often-- we get trapped in.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:04.870
So, let me conclude by saying
that, I think of some --

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.330 position:56%
and one of my chapters is called
the "Old Church" that, "The Garden",

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.600
you know, it says and
that is because I came

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.290
to see Sa'di's work very
much in that metaphor.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:21.090 position:56%
And one of the tastiest fruit of the
exploration of this garden was that,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.790
when I started my initial
research on Sa'di, you know,

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.600
and I know it is-- I've lived with
this poetry all my life as a master

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.110
of originality, of
freshness and color and humor

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.290
and elegance and I could go on.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.700
And I started collecting
main themes,

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.050
like what themes are
going to come out of this?

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.580
And you know then, I
had the shock of my life

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.780
because the basic core
concepts he dealt

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.120
with were mostly a dozen
or dozen and a half.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.930
I almost fell off my
kind of proverbial chair,

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.620
like, how do you do this?

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.100
How do you bring so much freshness

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:03.990
with so little traditional
language at your disposal?

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.940
And so, I began to read about
the concept of repetition,

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.450
the concept of making things new

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:15.580
and basically explore
the concept of speaking.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.070
So, that might be probably
the biggest gift

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:21.360
that I got out of these book.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.870
And that is, how is that
the poets create freshness

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.310
with anything that they touch?

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.410
Even with familiar ideas.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.290
Oh how is it that what
they say convinces us?

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.790
You know, and that brought
me to a lot of reading

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.990
about how language refies things.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.630
How-- What is it-- I have disposal
at language if we don't stretch it

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.640
with poetry, could refi things.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.720
Even when we say, for example,
change is great, right,

00:46:52.720 --> 00:47:00.970
is turns change into a thing,
as if change was a thing, like,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.930
you know, this room is great.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:08.100
Where as in fact change is a
combination of a set of shifting

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.820
and evolving moments of emergence,
of new ideas, of combinations,

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:19.810
of all kinds of variations on
the themes and we manage to kind

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:24.580
of the-- or either the language
takes the ability from us to see

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:30.120
that and that is how great poets
come, you know, into the picture

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:35.780
by creating the poetic process of
revival, rearrangement, shifting,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.570
combining the previous patterns
and giving birth to the settle

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.430
and constant process of remaking.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:48.490
And I think that is really
the key word for Sa'di.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.750
And just like a million
tress, a leaves--

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.710
or a million trees in a
garden will not be repetitive.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.670
A million leaves on a tree
will not be repetitive.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.210
In this poetic combination

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.860
and rebuilding things
are not repetitive.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.600
And in fact, they have
their powerful poetic logic.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.860 position:56%
And I'm going to give you a taste
of it, there's no way to explain it.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.270
I'm going to end with that.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:18.830
You know, it's like, we can never
say what is funny and a joke.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.840
They can hear it and
laugh at it, OK.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.140
Now listen to this.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.440
This is familiar.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.920
Hamlet says to Horatio, "There
are more things in heaven

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:35.810
and the earth Horatio, than are
dreamt of in your philosophy," OK.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.640
We never doubt him.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.430
Did he really research this?

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:45.390
No, Hamlet says it beautifully.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.830
Shakespeare says it convincingly.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:51.320
The power of the poetic
logic convinces us.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.010 position:56%
Now, imagine he would say, "Horatio,
I think there are more things

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:59.610
in heaven and earth that
are dreamt of in your--

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.670
", it would have destroyed
it completely.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.940
It would no longer be poetry.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.270
So, that's what I mean with
the power of precision,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:15.080
of convincing power of poetry
that Sa'di puts such good use.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.750
So, let me end with three lines
of his own vision of the heaven

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.510
and the earth which
we cannot argue with.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:25.720
"The cloak of beauty fits perfectly

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.280
on your figure while a
hundred cloaks are torn

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.120
by your distraught lover.

Every time, the sun falls
on earth from the heavens,

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.350
it is frustrating itself
in your presence.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.000
I will turn into dust and
disappear, but behold,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.730
on my face the dust
of your threshold.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:54.320
Return the heart that
you stole in daylight

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.110
and I'll stop following
you day and night."

I would like to give people the
opportunity to ask some questions.

out we have copies

of, thank you, that was--

that was wonderful and

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:41.220
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So my question
is, if you were to compare Sa'di

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:50.810
to Rumi or Hafiz, what would stand
out in terms of Sa'di himself?

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.160
What would--

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.960
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yeah.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.150

differentiate him, make him unique?

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:02.090
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yeah,
yeah, actually-- sure.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.840
Yeah. The question is, if
I were to compare Sa'di

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.920
to Rumi or Hafiz, for example.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:14.960
Let me particularly talk about Rumi
and I'm going to come to Hafiz too.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.990
You know a lot of what they
are concerned with is similar

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:26.310
that Rumi is a storm and
Sa'di is a quiet city.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:33.140 position:56%
So, a beautifully organized ruled by
law, you know, he breaks the rules

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:44.480
when he likes, but, it is-- you
feel in peace, you're not fighting,

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.590
you need to learn, you need to
fall in love and then, you know,

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:53.640
of course, love is going to
have all its ups and downs.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.820
For Rumi, you are-- you
have to break your being

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:01.510
into pieces and rebuild it.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:09.010
And I think both of them have
a little bit of the other,

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.620
when you look for it but
the dominant is there.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:19.020
For example, when Rumi laughs,
it's the world that's laughing,

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.380
that the flowers that
open, everybody who dances,

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.370
every thing that grows is a
laughter of a universe and love.

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.560
When Sa'di laughs he's
found somebody funny

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.050
and he is laughing at them.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:37.630
So he brings a lot of, I think
a big dose of down to earth.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:41.850
I was talking to a friend
actually who I think is here,

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:46.250
and now he is sitting there, if
you wanted a metaphor, I would say,

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.440
Rumi is here and he is
trying to reach you.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.700
Sa'di is here and he's
trying to connect there.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.620
So it's kind of, in a very
interesting way is this fairly

00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.390
similar trip, but, you know, I
actually think both of them are

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:03.570
in their own way very
much, very deeply,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.740
rooted in the social
realities of their time.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.410
It's-- I don't-- I do not,
really for a moment agree with--

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.780
there's some people who think that,
oh, this exotic poetry is have,

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.650
what does it have anything
to do with life?

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:18.100
I think it had everything to
do with struggle and change

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.450
and remaking yourself and
reseeing the world and so on.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:25.530
But, it's a different
kind of perspective.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:30.950 position:56%
Now, Hafiz, about whom I really wish
and hope I would have the fortune

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.630
of doing some work and
I think is in a way,

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:39.530
a kind of has overlapping
areas with the two, but,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.590
the way he uses language
is completely different.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:48.120
It's very complex and then
he also plays with spaces.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.230
Space is very important for
Hafiz and I think we have look

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:56.470
at the aesthetics of space
if we deal with Hafiz.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:58.270
Yes.

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.730
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.920
I'm sure they did.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:11.090
They-- as you know time wise, they
coincide, there are in fact poems

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.260
that sometimes people have
interpreted as alluding

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.280
to each other, but,
you know, I'm not--

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:24.260
I'm not so sure that we
have any factual reason.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:31.640
You know, the way I see it is that
this language is highly, you know,

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.760
that what they do is
highly intertextual.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.400
The tradition and the
language carries it.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.900
So, Sa'di is here, but he is
many places at the same time.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:49.010
Same as true of Rumi, so in a way
they are in constant encounter

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:52.330
with each other through the medium

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:57.290
of this overarching,
very complex tradition.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:01.620
But in terms of personally having
come in to contact or written

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.700
about each other, I
don't-- I don't know of it.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.200
I don't think so.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.500
Yes.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:19.160
&gt;&gt; I know it's incredibly
difficult to translate into English

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.990
and to me it sounds beautiful--

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.290
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank you.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:29.160
&gt;&gt; You've done fantastic job.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.710
Could you describe a couple
of challenge you've faced?

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.010
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yes.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:37.310
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] it into English.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.570
And also how suddenly have
influenced your own writing.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:41.320
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Absolutely.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.010
Tet me answer the second one
first because I'd really want it,

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:49.060
you know, translation as
a big love of my life,

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.000
so I'm going to come back to you
and be a bit more long winded.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.020
I think the language I have
written-- I have a book on Rumi,

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.650
"Lyrics of Mystical Love."

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:02.940 position:56%
I think that's written in a language
much closer to the language of Rumi,

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.880 position:56%
even though they're both in English.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.530
Whereas, the language I used
for Sa'di is less abstract,

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.980
less stormy, much more accessible.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:16.750
And so, I think it's an impact
of dealing with his poetry.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:22.390
In terms of how he has influenced
my education and my thinking

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:26.650
about poetry and all that, it
would really be impossible--

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.320
I mean, I grew up with this.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.410
From the moment I remember, you
know, my mother was upset with us,

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.850
she would say, [foreign
language], which is to try

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:37.310
to discipline a rascal is like
trying to risk a walnut on top

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.350
of the dome, that's Sa'di.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:44.000
OK. So that is going to roll
down and, of course, you know,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.580
she would look very stern
and she would say this,

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:52.020
but the walnut was rolling down and
so there was laughter, you know.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.110
So he was in, he was in
our lives from that moment

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:01.960
and I think it was an
extremely lucky situation.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.150
I don't know how to thank
my stars for being with my--

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.590
the parents who's life
was poetry and we live

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.900
in Shiraz and all of that.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.270
So, he influenced us
in all of these.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.370
I mean, when I was a
teenager, I argued with my dad

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:18.980
because I was more Hafiz and he
was more Sa'di but then yeah.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:22.920
But in anyway, he was there
in one form or another.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:32.420 position:56%
In translation, I really want to say
something that I taught translation

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.990
because I got really interested in.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.960
And I thought, OK, let me
read more on translation.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:42.140
And I really came to believe
that, it's a very original work.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.920
If you want to use a metaphor, it's
not like putting something in front

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.120
of you and drawing from it.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.830
It's like planting a
seed and let it go.

00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:59.020
It's like melting an ice, a
piece of ice which is in a shape

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.590
and refreezing it in
a different shape.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:05.420
It is a lot of originality
in what you do,

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.740
but you have to establish
the connection

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.220
and try your best to stay low too.

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:14.360
But I also came to
believe that it really--

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.530
although things are lost at
translation, no question about it.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.440
But a translation is a
lost and found place.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.720
You also find amazing
things about language

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.790
that you would have not done.

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.260
So, if you were not translating.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:36.620
So, I tried to read
and absorb and write.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.510
And then go back and see.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.670
Do I need to get closer to him?

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:46.430 position:56%
Is this something that it takes away
from what the original is there?

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:49.410
But the answer is,
I enjoy it so much

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:52.000
that it's almost like
writing poetry.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.830
And so, I'm absolutely
grateful for the fact

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:58.110
that he is a translatable poet.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:00.740
He is, you know, he is
just-- so is Rumi, actually.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:05.730
Hafiz is far more difficult to
translate because there are dozens

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:10.990
of interconnections between words
and concepts in each line and,

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:15.280
you know, God help you if
you want to translate it.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.090
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I would like
to segway into the question

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:20.100
that Joanne asked essential
mention that,

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.540
the translation is
she was interesting,

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.410
when you seen the Persian
verses, they're gender neutral,

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:30.010
the beloved that he is describing
could be male, it could be female

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:35.340
and your translations are clearly a
references to a women, I'm curious,

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:40.050
how much gender can you read
into it and how much of it--

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.350
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: OK.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:42.650
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Then there
is also another criticism

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.780
of Sa'di being misogynistic
and being very anti women.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.400
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: It
was until the 13th century.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.700
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
I know, I'm curious,

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.740
and furious to see
what you're doing.

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.040
Yeah.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.340
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Yes absolutely.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.180
OK. I'm glad you raised
that question on gender

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.560
because I read stuff that were
especially, and you're right, the--

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.360
pronounced out gender,
non gender specific.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.550
I read poems that are specifically
addressed to females, like,

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:08.900
you know, when you-- somebody
hides polo balls under their dress,

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.560
you know, you know, who they are.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:18.590 position:56%
But he does have homoerotic imagery
and actually in the chapter on love,

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:22.290
I do have a section, I have
an extended section on that

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:26.400
because people don't know how to
handle it, they try to erase it

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.020
by saying, "Oh no, you know, this
is all just metaphoral call."

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.360
Some other people say, "OK.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.820
It's just, you know,
it was a tradition.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.670
They did it without
thinking about it."

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.400
Now, there's a lot of
discussion that could go into that

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:51.920
which is homoerotic beauty didn't
necessarily mean what we are either

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.290
addressing as homosexuality today
and it requires a lot of in depth.

01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:02.130
Writing actually matters written on
that beautifully and give a talk.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:06.740
But, by no means, I want
to take a wider homoerotic.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.300
What I want to say is that,
what happens in the atmosphere

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:19.170 position:56%
of love makes all of these markers,
gender, class, language, irrelevant.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:24.150
And there is the emphasis is
on that, that love purifies

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:30.300
and beautifies and makes
it accessible to all.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.070
So, that is very-- not, not that,
you know, you know what I mean.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.050
So, it doesn't just a-- actually,

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:38.500
Kris Tevar [assumed spelling]
has written beautifully on that.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.610
There's a book called,
"The Tale of Love."

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:43.430
I would highly recommend it
to anybody interested in that.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.730
She's written beautifully.

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.120
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: It's
not so much homoeroticism.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.100
To me, it's the genderlessness
freeze the language

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.400
in a very interesting way.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.490
And then you translate it into
English, you're be struck.

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.010
How-- What should I put here?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.310
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: OK.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.610
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: A he or she?

01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:58.910
You see what I mean?

01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:00.210
It's a very interesting.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:01.510
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yeah.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.810
You do a number of things.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.730
I think if you don't do-- that's
absolutely true because the "Ou"

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:11.210
which could be he or she could be
a king they're praising, a beloved,

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:16.470
a male beloved, a female beloved,
a friend, you know, a master,

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:21.230
a lot of love poetry or
Rumi was written for Shams.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.530
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Right.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.830
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh KEshavarz: And
I personally do not believe

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:26.500
that that relationship
was homoerotic.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.190
That's a different
story we can talk about.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.720
So, there's a whole range
of, you know, but is this,

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.050
the case of Sa'di, there is.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.840
I mean there is-- There are
beautiful young male he describes

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.070
and he says, "I don't want to go
too near because they're dangerous,

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:43.180
you know, I want to get back
home and forget about this."

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.850
So he is-- he-- actually,

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:47.180
he's talking about
that very, very openly.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.500
Now, what you do in translation is
that, if you think of translation

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.980
in the sense of equivalency
and dictionary,

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.640 position:56%
this equals this, we are in trouble.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.450
But if you think of translation
as you create a context,

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.410
you give the meaning then it's--

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:09.500
you don't even have to
exactly repeat the wording.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.260
You make your listener understand

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.560
that this is what you think
the context that is going

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.410
on which is exactly why you
have to think of translation

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:24.580
as far more complex than just,
you know, finding the meanings

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:28.530
and then transfer it
from one text to another.

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.830
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Go ahead.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.130
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Yes.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:32.430
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Two more question.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.730
You and--

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.030
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.280
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
I am afraid not.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.880
At this point, I think
they might actually do it.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.620
They wrote to me is that, it's
Edinburgh University Press,

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.510
but I don't think at
this point it is.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:50.990
But I prevailed upon them to bring
the price down because, you know,

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:53.550
they-- their price is as--

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.510
&gt;&gt; Originally it was 120,
you're getting it for $36, so.

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:58.810
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
So I told them,

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:03.030
I'm not going to have any book
signing because it's ridiculous

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:06.530
to stand in front of your friends
and students and colleagues

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:09.120
and say pay $120 from my books.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.420
OK.

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.720
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Go ahead.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.020
Go ahead, please.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.070
&gt;&gt; I wanted to first of
all thank you very much

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:22.220
because there is nothing
more beautiful [inaudible].

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.520
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank you.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.820
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

The significance of?

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.610
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:36.970
In Baghdad, OK.

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.270
OK. Right.

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:46.130
Well. First of all, he lost his
father very, very young and he grew

01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:49.990
up in-- I think he left
Shiraz around that time

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:53.480
when he must have been
just under 20.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:05:00.560 position:56%
And again, we don't have a lot of
biographical information about that,

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.320
what people tell us is that,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:08.280
he really wanted a more intense
learning environment and he knew

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.500
about Nezamiyeh of Baghdad.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.490
And so, he went there to study.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:18.820
When he went there to study,
actually, he stayed longer.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:24.160
So he found the environment
very lively and many

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.820
of his little anecdotes, he
refers to the days in Baghdad.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.520
And in one of them, he says

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:35.170
that I had a regular
income through teaching.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:38.210
And that's how we know
he taught at that point.

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:42.630
He does go back to Baghdad
because he does travel a lot.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:46.890
But unless we do really a word
search and do an in depth study

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:52.040 position:56%
of what he else he may have said, I
think Baghdad is a city of learning.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.040
And he actually meet some
of his great teachers there

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.860
and stays in touch with them.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.430
So that is-- that I
can say for sure.

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.510
I think there was one in-- yeah.

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:34.890
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.190
Yeah.

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.490
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:41.290 position:56%
OK. So, let me first say that
probably because he travels so much.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:46.730
And in some places, he was in a--
economically, he was in difficulty,

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.680
didn't-- he run out of
things, he worked and so forth,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.290
and even if not, all of them
would be factually accurate

01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.590
and part of them would be.

01:06:53.590 --> 01:07:01.630
So, he-- when he came back, now the
Shiraz he lived in was the Shiraz

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:07.800
that as the-- the ruler of the time
wanted to rebuild and I'm sorry,

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.520
the Ilhanis [assumed
spelling] wanted

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.820
to build it back to
as the older time.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.710
They wanted to make a grandeur
that that was there before.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:18.420
So, when he came back,
he came back to a city

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:22.150
that was fairly prosperous,
although it did have,

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:24.640
of course, obviously a lot of poor.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.140
So in terms of what has
traveled, I think a lot.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:33.900
I think poets, even to
this day, and I am not able

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:39.090
to really speak accurately to other
Persian speakers like Afghanistan,

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:42.380
you know, Afghan and Tajik
and so on, unfortunately.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:52.050
But in Iran, to this day, poets
are embodiment of dedication,

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:56.330
telling the truth, speaking
truth to power where, you know,

01:07:56.330 --> 01:08:01.060
that really unexpected to be super
humans, it's not good enough.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.440
That was one thing I
discovered when I came

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.100
out of Iran poet sold many people,
make all kinds of, you know,

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.070
do things that are
not absolutely right.

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.600
Now, which doesn't mean
that Iranian poets don't,

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.130
but they're not expected
to, you know.

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:18.360
If your [foreign language]
actually said that.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.380
He said, "They write the most
beautiful line and the next day,

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.700
go back to be in jealous and petty.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.010
And, you know, how could
you claim to be a poet?"

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:36.000
So, it is a very tightly interwoven
expectation that if you are a poet,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.790
you would be-- you have a
responsibility for speaking.

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.490
Not everybody fulfills

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:46.070
that as responsibility
but you're expected to.

01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:50.360
And so, I think it has
pretty much lasted.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.660
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: OK.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.960
Thank you everyone.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.260
You can ask question in person.

Let's go to the books.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.900
I wanted to make sure
that we get a chance

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.420
to do the book signing as well.
