so what humans do that specialist we

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029
so what humans do that specialist we
 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.450
so what humans do that specialist we
absorb all of these ideas all these

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460
absorb all of these ideas all these
 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.570
absorb all of these ideas all these
inputs and we smoosh them up in various

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580
inputs and we smoosh them up in various
 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.970
inputs and we smoosh them up in various
ways and come up with new things and so

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980
ways and come up with new things and so
 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.300
ways and come up with new things and so
there are essentially three main ways

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310
there are essentially three main ways
 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.880
there are essentially three main ways
that the brain does this and we've

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890
that the brain does this and we've
 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.150
that the brain does this and we've
summarized this as bending breaking and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160
summarized this as bending breaking and
 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.259
summarized this as bending breaking and
blending so let's start with bending

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269
blending so let's start with bending
 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.840
blending so let's start with bending
bending is where you take something and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850
bending is where you take something and
 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.180
bending is where you take something and
you you change it you make it smaller

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190
you you change it you make it smaller
 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.920
you you change it you make it smaller
you make it bigger you change something

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930
you make it bigger you change something
 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.439
you make it bigger you change something
about it when you look at statues across

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449
about it when you look at statues across
 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.229
about it when you look at statues across
human culture you find that that people

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239
human culture you find that that people
 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.420
human culture you find that that people
bend the human form any which way making

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
bend the human form any which way making
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.280
bend the human form any which way making
it taller or skinnier emphasizing

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290
it taller or skinnier emphasizing
 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.049
it taller or skinnier emphasizing
certain portions over the other they do

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059
certain portions over the other they do
 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.759
certain portions over the other they do
that with all animal paintings and

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769
that with all animal paintings and
 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.219
that with all animal paintings and
sculptures and so on you can bend lots

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229
sculptures and so on you can bend lots
 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.799
sculptures and so on you can bend lots
of aspects of things so the artist jr.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809
of aspects of things so the artist jr.
 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.829
of aspects of things so the artist jr.
made a statue of the high jumper

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839
made a statue of the high jumper
 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.500
made a statue of the high jumper
muhammad idris for the olympics and he

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510
muhammad idris for the olympics and he
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.410
muhammad idris for the olympics and he
put that a super-huge and had him

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
put that a super-huge and had him
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.479
put that a super-huge and had him
jumping over a building and you have

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489
jumping over a building and you have
 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.060
jumping over a building and you have
other sculptors that make extremely tiny

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070
other sculptors that make extremely tiny
 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.580
other sculptors that make extremely tiny
little figurines and one of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590
little figurines and one of the
 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.709
little figurines and one of the
arguments we make is that the exact same

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719
arguments we make is that the exact same
 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.270
arguments we make is that the exact same
thing that's happening in art the same

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280
thing that's happening in art the same
 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.459
thing that's happening in art the same
cognitive processes are happening in the

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469
cognitive processes are happening in the
 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.709
cognitive processes are happening in the
sciences also so you see exactly this

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719
sciences also so you see exactly this
 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.060
sciences also so you see exactly this
kind of thing happening all the time

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
kind of thing happening all the time
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.090
kind of thing happening all the time
just as an example in the early days of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100
just as an example in the early days of
 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.940
just as an example in the early days of
driving in the 1920s headlight glare was

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950
driving in the 1920s headlight glare was
 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.810
driving in the 1920s headlight glare was
a real problem

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820
a real problem
 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.249
a real problem
so Edwin land the scientists realized

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259
so Edwin land the scientists realized
 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.929
so Edwin land the scientists realized
that he could solve this by using

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939
that he could solve this by using
 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.789
that he could solve this by using
polarizing crystals but those were very

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799
polarizing crystals but those were very
 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.980
polarizing crystals but those were very
big at the time so he figured out how to

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990
big at the time so he figured out how to
 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.739
big at the time so he figured out how to
shrink these down and make a windshield

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749
shrink these down and make a windshield
 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.300
shrink these down and make a windshield
out of all these little polarized

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310
out of all these little polarized
 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.669
out of all these little polarized
crystals it's exactly the same sort of

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679
crystals it's exactly the same sort of
 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.399
crystals it's exactly the same sort of
aha moment as the artist who's making

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409
aha moment as the artist who's making
 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.709
aha moment as the artist who's making
these tiny figurines it's the same kind

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719
these tiny figurines it's the same kind
 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.899
these tiny figurines it's the same kind
of bend going on and we see this all

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909
of bend going on and we see this all
 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.039
of bend going on and we see this all
over in in biology just as one example

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
over in in biology just as one example
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.410
over in in biology just as one example
the artificial heart since it was

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420
the artificial heart since it was
 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300
the artificial heart since it was
invented in the 1980s has been a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310
invented in the 1980s has been a
 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.249
invented in the 1980s has been a
mechanical pump but these are very

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259
mechanical pump but these are very
 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.559
mechanical pump but these are very
energy hungry and they get worn down and

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569
energy hungry and they get worn down and
 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.760
energy hungry and they get worn down and
so in 2004 a couple of physicians came

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770
so in 2004 a couple of physicians came
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.370
so in 2004 a couple of physicians came
up with a continuous flow heart where

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380
up with a continuous flow heart where
 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.449
up with a continuous flow heart where
blood flows through and is oxygenated

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
blood flows through and is oxygenated
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.440
blood flows through and is oxygenated
continuously so if you have one of these

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
continuously so if you have one of these
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.480
continuously so if you have one of these
hearts you don't have a pulse it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490
hearts you don't have a pulse it
 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340
hearts you don't have a pulse it
all Dick Cheney has one of these he

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350
all Dick Cheney has one of these he
 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.090
all Dick Cheney has one of these he
doesn't have a pulse and so this is a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
doesn't have a pulse and so this is a
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460
doesn't have a pulse and so this is a
bend of what we find the nature we get

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470
bend of what we find the nature we get
 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.290
bend of what we find the nature we get
the idea of the heart and then we bend

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300
the idea of the heart and then we bend
 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000
the idea of the heart and then we bend
it to make it compatible with what we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
it to make it compatible with what we
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.710
it to make it compatible with what we
want and of course airplanes are are a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
want and of course airplanes are are a
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.770
want and of course airplanes are are a
bend of you know what we witnessed birds

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
bend of you know what we witnessed birds
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.680
bend of you know what we witnessed birds
doing and so on so there are many ways

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
doing and so on so there are many ways
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.690
doing and so on so there are many ways
that you can bend things and this is one

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700
that you can bend things and this is one
 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.630
that you can bend things and this is one
of the great things that the brain does

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
of the great things that the brain does
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880
of the great things that the brain does
all the time so breaking is where you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890
all the time so breaking is where you
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.980
all the time so breaking is where you
take something some input that you've

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990
take something some input that you've
 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.830
take something some input that you've
received and you bust it into pieces

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840
received and you bust it into pieces
 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.660
received and you bust it into pieces
maybe you leave pieces out or something

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
maybe you leave pieces out or something
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.660
maybe you leave pieces out or something
like that so just as an example the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
like that so just as an example the
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.390
like that so just as an example the
artist Cory Arcangel took the video game

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400
artist Cory Arcangel took the video game
 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.490
artist Cory Arcangel took the video game
Super Mario Brothers and he hacked into

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
Super Mario Brothers and he hacked into
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
Super Mario Brothers and he hacked into
it and he removed everything except for

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
it and he removed everything except for
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.060
it and he removed everything except for
the little clouds and then he made an

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070
the little clouds and then he made an
 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.580
the little clouds and then he made an
art installation where it was just the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
art installation where it was just the
 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.080
art installation where it was just the
clouds and he called it Super Mario

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
clouds and he called it Super Mario
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.970
clouds and he called it Super Mario
clouds what he was doing was taking part

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980
clouds what he was doing was taking part
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.430
clouds what he was doing was taking part
of it away leaving part of it there that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440
of it away leaving part of it there that
 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.740
of it away leaving part of it there that
same kind of overt creativity that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750
same kind of overt creativity that
 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.810
same kind of overt creativity that
happens in the arts is exactly what

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820
happens in the arts is exactly what
 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.370
happens in the arts is exactly what
happens in the scientific lab all the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
happens in the scientific lab all the
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.280
happens in the scientific lab all the
time where you take certain parts away

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290
time where you take certain parts away
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.790
time where you take certain parts away
for example in my field there's a method

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800
for example in my field there's a method
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.560
for example in my field there's a method
that's used now in neuroscience called

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
that's used now in neuroscience called
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.740
that's used now in neuroscience called
clarity where you take the the brain

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750
clarity where you take the the brain
 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.770
clarity where you take the the brain
which you can't see inside of and you

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
which you can't see inside of and you
 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.840
which you can't see inside of and you
wash away all the fatty molecules so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850
wash away all the fatty molecules so
 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.370
wash away all the fatty molecules so
that you can see where the pathways

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380
that you can see where the pathways
 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.800
that you can see where the pathways
originate where they go and in that way

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
originate where they go and in that way
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.840
originate where they go and in that way
you can essentially make part of the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850
you can essentially make part of the
 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.730
you can essentially make part of the
brain transparent you can suddenly see

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740
brain transparent you can suddenly see
 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.830
brain transparent you can suddenly see
the pathways it's the exact same idea

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840
the pathways it's the exact same idea
 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.030

pointillism so there's there's these

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
pointillism so there's there's these

sort of big dots and they're seeing

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340
sort of big dots and they're seeing
 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.920
sort of big dots and they're seeing
these dots if you come up close you see

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
these dots if you come up close you see
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.160
these dots if you come up close you see
them if you go far away it looks like a

them if you go far away it looks like a
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.050
