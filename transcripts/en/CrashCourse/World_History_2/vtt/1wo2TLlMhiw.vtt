00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.500
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History, and today, we're going to talk about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.589
Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a
flame war.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.000
John from the past: Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr.
Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.400
and thousands of years.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.910
John: Except, thousands of years ago... there
wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.690
Also, let me submit that very little of this
conflict between Israel and Palestine over

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.970
the last several decades has been about, like,
theological differences between Islam and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.970
Judaism.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.380
No one's arguing about whether the most important
prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.820
or his son Ishmael, right?

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.949
It's not about whether to fast during Yom
Kippur or Ramadan.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.010
It's about land.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.609
Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious
makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly,

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:44.609
it isn't.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.620
So instead, let's begin as most historians
do in the late 19th century.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.649
And instead of talking about religion, let's
follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.780
and discuss competing nationalisms.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.539
[Intro]

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.090
Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman
Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.891
The population there, according to Ottoman
records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.550
and 3% Jewish.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.670
Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language,
and in Jerusalem the religious populations

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.670
were roughly equal.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.420
To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine,
an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.850
Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in
the first decade of the 20th century learning

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.480
the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover
and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbours.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.420
Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in
which people of different religious faiths

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.660
lived peacefully together.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.560
Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.500
The late 19th century was the Golden Age of
nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.300
than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire
in which at least 10 different nations all

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.360
wanted their own state.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.450
And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived
a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.640
had hoped that Jews could assimilate into
European nations but soon became convinced

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.650
that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe
and settle in their own state.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.560
The concept of Jewish nationalism came to
be known as Zionism.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.409
It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists
were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.739
as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.510
In 1917, the British government, hoping to
gain the support of Jewish people, issued

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.290
the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote,
"The establishment in Palestine of a national

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.170
home for the Jewish people," a bold promise
considering that Palestine was still technically

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.760
Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War
One.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.490
Of course, they would soon, but it turned
out that the British were overpromisers when

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.969
it came to Palestine, because a year before
the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.580
promised the French that they would divide
up the Arab territories and the Brits would

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.740
keep Palestine.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.159
Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials
had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.780
that he would rule over an Arab state including
Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.819
Ottoman rule, which Hussein promptly did,
so basically the Brits had promised Palestine

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.379
to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the
Zionists.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.379
What could go wrong?

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.379
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.950
So shortly after the end of the war, the British
established a colony in Palestine with the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.439
idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians
were ready to govern themselves, at which

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.680
point the people living in Palestine were
like, "Well, now seems good," and the British

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.120
were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet."

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.939
Meanwhile, the British established separate
institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.660
making it difficult for Palestinian Christians
and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.400
British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants
of Palestine.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.239
Again, what could go wrong?

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.900
Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor
the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.709
"facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable
conditions."

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.749
Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population
of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people.

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:56.260
In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30%
of the population of Palestine.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.079
And the growing Jewish population focused
on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.890
Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian
farmers who were living and working there.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.180
By controlling both the land and the labor,
they hoped to establish a more secure community

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.430
within Palestine, but of course, these practices
heightened tensions between Jewish people

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.549
and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and
the 1930s.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.079
Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to
think of themselves as the Palestinian nation,

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.800
and that growing sense of nationalism erupted
in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800
the British.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.590
With the help of Jewish militias, the British
brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.310
but in the aftermath, the British issued a
white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.940
Palestine, and calling for the establishment
of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.949
within ten years.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.599
This managed to leave no one happy.

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.170
The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting
Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.539
needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians
were unhappy about the prospect of waiting

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.120
ten years for a state.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.130
And then came World War II, which was actually
quite a peaceful time in Palestine.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.250
But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and
the British realized that colonies like Palestine

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.660
were far more trouble than they were wroth,
so they handed the issue of Palestine over

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.139
to the newly created United Nations.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.500
They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.060
For your first problem..."

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.039
So in November of 1947, the United Nations
voted to partition Palestine into separate

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.090
Palestinian and Jewish states.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.620
The Partition Plan called for two states roughly
equal in size, but the borders looked like

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.620
a jigsaw puzzle.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.310
I mean, you do not look at this map and think,
"Yeah, that's gonna work!"

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.590
Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the
plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.289
Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on
the one side and the Palestinians and many

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.680
Arab states on the other.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.000
The Israelis won, and when an armistice was
signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.100
land than they would have had under the UN
proposal.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.240
Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed
the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.349
and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip.

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.340
Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes
and became refugees in the surrounding Arab

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.340
countries.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.129
To Israelis, this was was the beginning of
their nation; to the Palestinians, it was

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.610
the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became
stateless.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.900
Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially,
and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.020
states went to war again.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.569
It was called the Six-Days War because -- get
this -- it lasted six days.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.480
Israel won, and then gained control over the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.230
and the Golan Heights.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.050
So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by
1967, things looked like this.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.129
Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they
are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:39.760
a basic framework for achieving peace, including
Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.220
in the war, and all participants recognizing
the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.220
state to exist.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.050
This of course did not happen.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.740
After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict
morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.039
conflict, and this is a nice moment to note
that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.300
are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians
are Muslims.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.890
Like, there's a significant Christian minority
of Palestinians, for instance.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.639
Palestinian is a word used to describe the
ethnic identity of those who have historically

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.639
lived in Palestine.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.449
There were, for instance, lots of Christians
in the Palestinian Liberation Organization,

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.110
or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.669
The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked
civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.690
to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and
meanwhile, the Israeli government began to

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.819
establish Jewish settlements in what had been
Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem,

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:32.700
the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.439
There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers
in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.729
Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal,
according to international law, but Israel

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.320
counters by saying that they aren't really
illegal because Palestine isn't really a state.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.030
By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the
first intifada, which literally means "shaking

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.030
off."

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.419
And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli
products and services and refusing to pay

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.259
Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed
forces cracked down on protesters, violence

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:02.259
ensued.

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.590
And the first intifada also saw the founding
of Hamas, which launched the first suicide

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.990
bombing against Israel in 1993.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.120
Hamas gained support partly because of its
militancy, but mostly because of its social

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.749
welfare projects in Gaza.

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:16.680
It built and staffed schools, mosques, and
clinics.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.289
The most important legacy of the First Intifada
was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:22.289
and Israelis.

00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:26.590
This led to the Oslo Accords, and the peace
process, based on our old friend, United Nations

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.800
Security Council Resolution 242.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.900
But there were a lot of issues to resolve
- I mean, putting aside the question of, like,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.240
how to make two states that don't look like
a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.380
the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian
refugees and their descendants to return to

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380
Palestine.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.589
Water rights, which are a big deal in that
part of the world, and so on.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.100
It's very complicated!

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.940
So then came the Clinton talks.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.880
Oh, it's time for the Open Letter!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.600
But first, let's see what's inside of the
globe.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600
Oh, look!

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.820
It's a collection of philandering American
presidents.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.500
An Open Letter to Bill Clinton:

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.279
Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer
than any other time in recent history to an

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:04.880
actual peace deal between the Israelis and
the Palestinians.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.470
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing
to give up more land currently claimed by

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.200
Israel than at any other time in the past;
even Yasser Arafat was surprised.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.920
Although not all the questions got addressed,
you were definitely closing in on something.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.950
But in the end, it didn't happen, and since
then, not to criticize you, things have gotten

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.200
kind of worse and worse and worse.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.370
Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.110
Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern
Ireland getting resolved while you were president.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.210
In short, it could have been amazing, but
instead it was kind of... neeeeh.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.880
Kind of like your presidency, actually!

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.769
At least you always have those vodkas-soaked
hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on.

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:40.459
Best Wishes,
John Green.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:44.339
So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's
government was undermined, and then, in September

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:50.080
of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon
led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.000
Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.520
To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
and it's the third-holiest site in Islam,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.180
behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's
Mosque in Medina.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.750
And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in
short, it's a pretty touchy place to march

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.480
to with a thousand armed guards.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.290
So the events sparked a massive protest, which
eventually led to the much more violent Second

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.089
Intifada, in which more than three thousand
Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:16.089
eventually killed.

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:20.019
In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in
defense of civilians, began construction of

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.880
a wall around the West Bank, but instead of
following the borders established after the

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.350
1967 War, the barrier was built to include
many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.820
To Israelis, that was about self-defense;
to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.911
Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in
an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won

00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:41.200
a majority of the parliamentary seats.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.459
Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority
have sort of divided how to govern Palestine,

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:48.690
and it's also sort of been poorly governed.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.810
In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently
launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.520
has responded with extended and extremely
violent invasions of Palestinian territory

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.350
that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed,
many of them militants, but also many not.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.850
Both parties claim to be responding to the
provocations of the other, but much of the

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.160
conflict reflects the consistent failure on
all sides to understand the legitimacy of

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160
the other's narrative.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.579
To Palestine, the Palestinian people have
been denied a state not just since the formation

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:21.389
of Israel, but also for decades before that,
and now they live under what amounts to a

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.959
military occupation.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:23.959
And that's all true.

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:28.470
To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need
a homeland, which the United Nations established.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.600
And they certainly aren't the first nation-state
to consolidate and increase their territory

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.790
via military victory.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.550
And they need to protect their nation against
the many active threats made against them

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.680
by their neighbors.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.720
That's also true!

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.240
It's important to understand the internal
logic of these competing nationalist visions.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.840
For both Zionists and Palestinian national
visions to eventually work, it's necessary

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.330
to understand the right of each to exist and
the legitimacy of each's historical narrative.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.320
But these problems aren't thousands of years
old, and they aren't intractable.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.779
They emerged in the British Mandatory Period.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:05.550
But let's hope that by understanding this
isn't an endless religious war, that we might

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.509
be closer to seeing its end.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:09.509
Thanks for watching.

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:10.540
I'll see you next week.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.959
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
Stacy Emigholz studio in Indianapolis, and

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:18.019
it's made possible by our subscribers on Subbable,
so thanks to you all.

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:20.779
By the way, if you want to learn more about
Israel and Palestine, our friends at Thought

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:24.350
Café have made a series of videos; you can
also find a link to them in the video info

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.350
below.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.630
Thanks again to all our Subbable subscribers;
thanks to the educators who share these videos

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.480
with their students and to the students who
share them with their teachers.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.350
As we say in my hometown, don't forget to
be awesome.
