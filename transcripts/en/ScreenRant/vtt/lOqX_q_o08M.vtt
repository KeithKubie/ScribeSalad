00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.310
The Marvel movies have come to be some of
the most successful films ever to be released.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.730
Filled with likable characters, great stories
and jaw dropping effects, the Marvel films

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.010
are here to stay.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.930
The films are often fairly funny, but some
of that humor doesn’t even make it into

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.279
the final cut.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.369
Despite portraying some of the most popular
superheroes on the planet, even the actors

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.349
occasionally make a mistake and goof up on
set, resulting in a mistake worthy of laughs.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.350
From Gods to aliens, scientists to mutants,
here are Screenrant’s 10 Marvel Bloopers

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.160
they couldn’t plan even if they tried.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.990

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.720
Ant-Man
Remember in Captain America: Civil War when

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.170
Spider Man made that obscure reference to
that “old” movie called The Empire Strikes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.740
Back before taking out Ant Man in a fashion
that was VERY reminiscent of the AT AT take

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
down?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.550
Well turns out that wasn’t the first time
Ant Man found himself in a situation that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.130
called out to a galaxy far, far away.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.460
In a blooper from the 2015 film Ant Man, Paul
Rudd is filmed in costume mimicking none other

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.080
than C3P0 himself, copying the golden droid’s
stiff movements and voice before strutting

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.420
away, the crew behind the camera easily getting
a laugh out of the quick gag Rudd decided

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.670
to pull.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:44.780
He also makes a quick reference to Taxi Driver’s
famous “you talkin’ to me” scene.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.000
Rudd also later slips in some light swearing
with his young co-star, whom he believes to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.110
be sleeping but she full on calls him out
on it shortly after.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.600
Captain America: Winter Soldier
How many hits does it take to break a simple

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.459
lock with Captain America’s awesome shield?

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.250
As it turns out...many.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.230
Chris Evans repeatedly brings shield to lock,
mocking a bashing movement only the dummy

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.230
lock won’t budge, resulting in Evans both
laughing manically and looking like a child

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.230
who just lost his candy, pouting in the corner.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.230
Thankfully for Evans, he was able to muster
up some of that super soldier serum and eventually

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.230
break the lock, thank goodness.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.150
A superhero isn’t much good if they can’t
break a simple lock.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.560
The Avengers
Here we have a standout blooper that has become

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.590
something of an internet meme.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.170
Despite being the God of Thunder and the proud
owner of Mjolnir, it looks like Thor still

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200
isn’t quite so worthy to wield the mighty
hammer.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.790
When the prop hammer is toss to Chris Hemsworth,
the actor miscalculates his catch and ends

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.870
up fumbling the hammer in a majestic juggle
in the mist of the alien invasion before ultimately

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.120
dropping it.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:06.030
Now’s not the time for these shenanigans
Thor!

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.970
Guardians of the Galaxy
Guardians of the Galaxy was already a pretty

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.300
goofy movie, filled with hysterical moments
that have become a defining feature of the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.580
space opera.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.720
It should come as no surprise then that there
were a ton of equally funny blooper moments

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.030
that happened during the production of the
2014 hit.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.581
One such moment was when Michael Rooker’s
Yondu decides to go full child mode on the

00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:37.190
Broker, spewing pure jibberish over and over
again.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.370
His fellow Ravager can be seen behind him,
trying very hard not to burst out into laughter.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.591
Avengers: Age of Ultron
We all know the Avengers cast likes to have

00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.070
on set.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.870
Just check out Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson
having fun with the classic “avengers assemble”

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.819
line from the end of Age of Ultron.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.480
But what happens when the actors mess up in
such a way that is both completely unintentional,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.010
amusing and the last thing you’d expect
to happen as an actor.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.850
That’s what happened to Mark Ruffalo in
Ultron as the actor missed his footing completely

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.780
in the Avengers Tower set and slid down Tony
Stark’s elaborate penthouse catwalk, resulting

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:40.660
in an uncontrolled and rapid descent as he
flails his arms wildly.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.790
Hopefully it didn’t make him mad.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.139
Doctor Strange
How Strange.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.720
When doing a fight scene without any actual
physical interactions, you’re bound to look

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.430
a little silly.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.210
Benedict Cumberbatch took this to a whole
other level during the production of Doctor

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.050
Strange and took his choreographed moves beyond
the fight scene.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.419
In the midst of battle, Cumberbatch decides
to turn his fight into a hilarious dance sequence,

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.750
complete with spins, shakes and sound effects.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:25.400
To be honest, it’s not the strangest thing
we’ve seen in this movie.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.650
X Men: Days of Future Past
Boy, she looked happy.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.600
Days of Future Past brought back the original
cast of characters, including Patrick Stewart,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.610
Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.300
During a scene with Berry, Jackman’s Wolverine
engages in some small talk with Storm before

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.449
full on making out with the surprised actress.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:52.330
In typical Wolverine fashion, Jackman walks
away to a casual “see you later” but that

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.189
doesn’t stop Halle Berry from full on freaking
out in joy, jumping up and down screaming

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.189
yes.

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:07.020
I’m sure that’s how most women would react
to…heck probably the men too (be honest).

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.580
Avengers
Leave it to Mark Ruffalo to have fun on yet

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.370
another Avengers movie.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.169
For a guy who plays an “angry green rage
monster”, he certainly knows how to let

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.460
loose on set.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.640
In the film, Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner is about
to reveal to everyone that his secret is that

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.919
he’s always angry.

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.500
Yet that’s not what happened at some point
during the shoot.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.919
When the sound effects for the Asgardian Whale
cue in, Banner straight up just bolts from

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.070
the action, leaving Captain America behind
with Hawkeye with an amused “dude you’re

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.070
on your own!” being hollered as he flees
the scene.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.340
Chris Evans can’t help but crack a smile
before the camera pans to show Scarlet Johansson

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.020
starting blankly into oblivious before realizing
Ruffalo just passed her by.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.930
Spider Man 3
Leave it to J.K. Simmons portrayal of J. Jonah

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.870
Jameson to make the cut for having a hysterical
blooper moment that unsurprisingly, fits in

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.470
completely with his character.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.640
When confronting his boss about running a
particular headline, Ted Raimi’s Hoffman

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.170
finds himself grabbing a set of chimes to
protect himself from Jameson’s furious rage.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.199
Unfortunately for Hoffman, the chimes fell
apart when he grabbed them, resulting in Jameson…or

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.199
J.K. Simmons to yell out “you broke my f******
chimes!” before turning to face the camera,

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.199
unable to fathom the incompetence of his peer.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.319
Deadpool
Leave it to the Merc with the Mouth to have

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.900
the shock and awe bloopers.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.680
To be honest, most of the gags and accidents
from any of the Deadpool gag reels could fall

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.440
into legitimate film footage since they fit
the tone of the film perfectly, from its crude

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:30.830
humor to the overuse of “colourful” language.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.699
One such instance was when co-star TJ Miller
compared Gina Carano’s Angel Dust’s haircut

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.910
to, well, a not nice way of saying it looked
like Justin Beiber did some not so PG13 things

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.910
to Miley Cyrus’ haircut.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.800
Why wasn’t this in the final film?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.810
The crown jewel however is when Reynolds is
in the car during the opening action scene

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.550
and messes up his fight choreography, resulting
in Reynolds breaking into song, joining by

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.760
the smiling and head weaving stuntman and
a very confused driver, who has to look over

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:01.620
his shoulders to make sure he’s actually
hearing this right.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.620
Perfect.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.940
So there you have it folks, 10 marvel bloopers
they couldn’t plan even if they tried.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.699
Do you agree with our list?

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:10.960
