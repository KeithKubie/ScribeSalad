00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.260
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCVT

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.310
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.817
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.730
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.770
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.374
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.870
Our guest today is Steve Squyres

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.720
who is the Goldwin Smith
professor of astronomy

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.660
at Cornell University.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.199
He is the chief scientist
and principle investigator

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.199
of the Mars Exploration Rover Mission.

00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:03.822
That mission is described
in his book Roving Mars.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.860
Steve, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.230
- It's a pleasure to be back.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.680
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160
- I was born and raised
in Southern New Jersey,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.250
right across the river from Philadelphia.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.850
- Looking back how did your parents

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.400
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.360
- Oh, they shaped my
thinking in an enormous way.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.492
I have been a scientist

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:27.410
as long as I can remember.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.610
When I was six years old I
considered myself a scientist

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.140
I just wasn't a very good one yet.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.420
Both my parents were scientists.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.950
My father is a chemical
engineer, actually.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.120
He got his doctorate from MIT.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.790
My mother was a zoology
major at Wellesley.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.211
That was where they met in Boston.

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.300
When I was growing up
when I was a little kid

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.050
I was always interested in science.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:51.432
I would go to my parents with questions.

00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:53.842
Dad would handle all
the physical sciences,

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.260
and mom would handle all
the life sciences stuff,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.210
so if I was looking through
a microscope at cells

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.260
I would talk to my mom,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.760
and if I was building a weather
station out in the backyard

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.910
I would talk to my dad.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.049
They were both very encouraging,

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.530
and remarkably tolerant.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.950
I was one of those kids I
had a little chemistry set,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.560
and I would do experiments
that would, sometimes,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.100
not do great things, you know,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.493
things would blow up
and burn and so forth.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:25.045
They put up with a lot.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:30.045
- I get the sense that not
only were you developing

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.590
your science curiosity,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.870
but also somewhere you
were getting the notion

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.740
of being an explorer.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.453
- Yeah, very much so.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430
When I was young I was fascinated

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.630
by the history of exploration.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.890
I would read books about exploration

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.920
of the Arctic and the
Antarctic, mountaineering.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.570
I love climbing mountains myself.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.010
I grew up in New Jersey where it's flat,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.680
but we took a family vacation to Colorado

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.700
when I was eight years old,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.590
and I just fell in love
with mountaineering,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.300
and climbing mountains.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.369
What initially drew me to
geology was I like science,

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.870
I like climbing mountains

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.910
I figure I could do
science in the mountains,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.246
so that was what initially
pulled me into geology.

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:19.380
The other thing, of course,
was I grew up in the '60s,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.070
and that's when Mercury and Gemini,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.320
and Apollo were happening.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.590
I was 13 years old

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.883
when Aldrin and Armstrong
walked on the moon.

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:33.170
That was what always fascinated me.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.238
- What about popular
culture, movies and so on,

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:39.624
shows like Star Trek
did they have an impact?

00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:41.540
- Yeah, actually less so.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.300
I've never been a big
follower of science fiction.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.505
I mean, I was aware of that stuff,

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:50.450
but it wasn't science
fiction that drove me so much

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.343
as it was real exploration
as it was happening

00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:55.062
with things like Apollo,

00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:59.370
and then reading through
the history of exploration,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.220
and Cook, and Columbus,
and Magellan, and Scott,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.290
and Amundsen, and the Antarctic,
and that sort of stuff.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.180
- What about school
before you went to college

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.841
were you experiencing
good science education,

00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:14.230
or was it really the home environment?

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.640
- It was more the home environment.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.400
I mean, I went to high school,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.790
and I took sort of the
standard courses that you take,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.632
but to do the kind of
science that I wanted to do

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:27.430
when I was young I wanted to
design my own experiments,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.023
and make my own mistakes.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.350
It was really more at home

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.523
the really interesting science that I did.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.800
The things that I learned

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.390
I learned largely from
my parents, actually.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.100
- [Harry] Where did you do
your undergraduate work?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.430
- I was at Cornell University.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.213
I was at Cornell as an undergraduate,

00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:48.590
as a graduate student
and now as a professor.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.400
I tried to escape from
the place a couple times,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.840
and didn't succeed either time,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.140
but when I was an undergraduate
I was a geology major.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.480
I'm a professor of astronomy now,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.413
but at the time I was doing just straight

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:00.730
bang it with a hammer geology.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.901
- What did you do your scientific work

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.270
as a graduate student on
did you do a dissertation?

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.459
- Yeah, I was very fortunate
in that I went to grad school

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.470
I was in grad school from 1978 to 1981.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.088
That was right when the Voyager mission

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:21.270
to Jupiter and Saturn was happening.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.263
I was very lucky that
I was able to work with

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:27.710
the Voyager science team,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.430
and I wrote my thesis on
two of the moons of Jupiter.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300
It was just fantastic

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.700
very formative experience for me

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.477
working on that mission it
was an incredible experience.

00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:44.460
- Was it the excitement of discovery,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.838
or was it that all of your
education and your background

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.778
was meeting in the right place to be?

00:05:50.778 --> 00:05:52.730
- Everything was perfect.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.650
I mean, all my background,
all my interests

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.810
were beautifully focused
on trying to do the geology

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.529
of these moons of Jupiter,

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.630
and then I got to just be
there and be part of it.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.180
We went from the moons of Jupiter

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.550
being these little points
of light, literally,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.040
that you could study in a telescope

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.820
into worlds that you could map,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.170
and do geology on in 48 hours.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.510
It was phenomenal.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.570
- Before we talk about the Mars mission

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.130
I want to get your insights
on being a scientist.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.190
What is the skillset

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.975
beyond the obvious

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.950
that really makes the kind
of work you do possible?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.130
- Yeah, I mean, there
are the obvious things,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.470
but I think the most
important characteristic

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.430
that you need to have to
be a success as a scientist

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.620
is just a deep and fundamental curiosity

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.007
about how the world works,

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:56.083
and science is figuring stuff out.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.210
I always say that being a geologist

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.125
is like being a detective
at the scene of a crime.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.360
There are clues and the
clues are in the rocks,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.530
and you're trying to read those clues,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.007
and figure out what happened at this place

00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:09.723
three billion years ago on Mars.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.560
If you don't have that curiosity,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.510
I don't care how smart you are.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.410
I don't care how good you are at math.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.230
I don't care how well educated you are,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.310
or where you went to school

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.045
if you don't wake up in the morning

00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:25.800
wanting to go figure out stuff

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.100
you're not gonna really
be a good scientist

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.100
because that's the key it's
having that curiosity drive you.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.150
- The curiosity, and also
involved in that I guess

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.610
is posing the right questions.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.120
- Yeah, actually, that's
a really important point

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.640
is that if you look at
scientists and you ask yourself

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.343
who's successful and who's not,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.990
a big part of it really is

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.293
picking the right questions to work on.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.173
That has many dimensions.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.390
One dimension just the practical one

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.110
is that if you want to do science,

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.810
especially, big complicated science

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.140
you need funding, you need money,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.140
so you got to pick a problem

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.900
that somebody's willing
to pay to have solved,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.747
and you got to write a proposal,

00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:17.530
and you got to get the
funding to get that done,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.363
and that's just a practical reality,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.473
but the other thing is

00:08:21.473 --> 00:08:23.570
if you want to have an
impact as a scientist

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.310
you have to pick the problems that matter,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.410
the ones that are fundamental
to our understanding.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.640
Those are sometimes not as obvious

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.330
as you might think they would be.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.108
I mean, there are some that are obvious.

00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:39.740
Is there life on Mars?

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.470
That's an easy one, okay?

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.120
There are others that
aren't obvious at first,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.820
and then somebody finds
something cool and off you go.

00:08:48.777 --> 00:08:53.020
There's an element of intuition
I guess I would call it.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.890
Having a sense of what's the
important stuff to work on.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.640
Another thing is you need
to be able to pick problems

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.630
that actually are sort of solvable.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.180
I mean, there are important,
exciting problems out there

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.980
that are just intractable,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.310
and if you spend 20 years of your career

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.630
banging your head against a brick wall,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.250
and the wall doesn't fall
down you've wasted 20 years,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.780
so you really want to be
sure that you pick problems

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.340
that you can actually make
some headway on as well.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.680
- I think I read an interview with you,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.090
or maybe it was in the book
that part of your transition

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.850
from geology to space was about,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.250
well, there would be more
interesting questions

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.250
out in space than there were
on the ground here in geology.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.810
Is that a fair restatement
of what you said,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.123
or is that what you meant?

00:09:47.123 --> 00:09:49.773
- I wouldn't say it quite
that way, but you're close.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.470
This really gets to my
passion for exploration

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.233
as well as just pure science.

00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:02.810
I went into geology it was
the field that I chose,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.810
and spent several years
getting trained to do geology,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.990
but after about three years
of that as an undergraduate

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.287
what I came to realize
is that the geologists

00:10:15.287 --> 00:10:17.360
who have been working on this planet

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.620
for a couple hundred years

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.420
have done a pretty darn good
job of figuring things out.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.490
While there is enormously
important and interesting science

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.010
that remained to be done

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.810
because of I was driven
by the desire to explore

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.840
as well as to do science

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.560
I craved working in a field

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.720
where there were things that
had just never been seen,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.720
where there were problems
that hadn't even emerged yet.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.520
I was sort of drifting towards maybe doing

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.280
some kind of work in the deep ocean

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.550
because the deep ocean
is one of the most poorly

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.343
understood portions of our planet,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.220
but then I got exposed
to planetary exploration.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.740
I took a course

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.480
at Cornell that was being
taught by a professor there

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.700
who is a member of the science team

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.250
for the Viking mission to Mars.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.600
This was going on at the
time in the late '70s.

00:11:15.043 --> 00:11:18.233
I was an undergraduate it
was a graduate level course.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.480
We were expected because
it was a graduate course

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.520
to do some kind of pieces
of original research

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.060
for our term paper,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.318
so a few weeks into the
semester I'm thinking to myself

00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:31.780
I better start working on my
term paper so I go to this room

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.600
where all the pictures
from Mars were kept.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.320
This is, of course, before CD-ROMs,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.737
and Internet and all that kind of stuff,

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:40.300
and the pictures were just on
rolls of photographic paper.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.090
I remember walking into
that room and sitting down,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.670
and looking at these pictures of Mars

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.281
that hardly anybody in the
world had ever seen before

00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:49.623
I was gonna spend 15 or 20
minutes flipping through pictures

00:11:49.623 --> 00:11:52.000
I walked out of that room four hours later

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.060
knowing exactly what I wanted
to do with the rest of my life

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.130
because this was the blank canvas

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.210
that I had been looking for.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.440
I mean, I didn't understand

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.790
what I was looking at in these pictures,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.630
but the beauty of it was nobody did.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.800
That was what appealed to me.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.189
- Now in a project like the Rover project

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:15.385
it's not just scientists
it's also engineers.

00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:17.830
- [Steve] Oh, it sure is you bet.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.290
- In your book you make an interesting

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.070
distinction between the two.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.430
Tell us a little about engineers,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.520
and compare them with the work of science,

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.540
which you've just described.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.600
- Yeah, it's quite different, I mean,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.730
scientist are truth seekers.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.900
You're trying to understand
how the world works,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.113
how the universe works.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.103
That's what drives you

00:12:44.103 --> 00:12:47.330
it's the curiosity about how things work.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.860
Engineers are creators, they're inventors,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.100
they're tinkerers, they're
people who build stuff,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.010
and their goal is to build
something that works,

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.763
and does so in an elegant,
successful fashion.

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:04.780
Engineers because they're
actually building real things

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.760
have to grapple with certain realities.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.843
You have a finite budget
to build something.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.690
You maybe have a finite schedule.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.930
Certainly, if you're sending
spacecraft off to Mars

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.763
you have a launch date,

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.413
and you better make that launch date.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.080
Engineers have to make compromises.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.930
They might have a concept in their head

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.640
for what would be the most
elegant machine you can imagine

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.940
to accomplish this task,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.129
but it costs too much,

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:33.289
it would take too long
to build it, et cetera,

00:13:33.289 --> 00:13:36.473
so you have to come up
with something that works.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.790
So there's this very
interesting interaction

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.410
that takes place between
scientists and engineers

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.670
where the scientist has some concept for

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.470
I want a machine that will do this,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.540
so I go and talk to an
engineer and the engineer says,

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.925
well, we could try that
let's see what we can do,

00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:52.764
but then, of course, the
scientist wants it to be perfect,

00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:54.344
the engineer wants it to work,

00:13:54.344 --> 00:13:56.550
and those two are sort of at conflict

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.130
with one another in the
real world when you have

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.750
these schedule constraints
and budget constraints.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.800
So there's this very interesting interplay

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.023
that goes back and forth
between scientists.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.430
It can be wonderful or
it can go very wrong.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.010
When it's wonderful as it
was on our rover mission

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.610
there's this wonderful creative
interplay that takes place.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.892
What I found was that
the key to making it work

00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:24.610
is that the scientists need
to learn some engineering,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.300
and the engineers need
to learn some science.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.990
We put a lot of effort on our
project into achieving that.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.950
I give a whole lot of credit
to our project manager

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.660
the engineer who sort of
led the engineering team

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.640
because he kind of instilled
the view among the engineers

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.580
that were doing this for the science.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.580
I tried very hard with my
science team to hammer into them

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.343
that if engineering doesn't
work we get nothing,

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.940
so we got to learn some engineering,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.120
and we got to respect
what the engineers do.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.610
I'll bet you, I'll bet you

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.430
that if you came and you sat in

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.812
on one of our daily
tactical planning sessions

00:15:05.812 --> 00:15:09.361
where we have a team
of a dozen scientists,

00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:11.630
and a dozen engineers
sitting together in a room,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.920
and figuring out exactly
what we're gonna do

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.430
with the rovers on Mars

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.970
I bet you could sit there for an hour,

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.300
and still not quite figure out

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.060
who were the scientists
and who were the engineers.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.597
The team is blended so well now

00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:26.480
that I think you'd have a hard
time telling the difference.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.660
- Now it's very clear
in reading your book,

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.310
and watching the movie
which is also very good

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.796
I should mention that
a Disney produced movie

00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:38.710
with the same title Roving Mars

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.640
that you had the important
role of being the leader,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.230
so you're not just a scientist
working with engineers

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.170
you're the leader of a science

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.240
mission project, so let's
talk a little about that role.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.370
What are the characteristics

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.720
that make it work,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.980
and how do you learn
as the process goes on?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.180
- Well, you learn by making mistakes,

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.530
and doing the best you can.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.260
I'm the leader of the
science team for the mission.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.430
You can't boss scientists around.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.210
You're not the general in an army

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.000
with a bunch of privates under
you that you tell what to do.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.900
Scientists do what they do
because they love what they do,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.700
and they're creative, and they work best

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.313
when they're allowed to
exercise that creativity.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.401
The way we tried to lead on this project

00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:45.930
in some respects I think

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.440
it was similar with the engineers, too.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.670
I mean, we had a very, very
talented engineering team.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.070
These are people who
had a tough job to do.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.973
They needed to create something.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.013
What you do when you're leading
a group of people like that

00:16:59.013 --> 00:17:02.250
is rather than giving
them a lot of directives,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.280
writing a lot of memos
and giving a lot of orders

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.920
what you want to do instead is

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.250
make sure everybody
knows what their job is.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.270
You create a structure in which

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:16.170
everybody has a clearly
defined responsibility.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.930
You make sure they know the processes

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.990
that they're supposed to
follow to get that job done,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.443
and then you kind of stand back
and let the machinery work.

00:17:28.222 --> 00:17:31.520
I think the best leader of
an organization like this

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.350
is one who gives no orders at all

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.450
that you create an
organization that runs so well

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.050
that you can take your hands
off and just let it go.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.270
I'm proud that I think
we've achieved that.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.920
I mean, I could get hit by a bus today,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.270
and the rovers would never know.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.454
My team is so good they don't
need me, they don't need me.

00:17:52.454 --> 00:17:56.300
Another thing is if you
create an organization

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.880
in which any person the
leader or anybody else

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.530
is indispensable, irreplaceable
you've made a mistake.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.902
If you're spending 900
million taxpayer dollars,

00:18:06.902 --> 00:18:08.143
which we are,

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.450
you better not have anybody
who is just essential

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.700
because stuff can happen.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.260
We've worked really hard
to create an organization

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.030
where everybody knows
their job, things go well.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.700
I'm here at Berkeley today.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.120
The rovers are gonna be operated.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.060
The science team is gonna be meeting.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.040
In fact, they're meeting
right now as we're speaking

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.040
now that I think about it

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.840
planning the next day's
worth of operations on Mars,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.830
and I don't know what they're doing,

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.630
but I know they're doing it
well because they always do.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.080
- It's an interesting
expression the rovers

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.500
when you use that expression

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.230
you're not just talking about the robots

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.710
you're talking about the
team that are actually part,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.605
or was that just?

00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:53.627
- Yeah, it all sort of
blends together in your mind

00:18:53.627 --> 00:18:55.283
after a while.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.820
We see these rovers as
extensions of ourselves.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.660
We want to understand Mars.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.400
We want to explore Mars.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.010
If any of us had the ability
to strap on our boots,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.400
and our space helmets and
go there ourselves we would.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.920
Instead we experience Mars
through the rover's eyes.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.513
We touch Mars with the rover's arm.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.067
That eyesight, that arm
they're very human like.

00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:25.330
Some of it's coincidence,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.080
but some of it's quite intentional.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.280
You see yourself as almost
being there virtually

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.163
through the rovers.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.330
You're standing there on Mars kind of,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.217
and you look around with
the cameras and you think,

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:49.370
oh, that looks interesting
let's go there and then you do,

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.467
and the next day you're there,

00:19:50.467 --> 00:19:54.390
and there are pictures of what
you wanted to see closeup.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.053
It's so much like being there.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.020
Yeah, it kind of blends
together in your head

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.118
a little bit after a while.

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:05.858
- Now all this comes about,

00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:07.670
and we'll talk a little more about

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.750
the rovers and the mission in a minute,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.000
it's very interesting because
in your book you describe

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.330
that this particular project was kind of

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.510
the third or fourth proposal,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.110
so you had to deal with the frustration

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.750
of writing proposals that weren't funded,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:26.940
didn't win the competition.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.280
Talk a little about that

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.840
because there is an
interface here big science,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.210
big engineering teams,

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.570
but you have to go to the government

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.370
to be funded and win in a competition.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.720
- Yeah, you do and that's
the way it should be.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.180
There are a lot of ideas out there

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.340
for interesting things
that you can do in space,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.270
and they all cost a lot of money.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.780
I mean, an inexpensive planetary mission

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.810
costs half a billion dollars.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.084
These are phenomenally expensive things.

00:20:57.084 --> 00:21:00.449
There are lots of great ideas
out there far more good ideas

00:21:00.449 --> 00:21:03.270
than you can actually fund and carry out,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.870
so how do you decide what to fly?

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.699
It's largely via a competitive process.

00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:10.570
Yeah, we went through a period, I mean,

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.950
I started writing proposals

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.003
for what eventually became
this mission in 1987.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.127
We finally got selected four proposals,

00:21:18.127 --> 00:21:21.430
and 10 years later in 1997,

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.570
and there was a string of
failed proposals in there.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.850
Each one was better than the one before.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.010
Frankly, the early ones
probably weren't good enough,

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.640
and they didn't deserve to be selected.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.980
They weren't at the level of quality

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.720
that it made sense for
the American taxpayers

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.360
to invest hundreds of millions
of dollars on our idea

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.610
because our idea wasn't good enough yet.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.180
It was bitterly disappointing
when you put years of effort,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.810
and hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.592
into writing a proposal
and it gets shot down,

00:21:50.592 --> 00:21:51.928
but looking back on it

00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:53.990
they probably deserved to be shot down.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.860
I can see the flaws,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.840
and we got smarter, and we got better,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.763
and we honed our ideas.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.400
There was stuff that we
would have liked to have done

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.320
that we had to take out

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.523
because we had to make
compromises to make it all fit.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.840
Then in the end, finally, 1997

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.770
after 10 years of writing proposals

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.775
we got selected to do a mission,

00:22:16.775 --> 00:22:20.060
and then there was great
turmoil in the Mars program

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.400
we got flat out canceled,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.740
and brought back to life three times.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.742
It wasn't really until the year 2000

00:22:25.742 --> 00:22:29.320
that we got the final go ahead from NASA

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.020
to build these two rovers.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.370
We initially thought we
were gonna build one,

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.780
and then they decided to fly two.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.950
Once they sort of made the decision,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.400
and gave us the money we had
34 months to actually do it

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.253
before we had to be on top
of the rockets in Florida.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.260
There was this brutally long
period of writing proposals,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.020
and trying to get NASA to say yes,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.500
and then once they finally said yes,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.380
there was this brutally
short period of time

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.180
that we had to actually get it done.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.983
- Let me, there's one point
I did want to bring out

00:23:01.983 --> 00:23:05.557
because in your book there's
this beautiful description of

00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:08.357
how each time you would
be writing a proposal

00:23:08.357 --> 00:23:10.500
you would get a group together,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.440
and you struggled with
a blank piece of paper,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.343
and you sort of had to put it all down.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.701
All of this losing,

00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:26.370
then winning, actually competing,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.157
but then bringing on board
former competitors and so on,

00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:31.560
it was all part of that?

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.687
- Oh, yeah, it's this very
complicated evolutionary process,

00:23:35.687 --> 00:23:37.970
and like you said it starts
with a blank sheet of paper.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.160
The blank sheet of paper phase

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.750
is actually one of my favorite parts

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.410
of the whole space mission game,

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.150
but it's a scary part because, boy,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.120
you can go terribly wrong in that phase,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.950
and have very bad consequences downstream.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.910
The blank sheet of paper is
literally you've got an idea.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.100
I want to find out what
it was like on Mars

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.160
four billion years ago,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.050
and could the conditions
there have supported life?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.460
I know that the basic approach
to doing that sort of thing

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.100
that works on Earth is you
go and you do field geology,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.960
and you look at the rocks,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.940
and you read the story in the rocks,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.800
so that's what I want to do.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.380
Okay, now how do I do it?

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.587
I mean, how do I actually
build a piece of hardware

00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:18.750
that you can strap on top of a rocket,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.670
and shoot off to Mars and
it's actually gonna work?

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.820
You sit down and you
gather colleagues, friends,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.610
people who you know who are really smart,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:28.480
and good at this kind of stuff,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.000
and you start throwing around ideas.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.420
Well, we could try this,
well, we could try that.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.100
Oh, man, we went through so many.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.660
There were iterations of this mission

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.670
where the rover would descend
on this powered lander,

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.860
it would land, look around,
and then take off again,

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.160
and go land somewhere else,
we had all sorts of ideas.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.446
Many of them turned out to be impractical

00:24:45.446 --> 00:24:46.677
including that one.

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:53.418
You fill in that blank sheet
of paper with your ideas,

00:24:53.418 --> 00:24:56.665
and then you put in a
proposal and you compete,

00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:58.840
and you compete against other colleagues

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.410
who have similar ideas,

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.450
and maybe you succeed and maybe you fail.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.460
Most of the time you fail.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.820
When that happens it feels really bad.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.920
Then you kind of regroup and you say,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.110
okay, what are we gonna try now?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.680
Sometimes, as you said,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.950
you approach some of your
competitors and you say,

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.330
well, we've got a good idea,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.200
but you've got a pretty
good idea there, too.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.270
You want to team up maybe?

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.704
So there's a lot of
that stuff that goes on.

00:25:20.704 --> 00:25:23.110
Yeah, we went through
10 years of that stuff

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.040
before NASA finally said yes.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.300
- Help us understand better now why Mars.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.300
You touched on that, I
mean, when you go from Mars

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.897
what is it that our audience
should understand about Mars,

00:25:37.897 --> 00:25:41.264
and what makes it
attractive for a scientist

00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:44.400
to go after the question
you're looking at?

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.830
- The thing that makes Mars important

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.890
is that it's one of the few
places in our solar system

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.050
that's enough like Earth

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:59.800
that you can imagine life
having once taken hold there.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.120
In fact, while it's
sort of like Earth today

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.270
there's strong evidence, powerful evidence

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.060
that in the past it was more like Earth.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.010
It was warmer, it was wetter,

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.750
there was liquid water at the surface.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.420
You can see places on
Mars where it looks like

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.900
water pooled and ponded
and flowed and so forth,

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.560
so because water is such a
crucial ingredient for life

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.770
Mars becomes a compelling target

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.840
to try to answer the question of

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.080
are we the only life in the solar system,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.230
or has life taken hold somewhere else?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.830
Now Mars is not the only
place you can do that.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.680
Another world that I'm very fascinated by,

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.410
and have been for years is Europa.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.680
Europa is a big moon of Jupiter.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.025
It has a crust of ice and
we think below that crust

00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:46.090
may be an ocean of liquid water.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.730
If I could figure out how
to do submarines on Europa

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.470
maybe I wouldn't be doing rovers on Mars,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.164
but Mars is both important

00:26:55.164 --> 00:27:00.000
to the question of life and
comparatively accessible.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.966
You can actually build a robot,

00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:04.755
and go to rock outcrops on Mars

00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:08.994
that preserve evidence of
what it was like long ago,

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.610
and read that record,

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.103
and infer things about
what the planet was like.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.240
That was what drove us was
it's the life question.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.900
I mean, that's what makes Mars special.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.025
- How far away is Mars?

00:27:23.025 --> 00:27:24.734
If you're planning a vacation

00:27:24.734 --> 00:27:28.050
how long is it gonna take to get there?

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.923
- You better be ready for a long trip.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.923
Mars is,

00:27:33.917 --> 00:27:37.243
you know, roughly 50% farther from the sun

00:27:37.243 --> 00:27:38.670
than the Earth is.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.530
Of course, the planets are always moving,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.123
so the distance between Earth
and Mars is always changing.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.730
When you launched from Earth to go to Mars

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.430
typical travel time is maybe seven months,

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.943
six to eight months it took
us seven months to get there.

00:27:56.767 --> 00:27:59.007
That's long trip.

00:27:59.007 --> 00:28:00.620
- Did you know how much money

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.170
you would have in the beginning,

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.070
or did the amount of money
you have change over time?

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.903
- Oh, my.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.593
It changed.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.150
When NASA first asked us to do this,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.370
and told us they wanted two rovers

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.290
we did the very best we could

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.750
to estimate what it was gonna cost,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.860
and I remember the number
it was $688 million,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.160
and we were sure, I mean,

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.430
we had all sorts of margin
on top of that, you know,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.380
we were quite confident in that number.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.740
As it turns out we were wrong,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.880
and our budget overran,

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.880
and in the end it cost about $800 million

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.050
to get the rovers to Mars,

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.330
and then we've spent another
$100 million since then

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.423
operating them so we underestimated.

00:28:47.594 --> 00:28:49.730
That's not uncommon in the space business

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:50.870
you're trying to do something

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.200
that nobody's ever done before

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.470
so it's hard to guess
exactly what it's gonna cost

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.340
because it's difficult to foresee

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.550
the problems you're gonna encounter.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.520
We encountered many terrible problems

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.620
in the process of building our rovers,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.810
but fundamentally the bad ones
all stemmed from one thing.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.220
We underestimated how
big the rover had to be

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.853
by about 10% just by a little bit, okay?

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.240
We had a design for a
lander, for a parachute,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.420
for airbags all that stuff

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.560
that we had inherited
from a previous mission.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.000
There was the Mars Pathfinder mission,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.270
wonderful mission back in the mid '90s.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.650
The idea we were just gonna
scoop out the interior

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.507
of the Pathfinder land it so
we have a big empty space,

00:29:31.507 --> 00:29:33.750
and stuff our rover in there.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.610
If the rover fit

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.000
we really could have
done it for $688 million,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.201
but in the end the rover was
just a little too big to fit,

00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.400
so the lander had to get bigger,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.550
so everything got heavier,

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.770
so the airbags needed to be reinforced,

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.670
and the parachute had to be redesigned,

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.980
and everything changed.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.160
We had to redesign the
whole landing system,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.550
and that resulted in a cost overrun,

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.060
and, yeah, in the end it
cost about 800 million.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.360
- Now this team that was working on

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.825
these sets of problems that
were changing over time

00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:06.350
you attempt in the back of
your book to list them there

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.603
there are 4,000 plus really.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.140
- The real number is
probably something like

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.840
six or seven thousand, I
couldn't find them all,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.040
but, yeah, there were thousands of people

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.195
who worked on this mission.

00:30:18.195 --> 00:30:23.193
- So organizationally
you confront a problem,

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.690
you mentioned one the parachute problem

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.790
the rover is getting bigger and bigger,

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.947
and you have eight months to launch,

00:30:32.947 --> 00:30:37.678
and the parachute you
have sort of doesn't work.

00:30:37.678 --> 00:30:42.560
Organizationally, what happens
as you confront that problem

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.560
is it clear the sub-group
that this problem goes to,

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.280
and they're off working on it and so on?

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.250
- Yeah, I mean, you have to have clearly

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.680
delineated responsibilities.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.820
When a problem comes up
you got to be very certain

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.310
who owns that problem,

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.660
and whose responsibility it
is to find a solution to it,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.020
so in the case of the parachutes

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.270
we had a small group of individuals

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.515
led by one very talented creative person

00:31:08.515 --> 00:31:11.010
whose job it was to solve that problem.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.290
The approach they took was,
man, we're almost out of time.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.650
Let's develop three different
parachutes in parallel,

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.669
and hope that one of them
works and one of them did,

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:23.910
but that was a scary
problem and one among many.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.310
I mean, we had all sorts
of terrible things go wrong

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.950
over the course of
developing these rovers.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.340
To me it was a small miracle

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.823
that we even got to the
launch pad let alone Mars.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.640
- When you think of a
scientist working in a lab,

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.881
and creativity the light bulb goes off

00:31:41.881 --> 00:31:44.140
if we were a Disney cartoon

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.480
what is creativity

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.590
like in a group process like this?

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:56.590
In other words, is it that
you confront a problem

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.510
the right team with
the right relationships

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:05.070
working together and then a bulb goes off?

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.260
- It can work in different ways.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.987
It depends on the particular problem,

00:32:07.987 --> 00:32:09.203
and the nature of it.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.593
It is very much a team effort.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.719
These rovers are so complicated

00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:16.410
that no one understands them.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.770
There literally is no single human being

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.210
who understands these rovers.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.560
They're just too complicated

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.310
for a single person to wrap
their head around completely.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.470
As a team we understand them.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.470
As a team there's somebody who understands

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.610
each part of the vehicle well enough

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.620
that as an organization we get it,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.200
but when you're in the process of

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.630
creating something that complex

00:32:41.345 --> 00:32:45.740
it's a mix, it's a mix because
there are some problems

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.680
that you really require group
interaction to deal with.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.640
You've got some problem
that you're working on,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.823
and it has many, many
different elements to it.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.510
There's no single person
who is gonna be able to

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.730
solve that problem on their own.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.949
In other instances there
were a number of things

00:33:06.949 --> 00:33:10.750
that were solved by the
lone genius, if you will.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.390
We had a lot of geniuses
on our team I think,

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:17.739
and one person somewhere
has some brilliant insight,

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:21.280
and then you go, oh yeah,
that's got to be it,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.950
and you go charging off down that path,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.890
but it was one person's
instant of creativity

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.780
when they saw the solution
that nobody else saw,

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.610
and I give some examples
of that in the book

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.188
that we had what looked like
some insurmountable problem,

00:33:35.188 --> 00:33:37.330
and somebody goes, well,
wait, why don't we try this?

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:42.330
Everybody goes, by golly,
yeah, that's it, so it's a mix,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.540
but looking at it I think
a lot of the most important

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.260
really creative moments in
the design of this thing

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.330
came from the insights
of specific individuals,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.550
people whose job it was
to solve this problem,

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.076
and they just sat down and solved it.

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:03.130
- There's one episode

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.193
once the rovers are there
that sort of struck me.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.790
Briefly you lose contact with the rover.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.543
Yeah, you can't figure it out.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.983
There was a problem with the flash drive.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.520
It's very interesting because it was as if

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.130
the rover had died,
you're all running around.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.410
- I didn't sleep for three days.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:36.770
- But somebody, one
member of the team had--

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.333
- Glenn Reeves.
- Glenn Reeves.

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:39.666
- Brilliant guy.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.298
- It's an example of a kind of creativity

00:34:44.298 --> 00:34:45.757
that anticipated something.

00:34:45.757 --> 00:34:47.563
- Yes, that was a wonderful example.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.330
Yeah, what happened was
18 days into the mission

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.313
we just lost contact with
Spirit just gone, nothing.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.530
The way you troubleshoot
a problem on a spacecraft

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.900
is you look at the data that
you have in the telemetry

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.170
you figure out what's
going on and you fix it.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.774
The only thing we had was no telemetry

00:35:07.774 --> 00:35:09.203
that was really bad.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.760
Then what happened was we
started to get just little blips

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.740
of data from the rover,

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.490
and we finally sort of got the sense

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.199
that what was happening was
the computer was booting up,

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:23.020
it recognized the problem it crashed,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.840
and then it would boot up
again 15 minutes later.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.730
It was doing this over and over and over,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.410
and doing it during the night
when there's no solar power,

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.550
and the battery is going down
and down and down and down,

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.107
and sooner or later four
or five days of that,

00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:35.920
and the vehicle is gonna die,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.583
so we had a real problem on our hands,

00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:40.184
and we didn't know what was going on

00:35:40.184 --> 00:35:43.350
because we get these little
tiny fragments of data,

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.110
but what Glenn noticed
this was the breakthrough

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.520
was that Glenn started
looking at just these

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.357
little tiny blips of
data that we would get,

00:35:52.357 --> 00:35:53.840
and what he noticed was that

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.040
it was all what we call real time data.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.500
In other words, the rover is saying

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.110
here's what's happening to me now,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.410
here's what's happening to me now,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.500
here's what's happening to me now.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.877
None of it was this is
what happened an hour ago,

00:36:03.877 --> 00:36:06.690
or a day ago, or three minutes ago.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.190
It was all real time stuff,

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.800
and what that meant Glenn figured out

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.450
was that the rover had no memory.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.410
It could only say what
was going on at the time.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.490
During the development of the rovers

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.850
we had had a lot of problems

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.250
with the flash memory onboard the vehicle,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.754
and because of that Glenn
had created this command

00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:31.720
it was called, init.crippled,
initializing crippled mode.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.098
What it does is rather
than using the flash memory

00:36:35.098 --> 00:36:37.971
it builds a whole little
file system in RAM,

00:36:37.971 --> 00:36:40.479
in the computer instead,

00:36:40.479 --> 00:36:43.122
so we fired up based on his intuition,

00:36:43.122 --> 00:36:45.810
an init.crippled command, and boom,

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.320
the rover regained its sanity immediately,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.080
and it was a problem with the
flash management software.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.480
Once we regained control of the vehicle,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.370
and put it to sleep

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.560
to recharge the batteries
for a couple of days,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.064
then it was possible to
figure out what was going on,

00:37:00.064 --> 00:37:03.740
regain control and everything
was fine after that,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.040
but there was that moment of insight

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.720
when Glenn realized, oh,
it's all real time data.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.550
It's probably the flash.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.960
That was the thing that saved the mission.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.440
If it had gone for another couple days

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.740
we would have lost Spirit.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.850
- Help our audience understand
the rovers basically.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.453
- [Steve] Good luck with that.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.050
- I realize we could
take hours doing that,

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:30.380
but just sort of briefly,
first, how were they named?

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.550
- Oh, yeah, Spirit and Opportunity

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.230
the way they were named was that NASA held

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.050
I don't know if I'd call it a competition,

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.157
but an activity with school children

00:37:42.157 --> 00:37:44.470
across the country were invited to

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.580
write in and suggest names,

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.180
and write a short essay.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.653
Then there was this process to select

00:37:53.653 --> 00:37:56.343
the names from that pool.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.350
The names Spirit and Opportunity

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.290
were suggested by a little girl

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.400
I think she was about nine
years old at the time.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.860
She was from Arizona near Phoenix.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.333
Her name was Sofi Collis.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.533
She had been born in Russia,

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.120
and grew up initially
in an orphanage there.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.510
She lived in an orphanage in Russia

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.590
until she was about I
think four years old,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.660
something like that,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.530
she, you know, at the age
of nine could remember

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.340
some of her time in the orphanage,

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.030
and then she had been adopted
by an American family,

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.730
and had come to the United States.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.220
She wrote this very touching essay

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.010
it was like three sentences
long or something.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.355
I mean, she's nine years old,

00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:40.512
but she had picked the
name Spirit and Opportunity

00:38:40.512 --> 00:38:43.720
to sort of represent her feelings about

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.040
the opportunity that she got

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.690
to come and start her life
over in the United States.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.804
I've actually grown very
attached to those two names

00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:54.253
I thought they were wonderful choices.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.450
One of the things I liked about it is

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:01.300
those names sort of
follow in the tradition

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.000
of naming ships of
exploration after things

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.930
that express your hopes, your aspirations.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.570
Endeavor, one of the space shuttles,

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.250
but also named after James Cook's ship

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.430
on his first voyage of circumnavigation,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.500
great example of that,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.780
and Endurance, Ernest Shackleton's ship.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.290
I mean, there are many good
examples like that from history,

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.679
so I think Spirit and
Opportunity are great names.

00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:29.038
- Interestingly enough
the names sort of worked

00:39:29.038 --> 00:39:32.570
as you described what the two did

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:37.020
where Opportunity had opportunity
and Spirit had spirit.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.690
- Spirit had a lot of spirit, yeah.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.290
It's funny because the
rovers, yeah, I mean,

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.410
they're hunks of metal, okay,
I get that, they're robots,

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.060
but they're complicated enough.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.950
They sort of have developed

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.900
a certain amount of personality, right?

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.030
We made them as identical as we could,

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.390
but, of course, they're so complicated

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.980
that they have differences
between them anyway.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.829
- What can they do?

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:00.933
Talk as you're answering
the question, yeah, yeah.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.330
- Then once we got them to
Mars we wound up operating them

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.480
in very, very different environments,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.120
and in very, very different ways

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.610
so they've had very different experiences

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.350
since they got to Mars.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:18.510
In Opportunity's case the
big scientific discoveries

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.150
all came in the first six weeks.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:25.150
I mean, it was just right
there, right there, it was easy.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.900
Spirit had to work for everything.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:32.200
I mean, Spirit landed in this
horrible, rocky lava plain

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.990
with boulders strewn everywhere,

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.770
and had to struggle to get to these hills,

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.350
and then climb a mountain

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.800
to start finding the
really interesting science.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.130
I mean, what the rovers do

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.553
is just what you would do if you there.

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:48.500
There are sort of three key components.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.360
One is they can look around.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.690
They've got very good cameras

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.438
with the equivalent of 20/20 vision.

00:40:53.438 --> 00:40:55.930
Superman's got X-ray vision,
we got infrared vision.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.440
We can look off in the infrared
and use that to figure out

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.970
what rocks are made of
from 50, 100 meters away.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.420
When you find something interesting

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.560
the second thing they can do is move.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.240
They can go over and just like you,

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.790
oh, that looks like an interesting outcrop

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:10.200
let's go look at that,
so you walk over to it,

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.990
okay, we drive over to it.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:15.610
Then when you get close you
can investigate it in detail.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.443
We've got this arm,

00:41:16.443 --> 00:41:18.260
and it's got the same
dimensions as a human arm,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.000
and on the end of it there's
this suite of sensors

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.118
that includes a microscope,

00:41:22.118 --> 00:41:23.630
this thing we call a RAT

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.800
that can grind away the
outer layers of our rock.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.585
We've got spectrometers
that can look at the rock,

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.097
and tell us what it's made of,

00:41:29.097 --> 00:41:33.330
and those really gather the
in-depth clues that we can use

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.523
to figure out what happened here.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.410
It's just this constant
process of discovery,

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.630
you know, you land with an idea.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.700
At both landing sites
we landed with an idea

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.058
of what we were gonna find,

00:41:48.058 --> 00:41:52.100
totally completely utterly wrong.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.950
Could not have been more
wrong at both landing sites.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:59.060
Okay, so then you kind of
regroup, and you say, okay,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.293
this is different now
what are we dealing with?

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.433
You just explore.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.590
It's so much like

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:11.020
what real geologists do on Earth

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.840
when they're in the field
and doing what geologists do.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.633
It's real field geology on
another planet and that's fun.

00:42:20.172 --> 00:42:24.560
- As you describe the humans on Earth

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.600
interacting with the robots

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.043
I had this sense that it
was a combination of an ER,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.143
a family intervention,

00:42:36.222 --> 00:42:40.140
and parents communicating
with their children

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.540
away at college who were
dealing with a problem.

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:44.679
Is that fair?

00:42:44.679 --> 00:42:45.770
- Yeah, there are elements of that.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.200
I would also throw in maybe operating

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.890
a robotic remote-controlled
car or something.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.940
There are elements of
many aspects of that.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.880
The rovers

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:02.580
we designed them to be as capable,

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.680
and as flexible as we could

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.350
sort of like a Swiss Army knife

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:08.940
you equip them with
lots and lots of tools.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.170
You don't actually know what
tools you're gonna need.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.160
I mean, the environment that
we were sending them into

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.620
was so poorly known

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.693
that we couldn't design
for that environment

00:43:17.693 --> 00:43:19.380
because we didn't know what it was.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.980
We didn't know what things
we were gonna encounter,

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.490
so you have to just kind of imagine

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.190
the things you might find,

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.070
and imagine the tools that might help you

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:28.960
figure those things out,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.840
and then build those tools,

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.780
and cross your fingers
and hope for the best.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.170
You get there and what you
find is not what you expected.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.010
The tools you brought are pretty good,

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.870
but maybe not exactly
what you would have built

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.980
for the circumstances you encounter,

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.340
so then you start getting creative,

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.810
and you start figuring out
how to use the tools you got

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.660
to answer the problem
that Mars has given you

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.400
as opposed to the one
that you anticipated,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.823
and you improvise, you make
up stuff as you go along.

00:43:59.018 --> 00:44:00.650
We didn't know what we
doing when we landed.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:01.670
I man, how can you know what you're doing

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.117
when nobody's ever done it before, right?

00:44:03.117 --> 00:44:05.519
So you just figure it out as best you can.

00:44:05.519 --> 00:44:08.250
Another element, of course, is that

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.003
you command the rover
to do certain things,

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.260
but all of those things depend on how

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.810
it interacts with Mars.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.270
You turn the wheels to get it to go,

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:25.110
but, sometimes, the wheels
slip in the soil, okay.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.053
You want to take a picture of something,

00:44:27.053 --> 00:44:29.370
but you get close to it
and it doesn't look like

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.353
what you thought it was gonna look like.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.660
Sometimes, you tell the
rover to do something,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.530
and the result that you get

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.430
is not quite what you expected.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.120
We've gotten them stuck in sand dunes,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.820
all sorts of things have happened.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.190
When that happens you just figure it out.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.180
Also, stuff goes wrong.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.053
I mean, things break.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.820
These rovers are getting old.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.670
They're seven years old and
hardware breaks on these things,

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.070
and when hardware breaks

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.550
you can't go up with a
screwdriver and fix it

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.663
you got to figure out
how to work around it.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.580
There's this process of

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.326
just figuring out how to
deal with the unexpected.

00:45:08.326 --> 00:45:10.380
That's part of what
makes the operations fun.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.760
I mean, the constant discoveries,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.800
the scientific discoveries
are tremendous fun,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.458
but this challenge of taking
this thing that we built,

00:45:19.458 --> 00:45:22.490
and trying to make it work

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.320
in this crazy, unexpected,
unpredictable environment

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.970
that's a fascinating challenge as well.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.180
- In your lecture you said that the rovers

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.401
were programmed to have
courage to make choices.

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.050
Talk a little about that

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.717
because it's not all your guidance.

00:45:42.717 --> 00:45:46.690
- That's right, I mean, when
you think about this the rovers

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.720
they're very far away.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.420
A typical time that it takes to send

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.440
a radio signal to Mars
might be 10 minutes,

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.690
so you can't joystick it, you
can't operate it in real time

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.750
you have to send a set of commands.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.390
Typically what we do
is we'll send an entire

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.960
Mars day's worth of commands all at once.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.640
It gets those commands
first thing in the morning,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.060
and then we don't communicate with it.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.930
We told it what to do for
the day and it does it,

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.330
and at the end of day it
sends back the results.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.240
Sometimes you have to

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.150
ask the rover to make its own decisions.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.930
I mean, let's say we want
to drive long distances,

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.040
we want to drive, I mean,
with Opportunity right now

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.180
we're trying to drive
like 150 meters a day,

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.530
that's a long ways.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.570
We have good cameras,

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.460
but the cameras are not good enough

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.043
to reliably spot dangerous obstacles

00:46:39.043 --> 00:46:42.780
150 meters off in the distance
we just can't do that.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.900
So you got two choices.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.420
Either you can say we're only gonna drive

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.509
as far as we're confident we
can see which slows you down,

00:46:48.509 --> 00:46:51.430
or you can trust the rover

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.850
to look at the terrain in
front of it on its own,

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.480
and make smart choices,

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.960
and we've built that
capability into the vehicle.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.242
Typically, when we do a long drive

00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:03.240
the first part of it maybe
the first 70 or 80 meters

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.650
we will command explicit,

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.740
and we'll just tell the rover go, okay?

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.460
We can see, we know it's safe just go,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.900
go as fast as you can,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.266
but then once you get 80 meters out

00:47:12.266 --> 00:47:15.440
we want you to turn on your brain,

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.240
and we want you to start looking ahead,

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.160
and what the rover will
do is use its cameras

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.333
to look for obstacles.

00:47:21.334 --> 00:47:24.830
It can do onboard stereo matching,

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.320
so it takes two images,

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.070
uses those images to build
up a three-dimensional model

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.830
of the terrain in front of it,

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.660
and it will assess what it sees.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.650
If it looks smooth and
flat and smooth sailing

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:35.850
it will move forward.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.810
If it sees an obstacle it
will look at that obstacle,

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.980
and say, well, is that little enough

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.940
that I can drive over it,

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.053
or should maybe I go around this thing?

00:47:43.982 --> 00:47:46.894
Yeah, you can program different levels

00:47:46.894 --> 00:47:48.510
of courage or cowardice.

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.430
You can make it scared
of only big objects,

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.420
or if you think it's
really dangerous out there

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.583
you can make it scared
of little tiny ones.

00:47:57.945 --> 00:48:01.490
In that way the rover is able to

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:05.350
kind of pick its way through
what might otherwise be

00:48:06.472 --> 00:48:09.430
risky, dangerous obstacles.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.006
- What is the most
important thing you think

00:48:12.006 --> 00:48:14.100
we've learned from this mission?

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.950
- Well, that's a hard question

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.530
it's been going on for seven years now,

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.690
and we've made many
individual discoveries,

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.010
but if you take the most
important individual discoveries,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.510
and kind of wrap them together and say,

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.070
what have we really learned?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.770
What we've learned is that in the past

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:34.100
Mars clearly had habitable
conditions on its surface.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.780
There was liquid water below the surface.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.190
There was liquid water that
came up to the surface.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.500
There were hot springs.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.480
There were volcanic vents
with steam coming out of them.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.000
There were places that on Earth

00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:49.790
are inhabited by microbial life.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:53.090
Now that doesn't mean that
that happened on Mars.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.181
Being habitable and being inhabited

00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:57.470
are two different things,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.590
but there clearly were
times and places on Mars

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.420
were conditions would have
been suitable for life,

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.100
so what that says is

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.225
if you want to know whether
there truly was life on Mars

00:49:08.225 --> 00:49:11.442
you go to those places
with the right tools,

00:49:11.442 --> 00:49:14.210
and you investigate the
question of was there life.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.370
Maybe the best way is to bring rocks back,

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.930
and put them in the laboratories on Earth,

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.900
but was Mars once a habitable world?

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.373
Yeah, there were places
and times where it was.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.700
- Now I know that you have been chairman

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.190
of an advisory committee

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.813
to sort of look at the
future of space exploration.

00:49:30.813 --> 00:49:32.930
- Yes, that's been my other job

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.343
for the last couple of years.

00:49:34.343 --> 00:49:35.750
- I mean, the country

00:49:37.737 --> 00:49:41.930
is in a place where it has
to reassess its priorities,

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:42.763
and so on,

00:49:42.763 --> 00:49:45.820
so how should we think about

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.250
what we should do in the future?

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.680
This mission was such a great success

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.830
in the sense that the
rovers have gone more than

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.597
how many days, I mean?

00:49:57.597 --> 00:50:02.593
- [Steve] Today as we speak is day 2,586.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:07.630
- So building on that
sort of great achievement

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.110
of scientific leadership

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:11.870
how should we think about the future?

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.470
- Well, we can talk just about Mars,

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.913
or we can talk more broadly.

00:50:18.154 --> 00:50:19.930
As you say, one of the things that

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:20.986
I've been involved in recently

00:50:20.986 --> 00:50:23.770
it's called the Planetary Decadal Survey.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.296
It's a year's long process
of establishing priorities

00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:31.870
for the next decade of
solar system exploration.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:35.180
The conclusion from that process was that

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.940
the next thing to do at Mars

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.330
after we've completed the missions

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:42.860
that are in the works right
now is to bring samples back,

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.430
is to bring rocks back
from the Martian surface.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:48.327
We've gotten to the point
where we know enough about Mars

00:50:48.327 --> 00:50:53.190
that we know the good
places to go and it's

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:57.412
so hard to build instruments
that you can miniaturize,

00:50:57.412 --> 00:50:59.870
and ruggedize and put on top off a rock,

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.703
and then send to Mars.

00:51:00.703 --> 00:51:02.300
The best scientific instruments are always

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.100
gonna be back here on Earth,

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.190
so the next logical step for Mars

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.550
now that we've learned all
the things we've learned

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.810
is to find some of these
really critical rocks

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.003
that are most likely to
contain clues about life,

00:51:12.003 --> 00:51:15.710
and bring them back to this planet.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:19.253
So that is the next step for Mars,

00:51:20.229 --> 00:51:23.000
but there are other great
places to go as well.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.380
I mentioned Europa.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.785
Europa is this moon of Jupiter
that we think has an ocean,

00:51:26.785 --> 00:51:30.200
and it would be nice to
really understand that ocean,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.800
so there's a mission
that we're looking at,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.510
and thinking about that would
go into orbit around Europa,

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.040
and would carry a number of instruments.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.110
An intriguing one is a
long wavelength radar.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.470
I mean, radar at long wavelengths

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.900
can actually see through
kilometers of ice.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.360
That's how we've mapped the
bottom of the Antarctic,

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.030
and the Greenland ice sheets.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.600
Do that at Europa, find
out how thick that ice is.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.470
Find out how deep you have
to go to get to the ocean.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:58.900
Find where the thin spots are

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.355
so maybe some day in the distant future

00:52:00.355 --> 00:52:02.550
we can go there and get
down into the ocean,

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.120
so that's a very exciting mission.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.984
Another mission that
we're really excited about

00:52:07.984 --> 00:52:11.520
is a mission to Uranus or Neptune.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.980
They're basically three
different kinds of planets

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.813
in the solar system.

00:52:13.813 --> 00:52:15.460
You've got the terrestrial planets,

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.130
Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars are made of rock.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.840
We've explored those very well.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.680
You got the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.369
made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

00:52:23.369 --> 00:52:26.870
We've explored Jupiter with Galileo.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.890
We've explored Saturn
with the Cassini mission

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.890
which is going on right now,

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.420
and then you've got the ice
giants, Uranus and Neptune,

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.230
which they're made of
very, very different stuff

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.308
than Jupiter and Saturn are.

00:52:39.308 --> 00:52:40.900
They're not like anything else,

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.100
and all we've done is
fly by each of them once

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:47.640
with Voyager 2 with 1970's technology,

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.160
so there's enormous potential
for discovery there,

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.810
so another future mission would be kind of

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.011
an orbiter and a probe

00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:57.410
to go to one of those ice giant planets,

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.530
so those are some of the
really exciting things

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:00.363
I think on the horizon.

00:53:00.363 --> 00:53:05.363
- How critical is this
work in our future in space

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:09.904
to maintaining American
scientific leadership?

00:53:09.904 --> 00:53:12.040
- I think it's absolutely crucial.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.738
I mean, if you look at the things that

00:53:14.738 --> 00:53:17.520
our nation does scientifically

00:53:18.778 --> 00:53:21.770
there are only a few really.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.400
If you look at the capabilities that exist

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.260
in many countries now

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.140
there are only a few things
where we in the United States

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.160
are still the acknowledged world leaders,

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.593
and we do stuff that nobody else can do.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.257
You know, high energy
particle accelerators

00:53:37.257 --> 00:53:39.983
the Europeans are great at that, okay?

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.810
I mean, you can name all sorts of things

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:46.890
where the United States is
not the acknowledged leader,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.540
but this is an area where we are.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.920
Planetary exploration,
deep space exploration,

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.880
this is something that we
do better than anybody,

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.260
and if you want to talk
about maintaining leadership,

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.773
man, here's a great example.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.820
- Finally, how would you
advise students out there

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.746
who might watch this to
prepare for the future

00:54:06.746 --> 00:54:11.746
if they see their future is
involved in this kind of work?

00:54:11.892 --> 00:54:14.503
- You know, it comes
down to the fundamentals.

00:54:16.873 --> 00:54:20.170
When you're getting your initial training

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.810
it's blocking and tackling.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:24.133
It's the really basic skills.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.490
There's plenty of time once
you get into graduate school

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.130
to specialize and learn about this detail,

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.880
or that detail or what have you.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.690
The foundation on which
all of this is built

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:41.740
is physics, chemistry, mathematics.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.150
The real core sciences

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:50.060
that we need that form
the toolkit that you use

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.410
to do this kind of stuff.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:55.270
We talked earlier about creativity,

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.900
and we talked earlier about insight,

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.250
and people's ability to
look at some tough problem

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.200
like a parachute that doesn't work,

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.150
or how do you position instruments

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.453
with a precision of
millimeters on another world.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.640
Those problems were
solved by creative people,

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.017
but every single one of those
people had a solid background

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.860
in physics, mathematics,

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.750
the things that you need
the toolkit that you need

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.430
to solve problems like that.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.960
I don't care how creative you are

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.680
if you don't have those tools

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.230
you're not gonna be able to do it,

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.290
so in the beginning it's just getting

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:32.870
that solid grounding and the fundamentals.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.860
- Steve, let me show your book again.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.150
I think people will really
find it fascinating,

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.523
and also there is an IMAX movie

00:55:40.523 --> 00:55:44.650
which really gives you a visual sense

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.000
of a lot of what you were describing.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.250
Thank you very much for
coming on our program.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.253
- I enjoyed talking to you.

00:55:50.253 --> 00:55:52.647
- Thank you very much for joining us

00:55:52.647 --> 00:55:55.493
for this Conversation with History.

00:55:55.493 --> 00:55:58.076
(upbeat music)
