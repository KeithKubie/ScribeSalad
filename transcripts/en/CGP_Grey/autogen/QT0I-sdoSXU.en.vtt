00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.547
 The lion queen of the animal kingdom is trying to improve her democracy. 

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:09.376
 She recently allowed citizens to elect representatives to join the jungle council to rule the kingdom. 

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.432
 However, she found that her citizens were very unhappy with the voting system. 

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:17.477
 Let us look at the elections on a small island in her kingdom to understand the reasons: 

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:22.039
 On this island, there are three political parties, two of which are big parties: the parrot party and the lizard party. 

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.419
 There is also a small party: the parrot parrot party 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.000
 On election day, citizens voted for each vote. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 They want to represent their own candidates in their constituency. The election results are as follows: 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.674
 The entire island averaged, the lizard got 49% of the votes, the parrot got 48%, and the parrot got 3%. 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.460
 The rules of the election are simple majority, which means that the candidate with the most votes wins. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.650
 Because lizards have the most votes in the constituency, they control 100% of the seats in the parliament. 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.192
 This is why many citizens are unhappy, most of them. 

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:55.450
 That is, 51% of the voters voted for other parties, but none of them even 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.924
 The Lion Queen thinks this is unfair, but she is not sure how to solve this problem. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.494
 After all, citizens want to have local representatives, but they don’t want to change the constituency. 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.640
 Fortunately, the kiwi, a citizen of the island, gave a suggestion to the lion queen. 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.581
 This advice can make her system more perfect while retaining local representatives. 

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.270
 And don't have to change the selection 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.629
 This idea is called "mixed proportional representation", or MMP, and it has two changes. 

00:01:17.654 --> 00:01:22.560
 The seats in the parliament are doubled; and each citizen casts two votes instead of one 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.029
 The system works like this: 

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.299
 First of all, on the election day, the Kiwi bird is still the same as before. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.066
 He got a list of candidates who were running for his local constituency. 

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.249
 The kiwi bird has one, and the winner will be the one with the most votes. 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.490
 So far, the status of the election is still the same. 

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:42.318
 The lizards still won all local elections, and more than half of the citizens were not represented. 

00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:46.100
 However, the second ticket of the kiwi, and the newly added half of the seats, will change all this. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.689
 Kiwi took his second vote and chose his favorite party. 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.276
 These second votes, after counting the votes, showed 

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:55.762
 Proportion of every party supporter among all citizens 

00:01:55.787 --> 00:01:58.445
 And reveals how many imbalances in the seats in the parliament 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.473
 In order to correct this imbalance, the party members of the party were added one by one. 

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.521
 Until the proportion of the parliament is consistent with the voters 

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.119
 Lizards are the most proportionate, while parrots are the most 

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:10.381
 So the parrots got the first vacant seat. 

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:15.319
 Continue this process and increase the seats of the parrot party until the lizards and parrots are out of proportion 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.819
 And the parrots are still below proportion, so they got the last seat. 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.253
 Now, the representatives of the jungle council are close to the actual will of the citizens. 

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:27.367
 This is a huge improvement over the old simple majority system. 

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:31.170
 But this brings up a very interesting question: 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.400
 Who decides, which member of the party can get these extra seats? 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.709
 The practical approach is that each party publishes a list before the election. 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.970
 In order, they list candidates who wish to enter the parliament’s preferences 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.120
 In this way, if only one extra seat is obtained, the first place on the list will be selected. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840
 If you get two seats, the first two will be selected, and so on. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.220
 This makes the MMP very different from other voting systems. 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 It makes the party a formal part of the election 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.810
 This also gives party leaders more control over party members because they can 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.700
 Reward or punish them by changing the ranking on the list 

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.612
 Although MMP has such a defect 

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:09.840
 The Lion Queen likes its other advantages very much. 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.599
 Because only a small amount of votes was wasted, it almost completely eliminated the "Jerry" (constituency division manipulation) 

00:03:12.624 --> 00:03:14.469
 And avoiding a few dominant majority 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.250
 By encouraging political pluralism, it also gives citizens more choices. 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.200
 This is worth talking about. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.150
 Note that after using MMP, the proportion of voters voted for local representatives and 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.000
 The proportion of the party is different. This is because when choosing a representative 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.709
 Citizens must use strategies to vote 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.946
 For example, the voters of the cockatoo don’t like lizards at all, but they can tolerate parrots. 

00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:38.930
 Because the parrots have too few voters, they know that their candidates have no chance to choose. 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.966
 So the real game is between two big parties. 

00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:48.359
 Therefore, many cockroaches will vote for the parrot in the hope that he will win and become his representative. 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.114
 However, when they vote for their favorite party, this strategy is useless. 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.930
 The more votes a party receives, the more seats it gets in the parliament. 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.810
 So citizens can freely vote for small parties because they know that each vote is effective. 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.761
 The Lion Queen checked these backup options and decided to convert her kingdom election system to MMP 

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:09.390
 Finally, the jungle council now truly reflects the actual needs of her citizens. 

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.000
 Thank you for watching!
