00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:01.325
- [Voiceover] Let's say that

00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:05.965
y is equal to five minus three
x over x squared plus three x

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:06.798
And we want to figure out

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:09.729
what's the derivative
of y in respect to x.

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.618
Now it might immediately
jump out at you that look,

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:16.900
y is being defined as a
rational expression here

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.210
as the quotient of two
different expressions.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.009
We could even view this as
two different functions.

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.296
You could view this one up here as u of x,

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:29.452
so you could say this is the same thing,

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:32.702
this is the same thing as u of x, over,

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:37.407
you could view the one in
the denominator as v of x.

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:39.807
That one right there is v of x

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:41.479
and so if you're taking
the derivative of something

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.000
that can be expressed in this way,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.868
as the quotient of two
different functions,

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.933
well then you could use the quotient rule.

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.022
I'll give you my little
aside, like I always do

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:51.329
the quotient rule, if you ever forget it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.831
it can be derived from the product rule

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.839
and we have videos there,

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.875
cause the product rule's
a bit easier to remember.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:56.988
But what I can do is just say,

00:00:56.988 --> 00:01:00.914
"look, dy dx, if y is
just u of x over v of x",

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:02.985
I'm just gonna restate the quotient rule.

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:05.239
This is going to be, this is going to be

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.828
the derivative of the
function in the numerator, so.

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:11.078
d, dx of u of x

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.003
times the function in the denominator

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.836
times v of x minus, I'll do the

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:28.071
minus the function in
the numerator, u of x,

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.883
times the derivative of the
function in the denominator

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:32.383
times d dx, v of x

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.633
and we're almost there

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:42.800
and then over, over the function
in the denominator squared

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.412
the function in the denominator squared.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.299
So this might look messy
but all we have to do now

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.391
is think about what is
the derivative of u of x?

00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:58.741
What is the derivative of v of x?

00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.642
And we should just be able
to substitute those things

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:03.991
back into this expression
we just wrote down.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.386
So let's do that.

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:09.553
So the derivative with respect
to x of u of x, of u of x

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.651
is equal to, let's see,
five minus three x.

00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:18.958
The derivative of five is zero.

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.907
The derivative of negative three x,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.094
well that's just gonna be negative three.

00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:24.581
That's just negative three.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.404
If any of that look
completely unfamiliar to you

00:02:26.404 --> 00:02:29.111
I encourage you to review
the derivative properties

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.330
and maybe the power rule.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.660
Now let's think about
what is the derivative

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.779
with respect to x,
derivative with respect to x,

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.529
of v of x, of v of x?

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.743
Well derivative of x squared,

00:02:42.743 --> 00:02:44.541
we just bring that exponent out front,

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.317
it's gonna be two times
x to the two minus one

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:51.258
or two x to the first power or just two x

00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:54.360
and then the derivative
of three x is just three.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.721
So two x plus three.

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.112
Now we know everything we need
to substitute back in here.

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:03.508
The derivative of u with respect to x,

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:06.588
this right over here
is just negative three.

00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:10.755
V of x, this we know is
x squared plus three x.

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:16.731
We know that this right
over here is v of x.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:21.233
And then u of x we know
is five minus three x.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.816
Five minus three x.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.458
The derivative of v with respect to x

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:31.625
we know is two x plus
three, two x plus three.

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:37.351
And then finally v of x, we
know is x squared plus three x.

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:41.252
So this is x squared plus three x

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:44.257
and so what do we get?

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:48.612
Well we are going to get, it's
gonna look a little bit hairy

00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:51.445
It's going to be equal to negative

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:57.120
I'll focus this so first we
have this business up here.

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.725
Negative three times x
squared plus three x.

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.754
So I'm just gonna distribute
the negative three.

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:06.754
So it's negative three
x squared minus nine x

00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:11.191
and then from that we
are going to subtract

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:15.663
the product of these two
expressions and so let's see,

00:04:15.663 --> 00:04:17.746
what is that going to be?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.510
Well, we have a five times two x,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.857
which is ten x

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:29.514
a five times three which is 15

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.734
we have a negative three x times two x

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.734
so that is going to be
negative six x squared

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:45.568
minus six x squared, and then
a negative three x times three

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:47.151
so negative nine x.

00:04:48.272 --> 00:04:50.238
And let's see we can
simplify that a little bit.

00:04:50.238 --> 00:04:52.747
Ten x minus nine x,

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:55.983
well that's just going to leave us with x.

00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:59.580
So ten x minus nine x
is just going to be x

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.958
and then in our denominator,
we're almost there.

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.067
In our denominator we
could just write that as

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:08.651
x plus three x, x squared
plus three x squared

00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:10.479
or if we want we could expand it out,

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.612
I'll just leave it like that

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.362
x squared plus three x squared

00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:18.678
and so if we wanna simplify

00:05:18.678 --> 00:05:20.936
or attempt to simplify this a little bit.

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:25.818
It's going to be negative
three x squared minus nine x

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:29.568
and then you're gonna
have a negative minus x

00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:33.417
minus x and then minus 15

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:39.529
and then minus negative six x squared

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.029
so plus six x squared, all of that over

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:50.479
x squared plus three x squared

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.101
or x squared plus three x, squared.

00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.454
I should say it that way.

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:59.049
Now let's see this numerator
I can simplify a little bit.

00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:01.596
Negative three x squared
plus six x squared

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:05.429
that's going to be
positive three x squared

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.533
and then we have in orange,

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:13.810
we have negative nine x minus an x,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.560
well that's gonna be
minus ten x, minus ten x

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.461
and then we have minus 15.

00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:22.461
So minus 15.

00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:26.430
So there you have it, we
finally have finished.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.847
This is all going to be equal to

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.557
this is all going to be equal to

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.057
three x squared minus ten x minus 15

00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:38.781
over x squared plus three x, squared

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.833
and we are done.
