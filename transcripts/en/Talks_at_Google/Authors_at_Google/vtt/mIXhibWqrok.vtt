00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.920
JESSICA SIMMONS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.460
Welcome to the Authors
at Google talk.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.840
My name is Jessica Simmons.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.030
And I'm a director in gTech.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.210
And it's my pleasure to
introduce you to Dorie Clark.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.110

her newly released book,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.090
"Entrepreneurial You."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.410
including "Reinventing
You," "Stand Out," which

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.530
was named the number one

by "Inc." magazine and
one of the top 10 business

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.420
books of the year by Forbes.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.100
Dorie is an expert
in self-reinvention

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.200
and helping others make
change in their lives.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a professor at Duke University's
Fuqua School of Business,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.850
a Grammy-winning jazz
producer, and consultant

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.570

like the World Bank, the Bill

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.900
and Melinda Gates Foundation,
and Yale University.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.050
Please join me in
welcoming Dorie Clark.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:07.020
DORIE CLARK: Thanks, Jessica.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.540
I was 22 years
old, and I had just

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.740
gotten out of graduate school.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.220
And this was my first job.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.860
I was a newspaper reporter.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.290
And it was kind
of an amazing job.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.700
I worked for the alternative
news weekly in Boston.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.140
This is actually the very
first cover story I had.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.760
It's not above the fold,
but it's still pretty good.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.190
[LAUGHS]

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.550
But one day, something changed.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.670
We went from covering all
of the most important issues

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.520
of the day, all the really
good stuff you can see up here,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.350
to me getting called
into the HR office.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.100
Now, it turned out I left
that afternoon without a job.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.450
I was shocked.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.289
And you might say, Dorie, duh!

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.090
You were a newspaper reporter.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.570
How could you not
expect to get laid off?

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.830
But the truth was, things
really were different back then.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.930
It was 2001.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.030
And we forget now in
retrospect, but the year 2000

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.550
was the best year in history
for the newspaper industry.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.250
Newspapers were
rolling in money.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.550
It was at its peak in
advertising revenue.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.180
But of course, as we've
seen in the years since,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.460
the years in which nearly 40%
of American journalists have

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.290
lost their jobs, that sometimes
things can change overnight.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.540
Oftentimes, when things are
in that moment of transition,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.140
we are not able to see it.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.860
We can't perceive it clearly.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.741
So I woke up the next morning
after getting laid off.

00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:09.240
And I said, well, you know, I'm
just going to get out there.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.750
And I'm going to have
to look for another job.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.330
But it didn't quite
work that way.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.900
It turned out that the day
that I had been laid off

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.780
was Monday,
September 10th, 2001.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.890
I woke up the next morning.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.010
And me being out of a job was
the least of anyone's problems.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.540
Now, today, many of you guys are
working in robust and growing

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.340
industries.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.180
We're here speaking at Google.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.150
Google is doing very well.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.520
But of course,
what we've learned

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.100
is it's not just
industries that can change.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.780
It's also jobs that can change.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.120
We know from our own experience
that the things that we're

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.530
hired to do today may be very
different from the things

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.200
that we're wanted and
expected to do down the road.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.770
There's a gentleman that I
interviewed for my first book,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.290
"Reinventing You," Stephen
Reiss, who at the time

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.700
was a high-ranking HR
executive in Silicon Valley.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.810
He told me that one of the
questions that he always

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.350
asked the most senior candidates
when they were coming in

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.340
for their final interviews
was, how are you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.110
reinventing yourself?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.660
Not are you
reinventing yourself?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.790
Not how would you
reinvent yourself?

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.460
But how are you presently
reinventing yourself?

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.510
He wanted an answer.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.980
And if he didn't
hear one, he said,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.760
they were not fit
because the number one

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.820
skill, the foundational
skill, that we all

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.200
have today is adaptability.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.470
If you have that,
you can evolve.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.160
You can change.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.100
You can move in to
the new direction

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.780
and make your
transition seamless,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.680
regardless of what's going
on in the outside world.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.150
If you don't have that, things
can often be quite difficult.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.280
Now, I know for
Google, for instance,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.640
that one of the
foundational principles

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.350
is encouraging you guys to move
around within the organization,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.210
to build new skills,
to try new things,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.880
which I think is
incredibly important.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.990
We have to keep
pushing ourselves.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.570
But what I've come to
realize in those years

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.610
since I was first laid off--

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.530
since I started out
as a journalist,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.210
I've reinvented myself.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.480
I've become an author.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.150
Today, as I'm speaking,
we have a new book

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.600
that I just launched, called
"Entrepreneurial You."

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.990
I've started to teach
and be a professor.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.060
I consult and speak.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.440
But mostly, I've been doing
research about this question,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.890
about how, in the
modern workforce,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.544
we can still succeed, even with
everything changing around us.

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:13.210
And so today, I wanted
to share with you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.330
some of the fruits of that
research over the years,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.690
about strategies that
we can all employ,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.150
not just entrepreneurs,
not just people running

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.480
their own businesses, but people
who have day jobs that they

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.310
love, strategies
about how we can all

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.730
be more entrepreneurial,
think more entrepreneurially

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.380
in our work.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.020
Because when we do
that, that's not just

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.500
about a methodology for
starting a business,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.330
it's about a way of being.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.620
It's about embracing
adaptability.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.500
It's about leaning
in to the changes

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.480
that we need to make to make
ourselves indispensable.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.780
So let's talk a
little bit about that,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.976
about how we can think
more entrepreneurially.

00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:08.180
I want to start
with a little story.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.800
This is Todd Herman.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.020
Now, when I'm talking
to people about starting

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.586
to think entrepreneurially, one
of the questions that I get,

00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:20.210
one of the things
you hear all the time

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.180
is, OK, that all sounds great.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.330
But what if I'm
starting from nothing?

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.900
What if I am in a
place where I don't

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.130
have a lot of connections,
I don't have a lot of clout?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.450
How can I even begin
to get started?

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.350
And so sometimes the answer
is right in front of us.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.470
Todd Hermann grew up
in Western Canada.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.850
And he loved sports.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.300
He was a high school
football coach.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.970
But he specialized in
something a little distinctive,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.490
mental toughness.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.030
That was his hook.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.530
He talked about how
to win the inner game.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.410
And so he started to develop
a sideline in addition

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.420
to the regular
coaching he did, where

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.050
he would coach athletes, high
school and college athletes,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.640
on a private basis.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.322
He knew that in order
to get more business,

00:08:14.322 --> 00:08:15.780
he'd have to get
himself out there.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.240
He'd have to somehow
win new clients.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.920
And so he decided
to do something

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.940
pretty simple, pretty basic,
that almost any of us can do.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.130
And that is talk for
free about his ideas.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.250
He put the word out to
youth sports leagues

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.820
around where he lived in
Western Canada and said, hey,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.240
I will come speak to
your team for free.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.070
But there's only one catch.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.530
For every player
that's there, they

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.920
need to have at least
one parent in attendance.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.840
And the reason he
did that was he

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.990
knew that if he just
delivered the message

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.620
to the high schoolers,
that would be great,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.630
but the buyers of his
services, the parents,

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.760
wouldn't be in the room.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.370
So he began to do
these free talks.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.860
And he did a ton of them.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.790
Within 90 days, he
had done 60 talks.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.310
Sometimes it's about
putting in the effort.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.500
It's about putting
in the sweat equity.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.190
But within those 90 days,
something transformational

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.540
happened to Todd Herman.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.560
Yes, he got more
coaching clients.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.030
It worked.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.010
But that's not the real story.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.090
What also happened was something
that he never expected.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.210
In the audience,
some of those parents

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.440
had interesting jobs
where they realized

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.400
that a mental toughness coach
could actually be something

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.740
that they could use as well.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.260
One of the parents
turned out to be

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.170
an executive with the
National Hockey League.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.940
He said to Todd, could you
come in and coach our players

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.820
in the NHL?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.490
One of the parents
who was in attendance

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.380
was a senior leader within
the Canadian government.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.660
That person said
to Todd, would you

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.360
be willing to come in
and talk to my office?

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.500
The Canadian government
needs what you offer.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.020
Todd had never even thought
about expanding his business

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:22.160
from coaching teenagers
to coaching adults.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.690
But when the opportunity
presented itself, he took it.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.110
He sprung into action.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.150
And today, Todd has a business.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.010
He lives here in New York.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.880
He has a business coaching
everyone from senior executives

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.100
to Olympic athletes.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.350
If you want to think
entrepreneurially,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.570
you have to accept
that sometimes, you

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.820
are going to start from zero.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.460
You won't have any connections.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.140
But if you get scrappy,
if you're willing to work,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.660
if you're willing to
seize opportunities

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.200
when they come to you, you can
make your own opportunities.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.060
Not having the connections
now is never an excuse.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.410
Now, another area that
I hear a lot from people

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.980
as we talk about how to begin
to think more entrepreneurially

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.440
is you hear a lot
of times people

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.600
say that they have
an idea that they've

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.680
been nurturing for a while,
sometimes even years.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.230
And it's been spinning around.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.400
But they haven't done
anything about it.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.140
And that always makes me
a little bit sad because

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.820
of course, if we're
not sharing it,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.960
then it's not having
an impact in the world.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.630
The things that we want to
accomplish aren't getting done.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.630
And so that's why
this gentleman's story

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.460
resonated with me so much.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.740
His name is Michael
Parrish DuDell.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.860
He actually wrote the book
for the television show,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.420
"Shark Tank."

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.440
But when he got his start as an
entrepreneur a few years ago,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.300
he did something that I
think we can all learn from.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.340
Now, as Michael was
thinking about consulting

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.700
and writing and speaking and
doing all the things that he

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.190
would as an entrepreneur,
he realized he could

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.860
he could certainly
do all the tasks

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.330
that would be involved
in his business.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.240
But there was something
that he had never

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.160
done that was essential to
really knowing how to think

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.500
and act entrepreneurially.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.630
He had never sold anything.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.630
And if you want to
be an entrepreneur,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.490
or you want to think
like an entrepreneur,

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.240
you know that you need
to be able to sell.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.010
It doesn't necessarily
mean literally

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.350
sell a product or
service, but it

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.210
means you have to sell an idea.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.090
It means you have to learn
how to be persuasive,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.020
how to close a deal,
how to make the ask.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.390
He knew he couldn't
be successful

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.860
if he didn't know
how to do that.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.780
And so he challenged himself.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:05.770
Unlike so many people
who talk and don't act,

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.720
he gave himself a deadline.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.190
He said, I am giving
myself 30 days.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.660
If I do not sell a client,
if I do not land business

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.340
within 30 days, I'm
going to give up,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.010
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing before.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.550
And he did it.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.420
Sometimes if we light
a fire under ourselves,

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.670
if we force ourselves
to take action,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:36.010
it can propel us out of the
inertia that is all too often

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.130
part of the human condition.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.500
It could be getting an
accountability partner.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.882
It could be posting
on social media

00:13:43.882 --> 00:13:45.340
and letting people
know that you're

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.770
going to do something so
that you embarrass yourself

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.030
into doing it.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.730
Because otherwise,
people will know.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.890
But however you decide to do it,
if there is an idea, a project,

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.200
an initiative that you
have been thinking about,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.570
that you have been
nurturing and cultivating

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.690
in the back of your
mind, maybe it's time

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.820
to bring it to the
front of your mind.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.840
Another lesson, maybe
the most central one

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.550
of all, when it comes
to entrepreneurship,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.630
is about the importance
of testing and iterating.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.490
That's why in
"Entrepreneurial You,"

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.930
I profiled this gentleman.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.270
His name is Danny Iny.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.210
He's an entrepreneur
based in Canada.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:36.180
And when he first started in the
world of online courses, which

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.000
is an area that he has a
lot of expertise in now,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.980
things did not go well.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.020
That's the thing
about entrepreneurship

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.910
and entrepreneurial thinking.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.421
It's not always a rosy story.

00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:46.920
Right?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.400
That's why some people shy away
from it because the results are

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.930
not guaranteed.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.300
It doesn't always work.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.140
In Danny's case, he launched
a course, rather ironically

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.500
titled Marketing That Works.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.810
And he ended up
selling one copy.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.240
Painful.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.060
That is the moment we all dread.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.920
That's why so many people
don't take that chance.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.660
But he learned something
important from it.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.060
And I think that you and I
can learn from his lesson.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.250
When he launched Marketing
That Works, he had a concept.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.940
And his concept was, I
have found all the things

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.890
that people need to
know about marketing.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.290
Now, I will tell it to them.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.680
And he thought the world
would come running.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.000
But of course, they didn't.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.380
Now, so often, what happens
when we are launching new ideas,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.010
new projects, new initiatives
is that we cook up something

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.670
that we think, that we
assume that people will want,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.070
but we never test that premise.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.000
We never validate it.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.750
We never actually go out
and talk to the customers.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.010
And so we make our guess.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.830
And our guess turns
out to be wrong.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.690
Danny told me that he spent
six months of his life creating

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.320
this course for this one guy.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.810
He says if he actually
factors it out,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:23.300
he probably made about $0.17 an
hour for the work that he did.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.500
So the next time--

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.994
this took a few years.

00:16:25.994 --> 00:16:26.660
You can imagine.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.970
He was gun shy after this.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.050
Next time he decided he wanted
to launch an online course,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.460
he knew he was going
to do it differently.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.350
He was not going to make
the same mistake again.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.270
And so what he did this time,
which has actually become

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.260
a classic-- it has become
a standard move for online

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.990
courses and I think should
probably be a standard move

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.050
in just about everything we do--

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:58.450
is that when he launched
his next course,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.980
he hadn't created the course.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.370
What he did was he sent
an email to his list.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.660
And he said, hey, guys, I'm
thinking of creating a course.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.270
Here's what it would be.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.490
Here's what it would cost.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.369
If you're interested,
you can sign up here

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.960
at a discounted price.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.060
You can be the beta testers.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.599
And in exchange for
more interaction with me

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:25.900
and your honest opinion and
feedback about the course,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.240
we can do it together.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.180
That course sold out.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.570
And by the time he was
able to fully launch

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:39.310
after doing his test pilot,
he was totally confident

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.580
that the course was what the
market needed and wanted.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.100
Because he had gotten
direct response

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.880
from his audience about exactly
what they wanted and needed.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.880
That was the way that he was
able to test it and validate it

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.150
without putting in the
huge amounts of effort that

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.410
in the case of the first
course were totally wasted.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.260
If we can learn in our
entrepreneurial thinking

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.710
to always test and
iterate, to place,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.760
in the words of the author
Peter Sims, those little bets,

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.440
the bets that are small enough
to give us data, the bets that

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.330
are small enough that,
if they don't work,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.450
it is not the end of the
world, that we can look at it

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.280
and say, OK, no worries.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.590
I'll go on to the next thing.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:31.990
That frees us up to double down
on what actually is working.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.460
Which leads us to metrics.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.450
Right?

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.090
How do we know,
with all the things

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.550
that we're doing, with
all the possibilities

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.390
out there in the world,
how do we know what it is

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.120
that we should be focusing on?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920
That's the challenge.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.560
Right?

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.350
This is a woman
named Natalie Sisson.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.070
Natalie is an entrepreneur
from New Zealand.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.130
And when I interviewed her--

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.740
she's today very successful,
makes a quarter of a million

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.450
a year with her business.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.620
Doing great.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.080
When I interviewed her
for "Entrepreneurial You"

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.750
and asked her what
it was is she most

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.560
regrets about the early
days of her business,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.170
she said that when
she looks back,

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.130
she felt like she
was working so hard.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.940
She felt like she was really
putting in the time and effort

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.340
and making progress,
building her brand.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.090
But what she was
actually doing, sometimes

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:35.430
for up to eight hours a day, was
interacting with people online.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.430
She was on social media.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.881
Now, she wasn't
watching cat videos.

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:40.380
Right?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.970
This is not someone who was
wasting her time in overt ways.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.030
She was doing things that
she felt were valuable.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.620
She was making friends,
building community.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.930
She was posting on LinkedIn.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.950
She was interacting
with people on Facebook.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.890
She was tweeting.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.930
We look at that
sometimes, and especially,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.660
in the social discourse
about business,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.250
we think, oh, that's
how you do it.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.340
That's how you build a brand.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.610
That's how you build a platform.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.140
But one of the
crucial distinctions

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.660
we need to make if
we're going to learn

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.590
to think entrepreneurially
is understanding

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.530
that sometimes the
things that we're doing

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.220
might have the
illusion of progress.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.620
They might have the
illusion of being effective.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.510
But they're not really.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.850
Because when it
comes down to it,

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.450
an online connection
like that, especially one

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.120
built on someone
else's platform,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.650
is usually a pretty weak tie.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.420
What she says she wishes that
she had done early on instead

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.370
was to spend that time creating
content, building out products,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.120
having something real that she
could offer to people to sell,

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.450
and also, especially,
building an email list

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.900
so that she could communicate
with people directly

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.290
and unmediated by other
people's platforms, which,

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:10.520
of course, are subject sometimes
to the vagaries of algorithm

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.230
changes and shareholder
preferences.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.860
We need to know
always, if we're going

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.210
to think entrepreneurially,
what metrics really matter.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.550
Not the illusion of
progress, the ones

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.290
that really make a
difference for us.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.430
If we can focus there,
if we can focus our ROI,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.880
we can really begin
to move the needle.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.660
Now, I've been making
the case to you guys

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.530
that entrepreneurial thinking
matters for all of us,

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.210
even if you work inside a
company, maybe even especially

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.520
if you work inside a company.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.970
I want with this story
to actually take it

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.870
even one step further and
say that it's not even

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.240
just entrepreneurial
thinking, but even

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.070
sometimes entrepreneurship
can make a positive difference

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.160
for your corporate career.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.700
This is a gentleman
named Lenny Chan.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.220
He's someone I feature
in "Entrepreneurial You."

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.600
I first got to know him when
I was consulting for the Mt.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.180
Sinai Hospital here in New York.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.460
And when I was doing this
consulting engagement,

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.130
everybody was
talking about Lenny.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.460
And at the time, I
was wondering why.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.910
What's up with this guy?

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.480
Why is everyone
buzzing about him?

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.740
And the reason was, he had
actually started his career

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.230
as a nurse at the hospital.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:44.090
And by the time I met him,
he had advanced so rapidly,

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.700
been promoted so
much, he was now

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.200
running communications for
the entire hospital system.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.500
That is not a
traditional career path.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.380
How had he done that?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.770
And so when I first met him at
a meeting we were at together,

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.590
I asked him, what gives?

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.760
How did you get here?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.870
And what he told me
is that along the way,

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:15.470
he had become fascinated with
apps, with smartphone apps.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.770
And so he got interested
in that and decided

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.270
that he was going
to figure out how

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.010
to develop a couple of them.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.760
And so he did.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.670
He launched them.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.650
He put them up, made
them publicly available.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:32.022
And it was his side project, his
entrepreneurial side project.

00:23:32.022 --> 00:23:36.180
Now, he didn't make a
million dollars from them.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.570
But he was making money.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.210
And he learned a lot.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.410
But all of that,
possibly, he thought,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.390
was going to come crashing down.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.530
Because one day he got
a call from his boss.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.790
His boss said, Lenny, I hear
you've been developing apps

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.830
on the side.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.456
And Lenny said, yes, I have.

00:24:02.456 --> 00:24:05.380
His boss invited him
into the office, wanted

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.420
to chat with him about it.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.230
Lenny was petrified
because he thought maybe

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.230
he had violated a policy
he hadn't known about,

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.270
maybe the boss
thought that he had

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.810
been doing inappropriate
things on company time.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.420
That wasn't it.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.790
His boss said, Lenny,
we need someone

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.000
to run social media
for the hospital.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.390
I think it should be you.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.550
His boss saw what Lenny
did on his own time, nights

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.290
and weekends, his own
effort, his own initiative,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.010
and he recognized
it as leadership.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:49.230
The old model, the
scarcity mentality model

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.800
that many people
had in the past was

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.670
that an entrepreneurial
side venture threatens

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.560
what you do at your day job.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.060
The smartest bosses today know
that that is completely untrue,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.920
that instead, the way
that you spend your nights

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.660
and weekends matters.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.160
What are you doing?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.590
Is it better for you to be
watching television, or hanging

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.660
out in a park?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.580
Or is it better for you
to be learning new skills,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.150
trying something on your
own, learning lessons

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:31.010
that you can apply and bring
back to everything you do?

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.490
In Lenny's case,
his boss saw that.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.350
And he ultimately
did such a good job

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.810
running social media
for the hospital,

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.260
he got promoted to run
all of communications.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.810
Today, Lenny actually works
at a different hospital.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.610
He's the head of innovation.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.640
He has transformed
himself in his career

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.900
on the strength of what he
decided to do and to learn,

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:00.530
what he decided to make himself
on his nights and his weekends.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.900
Now, another element
of entrepreneurship

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.000
that I think we can all
learn from in the realm

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.530
of entrepreneurial thinking
is about constraints.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.430
Just like in poetry,
sometimes the best poetry

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.900
gets written under the
direst constraints.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.320
It's not necessarily
easy to write sonnets,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.080
to write a villanelle
or a haiku.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.840
There's constraints that we face
that force us to be creative.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.780
And similarly, in the world
of entrepreneurial thinking,

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.460
we all face constraints.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.730
Whatever you want to
be doing, you probably

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.890
don't have as much budget
as you would really like

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.140
to be able to accomplish that.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.770
You probably don't have
as much staffing help

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.360
as you would like.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.420
You may be under
tight time pressures.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.320
But oftentimes, those
things, those very things

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.750
that are so vexing
in the moment,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:05.090
can actually inspire greater
creativity, can get you

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:11.910
a better result in the end if
you embrace the limitations.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.830
This is a gentleman
named Jason Gaynard.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.226
Jason faced a constraint.

00:27:20.226 --> 00:27:23.820
A few years back, he
was heavily in debt.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.340
He had built a business for
himself reselling tickets.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.440
And it had done
well for a while.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.350
But it wasn't his passion.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.800
And he had managed to
get really in debt.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.380
He had a baby daughter.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.670
And times were a little
bit strapped for him.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.680
One morning, because
of his baby daughter,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.580
he was up at 4 o'clock
in the morning.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.180
And that was when
an email came in.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.960
It was an email from Tim
Ferriss on his mailing list.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.775
Some of you guys may
know Tim Ferriss.

00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:03.420
He's the popular author of the
book, "The Four Hour Workweek."

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.580
And Jason was on his email list.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.250
Tim was launching a new book.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.320
And he was trying to
sell a lot of copies.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.870
And so he had just
put out a notice

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.820
that there was a special deal.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.100
There was only one
slot available.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.240
If someone in advance of
the launch of Tim's new book

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:28.440
was willing to buy 4,000
copies of his new book,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.780
Tim would come and do
two speaking engagements

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.760
for that person.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.860
This was $80,000.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.170
Jason absolutely did
not have $80,000.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.830
And he also had
no idea if he were

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.350
to have Tim Ferriss
available, what he would even

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.780
have Tim Ferriss do.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.940
But he saw that email and
said, this is an opportunity.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.430
Someone is going to take that.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.060
And a minute later, he
said, it should be me.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.250
And so he emailed back.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:08.190
Without any money in the bank,
he accepted the $80,000 offer

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.080
from Tim Ferriss.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.620
He reckoned he had
two to three days max

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.710
to somehow find the money.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.050
He went to his friends.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.920
He had a pretty good network
because he had spent time

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.740
over the years investing
in his friendships

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.410
and in his professional
relationships.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.390
And went to three friends.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.572
One friend had too many
questions and wanted to know

00:29:32.572 --> 00:29:34.280
what would it be for,
how would we do it.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.274
Jason didn't have time.

00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:36.440
He moved on to the next one.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.800
The next one was excited, but
wanted to do way too much.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.570
He wanted to start a
business with Jason.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.340
He wanted to launch
a whole endeavor.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.110
Jason didn't have time for that.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.190
He went to the third friend.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.510
The third friend said,
I'll cut you a bank check.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.860
Be here tomorrow morning.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.120
He got the money.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.790
He still didn't know what
he was going to do with it.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.190
But he found a way.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.900
What Jason ultimately decided
to do was launched a conference.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.910
He called it Mastermind Talks.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.850
And he would make Tim
Ferriss the keynote speaker.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.725
He would make him
the star attraction.

00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:13.600
But of course, he realized
if he was spending

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.180
$80,000 on Tim
Ferriss, he did not

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.540
have any budget for
any other speakers.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.470
What can you do?

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.030
How do you get around that?

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.540
Well, something
that he realized was

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.470
that it wasn't just him that
was excited to see Tim Ferriss.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.560
A lot of people would be
excited to see Tim Ferriss.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.150
And not just fanboys.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.570
Tim Ferriss's friends
would be excited to see

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:41.890
Tim Ferriss because oftentimes
they're ships in the night.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.620
They're all traveling around
to different conferences.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.570
They don't get to hang out.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.960
Jason decided that
he would invite

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.850
a whole fleet of
top notch speakers

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.520
that were in Tim Ferriss's
orbit and were friends of his,

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.470
but people he didn't
get to see that often.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.230
He would ask them
to speak for free.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.910
And the winner of a competition,
the attendees of the conference

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.510
would vote, would
get a $30,000 prize.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.190
For everybody else,
no compensation.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.770
Amazingly, they did it.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.460
Jason was able to organize
an entire conference based

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.430
around having Tim Ferriss and
a bunch of people that wanted

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.650
to hang out with Tim Ferriss.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.950
The conference was
a rousing success.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.190
He decided to make it elite.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.530
At first, he wasn't sure
how much he could charge.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.390
But eventually,
he realized if it

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:41.230
was a small, private,
curated event,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.480
he could charge a lot of money.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.830
Eventually, he
settled on $3,000.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.450
He brought his money in.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.099
He was able to pay off
the Tim Ferriss debt

00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:54.640
that he had borrowed
from his friend.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.840
He was able to
make money from it.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.520
And he was able
to launch a brand.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.040
It's now called Mastermind
Talks, a conference.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.500
He's been doing them
about four years.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.580
These have become such elite
and exclusive conferences

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.390
that the price tag,
$7,500, is actually

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.880
quite close to what it costs
to attend a TED conference now.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.140
The way that he was able
to come up with this plan

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.290
emerged from him
seeing an opportunity

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.840
and realizing that the
constraint that he had,

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.710
the constraint of no money,
the constraint of not being

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.760
able to pay other speakers
could force creativity

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.660
in new directions and has
opened up an entire new business

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.820
line for him.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.830
That's how we need
to begin to think.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.250
We need to ask ourselves,
not oh, we can't do this.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.290
We can't do this.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.290
We need, in the world of
innovation, as they say,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:58.630
to start asking
ourselves, we can if XYZ.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.370
If we can understand
what the if is,

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.230
if we can reframe
the question, it

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.410
opens up sometimes a world
of new possibilities.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:10.680
As

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.140
You heard in the
story about Jason

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.000
borrowing the money
from his friend,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.060
no questions asked,
come to the office

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:23.490
tomorrow, pick up the check,
your network matters a lot

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.560
when it comes to
entrepreneurial thinking.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.160
The myth, the myth of
entrepreneurship, of course,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.840
is the stories that
we tell that we

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.540
love to pass down
like lore that's

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.956
it's about guys in garages
tinkering by themselves.

00:33:37.956 --> 00:33:38.955
That's not how it works.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.080
Much more likely
and much more often,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.980
it's about a community of
people helping each other.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.370
And this is a story about that.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.410
This is Dov Gordon.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.170
Dov is a marketing consultant.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.530
And he wanted to build his
business, like a lot of people.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.660
He also realized he
didn't have a lot of money

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.000
for marketing expenses.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.810
And so he was trying to
figure out, how could he grow?

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.000
How could he get in
front of new people

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.750
without shelling out a lot
of money that he didn't have?

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.449
He realized that something
that would work really well

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.310
was affiliate promotions.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.820
If, for instance,
I promoted him,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.810
and if someone that
I had recruited

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.429
went to do business with him,
he would send me a commission.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.710
If we're able to do
that, that's a great way.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.409
You don't have to pay
anyone for marking expenses

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.320
until the client and
the cash is in hand.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.830
But how do you find
affiliate partners?

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.969
One of the ways that he was
able to start doing that was he

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.580
decided he would
start a community.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.940
He created something called
Joint Venture Marketing

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.530
Mastermind.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.850
It's very simple.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.380
It's a listserv.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.450
In fact, it's a Google listserv.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:04.030
And it exists today as a group
of about 100 to 150 people

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.290
who are supporting each other.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.250
They don't have to do business
with any particular person.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.570
Nothing is required.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.180
But he's convened a
community of people

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.210
that he has
hand-selected who reflect

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.600
online entrepreneurship
done the way that he

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.780
wants to see it done.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.550
This is not hard sell tactics.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.770
This is not sleazy operators.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.610
These are the people that
he respects in this space.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:31.000
And he brought them together
to be able to do business

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.900
with one another.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.736
Now, that helps him.

00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:36.610
And he's actually been
able to grow his email

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.640
list by over 10,000
people and get thousands

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.210
of dollars of business as a
result of what he put together.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:48.160
But even more than that,
he's helping 150 other people

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.320
grow their business as well.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.420
The core of
entrepreneurial thinking

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.730
is looking for
those opportunities

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.570
where we're able to have a
win-win, the opportunities

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.710
where we can help ourselves
by helping other people.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.320
This does not have
to be about growth

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.940
at the expense of someone else.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.720
The best growth, the most
lasting and sustainable growth,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.690
is about growth
through helping others.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.210
A question I hear
a lot though as we

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.090
go into this journey
about entrepreneurship

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.390
or entrepreneurial
thinking is about, how

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:30.820
do you stay on target
during the hard times?

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.100
In between starting out and
actually succeeding in the way

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.910
that we want to succeed,
there are a lot of roadblocks.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:43.680
There are a lot of times
where you are not sure if you

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.060
are making any progress at all.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.160
It can become incredibly
disheartening and incredibly

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.310
destabilizing because
you wonder if you're

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.570
making a huge mistake.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:59.980
You wonder if you'd be
better off quitting.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.360
That's why the story of
Stefanie O'Connell, I think,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.980
is so instructive.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.800
Stefanie moved to New
York with a lot of hopes

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.360
and a lot of dreams.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.840
She wanted to be a
Broadway actress.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.906
But she realized
early on that if she

00:37:16.906 --> 00:37:18.280
was going to make
it in New York,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.520
one thing she had to
get straight right away

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.540
is her finances.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.110
Because this is an
expensive place to live.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.020
She actually started a blog
to help her keep on track.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.410
She called it "The Broke
and Beautiful Life."

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.340
And in it, she started
sharing her lessons,

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.080
the things that she
had learned about how

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.140
to be smart about your money.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.450
Her blog started to get popular.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.240
She started to feel like it
was gaining some traction.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.620
Maybe it could be something.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:53.080
But of course, it takes a while
for a blog, or anything else,

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.690
to really succeed.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.510
Today, Stefanie is a recognized
personal finance expert.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.940
She's been on television.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.730
She writes for
major publications.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.640
But the way that she was
able to stay focused,

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.830
and something that,
I think, more of us

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.090
need to understand and embrace,
is that if the only thing

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.330
you're focused on, if the only
goal that you're headed toward

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:20.080
is oh, well, I won't have
succeeded until I get a book

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.680
deal, or I won't have
succeeded until I get on TV,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.500
or I won't have succeeded until
I get this promotion to SVP,

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.210
that is a long time in coming.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.500
What we need to do is learn
to focus on the small wins.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.270
We need to learn to
understand and recognize

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.300
that the signs of
progress are things

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.370
that need to be seen and
appreciated and celebrated.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.380
Because that's what
will keep us going.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.160
She told me that she remembers
vividly the first time

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.890
that an influencer
that she respected

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.800
retweeted one of her posts.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.250
That's a small thing.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.510
But it showed her that
someone she cared about

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.010
was paying attention.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.430
She remembers vividly
the first time

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.190
that instead of blogging
for free like she

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.080
had done for months
and months and months,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.710
someone offered
her money to blog.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.210
It was $25.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.570
That is not a lot of money.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.060
But she said, that's two hours
I don't have to be a waitress.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.320
And it's a sign that someone
values what I'm doing.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.990
When we see those things,
when we recognize them

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.290
for what they are,
which is as a signpost

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.560
that we are moving toward
where we want to go,

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.900
that is how we can
stay on target.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.020
That is how we can
keep going, even

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.227
in the face of discouragement.

00:39:48.227 --> 00:39:49.560
That's what we need to be doing.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.400
Now, Stefanie's story ties
in to an other point that

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:02.190
is critical here, which is that
you can't give up prematurely.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:07.800
If you do, you oftentimes
may have been on the path

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.770
to success, but you fall off
just a little bit too quickly.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.950
There's a study that was done
by a researcher named Josh

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.990
Morgan, which I found stunning.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.040
In 2015, he did a
study of podcasts,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.340
a longitudinal study over the
past 10 years, 2005 to 2015.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.090
What he realized, number one,
there's a lot of podcasts.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.590
At the time that he studied
this, 206,000 podcasts.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.380
That number has only
grown since then.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.320
If all we look at is
that top line number,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.740
we say oh, 200,000 podcasts, how
could I ever compete with that?

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.480
Why should I even start if there
are so many people out there

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.460
trying to reach
that same audience?

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.080
How can I ever break through?

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.070
What Josh Morgan discovered
though is something

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.270
that I think if we
really understood,

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.410
if we really kept in
mind, might actually

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.130
transform how we do everything.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:17.710
And that is out of
those 200,000 podcasts

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:22.780
over this 10-year period,
the average podcast

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:30.430
lasted only 12 episodes before
its creators stopped doing it,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.410
12 episodes.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.910
There was an average
of two episodes

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.530
a month for six
months, and they quit.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:41.840
We think we're competing
against 200,000 people.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.990
We are not.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:50.620
If you simply persist, the
ranks thin so dramatically,

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:57.110
you're competing against a
fraction of what started out.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.880
This gentleman here,
Jordan Harbinger,

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.790
he runs a podcast called
"The Art of Charm."

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.780
It's very popular now.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.115
It's in the iTunes top
50 business podcasts.

00:42:07.115 --> 00:42:10.580
It's hard these days with a
lot of big corporate entrants.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.780
You know, there's NPR,
major, big funded shows.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.020
Jordan runs an independent
podcast that is still

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.190
one of the most popular.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.550
Three million people
a month download it.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.410
How did he get there?

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:30.150
Well, it turns out he's
been doing it for 10 years.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:34.790
Who even had heard
of podcasts in 2007?

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.800
But that's when he started.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.650
And he's been doing
it ever since.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.820
It starts slow.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.310
He told me he remembers the
first time he'd actually

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.680
looked up his
podcast statistics,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.620
26 people had
downloaded his podcast.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:54.270
He said, not 2,600, 26 people
had downloaded his podcast.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.000
And he said, he found
it so depressing,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.940
he didn't look at his stats
for another six years.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.780
But he kept going.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.970
And today, he's built
a massive audience.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.820
We have to, as
entrepreneurial thinkers,

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.860
learn to outlast
the competition.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.950
Now, I also don't want
to leave the impression

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.930
that the only metric of success
is about huge podcast numbers,

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.300
or having some massive reach.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.000
That is a great
thing to aspire to.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.790
If we persevere, we
may, in fact, get there.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:33.260
But we don't have to get there
in order to be successful.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.410
As we saw with the story
of Stefanie and focusing

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.650
on the small wins,
there's a lot of good

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.600
that can come even before you
break through in a huge way.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.480
This is a woman named Fei Wu.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.600
I actually met Fei a few years
ago because she is a podcaster.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.320
She had me on her show.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.440
As I got to know Fei, I
realized something incredible.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.390
Now, she has a small podcast.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.340
It does not have
the download numbers

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.010
that the Jordan and
"The Art of Charm" does.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.710
But she has nonetheless
been able to build

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:12.080
a business for herself on the
back of having this podcast,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.680
not because she's getting
lucrative sponsor dollars.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.330
That hasn't happened yet.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.710
But what's happened is something
perhaps even more surprising.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:27.260
A full 25% of the
guests on her show

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.790
have actually gone on to hire
her for business projects.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:34.490
And it all started not
because she pitched them,

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.330
not because it was ever a
plan to get them as clients,

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.440
but because she learned about
these people, cared about them,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.550
got to know them.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:48.380
And she'd make suggestions,
like sending a list to people

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.990
about ways that they might
improve their website

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.890
and its functionality.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.030
Now, this was not a ploy
to get them to hire her.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.970
These were things they
could all do on their own.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.630
But she had developed such
a strong rapport with them

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.060
that when they found out
that she did branding,

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:09.020
that she did web design, they
reached out and said, well,

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.620
could you do this for us?

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.590
We would love to hire you.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.560
And she's built a successful
entrepreneurial venture

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:21.110
for herself as a result,
really, of the relationships.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.900
That's a metric
that we can focus

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.060
on is, how do you build
deep relationships

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.140
with your audience, with
the people around you,

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.790
with your community?

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.210
Which leads me to the last
point, the last story,

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:42.500
about how we can all start to
think more entrepreneurially.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.240
This is Pat Flynn.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.350
Pat also is a blogger
and podcaster.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.650
But his story is a
little distinctive.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.350
And when I learned about
it, I realized there

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.800
was an important lesson in it.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.130
Pat actually started out working
for an architecture firm.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:07.480
And during the Great Recession
in 2008, he lost his job.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.776
He had actually just
passed an exam though.

00:46:09.776 --> 00:46:11.400
He had been studying
for a while to get

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.490
certified in green
buildings and being

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.950
competent in the
green building world.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.230
And in order to study
for this exam, which

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.690
was pretty hard to
pass, he had set up

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.185
a blog, where he was posting his
study notes and all the things

00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:27.060
that he was learning,
just so he could really

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.550
keep himself focused.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.930
And he thought, hey,
maybe my efforts

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.480
can help some other
people as well.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.310
His site had become
pretty popular,

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.620
because there was useful
information on it.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.710
So it began ranking pretty
highly in search engine

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.910
results.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.720
So eventually Pat
decided that maybe he

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.297
would take his blog posts
that he had written,

00:46:48.297 --> 00:46:50.130
that he had shared for
free, and he put them

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:54.600
together as an e-book,
just an easy way for people

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.120
to start reading it
all in one place.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.890
So he puts all of his blog
posts together as an e-book,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.140
puts it up on his website.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.380
And something kind
of amazing happened.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.470
His first month
selling the e-book,

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.580
he brought in nearly
$8,000 from doing it.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.070
That was stunning
to him because it

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.380
was more than twice as
much money as he was making

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.810
at the architecture firm.

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:25.740
And the timing was pretty
good, because he had just

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.700
gotten laid off.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.222
But of course, when
he realized that this

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:32.430
was starting to take off,
he wanted to understand it.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.610
He wanted to understand why
people were buying this book,

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.610
so he can learn more
about his customers

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.020
and why they were doing it.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.580
So he sent out a survey.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.550
And he asked people, why
did you buy the e-book?

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:46.380
How did you hear about it?

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:50.430
And he realized something
kind of astonishing.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.030
A full quarter of the
people who wrote back

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.380
to him about the e-book
said that they had already

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.590
passed the green building exam.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.520
They didn't need
the book any more.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.060
He said, well, why did you
buy it if you don't need it?

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.020
And they said, Pat, we've
been reading your blog.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.720
And this is the first time that
you've ever sold something.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.920
And so it's the first chance
we had to pay you back.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.010
Think about that for a minute.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:28.210
If you can have the
kind of relationship

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.900
with your customers, with your
audience, with your community,

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.320
with the people around you
so that they care enough,

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.290
that they value
what you do enough

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.420
that they would be
willing to buy something

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:46.540
they don't even need as a
thank you, that's a testament.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.370
Obviously, we don't
want to be selling

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.230
people things they don't need.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:55.240
But think about the emotion
and the sentiment behind that.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.470
If we really want to be
entrepreneurial thinkers, if we

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.040
want to embrace
flexibility, adaptability,

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.570
thinking about what the
audience wants and needs,

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.670
and being able to deliver
that in innovative ways,

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.430
one of the best things we
can do is to ask ourselves,

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:17.410
how can we create a relationship
with that community such

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:23.560
that they would want to purchase
something just as a thank you?

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.260
How do we get them to value
what we're doing that much?

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:35.460
If we can reach that level,
we will have succeeded.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.880
So today, we all
live in a busy world.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.300
You know this.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.760
A study by the
Radicati Group in 2015

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.340
showed that the average
professional sends or receives

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.790
122 email messages per day.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.490
That number is
only getting worse.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.050
It is only compounding.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.500
A study by the
Eliassen Group said

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.950
that the average professional
spends 62 hours per month

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:05.700
in meetings, well
over a full workweek.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.929
It's a week-and-a-half
in meetings.

00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:09.720
But if you think about
it, it averages out.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.630
Two or three meetings a
day, it's probably right.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.370
62 hours a month.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.730
We are being pulled in
a million directions.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.920
Everyone's attention is frayed.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.940
And amidst all of this,
we have massive change,

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.280
technological change,
disruption, new innovations,

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.330
new trends, new geopolitics.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.900
Somehow we have to adapt.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:40.090
Somehow we have to make
ourselves indispensable.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:44.010
The more we can think
entrepreneurially,

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:49.770
the more we can learn to
bring these ideas together,

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:53.760
to embrace them, to make
them a part of our lives,

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.880
the more successful we
can be over the long term.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.600
That's why I wrote
"Entrepreneurial You,"

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.620
to be able to try to provide
a playbook for people

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:09.650
in today's economy to go a
little bit further and think

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:13.250
about how we can bring
this into our own lives

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.000
and our own careers.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.590
So today, I've laid out
11 different strategies

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.560
about how we can think
more entrepreneurially.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.050
Some may resonate with you.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.800
Others might not.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.330
It's a smorgasbord.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:32.150
But if you can take just one
or two and begin to apply them,

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.850
begin to make them a
