00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.440
So one of the first things I want to do is add a button right

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.570
here that plays some audio.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.240
Let me drag out the Utility area and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.752
then go find the button, and then drag that on to the canvas here.

00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:16.770
Now, I'm going to change the image of this button in a little bit.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.730
But before I do that, I want to think about where I am going to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.410
write the code that will execute when I press this button.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.190
In essence, where do I write the action for

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.340
this button using the control+drag technique?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.240
Let's think about how we did for the stop button in the previous scene.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.280
I am going to select this scene and then go to the Assistant Editor.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.835
So you may recall that we control+dragged from this stop button to this file,

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:46.590
viewcontroller.swift and created an action called stopAudio.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.550
So what we need to do now is create a new viewcontroller for

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.650
this second scene in our app.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.650
All right, to do that I will first manage some screen space by going back to

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.840
the standard editor.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.760
Then I will go to the File menu at the top, click on New, and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.350
then create a new File.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.320
Here, under iOS on the left, I will select a Cocoa Touch Class, and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.830
then click Next.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500
I will call this class, PlaySoundsViewController.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.420
Now, this is going to be a subclass of UIViewController,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.210
because we want to inherit metrics like view did load, etcetera.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.550
Our language is still Swift, and I will hit Next.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.930
And I will save this new class in the same folder as my app and hit Create.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.970
All right, so we now have a new file called PlaySoundsViewController.swift with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.440
a class by the same name inside it.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.670
So, the next thing to do here is to go back to the storyboard, and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.980
connect this second scene in our app here to the new file that we just made.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.090
So I will select this second scene and then open the Utilities tray.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.720
In here under Identity Inspector, you will notice that the cut and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.130
view controller is this guy, UIViewController.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.710
I can substitute this with PlaySoundsViewController, and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.024
as I start typing Escort auto completes it for me.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.639
All right, so let's make the action for this button now.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.670
I can go to the Assistant editor and on the left here, I see my storyboard.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.080
And on the right I see the view controller that this scene is associated with,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.320
which is the new file we created, PlaySoundsViewController.swift.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.790
If I go to my first scene, you will notice that he view controller on

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.740
the right hand side of the screen changes which is ViewController.swift.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.600
So I can hop back and forth between my first scene and the second scene in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.740
the app, and the view controller for it changes automatically.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.840
The reason why that happens is because we have this automatic setting

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.290
selected over here.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.220
All right, now we can create an action for

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.235
this button in this new ViewController.
