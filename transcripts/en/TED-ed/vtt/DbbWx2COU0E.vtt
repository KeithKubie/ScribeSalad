00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:10.186
Albert Einstein played a key role
in launching quantum mechanics

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:12.585
through his theory of the
photoelectric effect

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.987
but remained deeply bothered by its
philosophical implications.

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:21.325
And though most of us still remember
him for deriving E=MC^2,

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:26.681
his last great contribution to physics
was actually a 1935 paper,

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:31.635
coauthored with his young colleagues
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.925
Regarded as an odd philosophical
footnote well into the 1980s,

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:41.871
this EPR paper has recently become central
to a new understanding of quantum physics,

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:44.160
with its description 
of a strange phenomenon

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.842
now known as entangled states.

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:52.023
The paper begins by considering a
source that spits out pairs of particles,

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:54.922
each with two measurable properties.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.537
Each of these measurements has
two possible results

00:00:57.537 --> 00:00:59.108
of equal probability.

00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:01.748
Let's say zero or one
for the first property,

00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:03.950
and A or B for the second.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.492
Once a measurement is performed,

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:09.040
subsequent measurements of the same
property in the same particle

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.557
will yield the same result.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.512
The strange implication of this scenario

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.765
is not only that the state 
of a single particle

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.381
is indeterminate until it's measured,

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.194
but that the measurement then
determines the state.

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:24.114
What's more, the measurements 
affect each other.

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:26.624
If you measure a particle 
as being in state 1,

00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:29.118
and follow it up with the second
type of measurement,

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:32.472
you'll have a 50% chance of
getting either A or B,

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.668
but if you then repeat 
the first measurement,

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:37.673
you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:41.207
even though the particle had already
been measured at one.

00:01:41.207 --> 00:01:44.887
So switching the property being measured
scrambles the original result,

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:47.426
allowing for a new, random value.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:51.077
Things get even stranger when you
look at both particles.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.934
Each of the particles will produce
random results,

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:55.266
but if you compare the two,

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:59.386
you will find that they are
always perfectly correlated.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.293
For example, if both particles
are measured at zero,

00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:04.428
the relationship will always hold.

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:06.946
The states of the two are entangled.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:11.143
Measuring one will tell you the other
with absolute certainty.

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:15.984
But this entanglement seems to defy
Einstein's famous theory of relativity

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:19.027
because there is nothing to limit the
distance between particles.

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:21.219
If you measure one in New York at noon,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.448
and the other in San Francisco 
a nanosecond later,

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:27.593
they still give exactly the same result.

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:29.932
But if the measurement 
does determine the value,

00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:34.544
then this would require one particle
sending some sort of signal to the other

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:37.390
at 13,000,000 times the speed of light,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.741
which according to relativity,
is impossible.

00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:45.812
For this reason, Einstein dismissed
entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung,"

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:48.508
or spooky action at a distance.

00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:51.176
He decided that quantum mechanics
must be incomplete,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:55.703
a mere approximation of a deeper reality
in which both particles

00:02:55.703 --> 00:02:59.527
have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us.

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:03.109
Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.359
maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate,

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.960
and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.827
to depend on that of its distant partner.

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.648
For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse,

00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:20.194
until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:24.368
was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles.

00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:29.050
The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.439
strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.245
because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advanced.

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.613
Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach,

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:42.765
where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured,

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:45.853
has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:49.040
that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.709
Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument,

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.259
physicists went out and did it.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.483
Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s,

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:03.106
dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction,

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:05.214
and all have found the same thing:

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:07.603
quantum mechanics is correct.

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:12.220
The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.365
and cannot be explained by any 
deeper variable.

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:19.991
The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so.

00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.976
By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics,

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:26.702
it led to further elaboration 
of the theory

00:04:26.702 --> 00:04:30.798
and helped launch research into
subjects like quantum information,

00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:36.774
now a thriving field with the potential to
develop computers of unparalleled power.

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:39.602
Unfortunately, the randomness of
the measured results

00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:41.716
prevents science fiction scenarios,

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:46.127
like using entangled particles
to send messages faster than light.

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:49.025
So relativity is safe, for now.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:53.534
But the quantum universe is far stranger
than Einstein wanted to believe.
