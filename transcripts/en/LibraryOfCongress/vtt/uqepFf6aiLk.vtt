00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.480
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: OK, I think
we're ready to resume.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.260
The final program this afternoon
deals with Section 117 and 109.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.230
And the topic is we'll be exploring
whether current limitations on

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.430 position:56%
and exceptions to copyright
protection adequately address issues

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.970
concerning software
embedded in everyday products

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.450
or whether amendments or
clarifications would be useful.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.170
I'd like to start with just
sort of a general observation

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.770
from having reviewed
all the comments.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.800
And while this is not
a universal statement,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.820
it does seem to be
fairly common that many

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.580 position:56%
of the commenters either said that
no changes were warranted or needed,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.660
on the one hand, and others
commenter said that the same thing

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.160
but qualified it by
saying that Sections 109

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.810
and 117 properly construed,
no changes are needed.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.260 position:56%
While that creates the appearance of
consensus, I suspect that somewhere

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.320
in the middle there is
some level of disagreement

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.010
which hopefully we'll
get into this afternoon.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.690
So, I would throw that out as
sort of an opening question,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.290
a general question of whether
changes are needed or not,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.450 position:56%
and if so-- if changes are needed
in the interpretation of 109 or 117,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.500
what those areas of interpretation
where they would be helpful.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.740
So perhaps we could start with 109
if anyone would like to jump in.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.440
Jonathan? Jonathan Band, rather.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.740
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Sure.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.500
So, I guess, you know, the sort
of like the threshold issue of,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830
you know, properly interpreted--

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.560
but, you know, properly
interpreted--

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.990
you know, if I were an
Article 3 judge, you know,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.140
the world would be very
different, but that's--

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.780
I don't see that happening
any time soon.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.320
And I think especially for
ORI, we're very focused

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.170
on the specific problem of
109A and how would applies

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.820
to software-enabled products.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.730
And it seems that between the--

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.010
what is an owner and what is the
proper scope of interpretation

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.210 position:56%
of 109A and all of these contractual
issues that we talked about,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.880
the fact that you could just--

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.630
regardless of how courts
interpret 109A,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.510
you could still have contractual
restrictions on transfer.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.460
So we just think as
a practical matter,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.240
the only way in the
foreseeable future to really deal

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.370
with this issue, you know,
and that's why you have--

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.550
with circuit splits
and all the rest is

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.360
to have something very
short and sweet like YODA.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.480
And that would, you know,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.970
it wouldn't obviously solve the
entire problem but it would solve,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.270
you know, one piece of the problem.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.450
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Mr. Perzanowski?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.750
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: Yes,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.980
I would agree that YODA
is an important first step

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.100
and does embody some
important principles.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.150
I would also agree that it
doesn't solve the whole problem.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:52.420
I think-- I would not recommend
any changes to the text of 109

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.840
or 117 relevant to
the particular set

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.200
of questions that we're addressing.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.310
Today, what I do think would
be useful is a definition

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.860
in Section 101 of owner for
exhaustion purposes, right?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.900 position:56%
Owner of a copy as it appears in 109
and 117 or definition of transfer

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.790
of copy ownership, I think
that is a crucial question.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.730
It is a question that courts have
answered in a lot of different

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.210
and I think inconsistent
ways over the years.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.810
I think a definition of ownership
would provide some much needed

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.110
clarity, right?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.410
Who are we talking about here?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.550
We're talking about
consumers for the most part.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.820
How do consumers know whether
they own the things that they buy?

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.270 position:56%
I don't think it's a particularly
satisfying answer to tell them well,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.700
you know, here's a dozen cases
decided by the Ninth Circuit

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.400
and the Federal Circuit
and the Second Circuit

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.120
and maybe you can make
sense of this question.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.780
It's really fundamental question

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.500
and so I think it deserves some
attention here in terms of what

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.990
that definition would look like.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.350
You know, if it were up to me, I
would have a definition that said

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.890
that anytime you had a
transaction that was characterized

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.920
by a one time payment
and perpetual possession

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.350
that is a transfer
of ownership, right?

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.520 position:56%
So, that I think is the key
question that we have to answer here

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.670
with respect to 109 and 117.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:51.390
I also included in my written
comments a couple of references

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.110
to the Canadian and Israeli
Copyright Acts and the way

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.500
that they deal with
the ROM copy doctrine

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.450
and temporary instantiations
of works transient copying.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.820
I think there might be some benefit
from clarification there as well.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.080
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Mr. Band
mentioned the Your Own Devices Act

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.990 position:56%
and suggested that would be a good--

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.650
I think Mr. Perzanowski said
it was a good first step.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.810
What affect or impact if any do--
does anyone anticipate from--

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.790 position:56%
if that legislation was passed, what
impact would it have on innovation

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.510
in the field of software for
embedded software for devices?

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.470
Mr. Kupferschmid?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.400
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: So
I think if the YODA bill

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.790
or something potentially similar
or worse were to be enacted,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.000
I think it would certainly
adversely affect the ability

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.470
of software companies to
co-license, including the manner

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.810
in which these software companies
license as well as their ability

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.270
to enforce these licenses.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.160
As a result, it will be
more challenging for them

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.000
to recoup their investment
they make to--

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.560 position:56%
and to develop new software products
and to update existing ones.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.860
It'll be more difficult for them

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.870
to widely distribute their software
products to the public especially

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.730
on a variety of different platforms
that consumers enjoyed today.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.470
The availability of
scope and warranties--

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.050
scope of warranties
and support services,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.470
I think could be adversely
affected as well.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.940
It almost certainly would
change their pricing structure,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.240
certainly given the
provisions on maintenance

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.370
and support that are in the bill.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.700
And it could also allow
competitors to get access

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.170
to their software more readily
and therefore steal the software

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.310
of the underlying code and
create and sell cheap imitations

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.540
because they will not
have the sort of R&amp;D costs

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.770
of the original software company.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.740
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, on
that last point, I mean,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.740
why wouldn't just a regular
copyright infringement lawsuit be

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.040
sufficient there?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.920
I mean, YODA doesn't
take away the ability

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.270
to bring in infringement suit?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.110
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
So, yeah, no, I think--

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.780 position:56%
I mean I think that's right, but
like I said, it would make it easier

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.650
so I don't think you
want to be in a position

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.640
where you've changed your business
model from instead of creating

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.490
and innovating to bringing
infringement suits either

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.460
and so I think that's--
it's becomes an issue

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:48.750
of how do you police the
software and similarly.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.460
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: But do you think
the licenses are actually is--

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:58.310
or what preventing
that's kind of theft?

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.610
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: I would hope

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.610
to some extent that
that is the case.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.860 position:56%
I mean, certainly, well, like I
said, we'll talk about 1201 tomorrow

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.150
and that's part of it and I may
be sort of joining two bills,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.510 position:56%
the YODA bill and Fahrenholtz's
another draft that he's been working

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.890
on which would basically take
away the 1201 protections, so--

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.150
in doing so, but I think
certainly the combination

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.870
of the two would have that effect.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.190
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, can I ask--
sorry, just a general--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.050
which maybe other people
can address which is--

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.390
which I've always just
been curious about,

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:39.300 position:56%
but why the essential copy exemption
is limited to owners of the copies

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.410
and why that's not automatically?

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.340
So, CONTU recommended that Congress
adopt a rule that's, you know,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.140
allows you to create essential
copies if you were the--

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.240
I think it was a lawful
possessor of the copy

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.340
and that was changed in
Congress to be owner.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.000
I'm just wondering just
as a practical matter,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.580 position:56%
what's the rationale for limiting
the essential copy defends to owners

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.120
of software rather than
anyone who is, you know,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.390
has a lawful possession
of the software?

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.410
Mr. Bergmayer?

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.420
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: I'm
happy to address that.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.670
Well, as I look at the
essential step copy doctrine

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.930
as really making the most sense
and doing the most useful work

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.950 position:56%
in the case of installing software,
which doesn't happen as much anymore

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.720
since people just typically just
installed over the internet.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.360
But if you have a disk I would
say when you are installing--

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.550
you're installing from floppy
disks or a CD-ROM on to a computer,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.200 position:56%
well that is a copy, right, and I
think that is inarguably a new copy.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.520
And if you own that disk, then
you should be able to use it

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.860
by installing it on a computer.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.840
I mean, I don't think that's a
particularly controversial point

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.160
and that's where I think that the
essential step doctrine does the

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.460
most useful work.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.340
Where I have sort of
trouble with it is the notion

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.680
that simply using software
creates a ROM copy

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.860
and using the essential step
test in that context, I think is,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.990
it shouldn't be necessary to--

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.930
either those ROM copy should
be ephemeral and just excluded

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.100
from the definition of copy or
some other doctrine should say

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.010
that the possessor in that
context should not need to use--

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.690
need a license simply to use the
software, but I think limiting it

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.330
to the lawful owner is logical in
the case of installing software

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.590
because otherwise, I could take
software and then install it

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.330
on my computer and I'm the
lawful possessor then I lend it

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.640
to my friend, my friend
is the lawful possessor

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.870
because he is borrowing
it and he can install it

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.170
in his computer and so on.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.580
So I think that limiting it to
owner in that particular concept--

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.240 position:56%
contexts makes sense but not in the
context of ROM copies which I need--

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.930
I think needs to be more
fundamentally dealt with.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.230
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: Can I add?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.530
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Sure.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.830
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.130
I think another point that's
important here is to keep in mind

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.850
that the owner of a copy stands

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.160
in a special relationship
to the work, right?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.280
The owner of a copy is someone

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.990 position:56%
who in the ordinary circumstance
has compensated the copyright holder

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.130
for that work, right?

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.930
And so it makes sense to extend
a set of rights to owners

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.380
that we don't extend, certainly
to the public generally, right?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.670
Owners have rights that the
public at large shouldn't have.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.480 position:56%
And there might be other people who
are temporarily in lawful possession

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.790
of a copy that we don't think
deserve those protections, right?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.560 position:56%
So, you know, I order some software,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.030 position:56%
I don't know what decade this
hypothetical takes place in but we--

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.100
I order some software
over the internet

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.530
and it gets delivered
to me by FedEx.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.590
FedEx is in lawful
possession of that software.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.600
I don't think they get
to make copies of it even

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.630
if they're essential to running the
program because they don't stand

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.630
in that sort of relationship
with the copyright holder.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:05.100 position:56%
You know, the exhaustion is premised
in large part on this idea of,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.640
you know, the single recovery
theory where, you know,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.050
copyright holders have
been compensated

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.780
and as a result some rights
get transferred to consumers.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.970
That's just not true for people who
might be, you know, like I said,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.090
you know, temporarily in possession

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.180
or bailed users something
along those lines.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.270
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Mr. Mohr?

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.010
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: A couple of things.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.900
I think I just wanted
to associate myself

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.560
with Keith's remarks on software.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.170
He hit all the bullets
that I'd written

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.740
down plus a couple more
I hadn't thought of.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.710
The only thing I'm somewhat
confused about is we--

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.190
there's been some suggestion
that there's a split.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:54.640
I'm not sure exactly which cases
we're talking about a split on

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.940
but if we're talking about--

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.830
I mean, if we're talking
about Crawl [assumed spelling]

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.820
and Vernor [assumed spelling], in
our view, there is simply no split.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:05.100
And there is certainly no split
that warrants different application

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.670
of a newly crafted rule
to embedded software.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.780 position:56%
I mean I just-- I'm-- this is
something that I am struggling with.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.130
I don't-- I just simply
don't see that.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.990
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, in
considering, one of the things

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.140
that Crawl I think says is
that you could consider--

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.840
so, it says that the terms

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.710
of the license aren't necessarily
controlling and that one

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.610
of the factors, I think,

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.460
it identifies whether
it's the software is sort

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.760
of embedded in the device.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.090
I think they bring
that up as one factor.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.290
Do you think that's an appropriate
factor for a court to look

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.080
at in terms of determining sort
of trying to draw this line

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.500
between licensing and ownership?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.800
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Right.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.230
Appropriate, absolutely, right?

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.980
Because-- I mean this goes back
to the exchange that we, I guess,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.610
indirectly had before about
consumer expectations.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.910
There are particular industries

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.520
where there will be costumes
practices usage of trade

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.660
about how these goods
are sold and delivered.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.750
In such cases, there is going
to be a good deal of reticence,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.650
not only I think on the consumer
side but also on the judicial side

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:17.340
to engage in-- to find
ongoing license agreements

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.080
where they are in fact a fiction.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.680
But there are going to be
a whole lot of other cases

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.110
where a licensing relationship
is completely appropriate.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.760
And I mean, in our view, the courts
have solved that problem properly

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.390
and there's no indication that
they won't solve it properly

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.450
going forward.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.780
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Mr. Lowe?

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:50.420
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So I wanted to
comment the issue that's come

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.700
up about how innovation will
be affected by, you know,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.840
the YODA or any revisions.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.310 position:56%
And I think, you know, our industry,
the whole vehicle off the marker

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.600 position:56%
which is about $350 billion industry

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.710
in this country has expand
a huge amount of innovation

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.400
because of the ability to
reserve engineer and the ability

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.040
to work with, you know,
to work with patent law.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.180
And patent is still available
to protect, you know, innovation

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.360
and protect new ideas but
the sense that you can use

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.930
that we fear is the use of
copyright law to inhibit that

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.310
and I guess I brought that
up before and, you know,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.820 position:56%
the issue of exhaustion one step for
sale the car owner should be the one

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.000
that owns all the software,
not necessarily the, you know,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.290 position:56%
the idea behind the software but the
software-enable to do what they want

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.270
with that vehicle and that
includes, be able to put on parts

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.930
from that car that may not
be made by the same person

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.200
or company that made the car.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.760
So I think it's important that
when you're looking all this

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.870
that that needs to be considered
as part of this equation.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.910
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Just to bring to
Section 117 into the debate here.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:07.000
Section 117 does give certain
rights of repair and maintenance,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.630
but interestingly, the
language you use is--

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.330
that the key point is that you
have to be the owner of the machine

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:19.800
which in Mr. Lowe's example
would be the owner of the car.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.210
Is ownership there-- is ownership
of the machine itself enough

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.390
or do we also have to
worry about the ownership

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.780
of the programs on the machine?

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.260
Mr. Band you're already
up, so go ahead.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.820
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So, I'll answer
that as well as the, you know,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.450
the other questions on the table.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.960
So, certainly, in my
view it should be--

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.890
and actually I think 117C is
it's the owner of the machine

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.510
or the owner or licensee of
the machine at least for 117C,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.900
whereas 117B I think
applies to the, you know,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.590
is the owner of the
software and that's part

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.900
of the problem here
that they're different.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.690
And I think senate
leader, you're asking why

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.620 position:56%
with CONTU what was the cause of the
change from what CONTU recommended

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.330
to what Congress enacted, you
know, I'm old, I'm not that old,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.670
it was before my time when the
copyright software amendments were

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.670
enacted in 1980, but I suspect
that there's a very simple answer

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.570
that the lobbyist from
large computer

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.000
and software companies
understood that by shifting it

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.600
from lawful possessor
to lawful owner

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:38.370
that they dramatically narrowed
the effectiveness of 117

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.100
because by then already-- there
were, you know, already by then,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.100 position:56%
the predominant model was to license
software, and so they realized

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.650
that they could completely
neuter the effectiveness of 117

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.950
by just changing a couple of words.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.260
So that's actually
pretty good lobbying.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.420
You know, I wish I'd been
around and had done it.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.100
But with respect to the question
about innovation, I don't think,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.260
you know, a bill like YODA would
have any impact on innovation.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.930
I mean, right now,
sort of this control

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.310
over the resale market
is sort of like money

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.680
that goes right to the bottom line.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.950
A manufacturer knows that a product
has, you know, a certain lifespan.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:26.560
They have no idea whether
the purchaser of that piece

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.970
of equipment is going to keep it
for its entire lifespan or sell it

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.320
after five years and then, you
know, someone else will use it

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.690
for the remaining two or
three years of the lifespan.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.860
But the ability to charge
an extra license fee

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.630
for that transaction which, you
know, they wouldn't have made

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.500
if it just stayed in the
possession of the first purchaser.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.120
I mean, that's just again money
that goes right to the bottom line.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.040
I don't think it'll have
any impact on innovation.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.190
The possibility of
infringement, again,

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.930 position:56%
a bill like YODA makes it very clear
that, you know, the selling applies

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:06.660
to non-infringing copies and as
you mentioned that it also relate,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.550
you still have the ability
to sue for infringement.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.000
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So as YODA, just
going back to sort of a point

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.330
that I was making-- a
question I had before

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.590 position:56%
about whether this was limited, sort
of enterprise level kinds of things.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.630
Is it your-- and so YODA would
have extend to all of those, right,

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.240
it wouldn't just be
limited to consumer devices,

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:32.260
it would also extend to, you know,
a $20,000, you know, rack server.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.560
Yeah, right?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.860
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Right.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.160
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.460
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: It
would be-- it would be--

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.820
because at this point when you're
having, you know, it would apply

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.180
to the, you know, to the iPhone,
it would have apply to this.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.480
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Right.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.780
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: And
again we're talking--

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.920
and when you say enterprise level,
I mean, you know, you have a lot

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.210
of government agencies, you
know, this Library of Congress,

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:57.700
but it could also be the tree
company that's, you know,

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.610
that was chopping down trees
in my neighborhood yesterday.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:06.470
I mean, a lot of the power
saws have software in them now.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.170
And so if you want to
startup, one guy wants to start

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.470
up his own company and buy
used power saws, you know,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.770
it would allow him to start
a new business as well.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.820
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And is it your-- So
it wouldn't be necessarily limited

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.860
to circumstances where there's
like an ability to engage and sort

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.700
of the first purchaser
to engage in negotiation.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.490
I mean, let me put this put
it different way, it's to--

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.790
to what extent is there a kind
of, I mean, maybe you know,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.890
maybe you don't know, is
there sort of negotiation

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.320
between a company purchasing a
kind of-- you know, blips of that.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.680
I know you don't like
the word enterprise,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.920
but enterprise level kind of,
you know, switch from Cisco

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.090 position:56%
and the first purchaser and Cisco
this like negotiating over the terms

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.530
of the license, like how
does just never happened?

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: My impression
is it happens very, very rarely.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.560
I mean I imagine when the federal
government is buying things

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.330
from Cisco, there probably
is a negotiation.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.250
But certainly going back to, you
know, when and this does date me

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:11.700 position:56%
but when I was working on UCITA,
the, you know, the understanding was

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.890
that even you have these large
insurance companies, you know,

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.190
when they were dealing with
the software vendors, you know,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.300
this are like AETNA and MetLife.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.840
There was no negotiation, there
was very much to take early

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.230
that this is the license,
you got to take--

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.640
you got to take the
deal and that's one

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.500
of the reasons why the insurance
industry was so involved

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.050
in the fight against UCITA
and base ultimately prevented

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:38.000
from being adopted anywhere other
than Maryland and Virginia was

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.500
because they-- there was no
negotiation even for, you know,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.950
these Fortune 50 companies.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.080
&gt;&gt; Mr. Bergmayer.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.400
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah, this
have a-- just a sort of--

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.880
sort of a clarification
and some curious

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.540
as to how other people view this.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.120
I mean when I read the
definition of a copy,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.870
it says it's a material object, so
I would say that if own the car,

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.940
I necessarily own any copies
of software in that car,

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.360
unless you could say that there
are physically parts of the car

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.350
that I own and physically parts
of the car that I don't own.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.530
Because I can't sort of I don't
understand how you can read the

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.250
statute in any other way.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.860
So if I own the car, I
own the copies in the car

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.860
or if I own the machine
I own the copies

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.220
that are contained in the machine.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.540
Or if you say that I own the
machine and I don't own the copies,

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.240
there are physically parts, there
are literally chips or portions

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.640
of the physical item that I
don't own well I do own the rest,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.050
and how do I pick out, which
ones I do and which ones I don't.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.250
I mean this is just how
the statute is written.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.830 position:56%
This is the entire basis of how all
of these interrelated statutes work.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.340
And I keep hearing this notion
that well, you own the machine

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.140
but you don't own copies
of software in the machine,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.460 position:56%
and that just doesn't make any sense

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.090
and it just doesn't
comport with the statute.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.990
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And so I mean, but--

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.200
and so I mean do you think
the Congress when they--

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.050
when Congress reacted to the MAI
case, do you think they were just--

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.060
they were-- what do
you think that meant?

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.400
Were they not implicitly sort of
accepting that the premise of,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.590
you know, of software ownership

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.390
versus machine ownership wasn't
actually a real distinction

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.690
or what--

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.990
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: It
says that if you own--

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.290
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: -- how
do you react to that?

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.590
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: I mean, I'm
just looking at the statute,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.370
as if you own the machine,
then if there is a new copy

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.620
in other words something that
does trigger a copyright,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.680 position:56%
that is made by virtue of activating
the machine then you were given a

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.030 position:56%
statutory license to make that
copy, so that is not really relating

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.540
to the nature of what a copy is
or whether you own it or not.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.810
There's nothing in it that
says you don't own the copy.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.930
It's authorizing you
to make a new copy.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.600
So I think that's fine
and it does say a machine

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.380 position:56%
that lawfully contains an authorized
copy, so that would seemed to sort

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.650
of say you could have a
machine and parts of the count

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.310
as the material object that is the
copy, and parts of it that don't.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:01.260
But if we're going to say that you
don't own the copy but you do--

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.560
but you do own the machine,
then that necessarily requires

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.350
that you have some
way of determining,

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.700
which parts of the machine
do I own and which parts

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.410
of the machine don't I own.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.100
Because again, that's just
what the statute it says,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.630
there's no other way to read
it that actually does justice

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.640
to the actual words
that Congress enacted.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.450
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Harbeson.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:29.090
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: I just-- I'm
not going to have a lot to say

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.670
about Section 117 based
of my membership of course

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.990
but I do want to make two points.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.690
The first is that there was another
case that was decided the same day

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:42.020
as Vernor, and that's the UMG
v. Troy Augusto which is a case

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.830
of distribution of promotional
CDs to radio stations via

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:54.740
from record labels, and that
case was decided in favor of--

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.940
in favor of the person
who is doing the selling.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.570
To my knowledge it is not
affective market for CDs.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:09.170
So I-- And I offer that only
because it seems relevant to me,

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.840
but I recognize that I'm a
little bit off point here.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.400 position:56%
The other thing is I want to respond
to some points that were made

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.290
on this side of the table regarding
to-- with regarding to piracy.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.950
And just to point out that, you
know, I have some experience

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.760
with the concept of piracy,
I've been accused of this table

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.990
of being a pirate in previous
hearings and I, you know,

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:39.670
we make laws for the law abiding
not for the people that don't.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.130
If someone who's going to
violate a license is going

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.470
to violate the copyright
they don't care.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.700
The people who this will affect
or the people who do want

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.530
to follow the lawsuit, so I just
like to remind people of that.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:57.980
That's probably all I
say with this panel.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.280
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: General question.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.220 position:56%
If Congress decided to enact YODA or
some other legislation of a similar

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.780
or different nature or made
other changes that, you know,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.320
like haven't suggested here stay.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.530
Is there a risk or concern that
Congress that should be aware

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.040
of that private parties which
is simply contract around them,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.760
say well not withstanding
the provisions

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:27.710 position:56%
of the now newly amended 109 or 117,
you are not considered an owner.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.290
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: I'm
happy to start to address that.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.080
As I recall, I don't have the text
of YODA memorized but I do think

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.940
that the bill contemplates that
the possibility of contracting

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.160 position:56%
around those rights and it
explicitly rejects that possibility.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.510
So, I think this is really
important to go back to the point

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.800
that someone made earlier
about the distinction

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.130
between a contract and a license.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:58.420
A license is fundamentally
a creature of property law,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.790
not a creature of contract law.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:09.560
And, you know-- if what has
happened is a transfer of ownership

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.870
as a matter of property law, a
contract doesn't change that right?

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.700
It might create contract
liability for breach,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.220
but I don't think it can change
that fundamental question

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.520
of the transfer of ownership.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.620
That's why I think it's really
important do we have a clear,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.740
well settled understanding
of what kinds

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.730
of property transactions
trigger a transfer of ownership?

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.570
That's not a function of contract.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.650
The other point that I
wanted to make is, you know,

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.790 position:56%
in some of the earlier panels we
had some discussion about, you know,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:47.520
concrete examples of harm to
consumers and whether we can--

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.150
whether we can point
to specific instances

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:58.160
where consumers have been prevented
from transferring their devices

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.690
or whether we can articulate
other kinds of harm.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.440
And I think we can, but I
also think it's important

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:12.180
to use the same standard in
evaluating harm when we're talking

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.880
about the sort of potential
future harms to consumers

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.980
which I agree have not all
materialize yet and the kinds

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.110
of speculative harms that have
been articulated when it comes

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.540
to passing legislation
like YODA, right?

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.030
I think we need to hold those two
kinds of harm to the same standard.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.820
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So can I ask you about
sort of the Crawl test which starts

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.990
from the premise that the terms

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.430 position:56%
of the license are not
necessarily controlling the relevant

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.780
but not necessarily
controlling and that--

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.540 position:56%
and at least in that case the court
kind of went beyond the four corners

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.510
of the contract to look
at the kind of the--

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.580
the sort of facts on the ground to
determine whether there was the--

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.460
there was a license or there
where there was ownership.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:03.220
I mean, do you think that that test
is sufficiently clear or is in sort

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.020
of an appropriate approach
for courts to take

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.320
and try to draw this line?

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.270
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: So.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:17.680
I think the-- I think
the Crawl test by looking

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.160
at the terms of the license.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.270
Is not mistaken, right, to take
those terms into consideration.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.270
I think what's crucial
though is trying to figure

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.380
out exactly what question
we're trying to answer.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.620
And the question we're trying to
answer is not, what are the hopes

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.320
and dreams of the copyright
holder that they have reflected

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.690
in this agreement which is I think
what the Vernor test does, right?

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.590
It says as long as you recite
the right kinds of restrictions.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:55.640
As long as you announce your
intention to restrict use,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.880
to restrict transfer and you
call this thing a license

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.400
and not a sale, you get your wish.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.340
Of course the context in which the
transaction occurs is important

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.990
and some of that context is going
to be reflected in the license.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.990
But we can't stop there, right?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:22.490
My beef with the Crawls
decision is in part a question

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.240
about terminology, right?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.900
I think this term license
copy is misleading

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.200
in an important way, right?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.930
It distracts our attention
from what the real question is,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.830
which is whether or not a
transfer of ownership has occurred.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:47.770
And I think the more familiar
transactional category is a really

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.600
much more useful than the
term license and figuring it

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.140
out the answer to that question.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.640 position:56%
The statutory language, rental lease

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.110
or lending I think is much more
effective, because a license

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.870
as we know this is one of
the beauties of licenses is

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.870
that they're infinitely
flexible, right?

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:10.370
Property transactions are
not infinitely flexible,

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.260
certainly not property transactions
when it comes to personal property.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.380 position:56%
There's a limited number of accepted
transactional forms and what we have

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.480
to do is look at a set of facts
including the text of the license

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.130
and decide which category
works, right?

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.600
The numerous clauses principle
applies in this context as much

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.480
as it does anywhere
else in property law.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.020
Does that get to your question?

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.320
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.350
And so this sort of I'm
trying to sort to see

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.670
where if there's any real
disagreement between you

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.770
and Mr. Mohr in terms of,
you know, Mr. Mohr said,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.810
it might be appropriate,
would be appropriate to look

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.370
at again going back to
the topic of the study

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:57.630
which is software-enabled
consumer products which is it's--

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.910
it may be irrelevant
consideration to look

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.190
at whether what you're talking
about is software that's embedded

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.410
in a product when you're
trying to determine, you know,

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.930
under a test like Crawls whether
something is owned or not.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.760
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
So I would not--

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.830
I don't think the question
of ownership hinges

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.810
on whether the software
is embedded in a device.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.800
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: I wasn't suggesting
it was, but I was suggesting

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.820 position:56%
that it might be a relevant factor
and it might be an important factor.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.180
Just going to the point that
it gives you an indication

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.640
of what the customs are, what
the consumer expectations are,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.830
which I think something Mr. Mohr
agreed with be-- also relevant.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.880
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: Yeah, I think
it could be a relevant factor,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.310
I don't think it's the
driving factor that the things

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.220
that I've talked about
before, one time payment,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.330
perpetual possession I
think are much more clear

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.250
or much clearer indications of
the answer to that question.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.210
But I think that context
is important

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.500 position:56%
that there might be reasons to treat
some kind of products and some kind

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.490 position:56%
of industries different from others.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.570
Thank you.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.290
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: So just to,
take a jumping off point

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.710
from what Sy just said
in the legislative--

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:13.000
legislation for 117 that there's
a carve-out for embedded software

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.690
in devices in the context
of rentals, the notion being

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.970
that you can rent the car
and you don't need to worry

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:19.870
about the software in it.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.350
And in a legislative history
there's reference as examples

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.470
of such devices on microwave ovens.

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:32.220
And I guess, you might look to
that and say well Congress has sort

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.140
of recognize that that's an
issue and they've carve that out

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.050
and that would give us useful
information about what has happened

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.640
since that change or
that provision was added.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.780
And I guess the question
generally for the panel is does

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.780
that give useful information
from experience or is it the case

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.420
that that change is
really irrelevant

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.770
because again getting back
to the ownership question

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.900
if you don't own the software,
you don't own the machine,

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.280
it's the provision is
essentially doesn't do the work

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.850
that it may have been
intended to do.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.600
Mr. Band?

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.950
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well I think
it's helpful in that it shows that,

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:17.460 position:56%
you know, at the time it was
certain industry group came forward,

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.610
the rental car industry and
said hey this is a problem,

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:27.340
and Congress address that
problem and the sky didn't fall.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.540
And we're now, you know, the
economy is in a different place

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.920
and the level of technology
and the level of the number--

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.360 position:56%
the kinds of devices that have
software in them are-- is different.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.420
And so, you know, I think it
certainly worth looking and says,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.650
you know, well that's a good
starting point but now, you know,

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:55.870
that only applies to the rental
of devices that have or, you know,

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.920
that have the software in it and
so it's worth saying, OK can we--

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.880
does it make sense to expand
it beyond the rental context

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.780 position:56%
to other context, and does it make
sense to perhaps consider, you know,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.070
expanding it to the universe
of software, I mean, you know,

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:18.660
the definition that they have or,
you know, the category of software

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.350
that applies so it's kind of hard

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.310
to understand what
exactly what it means and,

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.310
y even with report language,
it's hard to understand

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.990
but I think it has been applied.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:31.720
People know I think that people
basically understand what it's

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.800
applied to and it has not as far
as I'm more led to any litigation.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.060
But, you know, I think it's
certainly worth saying, OK,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.160
this is a good starting
point, you know, how do we--

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.320
how can we expand on that, and how
can we build on that given the fact

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.110
that the world has
moved forward from there

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.740
and the issue is far more pervasive

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.650
in the economy that
it was at the time.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.950
&gt;&gt; Mr. Kupferschmid:

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.550
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: So, just
to follow up on your example

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.250
of the microwave in the context
of what Jonathan just said,

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.580
I mean the Congress knew
microwaves had software back

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.100
when they passed the act.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.320
Microwave still have
software in them,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.190
not sure what in that
context is changed

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.060
and what's Congress understood
the issue, they knew the issue

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:28.020
and decided to limit
this carve-out to rental.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.720
And so I think until we have vary
sort of specific concrete examples

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.410
of problems I think it would
be in the stake to sort

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.460
of legislate in this arena.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.340
I'd also like to point out
in the context of the--

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.450
of 109 and we talked about licenses
as if they were a four letter word,

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.300
and as if the mere fact that
there is a license in place means

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.250
that you can't do X, Y and Z, that
you could do if you were an owner,

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:03.330 position:56%
and that simply isn't the case, and
maybe the case sometimes but I think

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.590
in the vast majority of examples or
at least I think we need to study

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.200
of all the different consumer
products that are out there

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.160
and that includes software
to figure out how many

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.470
of them actually do
restrict transfer.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:22.420 position:56%
And of those products that restrict
transfer, how many of them just sort

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.080
of condition transfer like
for into the allow use.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.140
A lot of software companies for
instance that allow the transfer

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.830 position:56%
of their software provided you let
them know who you're transferring it

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:37.430
to and so they know who
to give the updates to

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.910
or the bug fixe or what have you.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.920
And so I think what you'd see
as if you look at these licenses

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.170
that they are, numner1, not those
restrictions on things like,

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:53.310
you know, essential copies, not
those restrictions on transfers

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.030
that you think that people
think that might the other.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.980
And you might even find a lot
of provisions in those licenses

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.730
that provide benefits
that are not found

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:06.160
in the usual ownership
or contract agreement.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.030
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Mohr?

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.340
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: That's like--

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.970
&gt;&gt; Your mic.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:20.330
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Just I guess
a couple of points in light

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.670
of the discussion that's going on.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.380
The first thing is I
do see some overlap

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:33.830
between Professor Perzanowski
and I on the--

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.720
at least in so far as the
concept to relevance goes.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.200
When the-- when we get
to the concept of weight,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.560
I think we have probably
considerably different views.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:52.420
The second thing that struck me is
in discussing the drafting of 117,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.370
I-- like everybody else, I
don't know how it got there,

00:39:55.370 --> 00:40:00.040
I suspect Mr. Band
is probably right.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:06.380
And if he is right, then the
development of the licensing model

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.750
for software was part
of congressional design.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.880
This was not an oversight.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.510
And so, if we're doing that,
I mean again I'm-- this is--

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.430
the office is doing its job if
I'm coming back to the same point

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:24.420 position:56%
that I-- in the beginning we've been
thoroughly examining these issues,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.420
but again there's an enormous
record of success here,

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.700
and how that model has played
out for software providers.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.110
To that end, I guess
I feel obligated

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:41.930
to voice extreme skepticism about
the idea of any sort of preemption

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.080
of license terms that's
just not something

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:49.340
that serves this industry well
for the whole host of reasons.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.110
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So there are--
there is at least one case,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.400
maybe more that have actually
preempted license terms

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.700
in a couple of context?

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.510
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Oh,
there's more than one.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.810
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, so
I mean, what do think?

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.580
I mean what of the ill
effects of that-- of those?

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.040
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: If you're
saying-- there are certain cases.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.410
So under the-- there are--

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.110
well, there's a couple
different kinds of preemptions.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:17.450
There is statutory, right, and
then you have field and conflict.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.820
I'm assuming you're talking
about statutory preemption cases?

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.120
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.420
Thank you.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.720
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: OK.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.820
So the-- with respect to the
statutory preemption cases,

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.790
there is a dividing line that
we've historically not really had a

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:39.010
problem with between-- oh, I'm
trying to remember the exact words

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.390
but essentially it's a qualitative
test that the courts have applied.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.170
And there's a difference for
example between use restrictions

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.470
and copying restrictions.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.980
And if you have copying
restrictions and the court looks

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.850
at those particular cases of scants
and if you have use restrictions

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.980
and they don't, that's an
appropriate and workable line,

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:02.180 position:56%
that's a quite different matter from
a statue that preempts contracts

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.270
or specific type of contract
for a particular industry.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.600
It's very, very different.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.900
So we're OK.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.930
I mean, we're OK with existing law.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.500
We don't have a problem with
it, but when we're talking

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.400
about in this discussion
moving beyond that,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.590
that's where the hackle
starts to go up.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.890
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Zuck?

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.190
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Yes, thanks.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.290
Thanks again for allowing me
to be part of this conversation

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.520
and it's very interesting to find
the intersections between sort

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.860
of the practical implications
and some of these deep dives

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.470
into the legal discussions.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.450
And so taking a step back again,

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.290
I just want to reiterate
what Chris said,

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.400
which is that we have a system
that's already working in terms

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.340
of software licensing and in
terms of serving the needs

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.930 position:56%
of the majority of consumers, right?

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.430
In other words, most consumers
have a particular mode of operation

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:56.740
and don't have assumptions about
if I buy an app on my phone

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.420
that app will transfer with
the phone if I give the phone

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.260
to someone else for example.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.160
And so it ends up being
exception cases that I feel

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.920
like we're talking about a lot.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.890
And so when trying to address those
exception cases, I think it has

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.130
to be weight against the
success of the industry to date.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.840
And also some of the flexibility
and again the dynamism associated

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.200
with those licensing practices.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:24.700
So I mean, when I sell a piece
of software, a game or something

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.840
like that, that for 99 cents
I do it with the expectation

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.760
that you will probably tire
of that game eventually.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.190
So the point on which of tired
of that game is what I consider

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.670
to be the duration of the
life cycle of that game.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.830
It's not how long somebody--

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.310
indefinite number of
people could be interested

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.270
into that game into
the future, right?

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.700
I mean, it's so-- when I'm pricing
at 99 cents I'm sort of building

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.090
into that notion that well,
after six months you're going

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.460
to either stop playing
this or you're going

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.610
to buy new levels or
something like that.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.190
I'm not building into a 99% cost
the ability for an infinite number

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.510
of people to become bored with
that game, and so there's this--

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.470
there is some expectations and some
of this dynamic licensing models

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.730
that says that I understand
how users are going

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.070
to go about using it.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:13.960
And then, you know, again in
the context of embedded devices,

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.520
which is where we have the least
amount of information about this,

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.970
I think because there's a
least amount of licensing cases

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.930
that have been addressed
and situations but,

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.480
if I say just automatically
that if you buy a refrigerator,

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.410
you all know the software in the
refrigerator doesn't that mean

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.000
that I can carry that software into
another refrigerator for example

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.880
that I buy or does the lifetime

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.050
of the software die
with the refrigerator?

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.510
Well, if I own the software,
then why don't I have the ability

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.330
to transfer that to another
refrigerator that I want

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.070
to use instead but with this
software that I somehow own

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.010
as a result of purchasing
a refrigerator.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:49.310
So I can see a lot of--

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:50.610
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: That's not-- It's
not particularly realistic

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.910
for a consumer.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.050
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Well, no, it's--
well, not particularly realistic

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.390
for consumer but that's just it.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:58.900 position:56%
Most of these cases that we're
talking about aren't consumer cases.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.300
They're about very large industries
that are trying to commoditize

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.560
out on products, after
market et cetera.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.490
It's very seldom about a consumer
doing any of these things.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.200
So in that case I could
very much see a situation

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.990
where I could take advantage of
ownership law, provide some way

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.870
that here is my new refrigerator
that's half price and here's a way

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.680
to transfer the software
out of this, you know,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.280
refrigerator you own
before and you don't have

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.750
to buy another one or
something like that.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:27.800 position:56%
That could be done at a higher level
than just an individual consumer

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.630
and made pretty easy I guess.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:32.800
I mean, you know it's a weird
example of the refrigerator

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.670
because it such a big device

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.360 position:56%
but I mean it certainly could have
been the case with tvOS or something

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.990
like that, that where
a lot of that kind

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:42.720
of active hacking took place
even at a consumer level.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.160
So I'm going-- Again, the
ownership of the software,

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.850
I think has downstream
consequences that we aren't--

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.560
that haven't fully thought
through, that's all.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.350
Even in embedded devices.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.970
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Beckert?

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.520
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Thanks for
bringing that one up Mr. Zuck.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.880
So maybe we can put a more
realistic face on it when we talk

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.810
about exchanging software
on parts in automobiles.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.460
And so in this example where,
you know, somebody owns the copy

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.990
of the software on their automobile
and one of the parts malfunctions

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.930
but there's a piece of
software on that part, right?

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:19.220
And we'll imagine that it's
just a part that's not covered

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.710
by copyright so-- or covered
by patent, so it's just a screw

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.220
that has a piece of software
in it that communicates

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.980
with another screw just to say,
this is the correct approved screw

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.170
that contains, you
know, that's authorized

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.690
by the automobile manufacturer.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.460
Well, you know, if the
software is not there

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.530
and after market parts manufacturer
can come in and say I can make

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.900
that screw, we're going to put that
screw and you have several options.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:49.340 position:56%
But in the scenario where, you know,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.630
the owner of the automobile
does not own the software

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.050
and does not have the right to
transfer the copy of the software

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.950 position:56%
into the new screw, now they don't
have options for replacement screws,

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.200
they have to go to the
person who owns the copyright

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.920
and the software and the screw.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.080
And it's not, you know, you say,
maybe in the refrigerator market,

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.910 position:56%
you know, this is sort
unrealistic and it's impracticable--

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.490
impractical or think about this.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.190
But, you know, the after market
auto part industry is a $350

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.700
billion industry.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.090
I mean, this is something that
exists and that's changing because,

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.880
you know, of the prevalence
of software in these

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.230 position:56%
that is purely mechanistic in parts.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.200 position:56%
So I think it's a very real concern.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.250
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: And I think
that a lot of that is going

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:35.520
to get adjudicated over time
and we've seen already cases

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.830 position:56%
where pure interoperability has
fallen in favor of even replacement,

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.350
printer cartridges and
things like that that--

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:48.040
so I think the systems that are in
place are addressing those issues.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.900
I'm-- Let me think of
another example that cameras,

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.200
right, I'm a photographer.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.620
If I buy the Canon 5D Mark II, it
has a certain amount of firmware

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.440
on it that provides a
certain functionality.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.170
There's other cameras
that they sell--

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.780
the only difference of them is
in fact the firmware, right?

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.540 position:56%
And that it is probably additional
functionality provided to the owners

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.530 position:56%
of those cameras and the difference
between them is in fact the software

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:16.100
and not the hardware because it's
simply easier to fully implement it

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.390
and to provide different
firmware than it is

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.480
to have different manufacturing
practices.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.190
So if I own the firmware associated
with the more expensive camera,

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.080
can I then later upgrade
to a cheaper camera

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.490
and install the firmware
from the previous one.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.070
I would consider that to be a
bad, you know, potential and

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.410
yet firmware is something
that's completely transferable

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.540
and is done by users today, right?

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.180
So it's not unimaginable, right?

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.560
And so, I mean, I'm just-- if we're
having a theoretical discussion

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.860
about it.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.810
I can come up with as many
theories why I don't want

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.520
that transferability as you
can come up with the due.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.990
I guess my understanding of what
has happened historically though is

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.430
that the things in
which we would all kind

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.490
of agree would be a good
idea, the courts have ended

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:59.790
up ruling in that direction.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:03.610
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Bergmayer?

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: All the examples
you're bringing up are not transfers

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.040
of material items, they're
all about making new copies,

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.550
they're all about making
adaptations,

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.970
they're all about things
that really don't relate

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.820
to whether or not you own the copy.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:20.190
Owning a copy of a 99 cents
software app would only mean

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.240
that you could transfer your
phone, your physical phone,

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.420
it doesn't give you the magical
right to make an infinite number

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.790
of new copies to anyone
else who wants one.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:30.200
If I own a refrigerator that
doesn't give me the right

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.300
to transfer the software because
it would give me the right

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.080
to move the chips from one
refrigerator to another, sure,

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.630
but not to make a new copy and
the same thing with the firmware.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.680
So I think there's just a failure
to distinguish between ownership

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:47.200
of a copy which is a material
thing and then the implication

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.490
of actual copyright rights under--

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.960
such as reproduction or derivative
works, and if those are allowed,

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.870
those would be allowed under fair
use, or maybe they are allowed

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.710
under some other doctrine
but whether

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.370
or not you own the copy
really has no bearing.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.670
Owning the copy doesn't means

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.650
that you own the physical
thing and that's it.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.270
And it means that you can move that
physical thing around and resell

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:13.250
that physical thing it's not about
giving you IP rights of any sort.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:18.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: On the flip side
of that though if I license software

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.670
for example, and I-- and
again, this is an embedded

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.900
but I would use the examples
that I'm drawing from.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.000
I have the ability to install
it on to new device for example.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.820
So if I'm only confined to my
ownership of the copy that exist

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.770
on a single device and I then
sell that device and get a new,

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:37.460
the iPhone or something like
that, that would suggest

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.710
that I don't then have a
right to bring a new copy

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.320
of software unto that device.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.650
You can't have your
cake and eat it too.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.190
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: If I buy
software-- if I buy physical--

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.940
if I buy optical media then I'm
given an essential step copy--

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.240
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: You're
not of a topical.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.280
You're downloading it from
a store to your phone.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.580
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yes.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.880
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: So, you're saying

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.180
that that's the things
that you want to own?

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.480
OK, I'm--

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.780
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer:
Yes, I own my phone.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.080
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: OK, so--

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.380
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: I already
owned my phone and I own it

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.680
after installing software.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.980
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: But you
want to own that software.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.280
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yes.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.580
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: That
you've downloaded.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.880
OK that's fine then when you get a
new phone then you have to pay me

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.180
to get the software
again for the new phone,

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.480
that's what you're suggesting.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.780
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: There are
markets that work that way

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.080
and there are markets that don't.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.380
I mean there are markets that
give you unlimited redownloads

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.680
on to new physical
devices that you own--

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.980
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: And that's
because it's a license.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.280
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Right.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.580
So what I bought then
is I bought the right

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.880
to make new reproductions--

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: You don't-- you
bought nothing, that's the point.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.440
You've-- yes, you've bought
a license of the software--

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.740
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer:
But I own the phone.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.040
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: -- so that
regardless sometimes you can use it

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.350
on three different
devices for example.

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.510
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: If I own my
phone, I own a copy of the software

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:35.170
that is installed on that
phone because a copy is defined

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.380
in the statute as a material item.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.980
There is no other category.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.120
There is no ethereal copy
like right to own a copy,

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.420
right to make a new copy.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.940
I can license IP rights or
I can own a physical item

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.540
and there is just a continual
failure to make that distinction

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.940
which is vital and specifically
the embedded software contexts

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.500
that we're here to discussion

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.390 position:56%
because it's specifically implicates
the ability to transfer devices

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.690
with software that is embedded in
them from one person to another.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:08.170
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: I guess
it hasn't been a problem--

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.060
that much problem doing
those transfers of devices

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.880 position:56%
that happen but its software though.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.180
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
I think we would say

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.330
that in the automotive industry
there have been those issues.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.690
So we see that all the time.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:18.990
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: You're talking

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:20.290
about the placement parts
though, it's a different--

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.590
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
Right but that--

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:22.890
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: --
issue than transferring.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.190
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
But there are part--

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.510
so this gets to what John
was saying earlier about how

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.750
when you own the automobile, you
know, are we going to distinguish

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.500
between whether you own certain
parts and don't own other?

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.370
What we're saying is when you're
replacing a part the, you know,

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:41.020
there are restrictions that are not
allowing you to transfer the chip

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.200
that contains the software to the
other because you can't access it

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.540
and you can't get it to
reboot on the other--

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.010
on the replacement device.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.410
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Is it about
you transferring your chip

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.770
or building your own chip and yeah
the new screw that you're trying

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.370
to provide when you function
it and try to provide,

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.410 position:56%
is it really about making a physical
transfer of a chip from one screw

00:52:58.410 --> 00:52:59.850
to another that you're trying to--

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:01.150
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
It's both issues.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:02.450
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: -- accomplish?

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.750
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
It's both issues.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.050
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer:
To me, I'll just say,

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.480
I'm actually adopting what I think
is a pretty narrow view of 109

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:12.780 position:56%
because I am specifically not saying
that this is about digital for sale

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:16.070
which is some right which
people have proposed--

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.690
yeah, to make new copies.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:22.270
This is about transferring a
material item from one owner

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:23.570
to another and that's it.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:26.260
There are other issues that
are related to digital for sale

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.300 position:56%
that we can discuss but specifically
when it comes to section 109

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.050
and the ownership of a
copy, it is only about the--

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:34.960
the ownership of a material item.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.040
It is not about IP
rights and it is not

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.890
about anything sort
of broader than that.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:44.810 position:56%
And I think it is simply misleading
to suggest that saying that the fact

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:49.550
that someone owns a copy gives
them intellectual property rights

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:56.190
which would be a license that
they otherwise don't have.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:57.490
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: OK.

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:00.520
I wanted to hit one other
topic before we close out,

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.550
and that's open source software
which is often accompanied

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:08.620
by conditions on the free transfer
and reproduction of such software

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.060
such as requiring the disclosure
of any software medications

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.860
or the downstream licensing
of such software.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.970
And the question I'd like to
put out is YODA or an amendment

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:23.750
like YODA affect the development
and use of open source software?

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.150
Chris?

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:28.230
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.670
&gt;&gt; Mic again.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.560
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: So this
question came up before

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.880
and the answer to that
question is yes.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.480
And the reason is because
an owner of a copy

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.390 position:56%
if I make a modification suppose
it's a fair use I have no obligation

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.690
whatsoever to share that.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:46.140
I may in fact sell fair
uses of a particular works

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.560
without permission,
that's the point, right?

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.120
So under that type of
model that's undercuts.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:55:00.770
That type of model rather undercuts
the incentives for communities

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.260
to develop around open source
and the sharing that goes

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.830
on in those communities to quickly
fix bugs and so on and so forth.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:11.480
It's a very different way
of distributing software

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.260
and the current model
allows people to choose.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.100
If they think that they
are going to do better

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.980
under an open source model,
they are free to do so

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.720 position:56%
and to adopt any number of different
licenses whether it's the GPL

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.370
or another one, but.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.750
And if they want to do a
close ecosystem in the way

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.630
that Apple does they
can do that too.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:29.930
That's fine.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.790
And it seems to have
worked pretty well.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:39.240
The only way it doesn't work
I guess is if you are adopting

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:46.240
and I mean I don't know what more
I can say about differing ways

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.300
of construing the statute based
of the ownership and copy other

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:56.690
than if you don't-- other than
to really say, I don't agree.

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:59.920
I'm having trouble finding
a court case that agrees.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.290 position:56%
And there are lots of people who
have invested lots of time and money

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:08.520 position:56%
and effort on particular
constructions of that very provision

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.430
that has been shown to
be an enormous success.

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:13.910
I think it would be unwise

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.780
to disrupt those expectations
or that performance.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.690
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Band?

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:23.660
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Yeah, I
don't see YODA or something

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.480
like that having any impact at
all on open source software.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.770
As we heard before, you know,

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:35.790
the open source licenses are
affecting the rights attaching

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:42.760
to the software but not the copy
of the software because it's--

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:48.960
and so, you know, the open source
license allows the second user

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:54.630 position:56%
to make copies or to make derivative
works, those are concluded different

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:56.670
from what we're talking
about in YODA which is purely

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:02.460
about can the first person sell
the product to the second person?

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:07.220
And it doesn't-- and it
would no way limit what's--

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:11.380
how the open source
model would work.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:19.360
But also just getting back to the
previous colloquy about, you know,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.400
let's say firmware
that is transferred

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.410
from one device to a newer device.

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:29.610
I mean, you see that all the
time with refurbished products.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:33.440
And, you know, we think
that, that secondary market

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.370
for refurbished products is--
I mean that's a good thing.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:42.580
It's positive for consumers
because, you know, you have--

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.130
consumers are able to buy
a product at a lower cost

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:50.030
than they would have been able to
buy a new or unrefurbished product.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:55.620
And it's, you know, environmentally
good to recycle products.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:58:00.890
And, you know, so yes it
means it conceivably means

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:04.300
that you'll have a manufacturer
who would have to compete

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.720
with a refurbished
product but, you know,

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.540
we think that competition is
good basically that in copyright

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:18.560
and other statutory monopolies are
the exception to the general rule

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.700
in our economy that we want
to promote competition.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.410
And so, having refurbished
product is a good thing

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:28.510
and we should encourage
it as much as possible.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.150
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mr. Perzanowski?

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:33.910
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: So
I want to go back to--

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:40.670
to go back a few minutes to a point
that was made about the possibility

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:46.900
that at least some license
agreements grant consumers' certain

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.000
rights that might otherwise be

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.450
within their control
as owners of copies.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.270
There are circumstances, right,

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:02.900
where a license does
provide something a keen

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.880
to the rights under
109 or 117, right?

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.840
That happens out in
the world sometimes.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.380
And, you know, I think that's--

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:19.150
those kinds of flexible
licenses are a welcome addition

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.420
to what we see out
there in the market.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:29.210
You know, so Amazon for example
has a sort of simulation of lending

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.660
that works on the Kindle.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:35.470
So publishers can opt in for
some books to allow consumers

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:40.400
to lend an ebook one time
for a period of two weeks

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.840
and then never again, right?

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.940
And so there are I think two
important limitations to keep

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.970
in mind and I think
demonstrate why those kinds

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:53.500
of licensed secondary markets
are a pretty poor substitute

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.800
for the real thing.

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.830 position:56%
One is they are incomplete, right,
Amazon system for example is opt in.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:04.930
Not all platforms do this certainly
not all publishers participate,

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:10.520
so you get this sort of spotty
set of rights for consumers.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.140 position:56%
And the other I think more important
big picture thing is there's a big

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.370
difference between granted
permission to engage in a behavior

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.590
and having a right to engage
in that behavior, right?

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.350
Property is not having
to ask for permission

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.230
and that's why we care
about ownership.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:30.320
And there are some really
important things that flow

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.180
from unregulated property
interest, right,

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.480
unregulated secondary markets.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:40.470
We might think that those uses
are most variable precisely

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.920
where permission is not
going to be granted, right?

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.650
So, you know, you mentioned that,
you know, sometimes they say,

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.670
look yeah, you can sell your
software but like, you know,

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.710
write down who you're selling it
to and keep track of that transfer.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.100
Well, you know, one of
the great things that come

01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:00.280
from unregulated unlicensed
secondary markets is privacy.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.540 position:56%
No one keeps track of who owns what.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.770
No ones keeps track of what books
you're reading, no one keeps track

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.070
of what software you're using

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.700
and I think consumers
see that as a benefit.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.130
And you can think about user
innovation or, you know,

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:18.390
potentially competitive
uses that or, you know,

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:21.530
competitive resale markets
where it's really unlikely

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.190
that anybody is going to
give permission for someone

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:28.310
to take their product and build
on it and do something new

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:34.360
and interesting within where you
might not see permission to sell

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.960
or use product at a lower price
that competes with the new product.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.690 position:56%
But that's precisely what a property
interest allows owners to do.

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:48.220
So, those things do exist but
they are not a perfect substitute

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.440
for actual ownership by purchasers.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.800
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Chris-- Mr.
Mohr would you have one more--

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.100
one final thought?

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.400
Or Mr. Harbeson?

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.700
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: No.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.790
In fact, I forgot to-- no.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.710
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Mister--
sorry, go ahead.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.010
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: It's
kind of ridiculous.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.480
I'm glad I'm not going to be
the final word because it--

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.880
that'll be kind of silly, but.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.680
I promise that I would shut up
and I did not sign a contract

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.090
to that effect so you're
stuck with one more of word.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:25.650
I want to just go back to a couple
of things that were said earlier.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.510
We-- There's been a lot of
talk or some talk anyway

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:33.680
about unintended consequences
of change in the law.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.560 position:56%
The Music Library Association is
here precisely because we're worried

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.370
about unintended consequences of
looking at something too narrowly

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:45.690
and having that to have
broader consequences.

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:57.790
So, just to be clear unless what
is recommended is something--

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:03.770
narrow to the extent of only
affecting 109C for example

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:08.310
and the way again that
legislation works,

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:12.000
I think that's unlikely
making a change

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.730
in this small field will
have larger ripple effects.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:22.070
So please I implore the office
to consider the wider impact

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.410
of what they're recommending.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:28.910
The other thing I want to address
is the question of preemption

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:33.840
of contracts and the reason I want
to do that is because we are--

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:38.640
we do propose a form of
that but I want to be clear

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.250
that we do not support for example
what was done in the United Kingdom

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:47.080
which renders certain
contracts unenforceable

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.780
if they contradict limitations
and exceptions in their law.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.730
That would cause enormous
problems for us in negotiations

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:59.620
of gift agreements into like the--

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:06.810
what we are requesting is a
much narrower form of preemption

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:10.690
and I would like to just
underline that proposal.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.220
It's in our initial
comments and so I just would

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.320
like to point towards that.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: And Mr.
Kupferschmid, you get the last word.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:19.270
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: OK.

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:22.460
So just to point out on a sort
of inconsistency with what

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.520
at least what I'm hearing from,
say the other side of the table.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.580
We hear that consumers
have a right to privacy.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.150
I understand that.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.450
I get that.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:40.430
We're also hearing that, you know,
they should have a right to updates

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:45.260
and bug fixes and customer support
as would be on the YODA bill.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.950
You can't have it both ways.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:50.430
I mean, there's no way for the
software company to know who am I,

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:55.100
know that the software has
been transferred and to know

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.540
who to provide these updates and
bug fixes and customer support

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.980
to if the individual wishes to
be remain anonymous or something

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.280
in terms of who you sell to.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.010 position:56%
So there's an internal inconsistency
there that is, you know,

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:16.390
that is problematic and I think
from a consumer protection or from,

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:20.660
you know, sort of satisfying
their customer base,

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.930
I think it makes a lot of sense
for these software companies

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.620
to includes a provision in there
that says, yes you can transfer.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.300
We're giving you-- That's
what you want to do,

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.470
yes you can transfer the software
but under these circumstances

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.550
which is we need to know who you're
transferring it to so we know

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.590
who to deliver the consumer support
to the upgrades, the bug fixes.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:39.700
I think that's completely
reasonable.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.400
And to the extent we're
hearing otherwise,

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.060
it's sort of putting the software
companies in a no win situation.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:51.420
And I guess that's the last word.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.360
&gt;&gt; Eric Bertin: Thank you
to the members of our panel.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.740
This concludes our roundtable on
software-enabled consumer products.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.880
Oh, excuse me I'm being
corrected on that.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So we have a microphone
setup free standing microphone.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:11.370
We wanted to have sort of a
period of time for observers

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:14.460 position:56%
and the audience to offer any
thoughts or comments they might have

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:19.900 position:56%
so there's a mic stand that's making
its way to the front of the room.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.830
So if anyone-- if anyone
is interested, go ahead,

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.280
where there's a microphone there.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.990
Mr. Tepp?

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:31.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Thanks-- is this on?

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:35.780
Is it on? Now there we go.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: All right.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.630
Just a couple of remarks
in regard to the harm

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:44.940
from the proposed contract
preemption concept.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.630
I'd like to point out that commonly

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:50.370
in the business-to-business
context licenses are the result

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:54.700
of face-to-face arm length
negotiations and the preemption

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.510
of those contracts introduces
unnecessary uncertainty

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.130
into the market place
and is inconsistent

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.310
with the basic free market approach

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.540
of the US Copyright System
dating all the way back

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.640
to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.210
In any event, what
this issue really boils

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:15.940
down to is preempting contract
terms that some people don't

01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.860
like not withstanding the fact that
they're enforceable contract terms.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.400
So it's about government
banning certain business models

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.170
which will actually have
the predictable effect

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:28.820
of increasing prices

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.970
because software companies
have fewer options and how

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:37.960
to tailor a license to particular
uses and they're be forced

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:43.360
to offer higher level,
higher price licenses.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.610
And the case for government
control in place

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:50.800
of free market approach
simply hasn't been made.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.480
The evidence is scant at best
particularly on the context

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:01.900
of software industry which
is as dynamic as competitive

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.290
and as innovative as any
industry in the Untied States.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:11.100
Thank you.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.260
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Any other
thoughts from the audience?

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.830
OK. Well, thank you that was the--

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.940
now that's the end of
the first roundtable

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.400
on software-enabled
consumer products

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.950
and next week in San Francisco.

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.580
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:30.020
of Congress, visit at loc.gov.
