00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.036 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Super Bowl of course
coming up this week, Anthony.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.804 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Who cares?
- But first headline.

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.306
- Who cares about
the Super Bowl?

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.875
- Is from the Real Bowl,
it's called the Pro Bowl.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.076 align:start size:97% position:3%
It went down.
- The only bowl I care about

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.046
I eat my cereal with my hands,

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.647
'cause the only
bowl I care about

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.282
(laughter)

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.217
is the Pro Bowl.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.387
I just throw dog
food on the floor.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.023
(laughter)

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause I'm all
about the Pro Bowl.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Lot of the football
world this week.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.495
- I don't own a toilet.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.997
(female laughter)

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.166
- Just shits on the ground.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.467 align:start size:81% position:19%
In the corner.
- There's only one

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.404
bowl I care about and
it's the Pro Bowl.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's what the NFL season
is geared towards,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.874
it's what it's all about.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.410 align:start size:84% position:16%
Everything is just
all about the Pro Bowl

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.845
and you know what, that
wasn't always the case.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.782 align:start size:94% position:6%
Back when it was in Hawaii
after the Super Bowl,

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.083
it wasn't that big of deal,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.320
now that it's in between
the end of the playoffs

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.856
and the Super Bowl
and it's in Orlando,

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.594
the best of America,
now it's number one.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.363
- There is some
concern this week

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.599
that the Pro Bowl
was so exciting,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.568
people are really not going
to be into the Super Bowl

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.769 align:start size:81% position:19%
anymore.
- It was, it was.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.405 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, everyone talking
about the one play.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know and we're
not gonna get into it.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.209
We're not gonna get
into the xs and os

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.978 align:start size:88% position:13%
but it was a
beautifully coached game

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the players
showed a real passion.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.683
I think that's what people
are gonna be talking about,

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.686 align:start size:94% position:6%
even during the Super
Bowl, is how much passion.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.457
I mean, those guys left it
all out there on the field.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.925
- All on the field.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.760 align:start size:97% position:3%
You often talk about oooh
there's not as much pass rush

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.862
in the Pro Bowl,
not this Pro Bowl.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.363
- Oh my God, this Pro Bowl.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:41.167
It was almost like the
offense was pass rushing.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.001
Do you know what I mean?

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.438
They were so into it

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.274
and just the stats,
I mean, unbelievable.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:53.246 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was like, the thing
about the NBA All Star Game,

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:55.982
how much fun that is and
how much offense there is

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.951
and then you think like
the NHL All Star Game.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.486 align:start size:81% position:19%
Imagine if the
basketball players

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.154
had to put on ice skates.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.822
That's what this
Pro Bowl was like.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.959 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And what a tough week
really for Stephen A. Smith

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
who's famous for
being a Cowboys hater

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.331
and Jason Garrett,
especially is a guy,

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.667 align:start size:97% position:3%
the coach of the Cowboys
that he picks on quite a bit.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.736
After watching what
Jason Garrett did

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.906
on Sunday night in
Orlando, case closed.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.908
- Jason Garrett saved his job,

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.512
probably saved a lot of
jobs during that Pro Bowl

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.915 align:start size:97% position:3%
and, you know, I don't have
the final score in front of me

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.884
but it was amazing.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.453
(laughter)

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:37.123 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just love the Pro
Bowl more than anything.

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:41.027 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wish they could
play it twice a year.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.663 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the skills competition,
are you kiddin' me?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.832
All those skills,
every one of them.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.600
There wasn't a single
skill that I was like

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.871 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's more luck or a
gift, it was all skills.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.406 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What throws.
- What throws what catches.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.108
- What catches.
- Oh my god.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.778
- Some diving plays.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.648
- They really put the pro
in Pro Bowl this year.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:06.653
- John Coughlin was a two time
United States pairs champion

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.791
in figure skating, Anthony,
died by suicide last week

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.994
in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:19.999 align:start size:97% position:3%
He had recently been suspended
from U.S. figure skating.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.202
He was 33 years old.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.369
- So this had nothing to do with

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.004 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Kansas City losing
to the Patriots,

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.007
this was just, do
you know why he?

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.777 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It happened shortly
thereafter, yes.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.046
- And what was he suspended for?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Officially there's
not a reason,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.085
but there has been
some reporting that

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.821
there were sexual
assault allegations

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.523
that he was suffering from.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:48.361 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yes, I love, listen suicide
is an important topic,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.863
a very serious topic, but
when someone's just like

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:55.168
"I screwed up so bad that
I'm pulling the plug."

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.169
I think it's great.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.538
I always think you're just like

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.673
I don't wanna go
through a trial,

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.908
you know what I mean?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:05.511
I don't wanna have to
explain this to my mom.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.779
I'm just gonna go.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.449
I always think that's great.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.084
'Cause at first it was
like, "Oh what happened?

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.518
This is some horrible tragedy."

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.722 align:start size:94% position:6%
This guy was like a
champion and worked with,

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.390
you know, trained people.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.692
I'm sure kids were
involved in some way

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
but you're just like
"Oh, you guys want me to

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.497
get punished for this?

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.200
You know what, I
got plans of my own

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.736
and I'm just gonna
see you all later.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.504
See you on the other side."

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.173
I find that delightful.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.075 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was wondering
where you could find

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.344 align:start size:84% position:16%
the lightness in
this story going in,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I do find myself
laughing at your ridiculous

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.216 align:start size:81% position:19%
statements.
- Like I believe,

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.952 align:start size:97% position:3%
when people are like, "Oh this
person's a child molester,

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.021 align:start size:84% position:16%
why didn't they just
kill themselves?"

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.824 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like, yeah, I understand
that, I agree with that.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.826
But when you kill
yourself afterwards

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:57.664
it's just kinda like "I'm
not gonna let you guys win.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:00.066 align:start size:94% position:6%
Yeah, I sexually
assaulted all these people

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:04.871
and I'm not gonna face any
punishment for it, I'm out.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.906
I didn't even like
ice skating anyway."

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.343
- Let's move on to
a lighter subject.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:16.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
Let's talk about a nurse
in the Phoenix area

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.452
who was arrested this week after

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:24.457
it was found out he raped
and impregnated a woman

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.559
in a vegetative state.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.094
- Yep, a couple weeks
ago you probably heard

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.797
about the story, there
was a woman in a coma

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.166
and she got Kill Bill'd.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.869
She was in a coma and all
of a sudden she's pregnant

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:40.606
and they're like "Oh,
uh, we're in trouble.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.743
The hospital is in
trouble, we're gonna

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.211
get to the bottom of this."

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.713
And you knew they were
gonna solve it right away

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:51.084
because all you do, is you
look for the happiest nurse.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.618
(laughter)

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's only so many people
going in and out of that room,

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.790
which one's the happiest?

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.225
He did it.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.829 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm surprised this guy
didn't pull a figure skater

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.165
and just be like,
"I'm not gonna.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.967
I don't wanna have to
answer these questions.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't have to look someone
in the eye over this."

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.405
But I'm glad they did get him.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
Although, like, okay.
- It was at one

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:18.411
of those facilities, like
an assisted care facility.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.446
- Sure, you're in a coma,

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.682 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm a big fan of like, if
I'm in a coma, pull the plug,

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.083
I don't wanna live like this.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.052 align:start size:97% position:3%
Even if they're like, there's
some rough possibility

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.187 align:start size:84% position:16%
in 20 years they'll
figure it out.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.623
If I'm asleep for
more than 24 hours,

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.091
I'm out, you know what I mean?

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.292
- Who's in charge right now?

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.027 align:start size:81% position:19%
Do you have it
written down that?

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.329
- I do not have a living will,

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.898
I've just told enough
people that I hope

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.334
that they would be like,
"He wouldn't want this."

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.803
But when I do do a
will, I will say,

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.072
you know, pull the
plug immediately.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.540 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Get on that.
- Yeah.

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:52.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
But if I was in a
coma, you know what,

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.114
do what you want.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.817
(laughter)

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.085
You know what I mean,

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.888
maybe, I'm not gonna say
that it's a good thing,

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:05.324
but I'm not worried about it.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:10.263
It's like necrophilia.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.199
Who's the victim, you know?

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well maybe the
families of the body.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:19.505
- If you see it, yeah, sure,

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.475
otherwise, you have no idea.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
But necrophilia's
better than having sex

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.482
with someone in a coma.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like in what way?
- Because the

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.053
one person's dead and
one person is alive.

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:37.323
But, uh.
- What?

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.261 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's less of a victim thing,
do you know what I mean?

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.597
So you guys are telling
me if you were in a coma.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:46.966 align:start size:88% position:13%
Maybe I'll do this,
I'll have a living will,

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.969 align:start size:88% position:13%
but if I am just in a
coma for a little while,

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.939
do what you want to me.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.241 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's part of the will.
- Or would you guys

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.809
be like, "Don't touch me."

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.345 align:start size:75% position:25%
- I mean.
- Would you let

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.047
someone have sex with you
if you were in a coma.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.849
- Probably not, I
mean I'd hope not.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:06.319
That woman's impregnated now.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.153
- Yeah, that's true.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.088
I mean, that's a bummer.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.157 align:start size:94% position:6%
- If you're gonna have sex
with someone in a coma,

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.558
use protection.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's a bummer for that.
- It finally occurs

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.328
saying "Well, that's
true, that's a bummer."

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.562
- Yeah, I didn't
think about the kid

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.997
who comes out of it.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just assumed the pregnancy
wouldn't go that far.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.401
- No, she just had the baby.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.469
- She just had the baby?

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:25.338
- Is she still in a coma?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.173
- Yeah.
- What?

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.810
- I just like that when
- The baby's doing well.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.744
- When they saw the bump

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.146
they were just like, "Oh, jeez.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:38.284
Oh we're getting a talking to.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.921
There's gonna be a meeting
at corporate over this."

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.789
You can't do it, nurses.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is why male
nurses get a bad rap.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
'Cause whenever a nurse
kills a bunch of patients,

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.530
it's always a female nurse

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.699 align:start size:97% position:3%
but whenever a nurse
knocks up someone in a coma

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:54.534
it's always a dude.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.535
Why is that?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.604
(intense rock music)
