00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:02.131
- [Instructor] The
parallelogram shown below

00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:06.364
has an area of 24 unit
squares, square units.

00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:08.642
Find the missing height.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.996
Here's the parallelogram.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.029
This side has length six.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.230
This side has length five.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.345
We want to find the missing height

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.416
and they gave us the area.

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:21.529
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.529
on your own.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.661
The key to solving this is to realize

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:31.140
how the area relates
to a base and a height.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.252
An area of a parallelogram,

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:35.728
area of a parallelogram
is going to be equal

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:38.145
to the base times the height.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.850
Now what's the base in this scenario?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.114
You could do this length
right over here as the base.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:51.610
Which is also going to be
the same as that length.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.721
In a parallelogram opposite
sides have the same length.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.390
The parallel sides have the same length.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.261
So this is going to be six.

00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.700
Our base is going to be six.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.103
Our height is what we want to figure out.

00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:07.156
I will just write this as the h

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:09.027
that we're trying to figure out.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.327
We know the area.

00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:12.660
The area is 24 square units.

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:15.000
There we go.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.250
We have 24 is equal to six.

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.858
Is equal to six times the height.

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:27.432
Six times what is equal to 24?

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:31.902
Six times four is equal to 24.

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:37.421
We know that h is going
to be equal to four units.

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:39.588
H is equal to four units.
