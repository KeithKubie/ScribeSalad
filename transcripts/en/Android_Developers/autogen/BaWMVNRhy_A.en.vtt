 Hi, I'm "Ian Lake" 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.770
 I strongly believe that adding features with AppCompat 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
 It is what moves your application from good to wonderful. 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.190
 AppCompat uses the portal style in Lollipop 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 You can advertise a range of colors in your theme 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.300
 Which automatically changes the number of elements in your user interface. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.480
 There are three main colors - colorPrimary and colorPrimaryDark 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 And colorAccent. 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.390
 colorPrimary is where the beginning, and acts as a color marker 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 Master in all your application. 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500
 If you are using a standard AppCompat theme, 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.430
 You will find the application bar uses colorPrimary in its basic settings. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.410
 If you are using a toolbar, adjust the color 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.090
 Using the colorPrimary background property. 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.580
 colorPrimaryDark can be used only in hardware 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.300
 Running Android 5.0 or higher, for background color services 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.590
 For the status bar, it must as the name implies 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.340
 The shadow is darker than your primary color. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.320
 colorAccent slightly different, 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.670
 It affects a large number of elements 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.240
 In your application. 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
 You will notice this in the EditText focus, the bottom line and the cursor. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 CheckBoxes, as well as background color, 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 Button and floating procedure. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.590
 The differences between each of your primary colors are very important 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 The background colors remain so clear. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 There are a few other colors less commonly used, 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 But it can be really helpful. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.260
 ColorControlNormal adjusts the natural state of the components, 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.780
 Such as EditText not selected. 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.650
 ColorControlActivated colorAccent is disabled as in the case of items 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.510
 Active or selected such as CheckBoxes. 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.110
 And colorControlHighlight which adjusts the multiplier coloring. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.900
 Too many customizations are available without touching 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.940
 Any of the individual components. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.280
 But the addition of these powerful features is not limited only 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.570
 On the whole activity. 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890
 You can also apply the theme to any scene in your application used 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.710
 Android: theme, which allows you to change 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.010
 This scene and his sons only. 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.910
 To make this easy, there is the ThemeOverlay principle. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.350
 ThemeOverlay is not like the full thread, 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.880
 Just seek to change the few things they need, 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.330
 This will be appropriate to change the elements 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.970
 In a normally light theme to display in a dark background, 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 Assume that the application bar has a bold primary color, 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.090
 While building a custom theme color, 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.310
 Make sure your theme is ThemeOverlay.AppCompat. 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.810
 This confirms that elements like colorAccent 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.550
 Works correctly on both Lollipop and Lollipop devices 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.600
 Topics and ThemeOverlays can be a powerful way 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 To change the shape of your application, whether in activity or on a level 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.460
 watching. 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.200
 Another tool to help you build better apps. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.150
