00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.690
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.020
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hi everyone.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.070
I am Betsy Peterson the director

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.200
of the American Folk
Life Center.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.850
And, on behalf of the
staff and everyone here

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.360
at the library I want
to welcome you all today

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.820
to the latest presentation

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.250
in the Benjamin Botkin
Lecture Series.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.540
The series is an opportunity
for the American Folklife Center

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.390
to present the very best
scholarship in folklore,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.900
ethnomusicology, oral history,
and cultural heritage studies.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.290
And, today is no different.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.470
Each lecture is also video
taped, I should say right now,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.660
and I'm trying not to
rustle my papers, but,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.080
we'll see how that goes.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.250
At any rate, everything is
video taped and will become part

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.120
of the lectures at the
American Folklife Center.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.520
So, with that said, if you do
have a phone turned on right now

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.290
or any other electronic
device, please, there you go,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.870
please turn it off now.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.020
Today's lecture is
a two for, we are,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770
we have two distinguished
guests with us today.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.070
We're going to speaking

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.820
about their recent
completed publication,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.660
the award winning
Picturing America,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.930
Portraits of National
Heritage, no,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.620
Portraits of National Endowment
for the Arts Folk Masters.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.170
But first, let me
tell you a little bit

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.300
about the two gentlemen who
are the authors of this book.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920
Tom Pich is a native New Yorker
and a professional photographer.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.930
And, over the past 25 years,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.960
in addition to his
commercial photography work,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.640
he has traveled across the
United States photographing

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.900
hundreds of National
Heritage Fellows

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.370
for the National
Endowment for the Arts

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.280
and documenting traditional
artists also

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.440
for the Smithsonian
Center for Folklife in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.170
And Cultural Heritage.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.830
His portraiture of National
Heritage Fellows is featured

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.770
on the NEA website and has been
exhibited at the Lincoln Center

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.950
on the Performing Arts in New
York and the Kennedy Center

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.190
for the Performing Arts here
in Washington DC as well

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.580
as the National Museum
of the American Indian

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.600
and in the Russel
Senate Office Building.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.130
As you know, the National
Heritage Fellowship Award is the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.010
highest honor, in the United
States, that can be bestowed

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.600
on traditional artists.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.490
So, when Tom started thinking
about publishing his work,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.080
it was a natural choice to turn
to Barry Bergey, a well known

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.520
and respected folklorist.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.060
Barry Bergey is also the
former Director of the Folk

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.420
and Traditional Arts Program

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.890
at the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.090
And, during his 29
year tenure at NEA,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.360
he oversaw grant
making programs.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.310
Helped shape cultural
policy served as manager

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.210
of the National Heritage
Fellowship Programs

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.110
and provided counsel to the
U.S. Department of State

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.670
on international
cultural policy issues.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.080
Prior to joining the
NEA, Barry serves

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.390
as the State Folk Arts
Coordinator for his home state

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.910
of Missouri where he
first gained renown

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.590
for documenting traditional
musicians in Missouri

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.740
and in the Arkansas Ozarks.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.510
In the course of his
distinguished career,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.390
Barry has served as a field
working, festival organizer,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.550
radio producer, curator,
and arts administrator

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.840
and chief bottle washer and
a little bit of everything.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.980
Among other accomplishments,
in 2005, Barry was a member

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.080
of the U.S. Delegation
to UNESCO involved

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.180
in drafting the Composed
Convention on the Diversity

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.860
of Cultural Expressions.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.460
And, in 2014, he served as
one of three U.S. delegates

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.960
at the Biannual Organization
of American States,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.920
not good to throw
these acronyms around,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.890
at the Biannual Organization
of American States Meeting

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.490
of Member Cultural
Ministers in Haiti.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.280
Today, they're going
to talk about the book.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.730
And also, after our lecture
and discussion today,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.110
they will be doing a book
signing in the foyer.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190
So please, if you haven't picked
up a copy already, please do.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.400
And, I'm sure, they would
love to talk with all of you.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.510
So, I will just turn it over
to Barry and Tom and tank you.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.080
[ Applause ]

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.380
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Thanks Betsy.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.510
I'm suddenly feeling tired
after hearing all that.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.200
I don't know what happened.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.940
But, we're happy
to be here today.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.220
Thanks so much for coming out.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.590
You know, this project started
out as an idea for an exhibit.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.410
And, I thought that'd be easy

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.320
because Tom's already
taken the photographs.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.640
And then, somewhere along
the line it became a book

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.260
which meant I had
to do some writing

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.660
which was a little more
work than I expected.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.960
But, I thought, at first,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.260
I should tell you
just a little bit

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.540
about the National
Heritage Fellowships.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.410
As Betsy said, it's the highest
form of recognition of folk

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.160
and traditional artists
in the United States.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.600
It was started in 1982
by Bess Lomax Hawes

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.820
who was then the director
of folk arts at the NEA.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.290
And, it was meant to honor our
significant living treasures.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.950
It was really based on a
Japanese program and concept

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.360
of honoring what they call
national living treasures.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.600
And so, she patterned
it after that.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.050
And, through the years,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.200
more than 430 artists have now
been recognized with this award.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.820
And, Tom's photographed
220 some at this point.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.370
So, the book became the process
of trying to select out of

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.590
that group 100 artists
to feature.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.590
But, I think, Bess
really best summed it

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.620
up in describing what the
Heritage Fellowships are.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.550
And, this is the only
reading we're going to do.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.700
It's not a book reading, but,
I wanted to read you this quote

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.060
from Bess because I
think it said a lot

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.410
about what was intended for
the Heritage Fellowships.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.270
She said this; of all
the activities assisted

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.250
by the Folk arts program,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.580
these fellowships are among the
most appreciated and applauded,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.280
perhaps, because they present to
Americans a vision of themselves

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.210
and other country, a
vision somewhat idealized

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.060
but profoundly longed
for, and so,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.870
in significant ways
profoundly true.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.870
It is a vision of a confident

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.200
and openhearted nation whee
differences can be seen

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.780
as exciting instead
of fear laden.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.280
Where people of good will,
across all manner of racial,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.390
linguistic, and historical
barriers, can find common ground

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.130
in understanding
solid craftsmanship,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.020
virtuoso techniques, and
deeply felt expressions.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.190
And, I don't think it could
be said better than that.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.370
So, when we thought about
choosing a photograph

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.570
for the cover of the
book, at the time,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.660
we wanted to pick
a good photograph.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.430
And now that I look back on
it, I think we selected one

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.230
that conveys a second message
which is, in this case,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.470
Julia Parker is standing
I a meadow

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.080
in Yosemite National Park.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.290
So, there is a living national
treasure standing in the midst

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.370
of a world heritage site.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.960
And really, those two concepts

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.380
of heritage have
blend nicely together.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.020
Tom do you want to
say a little bit

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.690
about this photograph
before we go on?

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.710
We'll get back to, sort of,
where all this started, but,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.140
maybe you'd like to
describe a little bit

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.580
about how this photograph
came about.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.550
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Right, I, over
the past couple of months,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.440
I've had a lot of questions
about did I take the photos

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.350
of the deer in my studio
or superimpose them?

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.750
Are those cut out cardboard deer
that I travel with all the time?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.480
So, you know, but this time
they didn't keep my luggage.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.480
But, I came into the park that
morning to visit with Julia.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.060
And, she was teaching
at the museum there.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.670
And, the weather was awful
and it was to get worse

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.170
and they were evacuating
the park.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.140
So, nobody was allowed in,
fortunately they did let me come

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.310
in and visit with her.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:08.810
And, as people were leaving,
I had the opportunity to walk

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.010
through the forest with Julia.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:17.070
And, that morning, in a break
in the rain, she told me all

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.490
about her spirit and she
would touch the trees

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.150
and she would tell me about
how she was part of this tree

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.110
and part of the sky and
the earth and the water

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.840
that was cascading
over the falls.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.880
Later that afternoon, as
the weather was starting

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.680
to get worse, if you look
closely, there's snow,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.830
there's hail, there's
a lot of rain.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.110
I asked Julia, which I always do
to all artists, where would you

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.850
like to be photographed,
not where I want to?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.240
And, she said her
favorite meadow.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.720
So, we drove to this location.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.060
And, the road was
a river of water.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.550
And, Julia's about 5 foot 1.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.360
And so, I went across into the
grass and I set up the tripod

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.720
and I went and got the
camera, set that up,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.750
then I covered the
camera from the rain,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.050
and then I brought Julia over.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.210
And, it wasn't until after
I looked at the photograph

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.090
and realized, when I walked

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.510
into the meadow I
followed this natural path

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.330
that I didn't even
recognize at the time.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.360
So, Julia stood there and
I was about five feet,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.220
you know, away from her.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.490
And, as we started talking
and I started photographing,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.030
the deer just rose
up out of the grass

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.560
and they just stood
there for the photo.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.690
And, once that happened, as
I do in most of my photos,

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.430
I might have photographed
for a minute, I knew I had it

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.040
and then we're finished.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.010
I don't move all
over the meadow.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.790
I just, it's an instinct that
I had from the beginning so.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.580
And then, I realized that
everything she told me about

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.690
and talked to me
about, probably,

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.900
that morning was right
there in front of me.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.030
And they all, to me, came out
to honor her, the weather,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.610
the magnificence of the
view, the animals, the earth.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.040
So, I'm forever grateful
for having been there

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.550
that moment that she gave me.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.390
As I understand also,
that meadow is

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.450
where she collects her materials
to make her basic right.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.860
So, she has, she has the
makings of a basket in her hands

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:30.160
and there's a roll of like
orange brush back there

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.220
that she uses to make
these baskets, plus,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.150
she goes to this meadow to
get a lot of her medicines

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.480
that she uses for healing.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.170
So, this is her favorite
place, her favorite meadow,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.200
her special place where she
comes to just spend time

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.950
and think and collect
what she needs, so.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.510
And, I spoke to her
just three weeks ago.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.620
And, she's doing well and I'm
on my way to visit her again

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.920
to do some more recording.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.420
So, I'm grateful
to that as well.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.020
But, what I'll do is go
on and talk a little bit

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.310
of how this all came
about, this works.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:15.190
So, this National Geographic
article changed my whole life.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.800
I was sitting in my apartment
in New York in the winter

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.250
and I read, I, my National
Geographic came in the mail

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.930
and I opened it up, I looked at
the cover that was intriguing

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.420
and I went, and I
came upon this article

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.910
about National Heritage Fellows.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.340
And, I knew immediately,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.290
immediately that's
what I wanted to do.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.700
Didn't matter what I was doing

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.600
to what level I was
doing my photography,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.690
this is what I wanted to do.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.960
So, I got on the telephone,
there were no cell phones then,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.230
and I dial the operator
and I asked her

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.460
to call National Geographic.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.760
And, she put me through.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.460
And, I did get through to one
of the writers of this article.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.280
And, he said, well, we
really didn't have much to do

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.040
with it besides the photography
but you have to contact the NEA.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.340
So, I said okay.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.810
So, I hung up with Boras
and I call the operator back

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.950
and says can you please
put me through to the NEA?

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.740
And, they said sure.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.440
And, next thing I know,
hello how can I help you?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.740
I said is this NEA?

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.310
She goes yes this is
NRA, how can I help you?

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.840
I was like no I want the NEA.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.920
So, after a couple of more calls
to the operator, thank God,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.660
I didn't get them
ones every time

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.960
because they probably
would've hung up on me.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.440
I got the number for the NEA.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.090
I still don't know what I was
doing, maybe I still don't.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:44.640
And, I, a lovely woman, Rose
Morgan, picked up the phone.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.240
And, I can tell you,
I still don't know

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.420
to this day what I
ever said to her.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.500
But, she said, well, if you're
ever in Washington stop by

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.820
and I'll introduce you to
our director at the time.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.250
And I said, oh that's great.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.960
Let's fast forward
about four hours.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.310
My wife comes up from work a and
she sees me packing my suitcase.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.610
And she goes where you going?

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.910
I said to Washington.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.210
She goes, oh what for?

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.540
I says, I have no idea.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:15.080
The next morning I got on the
train, went to Washington,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.250
found the right oak door in
the old post office building,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.330
Rose Morgan answered the door,
walked me in, introduced me

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.560
to Dan Chehe, I told him my
crazy ideas, and he said well,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.800
we'll help you as
much as we can.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.670
And, here it is all these years
later and I'm still on the road.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.060
So this, and, we talked
about it, and Marjorie Hunt

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.820
who was the co-writer
in this article,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.800
how the words really
inspired me at the time.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.730
And, I realize that more now,
as we're losing magazines

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.510
and that the written word
really will inspire journalist

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.920
in young people as
we go forward.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.250
So, that was my first
day in Washington.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.540
I don't even know if I stayed
that night or what I was doing.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:10.240
But, you know, it wasn't long
after I went on the road.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.710
And, well, the Heritage
Fellowships have a very strong

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.720
connection to the library.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.960
So, I wanted to mention
that, that the ceremony,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.700
there are three elements of the
Heritage programs, generally,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.130
I think of them as the personal,
the political, and the public.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.550
And, the personal
one, of course,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.400
is to honor the artists
and their families.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.120
So, we have a banquet
here in the great hall

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.390
of the library each year
honoring the Heritage Fellows.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.880
The political one is
the ceremony itself

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.260
which is held right next door
here in Coolidge Auditorium now.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.210
And often, of course,
congress people are invited

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.540
to come to that.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.180
And then, there's the
public event associated

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.530
with the Heritage Fellowship

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.010
which is a concert
that's been done recently

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.310
at the Lisner Auditorium

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.600
on the George Washington
University Campus

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.950
where artists are able

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.270
to present their work
whether it be music or craft

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.160
or storytelling or
dance, whatever it may be.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.550
So, those three elements
are connected.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.110
But, all of that of
course is documented.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.590
Tom comes down most of the time

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.130
to document those
events as well.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.160
And, the archive for the
heritage fellowship is located

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.340
here in the American Folklife
Center at the library.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.730
So, we've had a strong
and ongoing connection

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.650
to the library for
years and years.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.830
And, we hope that continues.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.620
But, it is a way for
the materials related

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.290
to the heritage fellowships
to live on.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.590
Now, maybe you want to go back

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.330
to the beginning
where you started.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.630
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, we've
been jumping back

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.930
and forth a little bit.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.490
But, it is a great honor
to cover these events here.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.980
The building's just
so spectacular.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.810
So, this is the first
photograph.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.340
So I get, I received,
before I left,

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.130
a list of the Heritage
fellows up until that time.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.920
And so, Sandman Simms lived
in New York and so did I.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.480
So, once again not really having
any idea what I was doing,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.220
I approached, I called him and
he walked me over to his house.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.450
And, I had this like,
sort of really,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.150
the vision in my head was to
shoot it with medium format

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.250
and black and white,
it should be beautiful.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.650
And, I visited with him,

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.750
and this was shot
with a [inaudible].

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.970
And, I do have some color
but mostly black and white.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.070
And, even before I get
back, once I seen the film,

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.110
I realized the format's
wrong and it all has

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.050
to be photographed in
color because there's just

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.960
such colorful people in
spirit and what they do.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.060
So, this is the first photograph

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.510
that I had ever taken
of the Fellows.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.900
And so, we went on
and you'll see

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.070
in the next one where
I follow that.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.160
This is the second
photograph I've ever taken,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.030
and it was on my first journey.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.680
So, I left New York, we crossed

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.010
over the George Washington
Bridge into New Jersey.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.240
And so, I was following
this line.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.370
If you lived, the
closest person to me,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.940
then we just went all the way
down to the Appalachians, so,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.540
it was quite a journey.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.250
We were welcomed, we
had a wonderful visit.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.600
And, once again,
it was the shop.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.000
And I was still, had a lot
of vision of how I was taught

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.620
from school and other mentors
that, when I was photographing,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.640
the window, the light
was just too much.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.000
So, I noticed that, when
we came up the driveway,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.980
he had a flag hanging off
either this house or his home.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.950
And, we went and
took the flag off.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.810
And, my friend Micheal
is standing outside

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.710
that window holding the flag.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.150
And, that's what
I love about it.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.270
So, it's, kept your
eye on this subject not

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.810
to go out the window.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.590
That's something that
we learned in school.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:18.090
And, we went on and this was
all the way down in Charleston.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.250
Interesting story, once we
got into this neighborhood,

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.020
we were asked what
we were doing there.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.490
And, when I went up and
asked for Mr. Simmons,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.760
this young man said
hold on a second.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.600
And, for ten minutes
I stood at the doorway

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.640
and nobody ever came back.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.960
I'm knocking on the door.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.860
So, I walked out to the street
and I watched this young man run

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.880
across an intersection.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.500
And, I was saying
to Micheal, look,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.320
that's the person
I just spoke to.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.020
And, a few minutes
later, it was him

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.250
and another young boy
that ran that way.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.300
And, I'm like, you could
see them moving around.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.060
And, next thing you know, they
ended up, they were sending

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.150
out a change to the
oldest brother

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.340
that there was somebody there
to meet their grandfather.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.870
And it was the oldest brother
to allow us to come in.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.840
And, we met Mr. Simmons
and he took us into a shed

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.160
that was right next to the house
where he does a lot of work

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.820
and he was kind enough
to start up the fire.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.580
And, I don't know from
this point of view, but,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.520
I remember asking him
specifically, that fire was

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.030
so hot that I could see
the glow in his hand.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.320
And I said, isn't that
hot, is that burning you?

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.360
And he says no you
get used to it.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.260
And then, on his skin looks like
cigarette burns or something.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.430
I said but they're the embers
of the fire that would come

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.840
and rest on his skin
over the years.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.330
And, the great thing, I think
it was over ten years later

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.030
that we were reunited
back up here together

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.940
and to be photographed with
Phil Simmons was a great honor.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.830
So, this was a journey
all the way

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.860
from New York and starting down.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.530
And we were being educated

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.530
at the same time being
lost in different places.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:13.050
But, we picked up speed and
we started to get an idea.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.930
And, once again, I looked
at the number the other day

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.010
of Mr. Simmons, I took
no more than 40 photos.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.340
And, we weren't even
seeing them,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.050
they were photographed
and filmed.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.350
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: You
were going to film.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:28.950
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Catacomb.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.250
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Yeah.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.550
And, I counted the
number of slides

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.920
in his folder there were
only 40 and I gasped now

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.170
like oh my God we only have 40
and we only need 1 good one.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.110
And the same thing when
we went to meet Mary Jane.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.190
Her folder is like this thin,
she has 2 sheets of slides, so,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.490
there's 20 in each one,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.680
and I don't think the
second one's even full.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.600
And, I went to meet with her.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.700
I remember, walking up
the stairs to her home,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.480
very warm day, but
just so welcoming,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.910
every one of these people
just so welcoming to me.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:07.200
And, we sat there and
talked and she was one

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.280
of the most beautiful
women I have ever seen

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.570
and had the opportunity
to photograph.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.200
And I just asked her to
look off over to the street.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.000
And, by that time, there were
a bunch of children gathering.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.320
And, while we were doing
it, the ice cream man came,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.510
and you know the
sound of those bells

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.880
and all the kids were excited.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.510
So, I asked Micheal I said
let's buy everybody ice cream.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.750
And so, everybody had
ice cream that day

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.800
and it was a wonderful day,
once again, maybe 30 photos

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.230
and that's what we
walked away with.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.820
And, I'm forever grateful to
have that opportunity too.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.450
So, this journey is just
taking us, you know,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.220
through the south
from the coast.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.040
And, we'll go inland all
the way to Ray Hicks' home.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.430
And, this is Banner
Elk North Carolina.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.400
And so, you see we
primarily chose this

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.110
to show what happened
on my first journey.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:13.800
And, I think it was
really, if any group

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.920
of photographs ever
said anything about me,

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.010
these were the rawest
photographs that,

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.360
I didn't read much about the
person I was going to see, so,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.130
I didn't have any
preconceived ideas.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.490
And, what I wanted to do,
I just let the landscape

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.090
and the person really
make the photograph.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.460
And so, this is some of
the most powerful as Barry

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.400
and I would go back and
forth trying to select photos

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.300
and why should they, why there
are very so wonderful ones.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.600
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey:
It was interesting.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.340
When we started looking at
the 220 or so to try to figure

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.960
out what to put in the book,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.850
we realized that first
journey we selected almost

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.150
every photograph.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.840
Something about that spontaneity

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.420
and the exposure to
it, I don't know.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.350
But it was interesting

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.650
that almost every one
of those photographs.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.960
And, we tried to
select photographs

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.490
because they had
good visual impact.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.390
But, also there was a story
behind the photograph often

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.690
as well.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.330
So, those two factors
played into the selecting.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.240
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Right,
so here's a couple

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.370
of New York kids trying
to find Ray Hicks.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.900
Well, Michael had the
great idea well let's go

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.980
to the post office, they'll
know where Ray Hicks lives.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.740
And the guy was wonderful
he said you're almost there.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.040
Go down the road a few
miles, when you get to the Y

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.270
in the road, you just go down
to the left, go into the valley,

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.490
and you'll say Ray Hicks' home.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.810
And, we followed that, and we
were excited, we're following,

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.450
we get to the Y, you go down
you can see a cluster of houses,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.820
and we pull up to a
mailbox that says Hicks.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.610
And, we're like,
oh, it's right here.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.470
But, the problem was, the
next mailbox said Hicks also

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.360
and so did about
five other ones.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.000
And so, I got out, and there
was this dog barking behind

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.300
a screen.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.080
And, I'm walking up to the house
and I'm a little apprehensive.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.140
And, from behind the dog
and the screen was a voice.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.440
What do you want?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.510
And we were asking
for Ray Hicks.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.890
And this person, even though
her mailbox said Hicks,

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.410
said he was down the road.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.200
And, we did eventually get to
his home and he welcomed us

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.050
and we spent most of the
day with him and his wife

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.970
and he walked me around to show
me his garden and, you know,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.570
where he collects
water and crayfish.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.430
And, he was excited about he
had just gotten electricity

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.730
in the house.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.630
So, he had a wire coming into
the living room with a wire

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.140
and a pigtail and a
little light bulb.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.590
And, that was the extent

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.170
of their modern day
conveniences for the most part.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.380
So, but, and then, there's a
whole bunch of travel stories

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.170
that surround after this.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.000
But, we didn't document those.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.430
I think I was too scared.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:11.650
And then, on to John Jackson.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.720
And if, this is one
of the photographs

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.650
that I spent an afternoon
with John.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.930
And, we were doing it in his,

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.730
taking some photos
in his living room.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.630
And, I talked with him
more, probably, for an hour

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.030
and a half before we
even I bring in a camera

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.980
so they feel comfortable.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.020
So, I started taking pictures of
John and it just wasn't working.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.820
So, we agreed that I would
come back the next day.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.160
And, the cameras were packed
up and put in the car.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.870
And, I was walking out
the front of the house

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.570
and John was walking and
he was at the door, and,

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.810
I just noticed the light on him.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.560
And, I said John, hold on.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:01.290
I got the camera, I took
half a dozen exposures

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.940
and I knew I had his picture.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.710
And, I never went
back, we didn't,

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.090
I said I think we're good.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:14.430
And, next time I would see
him a festival or so on.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.880
But, somebody asked me
once, oh you've got pictures

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.180
of such and such an artist.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.280
And, do you have a picture of
them doing this or do you have?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.000
And I says no I usually, I
look for one photo that will,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.840
you know, say who they
might be, who they are.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.140
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: One of
the interesting things

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.770
about John is his house is
filled with Civil War artifacts.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.850
You know, he used to
take a medal detector

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:48.040
out across the battlefields and
find beneath the earth bullets

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.090
and remnants of swords
and all sorts of things.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:57.440
And John, professionally,
was a caretaker, handyman,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.240
but also a grave digger.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.370
And, I've always thought
it was kind of ironic

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.530
that he spent his
professional life putting bodies

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.700
under the ground and his side
light was looking underneath the

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.180
earth for other treasures.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.940
It just seemed like
an interesting irony,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.370
in addition to being a great,
great singer and musician.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:23.230
But, I always thought that was
sort of an interesting dynamic,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.530
one of the most wonderful
people you could ever meet.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.300
I think it comes through
in this photograph.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.940
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: I think
we spent, probably,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.610
the first hour talking
about, because you'd walk

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.140
into the house and everywhere
were boxes or tin cans,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.550
Maxwell House Coffee cans.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.990
I was like John what are these?

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.410
He goes, oh those are just,
you know, old bullets or.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.570
And I have them, today I have a
couple of gifts that he gave me.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.460
It looked like just a pancake.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.160
So I said, what was this, he
goes that looks like a bullet

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.330
that hit someone
that flatten out.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.280
Yeah, and he did, he had
belt buckles, broken swords.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.500
And he ws generous with
all of it, you know.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.730
And so I thanked him and I still
have those and display those.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.700
Well, here is my longest
second trip in beginning.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.910
This is 1993.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:25.200
And, there I am in jeans and
an jean jacket in Louisiana

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.480
in Saint Bernard Parish
photographing Ervin Perez,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.070
one of the Fellows, and then
below with Canray Fontenot

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.890
and my friend Micheal
Singh who's

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:41.380
in the back now taking
these photos of me.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.050
My girls get a good laugh
out of what I looked like

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.050
and what I wore back then.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:50.480
I just told Barry this
story last evening.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.620
On Monday I was in New York and
presenting to, I was talking

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.790
to some people that
had bought the book.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.860
And, they have a
receptionist that has been part

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.450
of this whole thing, seeing me
coming in and out and talking.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.970
And I said did you never, did
we never show you the book?

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.270
And she said no.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.610
And, I went to this page
and I showed her that.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.450
And, she goes oh, bluejeans
and a bluejean jacket?

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.440
I says yeah, 1993.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.810
She goes, oh I wasn't
even born yet.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.150
So, I felt real good about that.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.350
But, these are some of the
other journeys and I'm grateful

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.320
to have these photographs

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.120
of realizing how crazy a
haircut I had at that time.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.580
But, once again, we
will welcome so much.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.630
We had dinners with both these
gentlemen and their families

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.360
after we photographed them.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.040
I don't think these, Canray,
the gentleman on the bottom,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.120
he had just gotten
back after being

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.710
in the hospital for a few weeks.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.300
We went outside, we photographed

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.000
for maybe ten minutes
at the most.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.620
Then he asked me to go dig out
some crayfish from the front

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.380
of the yard so we
could have dinner.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.870
And, we did, so we
learned how to do that.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:18.710
And, once again, he was the
ending part of this journey.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.820
And we were in Eunice
with Boisec.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.160
And, we were out on his porch.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.150
And, a storm was coming in.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.350
And the midst the rain, the
midst of the rain started coming

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.500
through the screen and it
made him uncomfortable.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.180
And, the light was
terrible, the lighting was.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.250
And, we went to his
living room once again.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.380
I asked him if I come
back the next day,

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.710
if the weather was
better and he agreed.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:49.620
Put the cameras in the car, the
car was underneath the carport,

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.800
tin, just a piece
of corrugated tin.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.040
And, as I was about
to get in the car,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.300
the wind was whipping
up, and I noticed

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.940
that the rain was picking up

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.870
and all the animals started
scurrying for shelter.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.480
And I asked him if
he would come out.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.780
There was a rocking chair

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.930
that was being moved
with the weather.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.100
And he agreed even though
he said he didn't want

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.400
to catch a cold.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.160
He put on his jacket, put
on his hat, he sat there.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.160
And as I started taking
the picture, this rooster,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.080
or chicken, it's a rooster,

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.960
started walking through
the frame.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.420
And, I have six frames of this
photograph rooster walking

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.720
through, walking out.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.500
Soon as he walked out,
I knew I had the picture

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.270
and I told him thank you very
much and we were finished.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.720
And so.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.740
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Kind of
an interesting element

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.880
of that photograph, behind the,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.300
the story behind
the photograph is

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.150
that Boisec name is
dry wood in french.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.000
And, he got that nickname
because, as a young man

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.020
when he worked in the fields,
when it started to rain,

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.690
they always said he was
the first one to run

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.710
into the barn to stay dry.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.790
And now, it turns out that Tom's
photograph was another attempt

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.930
to photograph him and
avoid the rain so.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.000
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: He did, he was
very uncomfortable feeling

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.680
that mist coming in, and
then to get him to agree

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.130
to step outside for this photo.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:24.640
And, it didn't take, out of
probably 20 seconds it was over.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.430
So, and we were glad that
the rooster decided to show.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.800
&gt;&gt; Barry Bargey: The rooster has
other functions in Cajun culture

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.290
as well, regarding Mardi
Gras and usually a plate

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.090
on the table generally.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.140
[ Background noise ]

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:49.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: As I went through
the 90s and started evolving

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:55.070
into being a better
documentarian, to gathering

00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:01.930
as much information as I
could, I sat with Flory Jagoda.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:09.800
And, I would ask a question,
especially even more now,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.690
I'll ask a question and
I'll just let them talk.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.520
I might not speak
for 15, 20 minutes.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.350
I just, as, and, if I have
to like redirect more,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:25.660
encourage them, it might be as
few word sentences as a can.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.060
She wanted to, we, her
house is just all these

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.360
wonderful instruments.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.950
But, she went on to tell
me a story about her

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.450
as a young girl and
an accordion.

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:44.070
And that was one of the
most incredible stories I've

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.370
ever heard.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.100
And, I'll let Barry
finish up with that.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.500
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey:
Well that story was,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.680
her family was living in Bosnia.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.320
And, she was about 17
years old at the time.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.880
And, her father could tell

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.590
that the Holocaust
was on the horizon.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.010
And so, he had got her
a passport, somehow,

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:10.510
a forged passport,
and he put her

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:14.260
on the train with her accordion.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.850
And, he said just keep
playing the accordion

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.620
and if the officials come up,
just keep playing the accordion

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.010
and they may not
check your identity.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.370
And, she was able to
escape Bosnia and 42

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.390
of her family members
were killed in the,

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.760
including her grandmother,

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.520
who is the person she
learned her songs from.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:44.100
So, she wanted to carry on, of
course, that family tradition.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.250
And, the accordion you see on
the right side of the screen,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.720
the little white according is
the accordion that she carried

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.210
with her on that train ride.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:59.720
And, just recently, the Virginia
Foundation for the Humanities,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.950
the Folk Arts Program there, had
someone restore the accordion

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.980
so she could play it again.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.590
But, it's quite a
story both tragic

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:13.910
and has its happy
ending as well for her.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, when she
was telling me this story,

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.760
I asked her what
happened to the accordion,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.990
she said she still had it.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:25.070
And, I asked can we get it
and put it in the photograph.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.010
And, the full photograph
shows the whole instrument.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.190
But, I mean that's
to me so special.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.870
And each one of these visits,
yeah, I could go over, you know,

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:43.170
sitting with Ray Hicks and I
can still feel the temperature

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:48.190
of the day and sitting with
Flory and just feel how,

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:51.940
you know, she's just a
beautiful woman in spirit

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.450
and telling this story and
at the same time being able

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.210
to smile for the photograph.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:02.470
And, she's proud that,
you know, that she had it

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:07.800
and that there was the interest
in for it to be restored.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.300
When I heard that, that
was incredible too.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:15.280
So I, so everything
starts to evolve.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:22.510
And then, some of them
take on different stories.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:29.550
And, we show you this one
because Wade Maynard turned 100.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.850
Correct?

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.150
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Right.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, Barry and I
that day, that day met and,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.710
in Michigan and drove
up to their house to,

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.340
Barry was presenting
him with a plaque or.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.210
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: We were giving
him a letter from the Chairman

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.960
of the National Endowment for
the Arts to congratulate him

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.640
on his 100th birthday.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.160
So, this was the only trip
I had been able to take

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.340
with Tom and his journeys.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.460
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: There was a
couple other funny stories.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.720
But, within that,
we got to the house

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.560
and Wade's wife plays for him.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.930
So, I thought it was appropriate

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.050
to photograph the
two of them together.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.290
And then, off we went
with this whole family.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.240
The house was full of
children and grandchildren

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.540
and great grandchildren.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.840
And, off we went to the
local high school where,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.420
as you can see in the smaller
photograph, was full wall

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.730
to wall with townspeople that
came out to hear them play

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.860
and to honor him
for his birthday.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.580
Well, the ceremony
went on proceeding.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.170
And, I was off the side of the
stage taking some photographs.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:47.690
And, Wade came, after a song he
was trying to wave me to come

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.510
on stage and I kept saying no.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.580
So finally, he said to the
audience, I'm not going

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.130
to play unless Tom comes out.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.610
So, I came out, I stood next
to him, he introduced me,

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.800
I said a couple of
things and all the sudden,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.160
someone in the audience just
stood up and said sit down.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.980
And, I was stunned.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.760
And, I looked at Barry in
the audience and my eyes were

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.690
like this big, I froze.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:20.190
And somebody else shouted from
the audience and I'm like, wait,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.070
I got to get, I got to go,
I got to get off the stage.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.370
They want to hear you

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:25.840
and they're telling
me to go sit down.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.770
And, I mean, so I left.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.310
And I was, it had me.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.610
And, I left the building.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.040
And Barry had seen me leave and
he met me out in the courtyard.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.500
And, I was like I didn't mean
to come out and I'm trying

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.190
to explain myself that
Wade wanted me out there

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.680
and I didn't mean to upset the
audience and stop the music.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.760
And, we went over to a cousin
or of Wades and we talked to him

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.170
about it, you know, we
didn't mean to upset them

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.560
and why the reaction in
the audience was so great.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.170
And he says, they weren't doing
that, they were asking for Wade

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:08.220
to play the song Sit Down.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.520
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: There's a
great gospel song that Wade

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.460
and Julia were well known
for where she says sit down

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.850
and he says I can't sit down.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.190
She says sit down, he
says I can't sit down,

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.110
she says sit down, I can't
sit down I just got to heaven

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.780
and I got to walk around.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.880
So, that's what they
were calling for.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.600
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: And I tell you
I would've been happy being

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.500
in heaven at that moment.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.100
I don't know what, I
was, that was a tough,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.520
that was a tough moment.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.200
But I was relieved afterwards.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.740
So, the visits take on all
kinds of different directions

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:46.120
and the stories become
more interesting

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.740
than the photos sometimes.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:53.270
And a similar thing
happened with Chunky Sanchez.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.930
I know he wasn't
in great health.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:01.190
But, a week after he received
his Heritage fellowship in 2013,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.190
I flew out to San Diego to
visit with him, now I set it

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:07.240
up with his family,
with his wife.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.550
And, I'm always at a location.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.870
So, we, I asked Chunky
where would you

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.610
like to be photographed,
before I got out there?

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.260
And, he said Chicano Park.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.520
Now, if anybody's
been in San Diego,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.970
there's wonderful
murals in this park.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.880
So, I arrived there about an
hour plus before I was supposed

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.180
to meet Chunky.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.970
And, I was watching these,
all these cars pull up

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.820
and families would get out.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.120
And then, they started putting

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.090
on these costumes
and headdresses.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.490
So, of course I'm
interested, and I walk over

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.950
and says is there
a parade today.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.640
And they said no we're
here to meet a friend.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.780
And, questions on questions,
and they said we're here

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.430
to honor Chunky Sanchez.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.430
And I said how did you know
he was going to be here?

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.060
Oh, his wife called us.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.620
And, he's such an advocate
for the different communities,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:07.140
for Mexico and the Aztec
communities, that they came

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.410
to be, just to witness
me photographing him.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.630
And, that's when I realized,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.670
I couldn't just photograph
Chunky alone.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.810
I put them all in the photo.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:22.490
And, it just was incredible
how many people loved this man

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.490
for them to show up.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:26.230
And, it's a much
better photograph

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.110
than me just photographing
him alone.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.410
He's since passed away.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.170
But, I think his,
he's on a mural there

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.770
in the park now too
honoring him.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.300
&gt;&gt; Barry Bargey: Right
and they named the school

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.600
after him as well.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.980
We had a big dinner at a table
of about 40 people at a school

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.650
that they named after
him as well.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:51.740
But, how exciting that that many
people would take time to come

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.850
out and dress up and
just in his honor, so.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.790
They take on all
different forms.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:03.690
So, this brings us back
here in the mid 200s.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.820
I had to start to think
about what I was doing,

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.960
if I was gathering, if
I was doing my trips

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.320
or these heritage
fellows justice.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:21.810
And, it all came one night
after listening to Joe Wilson.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.560
And, Joe Wilson was
a dear friend.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.290
And, he was giving
a talk one day here.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: At the
library right.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.560
He was being honored
as a living legend.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.540
Then there was as symposium
that occurred during

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.900
that period time as well.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.600
And so, what Joe was talking

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:47.200
about is how he dedicated
himself, and if he had,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.510
whatever he had to bring with
him to record the artists

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.580
that he was visiting he
would make those efforts.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:59.330
And, I'd sort of just
given up on video instead

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.950
of taking all this
equipment just focus

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.900
on taking the photograph.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.860
And, at that point it was, I was
bringing lightening equipment

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.980
and all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.940
And that night, I realized
I had to rededicate myself,

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.340
if I was going to do
this, to spend time,

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.570
don't spend just a day, if I
needed two days or three days

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:27.880
with a Fellow to record their
words to record their visions.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.580
And so I did.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:34.190
And, this next slide,
and it's a silent piece,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:39.920
but it shows you how I took
Joe's words and put them

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.910
into the work I do now.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:46.110
If you watch Joe, and
if anybody knows Joe,

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:51.030
if you ask him a question, he
could go on for about 12 hours.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.280
This is a video I did time laps.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.580
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Sitting

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.080
on his porch that's the
New River behind him there.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.440
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: At this
point, I wasn't even there.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.710
I was in the kitchen
cooking with his wife.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.170
I didn't even go out to
reset the camera exposure.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.080
So, we started out in the
like, he never left that chair

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.940
and he continued his story.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.620
Poor Barry had to
listen to those.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.880
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: There's
some great stories in there.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.350
The one I remember, at least,
is as Joe talked about the mix

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.540
of cultures in southwestern
Virginia

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:28.760
and northeastern Tennessee,
because, in that area,

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.570
those remoter areas, there's
a mix of Anglo American,

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:35.080
Native American, and
African American folks

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.380
who moved into that region.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.500
He said yeah folks moved
here he said and they,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.220
somehow they took a high
dive into the gene pool.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.970
But he had a great way
of expressing himself.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.080
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Yeah, I remember
some of the things he was trying

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:54.170
to tell me when I told
Barry it'd be interesting

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.230
to listen to it.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:03.100
So that, and since that moment,
I have really rededicated,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:08.900
when I go visit with a
Fellow, we have a day schedule.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.920
But, if something's
changing, I'm very flexible

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.460
with my schedule to stay
long or come back, revisit,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:21.290
to make sure, more than
anything, if I'm trying

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.400
to capture some video and
I don't bring in a lot

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.230
of video equipment, we
try to make it really easy

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.620
that the equipment is
not more than who we are

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.250
and that I'll spend as much time

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.940
and I'm gathering a
lot more information

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:45.260
and having a really
good time at it.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.930
There's a few photos left.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:51.450
But this, this is
a trip of destiny.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:58.150
And, this happened a
summer ago that I had,

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:01.880
I was supposed to
go to the Dakotas.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.880
And then, by some false
wiring and fate I asked one

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.470
of the Heritage Fellows
from Maryland where he'd

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.770
like to be photographed.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.080
He said Seattle.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.310
I said how do we
go all the way to?

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.210
And, I said okay.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.510
So, I thought, well if
I'm going to Seattle,

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.540
I'm going to visit
a lot of people.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.250
So, I spent time in Seattle and
all the way up through Alaska

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.370
from Ketchikan to
Sitka to Juneau.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:34.970
And, when things are in the
stars and everything aligned,

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:38.630
it works out and I'm grateful
because this young lady,

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.500
who happens to be in the
book a couple of times,

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.540
is a deer friend and
has passed on since.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:52.470
And, when I visited with her,
she had terminal bone cancer.

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:56.270
But, her spirit was so alive.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:03.390
And, she's known for this,
when she makes her capes,

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.430
when she twirls how they look.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.380
So, she took me to a spot where
she wanted to be photographed.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:16.100
And, in that area were
fresh bear tracks.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.320
So, that unnerved
me a little bit.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.640
And, at this time,
she was on crutches.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.100
So, her husband Denny
and myself were there.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.120
And, I'm asking him
very naively, like so,

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.920
I know you can't outrun a
bear but is that whole thing

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.610
about curling up and
covering your neck?

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:38.450
He goes, if they're hungry,
they're going to eat you.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:42.480
So, I'm like, already saying.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.410
I don't really think
this is the right place.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:52.170
And, anyway, she says look, and
she sticks out her crutches,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.980
we're bigger than the
bear and we're talking.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.650
So, to fast forward, Denny
says, none of that works.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.060
He goes all you have
to realize you have

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.090
to outrun the person
you're with.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.340
And, we both looked at her
and said okay we're good.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:09.090
And that's where we went
on to take this photograph.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:13.510
And now, there's a whole
story behind this, you know,

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:22.400
the weaving and the wool like
comes from this particular goat.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.280
She researched back to
her ancestors like 400

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.910
or 500 years ago and
found the same bloodline.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:33.050
And, on one part you could
actually see the DNA strand

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:38.400
that she weaved into it and
that's the DNA strand, but.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.630
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: The wool
comes from the mountain goats.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.950
It takes years, sometimes,
to collect it

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:47.460
because they take the
wool off the bushes

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.790
as they're shedding the wool.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.770
So, they go out into their,
the woods into the hills

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.500
and they will collect the
wool out of the bushes.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.360
&gt;&gt; Tom Pinch: Right, they
won't capture and sheer them.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.070
They do it naturally.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.940
Right after that,
I went up to Juneau

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.870
and this is another relationship
to Terry and Clarissa Rizal.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.830
And, I spent, I called
Barry the day after

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.820
and said I just spent the
most exhausting 17 hours

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.690
with someone in my whole life.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.500
I needed two days to recover.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.800
She was so energetic.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.970
But, she wanted to
show me this place

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:28.130
where she gets her
inspiration from.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.310
And, it's called Eagle Beach.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:36.130
And there was just a wonderful
moment and you can see

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:42.890
in her work and her
landscape how one is the same.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.190
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: In Alaska,

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.570
there are several
different types of capes.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:50.720
This is also made
with the same wool.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.280
The first one you saw is
called Raven's Tail weaving

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.090
and this is a Chilkat like it

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:00.510
with the clan lineage
on the back.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:04.350
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: But, it was really
amazing, as I was photographing

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:10.510
to realize that the landscape
is what she's wearing.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.290
[ Background noise ]

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.590
I'm just going to go back.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.180
So, going to finish
up with this one.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.170
This is the part of the
rededication that I had.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:29.380
And this just happened
this past year.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.950
This is Elder Roma Wilson and
I had been looking for him

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.350
for years and years and years.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.660
And, he comes from Mississippi
and he migrated to Chicago.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.790
Nobody knew where he was.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:44.880
About 4:00 on a Saturday
morning,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.770
I was researching
Alabama Sunlights

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.870
when they were playing
one of his songs.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:56.650
And, I immediately got
distracted over the Elder,

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.200
well, then I found him.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.620
I found a clip on YouTube

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:04.400
that I couldn't believe
was dated correctly.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.340
Within two days, I spoke
to his granddaughter who's

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.860
in that picture and I flew
immediately to Detroit

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.340
because Elder Roma
Wilson's 106 years old.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.510
And, here is one of the
recordings that we did.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.590
[ Background noise ]

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:30.590
Hello. Yeah I, so, that,
you may hear the sound.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.340
&gt;&gt; You ready.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.140
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Yeah I'm ready.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:57.620
[ Music ]

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.000
So, it's just a piece of the.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.230
&gt;&gt; All right, I'm so glad
trouble don't last always.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: And, I didn't know
his granddaughter was going

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.810
to sing.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.640
And, she was just
handing him the harmonicas

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.170
and he was testing them all.

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.090
And, he started playing
and this happened.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.400
So, this is a great treat.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.560
And, he went on to play
a few more tunes for me.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:25.710
He's 106 and he introduced
me to his new wife

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:30.560
because his former wife had
passed away a year earlier,

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.810
he goes she's 92.

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.320
I says Elder you're
robbing the cradle.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.620
He goes yeah I know.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.300
He had just such a
great since of humor.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.560
I stood up and we finished up
and this is one of the photos

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.550
that we did with Elder.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:48.860
And, we'll be, I'll be going
back visiting with him as well

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.510
to do more recordings so.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:52.270
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: So,
the beat goes on.

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:56.590
And you were just up in Chicago
photographing Ella Jenkins

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:57.890
just a.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:59.190
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Short while ago.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.790
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Weeks
ago, she's, what's she 90?

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.090
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: 99, yeah.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.750
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Yeah, 99, okay.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:09.400
Well, I think that
concludes our presentation.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.560
We'd be happy to take a few
questions if we have time.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.710
I see one back there,
I don't know

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.300
if we've got a mike
we're going to use, okay.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:27.110
Right here, stand up, no,
back there in the white.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.780
&gt;&gt; How yo doing?

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.800
My name is Dennis Burrows I'm
from Weehawken New Jersey.

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.290
And, I lived in Harlem
for quite a bit.

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.170
And, I'm a cinematographer
and a photographer.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.240
And, I do a lot of
documentary stuff.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.270
And, I was wondering, I was
surprised that you told me

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.240
that you had somebody back there
holding the flag in the window.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.820
So, I'm wondering
where you draw the line

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:55.700
when you come upon a
scene and you either want

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.310
to get just everything as it is
or do you want to add something

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.870
or was that just
something that just sort

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.960
of happened at the last minute?

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.420
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Well I, honest,

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.260
that was the second
photograph I ever had taken.

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.880
It was the first photograph in
the new format with just color.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:16.450
And, I looked back then
and the instincts of going

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:20.280
to art school, you always
learned keep your eye

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.580
in the photo.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.790
If you bring it in this way,
make sure it comes back.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.700
And, my eye kept
going out that window.

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.770
And, it's a great
question to ask.

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:34.960
And, that is the only time
that really has occurred.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.890
Now, when we have, we walked
through Michigan with an artist

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:41.190
with different pieces of art.

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:46.570
And yes, we placed
her stuff there.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.780
But, what I love about the
picture and why I show it

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:54.830
and why I say that is because
my two dearest friends,

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:58.290
and one of them being that
gentlemen right there,

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.260
we've grown up together and
started this journey together.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.440
It always reminds me of that
they're part of that photo.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.320
And so, that's why, I
don't try to, try to.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.210
&gt;&gt; I'm just asking you because
I was doing a documentary

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.330
in New York City
and we were, I was,

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.330
you know John Alfred,
he worked DC.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:19.560
Well, I started the program,

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.970
the Professional
Television Training Program

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.760
where we had underprivileged
young people

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.950
where we taught them how to
do documentary video and film

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:33.180
in the tradition of DC TV which
is basically cinema verite.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:38.500
And, Discovery Channel came and
got one of my students put them

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.100
in a documentary
called the Harlem Diary,

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.190
which talks about young people
in Harlem and their lives.

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:47.830
And, I was hired
as a video mentor.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.820
And, I would travel around with
the students just to make sure

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.400
that they were being technically
responsible for the video

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.300
that they were going
to be taking back.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.750
To add to the piece.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:04.990
And, one night, we were in
Harlem, like around 130th,

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.960
maybe 129th and Frederick
Douglas and they're looking

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.920
in the projects because
they're supposed to be meeting

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.600
up with a crew that was
going to have a dog fight.

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.840
But, that wasn't
going to happen.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:21.010
And then, the director decided
to create a dog fight and that's

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:25.210
when I got fired because I
said this is not documentary.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.720
So, that's why I asked
a question like that.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Pinch: No, I
totally agree with you.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.960
&gt;&gt; And I thought you did
so that's why I asked.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.010
&gt;&gt; Tom Pinch: Yeah and it, yeah
and it's funny because I know,

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:41.650
when I meet with these
Fellows, they'll tell me stories

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.810
that other journalists have
come to visit with them.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:46.660
And they've said, like this
one woman out in Kansas,

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:51.490
it was like 100 degrees,
you know, I'm 77,

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:53.340
he has me in the
cornfield then I'm

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.580
in the hay field then
I'm holding this.

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.090
I almost passed out
from heat stroke.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.860
And, that person didn't
even, they were just there

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:04.270
to get the image and gather.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.170
And, I approach it
so differently.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:12.820
I spend a lot of time, before I
even break open the camera bag,

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.050
I ask them where they
want to be photographed.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.400
I don't bring any
lights with me anymore.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:24.670
And, that came on the request of
my oldest daughter saying to me,

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.580
she was in Puerto Rico with me

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.180
and she said dad you've
just gotten so Hollywood,

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.650
I had all these lights.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:33.600
By the time I sat them
up I've lost the mood.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.670
And, with some of
the elder people,

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:38.050
by the time you put these
lights and the flashes went off,

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.280
they were like, I think it
was giving them a stroke.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.750
So, I'm back to just pure
basics, what's there is what.

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.050
I.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.930
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Yeah,
and I think, I think that,

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:54.470
we call the book Portraits
because they are portraits.

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:57.940
But, they're really a, what
I see as a collaboration

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.530
between Tom and the artists
because they have some agency

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.770
in the decision as
well saying well I'd

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:05.320
like to be photographed
here or I'd

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.620
like to be photographed there.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.740
So, I think it is a
collaborative piece.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.680
There's a great story
about Woolley McGray who's

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:17.220
in the book Cowboy
Poet from Montana.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:22.060
And, he didn't want Tom,
originally, to photograph him

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.450
because he didn't like
photographers coming

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:27.480
to take his picture because
he had a bad experience.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.440
He was out on his ranch and
somebody came up to document him

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.790
and followed him around all
day and they were ordering him

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.320
to do this and do that.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.590
And, he was out in the field
throwing some hay bails off the

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:44.740
back of the wagon and the
photographer said could you do

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.040
that again for me.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.090
He said you come
back tomorrow at 11am

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.110
and I'll be doing
the same thing.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.150
But, he wasn't about
to throw one off

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:54.700
if it didn't need
to be thrown off.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:59.220
So, you do have that
conversation about things.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, Barry
sent me to the lions den.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:04.140
I go all the way to Elko Nevada

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.570
and the first morning
I'm there I'm sitting

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:11.160
in a green room waiting
for Woolley McGray to come

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:16.860
and introduce myself and say
I'd love to get your photograph.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.070
It's 0 degrees out but I
want to get a landscape.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:23.660
And he was, he wouldn't
even talk to me.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.780
He's like why should
you take my picture?

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.480
There's nobody else
better in Montana.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.590
And he went on and on and on.

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:35.500
So, he finally agreed
not to beat me up

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.270
and to let me photograph him.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:40.400
He said here's the deal.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.700
You can photograph me.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.780
Don't ask me to look at you and
don't ask me to do anything.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.080
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: So,

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.730
he definitely stipulated he
wouldn't be photographed riding

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.350
a horse as I can recall.

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Yeah, oh yeah.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.930
So, I had this, fortunate, just
by fortune, the stage setting

01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:02.010
where he was going to speak
looked like an old town.

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:05.670
And, the lighting guys, who I
had met, and we were talking,

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.570
and we just put a
spotlight on the set.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.470
And, I put a chair, a
metal chair, I said,

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.770
if you just sit there.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.480
And, it was an angle that I
shot it because he's noted

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.320
for his red cowboy boots, and
he tucks his jeans inside of it.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.450
And, he never looked at me.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:25.690
And till this day it's one
of my favorite photographs.

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.320
And then, Barry had
heard from Woolley

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.620
after and what did he say?

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.010
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: He termed
that one of his favorites too.

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.000
He said something to the
fact that I never need

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.760
to be photographed
now I have this one.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, and he's,
then I stayed with him that day

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.900
and he read this wonderful
poetry to the audience except

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.650
for this one moment
when he turned around

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:50.080
and said I'm a little
under the weather,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.900
this is after I photographed
him.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.620
Said, he was up all
night with a toothache.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.450
So, he turned around, and I
do have it documented frame

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:01.590
by frame, turned around and
he pulled his tooth out.

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:05.900
And, he spat blood on the floor,
took out a cigarette pack,

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.300
put it in there, turned
back to the audience

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:13.850
and said I feel better
and continued.

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.150
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Tough guy.

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:20.090
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: So, everyone, but
I just let it happen, you know.

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:24.510
But, and there is one other
photograph that I'd taken

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:28.860
where there's a light reflection
from one of my flashes

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.770
in a mirror to come
clean I left it in there

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:35.810
because that's the
only one that I'm in.

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:37.440
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey:
Any other questions?

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.740
&gt;&gt; I can't imagine how
challenging it must have been,

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.710
I can't imagine how challenging
it must have been to decide,

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:48.610
you know, which people and
their photographs were not going

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.320
to make the book.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:56.680
So, you know, was the
process you made a first cut

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.750
and then did you swap
out different ones

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.730
as you made your decisions?

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:05.890
What was that decision
making process like?

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:08.710
&gt;&gt; Tom Pich: Well, because
our families know each other

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.010
so well.

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:12.680
And, I mean, I was involved
my family in my process

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.880
and Barry also, what we did is
we came up with our own list.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.410
And, I went to my
family and wrote my list

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.860
and Barry did the same.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.760
We took those two lists
and we put them on top.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.290
And, about 75% of
them were the same.

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.930
So, we knew those were in.

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:36.560
And then, Barry took it
to the professional step

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.330
of thinking geographically and.

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:46.420
&gt;&gt; Barry Bergey: Functionally,
ethnically, different types

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.890
of artwork, you know, craft,
music, dance, and so forth.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:54.590
So, tried to, I think
there are 45

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:58.330
or there's 43 states represented
all together because we tried

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.590
to give a broad sense.

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:05.240
The real lesson, I think, from
it is that some folks would say,

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.610
you know, this reflects
a diverse America.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:09.990
And, I think it does.

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:12.540
But, 5that wasn't a
self-conscious decision

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.650
in one respect and that is

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.940
that excellence reveals
diversity as well.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.140
And, every one of these
artists is excellent.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.820
They are a living treasure.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.880
And so, it isn't hard
to find diversity

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.180
when you look for excellence.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.970
Rather than going the other way
around, we look for diversity

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:30.450
and then find the excellence.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.110
The excellence is there.

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.300
And, I think it's
revealed in the book.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:41.040
So, the composite statement is
one, I don't think it's unfair

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.830
to say it's a portrait
of America.

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:48.860
It's not the portrait but
it is a portrait of America

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.160
and we'd like to hope that.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.840
But, everyone also
had a striking,

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.110
you know, image a good story.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:02.080
And then, we also in the book
put a quote from each artist

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.530
so we could give the
artist's voice as well.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:11.570
So, every image also has a
statement from the artist in it.

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:15.090
Are we ready to wrap up?

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.510
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you so much.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:21.260
[ Applause ]

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:25.600
I just want to thank Tom
Pich, Berry Bergey for coming.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.950
They're going to be outside
and sign copies of the book

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.250
if you want to buy it.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.620
It's a great bargain
it's a great book.

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.920
And, thank you all for coming.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.290
Our next Botkan lecture we
hope will be on April 4th

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.220
with Barry Ancelet talking
about Cajun culture.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:44.650
We have to wait until we get a
budget but we're working on it.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.140
And, they're working on it
across the street so hope

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.510
to see you back here then.

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:52.350
So, thank you and thank
our speakers once again.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:57.020
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
