00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.470
TV has come a long way since its conception.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.000
Original programing is now competing with
big blockbuster films in terms of budgets

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and fandoms.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.880
Despite the amazing cast and crews behind
some of these hit television shows, the occasional

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.150
mistake can slip by without anyone noticing
until it’s too late.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.420
Give us a like if you never noticed these
10 mistakes in big TV shows!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.960
Friends
In the episode “the one where Ross finds

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.269
out”, Rachel learns that Ross and Julie
are going to be getting a cat.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.960
Between the shots however, something vanished
and reappeared without the crew noticing.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.870
In one shot, Rachel can be seen without a
necklace yet after the action returns to her,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.970
she is without said necklace.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.000
Cut back to her and she has magically produced
a necklace only to have it missing again in

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.320
her next shot.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.210
The Simpsons
Fun fact: continuity errors can even make

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.290
their way into animation, even one of the
most popular animated programs of all time.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.520
In the very first Simpsons episode “Christmas
special: Simpsons roasting on an open fire”,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.460
Bart, Millhouse and Lewis can be seen on the
balcony leaning in looking at the mall Santa

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.600
(who just happens to be Homer).

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.080
When Bart leaves, the cut shows Millhouse
and Lewis, who has unexpectedly changed races

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.799
from African American to Caucasian.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.070
How I met your mother
It happens on a TV series that runs for seasons

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.180
on end that the writers may end up forgetting
the smallest details that they mentioned years

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
ago.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.500
This was the case on How I met your mother,
where it was stated in season 5 that Lily

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.190
and Marshall have been using the same toothbrush
ever since they’ve been together.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.090
Yet in the season 1 episode “zip zip zip,”
Lily and Marshall are shown brushing their

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.950
teeth with individual toothbrushes.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.920
Game of Thrones
Game of Thrones is arguably one of the biggest

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.870
and greatest TV shows to have ever been produced.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.630
Despite its monster production costs, even
the occasional mistake will inevitably slip

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.380
its way into the final product.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.690
Case in point the episode titled “The Pointy
End”.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.410
Eagled eyed fans will noticed that ironically,
there is a Kingsguard on the right side of

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.660
the frame in the red keep trying very hard
without much success to sheath his sword.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.520
It’s with the pointy end man.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.540
Gilmore Girls
Fans rejoiced when Netflix revealed the beloved

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.510
show would return on their network, causing
immediate binges of the previous season to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.680
fuel their excitement.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
But did anyone notice the continuity error
in the episode “red light on the wedding

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
night”?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.009
At Luke’s place, Lorelai, Rory and Max are
all having breakfast and having some coffee

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.190
to go with.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.459
Look closely and you’ll notice that the
coffee cups go from red to blue between shots.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.569
Also worth pointing out that Max’s coffee
cup likes to travel across the table, going

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.519
from the left side to the right side of his
placemat.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.730
Family guy
Sometimes artists and directors come up with

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.239
multiple shot designs to choice from in the
final cut but might accidently mix up those

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.040
concepts in the final cut.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.930
This is evident in the Family Guy episode
“and the wiener is” when Peter is driving

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.260
down the road to the tunnel.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.349
In three different shots, the white painted
lines on the road go from broken to totally

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.010
gone to being a solid straight line.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.799
Buffy the vampire slayer
Who’s that person there?

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.680
Every now and again, both in film and on television,
the action may get frantic enough that it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.989
just gets too demanding for the crew to micromanage
every meticulous detail.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.439
This happened in the fifth season of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer, in the episode “This

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.879
Year’s Girl” when Buffy and Faith got
into a fight and tumbled down the stairs.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.889
In the initial runs of the episode, the camera
man responsible for the following reaction

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.870
shot can actually be seen in frame to the
left of the staircase.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.939
Got a little too close their buddy!

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.739
Game of Thrones
Episode 9 of any season of Game of Thrones

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.989
is known to be the big one, where the chances
of character deaths or major revelations come

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:18.989
to light.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.730
Perhaps with all the action going on we as
fans failed to notice a huge chance for Danerys

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.919
between the events of episode 9 and 10.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.109
In the amphitheatre during the coordinated
attack by the sons of harpy, Dany can be seen

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.989
wearing a long elegant white gown yet in the
following episode, dirt aside, we can tell

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.329
Dany is wearing a slightly different outfit
that isn’t as regal or as long as per previous

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.329
dress.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.510
Other modifications include her shoulder pieces
and the visibility of her boots.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.290
I guess she has a secret stash of clothes
just hiding out in Essos.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.540
Breaking Bad
Considered to be one of the greatest shows

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.799
ever made, Breaking Bad can be excused when
it makes an error.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.200
The show was known for tossing in pop culture
and news events into its narrative but creator

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.230
Vince Gilligan jumped the gun in the fifth
season when the death of Osama bin Laden was

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.199
pointed out almost a year too early as the
show’s timetable put the fifth season in

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.449
2010, while bin Laden was killed in 2011.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.060
Gilligan would later admit to his mistake,
but since this is Breaking Bad, we can let

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.909
this one go.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.750
Westworld
The monster hit debut of 2016, Westworld flooded

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.020
the internet with crazy theories and appreciation
for weeks.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.870
While everyone was debating what could and
could not be real, they may have noticed a

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.770
few mistakes slip through the cracks.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.750
Westworld wasted no time in this matter, having
a continuity error slip past us in the first

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.750
episode.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.479
When Evan Rachel Wood’s Delores emerges
from the shop across the street from Maeve’s,

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.000
we see two gentlemen standing right next to
her.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
A quick reaction shot to Teddy is shown before
the action cuts back to Delores, only this

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.370
time; she is now in the presence of a single
gentleman with a tophat.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.080
There really is a glitch in the matrix!

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.770

big tv shows you never noticed.
