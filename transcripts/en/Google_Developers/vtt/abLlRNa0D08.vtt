SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.280
We're going to go ahead
and get started.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900
People are walking
in from lunch.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm Shiva Rajaraman, and I lead
the product team for our

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.200
platforms, effectively creation
as well as developers

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.770
and our APIs.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.120
And I'm joined here by Ibrahim,
who's working as a

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.370
developer programs engineer,
and Andy, who heads up

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.470
engineering.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.030
And we have a special guest
who'll join us in a bit.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.930
So the purpose of this session
is to do something we've

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.090
actually never done before,
which is to really lay out

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.870
some of the areas of development
around our

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.369
platform that we're most excited
about and give you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.310
some of those examples.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.980
And in addition to that, walk
through some actual executions

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.290
that are really stretching our
platform in new directions and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.340
which we'd like to
see more of.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.960
So with that, though, let me
first start off with a very

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.620
important announcement for
today, which is that we're

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.540
actually doing two things
when it comes to live

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.850
streaming on YouTube.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.530
One is that our live API is
wild, and we'd love to see

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.690
people start to use it.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.610
The second piece of it is that
we're actually opening up live

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.400
self-service on YouTube to a
much larger group of channels.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.620
So anyone who is basically a
channel in good standing and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.410
has over 1,000 subscribers on
YouTube, effective as of 12:45

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.740
today, can start to apply to
actually live stream through

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.190
the YouTube Platform.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.350
In the past, that was a very
restricted audience.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980
We're really ironing things out,
but we're ready to scale

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.900
it out to everyone.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620
So with that, though, there's no
better way to showcase what

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.400
we can do than a demo, which
Ibrahim will walk through.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.380
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi, everyone.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.820
Today I will actually show a
small demo from one of our

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.980
partners, Elgato's Game
Capture device.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.010
So I will play a game called
"APO Snow." And I will show it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.460
live on YouTube.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.490
So let's get it started.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.740
So I have my game here.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.790
And actually, the first thing
I will do is I will

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.590
authorize the game.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.120
So it will use my credentials
and create

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.822
the event on my behalf.

00:02:05.822 --> 00:02:07.420
Allow access.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.509
And now I can actually change
the game title.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.380
"Watch me Play at IO."

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.790
I can set the maximum
resolution I want.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.490
I'll see it public for now.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.090
And it will be like a gaming.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.870
And I'll start streaming.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.610
Right now, it actually-- or
device starts capturing the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.475
audio and video.

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:37.170
It encodes it.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.665
And it starts streaming
to YouTube.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.420
While it's actually preparing
this stream, let me check in

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.856
my own YouTube account.

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:52.270
And I see it's actually
preparing it.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.330
I see it here.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.230
"Watch me Play at IO." In less
than a minute, we will

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.490
actually see it live.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.380
And let me turn it
to my game here.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.820
You'll see it's on my tablet,
and I will start playing.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.615
And you'll see in a second
that it will be live.

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:12.930
And while I'm playing, actually,
Google's still

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.180
streaming it over there.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.945
Well, it's kind of harder
to play it online.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:23.760
Thought it was easier when I
was snowboarding myself.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.010
But we will see.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.450
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: You did
really good last night.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.700
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Yes.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.770
We can do few tricks, I guess.

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:39.850
Well, it was not actually like
showing my real stuff here,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.570
but let's go back to
the streaming.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.570
And it should be almost there.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.196
And let's see.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.595
Yeah, we are just like
few seconds away.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.500
And our stream is here.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.470
In only like, I guess, 5
or 10 seconds, we will

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.850
start seeing it live.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.060
And let me actually talk about
the structure I'm using today.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.480
Actually, I have my tablet.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.670
I'm playing the game and using
their device, actually, which

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.990
they already used the
Live Streaming API.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.230
It actually starts capturing the
whole audio and video and

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.430
compresses it.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.570
And it sends it to
my laptop here.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.430
And I start streaming from the
laptop using live API.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.760
Oh.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.225
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:23.475
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: We are live.

00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:38.190
That was just a few seconds
ago I played it.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.602
I will keep playing.

00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:43.554
See where [INAUDIBLE] is now?

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.610
Thanks, everyone.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.232
That was me, and I'm just
handing back to Shiva.

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:52.156
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:54.928
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Nice.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.178
Thanks for that.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.480
So thank you.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.780
That was great.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.700
It's always hard to pull these
technical things off during

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.200
one of these presentations.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.290
And it's amazing that we
have 15 cords, and

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.090
this actually worked.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.450
So congrats.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.850
So what I'm going to do is walk
through, again, something

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.060
we're doing for the first time,
which is how we look at

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.090
the developer ecosystem and
some areas that we're

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.900
particularly excited about.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.560
But first, I just wanted to
walk through some of our

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.910
principles.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.580
And so one of the key things
is we do want to make clear

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.270
and emphasize that we do see
ourselves as a platform.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.805
And as a platform, we're really
excited about people

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:48.360
who create good applications
that effectively extend

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.860
YouTube and take us into
verticals or domains that we,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.620
as a horizontal platform,
may not be good at.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.280
And some of these principles
are really, really key.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.100
So one of those is with the
launch of the Analytics API

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.070
which is live, effectively,
as well this week.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.110
We are very excited about this
idea saying, hey, YouTube is

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.590
one of the greatest
focus groups

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.040
that's ever been created.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.420
So how can we get that data
out to people who can then

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.930
take it to verticals and take
it to different applications

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.200
and really extend it
and make it useful?

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.920
So one of these principles is
get that data out and let

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.760
people use it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.400
We don't believe in just
hoarding data and keeping it

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.760
isolated to the platform.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.310
The next one is very important,
which is this idea

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.550
of embracing developers that
really extend YouTube.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.880
For the most part, what we try
to discourage more and more is

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.490
just building a bunch of YouTube
clones that mimic

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.110
everything we do with
a different brand.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.950
And we'd prefer to have people
who take us into the world of

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.630
food, the world of gaming, for
example, and take us into

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.600
different areas which might
actually make YouTube both

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.510
better, or something that can
sustain on their own and

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.880
develop a unique audience, or at
least take our audience and

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.160
go deeper with it.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.610
We'd like to see more of that
happening in the ecosystem.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.550
For the most part, it's quite
phenomenal what is out there,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.930
but building a clone app
typically is hard to sustain

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.240
both from a business model
perspective and an audience

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.900
perspective.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.440
So go a little deeper.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.720
It usually pays off.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.960
The next one, which is also
very important, is that we

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.140
have millions of partners
who monetize on

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.720
YouTube, the platform.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.170
So one of the big principles
we have is that as content

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.240
flows from YouTube into
developed apps in the wild,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.660
preserve those creator
interests too.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.530
Usually that's about
monetization, but sometimes

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.630
it's also about how can you
start to help those creators

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.930
and do something special
for them?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.050
And I'll walk through some
examples of that.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.460
And then finally, we'd like an
experience where if you come

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.130
to YouTube as a viewer, and
you personalize that

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.730
experience, when you go into
another app, take advantage of

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.120
that personalization.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.900
And while we're not talking
about it today, someone like

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.420
Flipboard's really a good
example of that.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.720
You can set up your YouTube
channel in Flipboard.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.450
You can auth to YouTube.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.640
And then you can get your
personalized subscriptions on

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.870
YouTube right within
Flipboard.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.760
And so those types of
solutions are great.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.910
And rather than recurating
things for users, which

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.450
sometimes make sense, sometimes
it makes sense to

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.060
build on the profile that
someone's set up on YouTube

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.310
and extend it further.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.490
So to start with, I thought one
great example would be a

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.090
media company, actually,
Tastemade, that is extending

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.630
our platform in all of
these dimensions.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.900
And we're very excited about
them, because they're doing

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.080
this in many different ways that
really opens up YouTube

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.760
to a whole new audience.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.800
And one of the things with
Tastemade, even their media

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.220
company-- it's probably the
first media company that's

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.110
ever existed that has
more engineers

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.320
than business people.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.610
So it's a great example that
they actually believe in our

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.830
APIs, believe in the platform,
but are doing a ton of things

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.620
to actually extend it.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.090
And the best way to showcase
them is to actually jump into

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.700
a video of an example that
they've created using our

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.190
platform and using our audience,
but using a lot of

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.440
tools that we'll go into.

00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:15.774
And it's right after lunch, so I
don't mind showing you food.

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:37.789
[HINDI SONG PLAYING]

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:39.270
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.480
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: So this video
is two people who've

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.270
effectively created
a cooking show by

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.162
traveling around the world.

00:09:46.162 --> 00:09:48.335
And as you can see, it's
very polished.

00:09:48.335 --> 00:09:50.150
The food really shines.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.660
Some nice titles and editing
that goes into it.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.630
Looks a little more tasty than
what we served you today.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.400
So go ahead and pause.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.200
OK, jump to-- yeah.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.560
And what's going on behind the
scenes is that Tastemade, as a

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.180
network, is effectively saying,
hey, what if anyone in

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.720
the world, one person, two
people, could effectively

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.660
become the next Gordon Ramsay?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.110
What are the tools they need to
get access to editing and

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.580
production expertise
in any region?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.980
How can they translate that to
different places and create

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.870
good content like this?

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.620
Second piece that they're
really doing is

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.990
really going very deep.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.880
And they're going deep into food
and travel and trying to

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.880
really own that domain by
creating hundreds, if not

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.100
thousands, of channels in every
different country in the

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.560
globe, but also creating a tool
set so that people can

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.930
actually join a network and
cross-promote and find their

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.550
audience, without having
to do that one by one.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.070
You can almost think of them
as like this platform for

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.870
content apps in the food
and travel space.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.290
Then finally, they do some
things that we as YouTube are

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.270
not so good at, which is
effectively building a

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.730
community where if you're an
aspiring person trying to

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.350
create a cooking show, you can
find peers who are really good

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.080
at some of the types of skills
that you need to actually

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.740
build a cooking show, which
means you might want to find

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.530
someone who's really good with
a slow-mo camera, because

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.700
there's nothing better than
showing the spices bounce in

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.170
the pan when you kick off
one of these shows.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.380
Or you might want to find
someone who's really good, an

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.930
expert of lighting and different
food angles.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.720
That's something that's going to
be very hard to find in the

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.290
wild unless someone builds a
community around it, which is

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.240
what they've done.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.790
So one of the things they've
done is effectively created

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.340
these community pages around
every creator on YouTube.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.830
And they use our Analytics API,
as well as our Data APIs,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.590
to get the information there.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.280
And then they extend it by
effectively saying, hey, this

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.470
person's a chef.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.620
This person's actually
a great food editor.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.660
This person's a great
food copywriter.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.880
And you can find these people
in almost Kickstarter-style.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.440
These projects can now be
funded, which are effectively

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.010
video projects, around new
channels on YouTube.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.350
They also do some great stuff
around the Analytics API.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.850
They've been in the beta
program, and they've been

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.230
pulling things like subscribers
or views.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.040
One of the things that they'd
love to see happen is that for

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.160
any creator, you have a
currency, a reputation, that

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.870
gets built up around YouTube.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.050
And so as people are looking
around for people to

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.870
collaborate with, like a
Ukrainian chef who's

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.100
effectively looking for a local
community to create a

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.620
good show, what they can do is
look up those people and then

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.310
see the videos they've produced,
and see how many

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.140
subscribers, those channels,
and how much watch time and

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.250
views those videos generated.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.790
So it's this reputation layer,
specific, again, to food and

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.360
travel, that they're adding
on top of our platform.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.980
It's really exciting, and
they're making the UIs work

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.190
really well for anyone who
might be a casual user.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.970
And next, what they've done is
said, particularly with food

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.970
and stuff, it makes sense to
have a magazine-style mobile

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.170
app for this.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.310
They've taken all the Tastemade
content on YouTube,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.680
using the Player APIs, have
put that into an app.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.090
And in turn, they do things
that make sense for food.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.340
In this case, when you're
watching one of these videos,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.120
you can actually see a full
downloadable recipe for those

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.100
videos as well, which makes
perfect sense and is not

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.460
something right now
that's available

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.930
on the YouTube platform.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.710
So it's a good example of an
app, tons of videos, that they

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.440
extended to make sense
for their vertical.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.490
OK, with that, I'd like to zoom
out a little bit and talk

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.800
more about the developer
ecosystem and some areas we're

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.020
particularly excited about.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.400
And then Andy's going to come
up and walk us through some

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.650
showcase examples.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.940
So this is the first time we're
actually doing this and

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.820
actually consciously thinking
about what are some of the

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.340
segments we're excited about.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.320
So the labels are still rough,
but I'll try to explain them.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.260
In the top left is creation.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.905
You saw things like live
streaming and capture.

00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:07.240
It's very exciting for us.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.440
We'll walk you through some
examples, including a guest

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.610
star on the discovery
and context side.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.450
These are the true viewer
consumption-oriented apps.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.240
So folks like BuzzFeed who might
be all about news and

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.040
really interesting moments.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.840
They are now integrating video
fluidly so it's keeping

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.170
engagement in their apps high.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.070
Then we have some folks on
the enterprise side.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.760
So enterprise is very hot right
now, partially because

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.330
there's lot of money
flowing to it.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.560
But also, when we look to the
future, we think about tens,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.670
if not hundreds, of $100 million
run-rate businesses

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.640
being born on our platform.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.300
And in order to do that, we need
platform companies out

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.290
there, who are building
on our APIs to

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.330
service those verticals.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.290
So we'll talk through a few
examples of that, but

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.030
Tastemade is one good example,
which is how can a media

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.370
company, in food, actually
survive and

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.540
also thrive on YouTube?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.710
And they're doing a bunch of
things to extend that.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.470
And we'll continue that.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.730
And then finally, analytics
and promotion.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.230
With the Analytics API out
there, as well as things like

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.630
posting through the APIs, we're
excited about folks who

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.310
are taking our data and
verticalizing it, whether it

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.800
be for music, more
horizontally, or

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.940
cross-platform.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.640
We'll walk through some
examples there.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.290
So we're going to start
with creation for

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.720
our showcase examples.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.460
And I'm going to invite someone
to come up on stage--

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.590
Jussi?--

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.916
to do a demo of someone
doing something cool.

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:35.096
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Hi, guys.

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:37.460
How are you doing today?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.610
Everybody excited by the current
Chromebook Pixel?

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.230
At least I am.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.700
So my name is Jussi Laakkonen.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.680
I'm the founder and
CEO of Applifier.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.910
And in Applifier,
we're building a

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.380
service called Everyplay.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.840
And Everyplay's about getting
those elusive but awesome game

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.890
moments out from mobile games
and into YouTube, Facebook,

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.990
Twitter, and through those
things to your friends and

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.750
family to enjoy together.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.820
The reason why we're doing this
is the word-of-mouth is

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.780
the number one way how people
decide to download a new

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.530
mobile game.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.260
We did a survey in March, and
we found across 1,800 people

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.250
that word-of-mouth was
neck-and-neck to App Store.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.710
And this is corroborated by
studies by [? e-dar ?],

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.630
Forrester, and Nielsen.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.630
The best way to discover a game
is when a friend pulls

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.550
out an Android phone and tells
you, you got to play this!

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.560
Check it out.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.880
That moment of social proof
needs, I can see what this

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.340
game is about, is really,
truly awesome.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.440
But the problem with this is
there's only so many times I

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.220
can go out and have a latte
with my friends.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.480
So instead of that, could we
take this offline moment and

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.700
take it online?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.620
And that's what Everyplay's
about.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.470
In our survey, we also asked
mobile players on how do they

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.550
feel about sharing.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.840
And we were very pleased to
discover that 20% say that

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.770
sharing video replays
from mobile games

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.470
is extremely important.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.030
Not somewhat important,
not quite important,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.780
but extremely important.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.700
Now that's one piece.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.220
So we know there's a
set of people who

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.310
want to share content.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.690
But what about video?

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.109
Is this a great way to capture
the dynamic nature of gaming?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.589
And we found out that,
yes, it is.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.660
In the same survey, we also
asked them, what have you done

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.840
after watching game-related
video?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.250
And nearly 50% said that they
had immediately decided to

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.020
download the game.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.930
And also another roughly 20%
said they decided not to.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.630
So video drives decision
making.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.990
And it drives, also, referral
to friends.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.680
Hey, you got to check this out,
this crazy replay that I

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.700
saw from a game.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.660
Now with that, the challenge
is how do we get an awesome

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.630
replay out of "Bad Piggies"
and into YouTube?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.790
And that's where Everyplay
comes in.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.850
So we looked at Elgato, which
is a fantastic piece of

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.560
hardware, but I think it's even
better if you don't need

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.500
any additional software or
any additional hardware.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.240
So now we're going to go into
a really hairy live demo.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.010
So let's see how
this plays out.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.130
So I'm going to switch
over to this one.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.270
So here we have a ordinary
box-standard iPad mini,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.700
running the latest build of
Rovio's "Bad Piggies."

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.890
And let's turn on the sound,
so we can hear

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.800
what's going on.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.780
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: So when I'm
thinking about Replay-Capture,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.500
I'm capturing something that I
do not know whether it's going

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.800
to be cool or bad.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.540
It's going to happen.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.980
And I'm just going to be playing
a game, not thinking

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.960
about really replays.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.430
And I'm just going to take a
level and start playing.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.840
And so here, this is a level
I too start already, but I

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.070
thought it was such a fantastic
contraption of this

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.410
pig taking a ride
with four-wheel

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.700
vehicles, so let's go.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.016
So I'm going to send the piggie
on his fly, and I'm

00:18:58.016 --> 00:19:00.040
going to tap on the Capture.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.590
And we're now capturing a
gameplay as it happens on the

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.650
background while
the user plays.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.720
No additional hardware, no
additional software.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.450
It's baked straight
into the game.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.210
And this is actually live on
the App Store right now.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.380
So you can get "Bad Piggies"
from Rovio with Everyplay.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.480
And now what we can do, we
can check out the replay.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.540
So this is what we
just recorded.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.290
And it's now on the device.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.380
And obviously, the next step
is to get it out from the

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.060
device, so we want
to share it.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.550
So we open up Everyplay and
the sharing interface.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:37.230
So Everyplay is an embedded
application within "Bad

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.810
Piggies." So we're still
in the same game.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.320
We're going to give this a
title, "Bad piggies." And

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.060
obviously, we want to
share it to YouTube.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.610
We can share it to Facebook
and Twitter.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.540
I'm going to do that too.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.660
And I'm going to tap on Share.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.620
There we go.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.230
So now it starts uploading.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.195
And I'm posting to Facebook.

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.620
So I'm going to send
it to Facebook.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.520
I'm going to send
it to Twitter.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.010
And obviously, I want to also
send it out to YouTube, which

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:06.930
happens on the background.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.000
So we use the YouTube Upload
API, so that we upload first

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.690
to our own servers.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.540
And from our own servers,
we upload it to YouTube.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.050
So while this being transcoded
by our servers and YouTube's

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.070
servers, let's look quickly
around Everyplay.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.870
So Everyplay's really kind of a
vertically-oriented solution

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.930
for mobile gaming.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.230
We're building a model name
that you can follow

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.860
interesting game creators,
replays, and discover games

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.010
that you haven't maybe
seen before.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.150
So this is me on Everyplay.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.390
This is my home feed,
people I follow.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.690
So we have a social
follower model.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.440
So why don't we go and
check out a replay

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.830
from the Popular tab?

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.683
So there's a whole lot of stuff
from "Bad Piggies." Why

00:20:46.683 --> 00:20:51.135
don't we check out this
crazy contraption?

00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:55.480
This has about 100,000 views
in a couple of days.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:02.160
So this guy built a rocket
out of a bad piggie.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.090
So it's going on a flight.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.390
It looks pretty good.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.390
Oh, there we go.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.670
So Jarek's just favorited my
tweet, so I should have turned

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.430
off notifications
for this demo.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.650
And obviously, if I haven't yet
played "Bad Piggies," I

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.780
can just tap on the Install
Now button.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.740
And it opens up the app sheet
from the App Store.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.300
And now I can install
the application.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.640
So it's kind of an embedded
discovery mechanism, also, for

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.540
the creators.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.230
One cool thing we also do, which
we don't yet have on

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.450
"Bad Piggies," but I'm going to
show you very quickly, is

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.580
that we have the opportunity to
have the players actually

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.570
provide commentary from their
games that they're playing.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.600
So well, I would show you if
this loads, but it doesn't

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.310
seem to be loading.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.630
So let's try again.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.750
Somebody once said that doing
live demos is like

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.500
playing with fire.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.320
You're going to get burned.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.430
So let's do this very quickly
if it loads-- yes.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.760
And I'm going to
go to my Home.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.370
And so I have a very special
message for all of you here at

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.270
I/O which I pre-recorded,
actually, at the YouTube

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.500
headquarters, where
I was yesterday.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.465
And didn't play.

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.715
Let's try again.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.926
The wireless is a little
bit flunky here.

00:22:19.926 --> 00:22:20.918
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:24.820
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Hey, everyone
at I/O. This is "Shadowgun," a

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.230
Unity 4 game that we're using to
demonstrate the performance

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.790
of a game running Everyplay.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.925
And not only that, we are
also demonstrating this

00:22:32.925 --> 00:22:34.410
shot, the face cam.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.330
So that's me talking and lets
players annotate and comment

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.012
their game play.

00:22:39.012 --> 00:22:39.390
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.120
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: So by now,
I'm pretty sure we have

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.180
YouTube ready with the upload
that we've done previously.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.170
So I'm logged into YouTube.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.755
I'm going to go into
my uploads.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.660
And there are a couple of
"Bad Piggies" replays.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.840
It seems that the latest one
didn't yet make it here.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.470
Because it's a server-server
transition.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.800
And there's a couple
of encoding passes.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.260
So we're going to look
at an older version

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.050
that I did just yesterday.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.600
But trust me, it does work.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.710
But we cannot quite control how
long it takes to YouTube

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.960
to encode a video and
put it online.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.280
I'm sure there's like
a fast track switch

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.530
I could pull, Shiva?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.240
So there.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.040
So Everyplay is an integrated
SDK that goes inside the game,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.480
automatically records the
gameplay, and lets the player

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.310
share with their friends and
family on YouTube and other

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.600
social networks.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.210
So as a summary--

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.121
and so we're going to
go back to this.

00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:45.630
As a summary, our roadmap is
to use Data API to provide

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.700
discovery, to aggregate these
videos on YouTube.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.570
And we definitely are planning
also to help people to bring

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.430
more gaming content into
Everyplay by allowing them to

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.330
embed YouTube videos.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.310
We're really excited about
the launch of Live.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.820
We support live broadcasting
in the SDK.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.330
So we're definitely going
to be integrating that.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.580
And my visuals also have
Annotation API, so you

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.720
actually add annotation
to videos and portrait

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.240
orientation.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.460
There's so many games on
portrait orientation.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.030
If you're interested in
discovering a little bit more

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.760
about what we found on our
survey of 1,800 mobile gamers,

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.190
the link is here.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.980
You can find a presentation
on that.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.180
And you can grab me out doors.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.830
We have a food truck at the
corner Ford and Howard, if you

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.880
want to come out for
a cup of coffee and

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.820
more demos of Everyplay.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.889
Thank you for having me.

00:24:29.889 --> 00:24:35.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:35.048 --> 00:24:36.690
ANDY BERKHEIMER:
Thanks, Jussi.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.270
Now I wanted to go through
a few other examples of

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:44.380
applications that showcase the
full set of APIs we have and

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.450
help set the stage for many of
the follow-on talks that we

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.050
have going on throughout
Google I/O

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.690
both today and tomorrow.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.810
And after that, we'll leave the
floor for your questions.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.170
First app I wanted to talk about
quickly is an app called

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.200
Woowa Brothers from Korea.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.730
Woowa Brothers is a great
example of a mobile-focused

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.700
food review app.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.500
One of the things that we
really like about Woowa

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.780
Brothers is as you go through,
you select your food, you eat

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.230
your food, you rate the
places you've been to.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.350
As part of the rating process,
you can also take a video of

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.950
the food you've just eaten,
really help provide a rich

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.060
example of what this restaurant
is about, and

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.970
upload it directly to YouTube,
and then watch it

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.500
directly in your feed.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.430
We think this is a great example
of both our Upload

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.140
APIs as well as our Android
Player API.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.060
And it helps both the Woowa
Brothers bring a great

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.250
immersive experience within
their application.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.920
It also gives them a platform
for distributing these videos

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.710
globally through YouTube, which
both draws attention to

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.840
their application as
well as to the

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.090
restaurants featured therein.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.960
After you've had a good bit
of dinner, it's time

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.910
to play a few games.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.090
And of course, one great example
we have of integrated

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.850
capture into gameplay is "FIFA
2013." I know our developer

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.670
programs engineer Jarek is
very fond of this game,

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.970
especially when he's reliving
the glory moments of his

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.580
hometown, Wisla Krakow.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.490
So directly within the game, you
can capture your greatest

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.100
goal scoring events, share them
with your friends and

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.560
family, and get the best
bragging rights.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.622
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Five
views, whoo-hoo.

00:26:34.622 --> 00:26:37.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.810
ANDY BERKHEIMER: And of course,
earlier, I wanted to

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.630
actually quickly hold up the
game capture HD, which we

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.520
demonstrated earlier
with Ibrahim.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.480
So what the game capture HD
actually allows you to do is

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.680
take the HDMI output from any
device and live broadcast it

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.920
to YouTube through the Live
Broadcast APIs that we've

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.170
announced today.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.310
On the consumption side, we also
have a number of examples

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.230
of great vertical integrations
of YouTube content into

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.480
consumption applications.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.850
A lot of folks are familiar with
BuzzFeed, and BuzzFeed's

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.460
goal is to surface the latest
and greatest of the web, no

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.440
matter what type of
media it may be.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.330
And so a lot of the latest and
greatest of the web can be

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.130
found on YouTube.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.180
And so it makes sense for
BuzzFeed to have a very, very

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.480
smooth Android Player API
integration, so that within

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.050
BuzzFeed, you can find and
consume whatever media people

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.300
may be talking about.

00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:40.730
And you can see here the
transition where directly

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.960
within the BuzzFeed app you're
able to go through to and

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.230
watch full-screen
YouTube video.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.340
Interesante is a great startup
down in Argentina which is

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.290
building a way for users to
collect and share content of

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.540
interest to them across
all types of media.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.750
And we think they're a really
innovative example of using

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.960
our Topics API to power
some of their

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.020
recommendations engine.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.540
So they're able to use the
videos that you're interested

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:13.060
in to recommend other types of
content that may not even be

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.940
video that's also of
interest to you.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.720
And vice versa--

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.050
they can use their knowledge
about your interests in

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.310
imagery and text media
to recommend

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.955
YouTube content as well.

00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:26.370
[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.330
ANDY BERKHEIMER: I lastly
wanted to demonstrate

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:34.930
Soundslice, which shows off the
integration of the Player

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.930
API into a music and guitar
learning application, so that

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.670
as you're learning guitar,
you're able to play along with

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.050
your favorite YouTube stars,
whether that be the actual

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.660
stars or just a cover band.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.560
And with that, I'd like to hand
it off to Shiva, who will

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.040
talk through a few other
examples in our ecosystem.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.270
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Cool.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.760
We're going to shift back to the
back office and start with

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.600
analytics and promotion and
talk about some ways that

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.100
people are extending
our Analytics API

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.450
for particular domains.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.670
So one of the exciting things
that's happening right now for

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.250
us is that we have a lot of
content networks and new media

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.170
companies that are launching
channels on YouTube.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.920
And one of the key value
propositions they have for

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.050
their networks is really
to understand how to

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.270
cross-promote and also give
feedback from the overall

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.480
network to someone creating
something cool, so that they

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.320
have more ideas about what
they should actually be

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.110
creating that make sense
for their audience.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.840
So a great example of
this is Tubular.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.360
And what Tubular is doing, in
this case with AwesomenessTV

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.640
and network, is say, hey, for
any one of your channels out

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.835
there, you can come into our
dashboard and get a sense of

00:29:41.835 --> 00:29:43.720
who your audience is.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.790
And not only for that audience,
you can start to get

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.580
a sense of who in that audience
is influential.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.530
But also what other things
are they also watching?

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.530
So if you think about that from
a network's perspective,

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.460
it's really simple.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.330
It's, hey, this is great.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.480
It's an awesome channel.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.340
I seem to have built
a great audience.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.150
Who should I collaborate with?

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.090
On the other side of it, what
we'd like to do is start to

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.430
keep extending this in terms
of thinking about analytics

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.130
integrating with Topics API.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.100
What else are they watching?

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.180
And that gives you ideas about
what to create and who to

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.320
partner with.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.150
So it's a great example of
someone who's taken,

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.630
effectively, a basic firehose
of data that we've serviced,

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.750
blends it together and
makes it work and

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.200
starts to extend it.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.690
And very importantly, they also
take a look at analytics

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.630
from YouTube and combine that
with Facebook and Twitter and

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.540
other sources, so we
can create a great

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.170
cross-platform picture.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.730
We love to see these
things out there.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.870
And they're becoming very
successful, because this type

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.370
of knowledge is, for the most
part, missing from most

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.620
content creators.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.420
Now, take the same theme and
take it deep into a vertical.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.340
This one's Next Big Sound.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.220
And what Next Big Sound does is
not just for a horizontal

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.690
platform across multiple
different types of creators,

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.670
but goes deep into music.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.030
And they create a slightly
different UI.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.750
And their UI is more focused on
what's trending in terms of

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.670
songs and artists across
various platforms.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.310
And they really bring
that to life.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.220
So you can see here how you
have YouTube video views,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.200
you've got Instagram likes,
and you've got basically a

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.980
trend meter associated
with them.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.640
The goal is that anyone can look
at a particular artist,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.650
in this case Bruno Mars, and
get a sense of a complete

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.070
picture across platform
about what's going

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.440
on with that artist.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.460
And they've made this UI very
friendly so that you can

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.780
imagine even the artist
manager or the artists

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.190
themselves being able to pop
into this UI and understand it

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.820
and hopefully get some
actionable insight

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.560
immediately.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.340
So these are great examples of
things where you just take

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.520
data and you start to bring it
to life and visualize it, that

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.780
you can do very different
things

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.330
for different audiences.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.970
And we're seeing these things
start to sprinkle and appear

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.550
on the ecosystem, but there's
so much to do here.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.450
We know there's a big theme
of big data and

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.420
that type of thing.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.550
But YouTube's a great example as
probably one of the biggest

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.760
data sources on the planet
that still has

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.420
yet to be mined fully.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.440
And while our APIs are fairly
new, this is the right time to

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.440
start using them, because
we need that feedback.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.010
What can you actually
do with it?

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.380
What's missing from it?

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.320
And we have a lot of different
sessions today and tomorrow

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.890
that are focused on
using that API.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.950
So if you have a chance,
come check them out.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.530
I'm going to jump
ahead of this.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.490
The next one is getting into
the enterprise side.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.390
We talked about Tastemade
already.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.600
I wanted to show you another
one called ZEFR, which is

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.000
focused on the rights
management business.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.570
And this is very--

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.080
if you'd seen our CMS, you'll
say, wow, this is a huge

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.970
improvement.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.980
But I think one of the key
things is that when you look

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.510
at someone like ZEFR, what
they're doing is effectively

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.110
saying, hey, we manage content
for a lot of media

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.630
companies out there.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.080
And we want to make it easy
for them to understand who

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.770
their fans are, as expressed by
actually uploading YouTube

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.910
content, but also what's
the ones that are most

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:04.890
important to act on?

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.040
Where are my revenue
opportunities?

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.090
So what they have is a team of
people who come into this

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.360
dashboard every day.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.150
And what they do is build based
on our Content ID APIs

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.720
and our Analytics APIs to put
together a very good picture.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.590
And the picture is, here
is content I can claim.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:23.450
And I can make a decision about
whether to use that to

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.480
block that content, to monetize
that content, or even

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.510
further promote that content.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.880
And they've made a very friendly
UI which effectively

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.040
creates a smart queue on
top of all this data.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.880
So as a studio, I can look at
this and say, what's hot,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.540
what's trending, and what's
revenue-opportunity, and act

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.940
on it immediately.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.470
So these are things, too, where,
as enterprise gets more

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.350
consumer-friendly, we're excited
to see people actually

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.350
building very robust businesses
on the back ends of

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.270
something that back in the day
was really just thought of as

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.450
a way to just block content
on YouTube.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.510
Now it's actually a huge
business opportunity for these

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.820
people, and increasingly,
an opportunity to

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.070
connect with your fans.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.330
And with that, I'm going to turn
it back to Andy for the

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.170
recipe book behind this.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.409
ANDY BERKHEIMER: I just wanted
to finish off by summarizing a

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:15.540
little bit about all the
different components that go

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.580
into building these applications
that YouTube

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.719
provides and to lay out the
landscape of what you can dive

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.880
into to learn more about at
Google I/O this week.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.460
A lot of these applications
highlighted a number of our

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.420
latest APIs--

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.510
our Live Broadcasting API, our
Topics API, our Android Player

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.480
API, and our Analytics APIs.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.120
And we have sessions and
code labs around many

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.370
of those this week.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.340
Also, we're talking a lot about
some of the things that

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.929
go on behind the scenes
at YouTube.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.530
This is something we haven't
done at I/O before.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.199
This is something we're just
trying out this year, which is

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:56.940
discussing not only code labs
around the APIs themselves,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.450
but also sharing knowledge from
our own engineering team

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.140
around many of the development
challenges and problems that

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.770
come up in working with video,
both to help you develop

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.660
better applications as well as
to give you a sense of some of

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.730
the heavy lifting and
infrastructure that goes on

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.140
behind the scenes supporting
these APIs.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.990
We have a number of talks going
into details about how

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.510
we look at problems like
adaptive streaming, how we

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.390
look at incorporating video
encoding and decoding

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.150
capabilities into applications,
as well as some

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.280
of the user design challenges
and business challenges around

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.430
building these applications
around these APIs.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.170
And if you remember nothing
else, just wanted to summarize

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.260
the talk for you.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.590
A lot of what we're talking
about here today is ways that

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.780
we extend YouTube, not
just recreate it.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.590
How do we create a larger
pie for both our

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.040
creators and our viewers?

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.530
And we've seen a lot of people
have success here by diving

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.840
deep into a vertical, diving
deep into a region, diving

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.530
deep into the specialized areas
where a broad horizontal

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.650
platform like YouTube will
never go on its own.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.690
We really want to empower
creators.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.880
YouTube started off as, and
still exists today as,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.490
Broadcast Yourself.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.060
And it turns out that there's
still a lot of challenges and

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.390
friction points in the ecosystem
and just in the

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:24.460
tooling to create and produce
a video that we see needs to

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.290
be met there.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.280
And lastly, a lot of the APIs
we're going to be talking

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.550
about this week are very new.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.490
Some of them have just
launched this week.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.720
The rest have all launched
within the

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.320
last couple of months.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.990
While we think that they're in
pretty good shape, we by no

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:39.430
means think that
they're final.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.990
And we're looking here this week
to get your feedback on

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.305
ways that we can improve them.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.580
So I just wanted to say
thank you, and leave

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.948
the floor for questions.

00:36:50.948 --> 00:36:58.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.740
ANDY BERKHEIMER: And if you have
questions, please go up

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.885
to one of the mics.

00:37:02.885 --> 00:37:04.370
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.000
Phillip from ZEFR.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.870
First, I got to say, we got to
get you a better screen shot.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.390
That's just embarrassing.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.930
So you talked a lot
about the APIs.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.320
And our business utilizes
them quite a bit.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.640
And what we keep running
into problems with

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.180
is the query limits--

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.130
the API quota limitations.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.640
There seems to be one group
that's in charge of the

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.630
partner, one group that's in
charge of the Analytics API,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.070
and another group that's in
charge of the GData one.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.236
And as soon as we seem to make
headway with one, then the

00:37:36.236 --> 00:37:38.120
other one, we sort of
lose touch with.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.870
So as our business grows, it
seems like the incremental

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.320
adjustments to those API limits
really sort of hold us

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.060
back from actually being
able to move quicker.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.830
So I'm just curious, what can
we do to actually get

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.330
something set up to be more
reasonable and help you guys

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.810
help us, and vice versa, so
that we don't have to keep

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.150
pestering you guys every week,
every month, to say, hey,

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.600
look, we've hit it again,
now let's go?

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.230
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Yeah.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.350
It's a great question.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.620
I think one of the things
we're doing is trying to

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.292
reorganize in some ways so that
we have single points of

00:38:11.292 --> 00:38:13.430
contact for key partners,
particularly as they reach a

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.040
certain scale.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.120
And so that working through key
points of contacts, you

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.090
can actually work through and
start to say, here's my plan

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.530
over the next two quarters.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.380
Here are the milestones
I expect to hit.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.600
And instead of hitting them and
then reacting, which is

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.380
kind of our status quo right
now, instead coming up with a

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.730
plan over the next year that
says that this is probably

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:34.690
going to be our demand.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.560
We can keep a check on it but
effectively forecasting that

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.460
out and supporting
you accordingly.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.180
This is something we've just
started reorganizing around to

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.190
support in the last
few months.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.310
So expect it to roll out to you,
and you'll start to get

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.200
in touch with some of our
fantastic dev rel team, but

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.830
also a new team that's coming
together to be more of a

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.080
partner manager.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.900
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Henry
Sztul with Shelby.tv.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.650
You guys have done a great job
with making accessing videos

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.360
on Android more accessible.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.640
It think it was a new
API initiative this

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.660
past year or so.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.370
Do you see that moving to iOS
in the near future, as well?

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:18.575
Or is that mainly an
Android-only direction?

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.090
ANDY BERKHEIMER: We're
actually looking.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.160
We'd love to bring that
to iOS as well.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.770
We're looking into ways we can
do that that kind of meet our

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.220
needs in terms of being
able to provide

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.930
updates in a timely way.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.040
We were able to find a
solution on Android.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.500
We haven't been able to find
a solution on iOS yet.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.722
That's something that's
definitely top of our mind and

00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:42.930
something that we're
looking into.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.340
But we don't have any sort of
specific news to share there.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.590
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.725
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's
[? Layton. ?]

00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:53.940
Just a simple question
for you guys.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.710
Are you considering any video
post-processing stuff like

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:02.190
reduce the noise or bringing
brighter to the video content?

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.920
Thanks.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.510
ANDY BERKHEIMER:
In short, yes.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.780
Actually, one of our talks
this week is around video

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.670
stabilization and around some of
the post-processing that we

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.640
make available there.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.740
If you actually look into our
upload tools, I think we've

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.740
recently started to expose some
of the controls to enable

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.670
a few of those post-processing
steps through our Upload API.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.760
And we have a lot of great
engineering teams doing

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.060
research into how we can bring
more of those capabilities

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.670
into our pipeline and
then expose those

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.060
through Upload API.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.660
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Now's a great
time for feedback on that,

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.560
actually, particularly around
the stabilization talk, but

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.670
generally for us too.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.010
ANDY BERKHEIMER: And I
definitely encourage you to go

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.360
to the stabilization
talk this week.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.510
And you'll be able to talk to
the developers there and

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.680
provide some feedback on what
else you'd like to see.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.520
AUDIENCE: Um, [? Megan. ?]

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.620
So the gate G.APIs you
have, you've got v2

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.710
and you've got v3.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:01.240
I'm curious when v2 will be
fully deprecated, just because

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.270
v3 isn't completely flushed out,
so we find ourselves sort

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.253
of balancing between when
we make a v2 call

00:41:06.253 --> 00:41:08.060
and a v3 query call.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.090
And then the other ones that
[INAUDIBLE] came up here has

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:15.640
to do with the Freebase in the
topic IDs, in terms of how

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.300
those things are tagged and how

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.960
frequently those are updated.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.110
Just an example being we had a
Daft Punk music video that I

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.860
had in a integration test,
thinking that the topic IDs

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.920
were always going to
stay the same.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.935
And it went from having four
tags that were fairly specific

00:41:31.935 --> 00:41:34.490
to accurate to the last time I
ran it, it just had one tag

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.810
for electronic music genre.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.660
So I'm just trying to figure
out what the process is on

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.260
keeping those updated
and how much we can

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.240
rely on those things.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.030
ANDY BERKHEIMER: Remind
me what your first

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.142
question was, again?

00:41:47.142 --> 00:41:48.380
AUDIENCE: v2 versus v3.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.420
ANDY BERKHEIMER: Yes.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.880
So v2 versus v3.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.430
We're working to bring v3 up to
complete parity as quickly

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.400
as possible.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.000
And we're not going
to deprecate v2

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.290
until that's the case.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.650
And so that's the short
answer there.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.000
And as we get v3 to that point,
we'll announce it and

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.220
roll it out and expect some
communication there in the

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.710
next couple of months.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:13.920
On the Topics API, I don't
actually know directly myself

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.260
what the update process is, what
guarantees we make there.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.920
We actually have Shirley and a
couple of engineers from the

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.195
Topics team who will be giving
a talk later this week.

00:42:21.195 --> 00:42:23.100
And it'd be great to ask
them that question.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.860
They can go into a lot more
detail there than I can.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.140
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Yeah.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.250
And I'll add one
point on that.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.420
Right now we kind of give you
one central topic around a

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.160
video through the API.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.990
So one of the things
we want to do is--

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.190
we don't have the specific
date on this.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.330
Go to that session and provide
them feedback, but expand the

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.390
number of topics.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.590
The issue is that centrality can
shift over time for many

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.590
of these things.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.050
And one becomes a meme, and
something else happens.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.450
We get more metadata.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.630
So what we want to do is give
developers, effectively, a

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.000
broader spectrum of the topics
associated with video, such

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.240
that you can rank and decide
what's important for you.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.674
And you have more stability.

00:42:55.674 --> 00:42:57.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I noticed
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.220
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Right.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:09.670
AUDIENCE: How much of focus is
our support for TV devices?

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.780
And I ask in particular
because this week, you

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.430
launched pay-for channels, but
none of those videos actually

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.165
work on my Google TV devices.

00:43:21.035 --> 00:43:22.595
ANDY BERKHEIMER: Ah.

00:43:22.595 --> 00:43:24.120
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: And you're
talking specifically about

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.790
consumption, not developers
building for a TV.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:27.600
Is that correct?

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:27.955
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:43:27.955 --> 00:43:28.640
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Both.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.540
OK.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.310
ANDY BERKHEIMER: So actually,
we're rolling that out.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.160
That will be coming
on TV devices.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.980
That's actually--

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.560
it's available on some of our
devices today that'll be

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.390
coming out to Google TV
devices very soon.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.390
And when it comes out to Google
TV, it will also be

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.390
baked into the Android Player
API, which works on

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.690
Google TV as well.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.750
So that's when you've got
about eight different

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.440
platforms out there, getting
them all launched on the same

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.270
day is pretty tricky.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.390
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: And just to
add some color to that.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.650
As we think about distribution
of YouTube app on a variety of

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.420
TVs, one thing we've not focused
on is creating a

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.560
specific SDK for TV developers
outside of the

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.090
Google TV app space.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.410
We're trying to focus more on
getting our app commonly used

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.500
with access to all content
available on all

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.840
platforms right now.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.900
Many of those platforms, as you
probably know, just aren't

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.600
sophisticated to
support a great

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.850
developer ecosystem today.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:28.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm John
from OpenSlate.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.210
Little detailed question, but
it causes a lot of pain for

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.610
us, and we're very, very
concerned about it is

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.770
migration from user
IDs to titles.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.640
We've heard that user IDs
are going to go away.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.320
Titles are the way to
go in the future.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.770
We've already seen evidence that
folks are changing titles

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.980
to be pretty much like titles
of web pages, so they don't

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.730
provide a lot of information and
certainly not a business

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.200
link back to the owner
of the channel.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.850
Of course, we have the unique ID
on the other side, but the

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.260
user ID has been the key really
for quite a long time.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:03.130
And the biggest problem that we
see here is the fact that

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.030
over on the [? AdEx ?]

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.020
side, in the RGB callout, if you
want to target against a

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.340
specific channel,
the placements

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.430
are still the unique--

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.180
still the user IDs.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.210
Is there anything we
can talk about now?

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.530
Or is that too detailed
for this conversation?

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.410
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: We should
have probably a separate

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.590
discussion and go through
some of the use cases.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.220
Like obviously, some of the
things we're doing have to do

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.830
with unifying our account
structure across Google+,

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.000
YouTube generally, across
all of Google.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.680
And that's going to open up
new opportunities, right?

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.830
But we're also going to start
to move from users to

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.700
multi-channels and different
types of relationships, which

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.360
might complicate
things further.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.400
And so maybe for the sake of
this room, we can just talk

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.340
for a little bit right after.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:41.800
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.530
Is it for certain that
user ID will--

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.670
it's 100% certain that's
going away?

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.320
ANDY BERKHEIMER: Well,
effectively, the notion of a

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.300
one-to-one mapping between
user IDs and

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.500
channels is going away.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.250
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Right.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:54.680
Yeah.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.160
In terms of the right thing to
target on, we should have a

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.880
deeper discussion.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.510
Cool.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.310
AUDIENCE: I'm Danilo from
DADC load entertainment.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:09.310
I actually know Jarek and
Jussi from Everyplay.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.210
Very interested to see the whole
combination because I

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.360
work in a company that
makes games--

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.700
game development and
game consoles.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.270
And we also do video
app development.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:25.350
So I'm very interested to see
when this whole thing would be

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:30.660
coming to Android and what kind
of multiplayer and live

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.630
streaming multiplayer support
could be coming from Google

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.830
and YouTube as APIs, just
because the new Google Play

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.800
Game Services--

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.490
you're just trying to put all
of those things in just like

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.480
one awesome app that you will be
playing a game and will be

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.040
streaming it live.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.595
And at the same time, your
friends will be able to be

00:46:50.595 --> 00:46:53.240
spectating that experience.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.080
But I think we will need to
work with mood [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.650
inside of YouTube and Google
to make that work.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.670
So we just would like to see
and hear from you guys what

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.050
would be your support for live
streaming gaming and

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.240
multiplayer support
from YouTube.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.200
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: I think
one of the--

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.360
there's two pieces.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.930
One is our Live APIs are
obviously available now.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.780
And we expect to see a lot of
people using them to actually

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.130
make that live streaming case
for many games effectively

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.670
possible today.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.790
Starting today, I should say,
with a few exceptions who

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.690
started a little bit earlier.

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.300
And so in terms of how that
integrates with the broader

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.110
Google Play SDK and what's there
available for a game and

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.710
whether that's turn key and how
much that's tied to that

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.930
specific graph and that type of
thing, you do have to work

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.230
with multiple people.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:42.060
But you do have a group,
particularly--

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.360
can the dev rels actually
stand up?--

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.570
who are doing a lot of stuff
here and kind of spanning a

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:48.760
lot of different areas too.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.360
So it might be really
interesting to talk deeper

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.930
session what you're trying
to achieve and see if the

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.260
existing APIs do it.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.900
Or at least there's a good
recipe book for how to use the

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.140
multiple APIs that are available
and make it happen.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.601
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:48:02.601 --> 00:48:05.370
Thank you.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Mike from
Collective Digital Studios.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.570
One of the big things a lot of
our users want is the full

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.000
list of their subscribers.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:12.880
And we've had--

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.520
I noticed you can get it through
channel list, but

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.480
there's been issues with it.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.420
And I think it's capped at 1,000
is the last I heard.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.660
Is there plans to be able
to get back your

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.520
full subscriber list?

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.565
SHIVA RAJARAMAN:
Yeah, there is.

00:48:23.565 --> 00:48:25.250
Do you know where
it is, Jarek?

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.210
I caught you on the spot.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:27.520
Yeah.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.580
[LAUGHS]

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.690
So we're doing two things.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.160
One is a lot of those enterprise
use cases you have

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.780
through the Analytics API
can page through a whole

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.580
subscriber list.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.400
So I need to double check
and make sure

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.490
there's no cap on that.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.390
But our principle is
not to cap it.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:49.360
So if you do actually want to
use that, it makes sense.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.950
Some of the issues we might have
are particularly around

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.700
what's a minimum cluster size
you can have for your

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.860
subscribers before you
can do audience

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.510
analytics on that cluster.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.440
And that's more of a privacy
protection issue.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.070
But in terms of getting the
public subscriber list, we

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.930
know it's been frustrating.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.820
If you're looking at what some
folks are doing, they're

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.410
crawling and/or getting it
partially through the API.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.120
The goal is to release
the full list.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.450
But you can actually follow up
with me, and I'll get you the

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.076
right answer.

00:49:16.076 --> 00:49:16.412
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:16.750
Great.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.000
Thanks.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:20.150
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:24.505
My name's [? Sunat ?] from
France 24 news TV channel.

00:49:24.505 --> 00:49:32.610
We've been trying to integrate
the live broadcasting to our

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:34.180
process, our workflow.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.750
We are very concerned about
the fact that we have to

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:42.120
create an event each time we
have to broadcast something.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:51.610
And when we want to stream,
our channel never changes.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:58.040
The configuration we are
broadcasting to changes every

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.320
time we create an event.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:07.375
Do you plan to create stable
sources we can broadcast--

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.500
how would I say--

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.210
continuously?

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:18.870
ANDY BERKHEIMER: You
want a single

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.670
event ID that you reuse?

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.490
Is that basically your--

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.860
We could broadcast

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:29.280
continuously to the same server.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.680
And then we could create
events, based on

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.490
the same only source.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.740
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:41.766 --> 00:50:45.110
but actually we are enabling
it to go actually longer.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.880
And that you don't need
to change the event.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.710
You can only have one event.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:52.010
And this event will actually
go over to that four hours.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.120
And so you don't need to change
the event from now on.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.020
So we actually will
enable it soon.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.236
And we are working on it.

00:50:57.236 --> 00:50:57.970
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:58.700
Thanks.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.580
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.680
My name is Gabriel from
[INAUDIBLE].com.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.130
When can we expect a deeper
integration between the

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.100
Google+ API and the
YouTube API?

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:16.390
We have been trying to play
with the login content for

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:20.450
subscriber-based Google+
circles.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:25.520
But in some ways, you need the
user to be able to do that

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.010
program [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:31.940
But we didn't find a way, even
listing that, asking that in

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:37.620
the YouTube API, the answer was
there is something that we

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.330
are working on.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.380
But we don't have any
dates yet for it.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.230
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: I think, is the
question about whether--

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:45.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean--

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.660
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Get the
same-- like through the

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.920
YouTube API, get the
subscriber--

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
integration.

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:55.060
You have features that you can
use both YouTube and Google+.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.870
But still you cannot use
them through the API.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:03.590
I mean, are you doing releases
based on that or the focus is

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.980
on the Analytics API?

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.590
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: So, one, you
should just talk about how

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.270
we're approaching API-developed
based

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:12.260
development.

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.140
And in terms of the specific
Google+ versus YouTube--

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.070
we're in the process of getting
people to connect

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.560
these accounts so that we
have single graphs.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:24.210
And until that happens and keeps
getting progress, it's

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.640
hard to expose it all
through one source.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.000
But our goal right now
is to have channels

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.960
backed by Plus pages.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.980
There's a lot of other
discussions happening on that

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.780
as well so that these start
to look more similar.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.820
And these objects have mappings
that we can actually

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.670
then start to expose.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:43.495
But in the meantime, building on
APIs, absolutely, but this

00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:45.511
is the guy.

00:52:45.511 --> 00:52:47.890
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Mark
from Pixability.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.750
I'm wondering are you planning
on having an

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.860
AdWords for Video API?

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.780
Or is there any movement towards
that or any sort of

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.890
kind of developer tools around
those creating campaigns, on a

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:04.220
thing like that?

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.190
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Yeah,
there is some

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:07.780
progress on that front.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.740
We're not the experts on
that actually, though.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.100
But I can follow up with you.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.610
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.690
AUDIENCE: I think,
a quick question.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:19.070
Have you guys considered or is
there a way for you to return

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.880
the cost in v3 for individual
queries, so we could do a

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.700
little better housekeeping on
our end or accounting, I

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:30.030
guess, properly, on our end
to know how we're doing?

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.940
Or maybe that's reflected in
us not having a perfect

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.160
understanding of what
things cost.

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.810
ANDY BERKHEIMER: This is cost
as it relates to quota

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.520
enforcement?

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.180
ANDY BERKHEIMER: I think
that's a pretty

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.120
good feature request.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.710
I don't know if--

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.755
It's definitely a feature
request we've

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:46.460
looked at in the past.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.810
I'm looking at Jarek to
see if we've done

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:48.790
anything about that now.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:49.290
But--

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.100
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: No.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.216
ANDY BERKHEIMER: What?

00:53:53.216 --> 00:53:55.076
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: It's just--

00:53:55.076 --> 00:53:57.030
JAREK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.842
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: But
no specific--

00:53:58.842 --> 00:53:59.290
OK.

00:53:59.290 --> 00:53:59.790
It's a good feature request.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.480
ANDY BERKHEIMER: We have some
practices, but it's not

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.530
structured data at the moment.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.090
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: You want
a per query type cost,

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.340
effectively.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.810
AUDIENCE: Hey, Noah
from FanBridge.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.010
As you guys build up this crop
of people who aren't

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:16.040
necessarily content partners but
are serving those people,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.480
certain parts of the API fork
to let only data access to

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.360
content partners.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.400
Are you guys thinking about
merging those together, so

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.450
someone who isn't a content
partner but has content

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.260
partner clients can still
access that same data?

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:33.330
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: And this is for
the cases where you're not

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.050
trying to get your
own data, right?

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.540
You're just trying to use
YouTube as a data source

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.685
across all the content?

00:54:38.685 --> 00:54:39.405
Is that correct?

00:54:39.405 --> 00:54:42.840
AUDIENCE: So if an MCN is a
client, we can show them their

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.960
earnings data and things like
that that are only available

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.350
through content owner APIs.

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.030
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Oh, without
having access to their auth?

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.780
AUDIENCE: With their auth?

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.010
But we're not the
content owner.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.040
We're not an MCN.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.320
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Yeah,
so we do have--

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.700
I don't know if Jarek, you can
talk about that, but it's

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.770
effectively like "acting
on behalf of," right?

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.050
So that's something we're
working on right now.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.170
AUDIENCE: As it relates to v3
calls, part of the best

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.230
practices includes
using e-tags.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.510
And I could see why you'd
want us to do that.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.640
But there doesn't seem
to be any benefit

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.420
on the actual quota.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.120
So I can have a bunch of things,
query e-tags, get a

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.510
bunch of 304s back.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.890
But it still seems to eat into
my quota the same as if I

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.160
didn't even use an e-tag.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.730
Is there going to be
a change in that?

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.280
Or what's the advantage of me
using an e-tag, then, if it

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.885
doesn't really help my quota,
I guess is the point I'm

00:55:33.885 --> 00:55:34.260
trying to--

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.590
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: Specifying a
part and getting less quota

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:37.200
accordingly?

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.920
ANDY BERKHEIMER: Yeah, I mean
the biggest advantage right

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.500
now is in the data transfer
and being able to get the

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.700
response faster.

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.000
In many cases, being able to
generate a 304 still requires

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.580
just as much back end work.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.060
And so yeah, I think
that's kind of

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.310
reflected through the cost.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:56.280
SHIVA RAJARAMAN: We're going
to have to cut it off now?

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.140
OK.

00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.470
So thanks, everyone.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.280
We'll definitely follow up
with the quota stuff.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.630
And people had some specific
questions we couldn't answer,

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.610
feel free to shoot me a note,
and we'll follow up.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:05.420
Thank you all.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.842
[APPLAUSE]
