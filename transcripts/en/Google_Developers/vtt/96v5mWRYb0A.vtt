IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi everyone.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm Ibrahim Ulukaya
from YouTube

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.580
developer relations team.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.490
And today, we'll talk about
YouTube subscribe button.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.820
And joining me, Kurt Wilms
from YouTube product

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.310
experience, joining me today
from the Paris office.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.960
Hi Kurt, how are you?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.920
KURT WILMS: Hi, thanks
for having me.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm doing good.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.690
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Great.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.470
So as you guys maybe already
figured out, we recently

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.020
launched the YouTube
subscribe button.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.840
And Kurt is the product
manager.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.720
And he will actually tell
us a little bit

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.640
about it more in detail.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.320
So maybe let's get started.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.340
So what is the YouTube
subscribe button?

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.250
And what is the motivation
behind this button?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.050
KURT WILMS: So the subscribe
button is something we've had

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.770
on the desktop site
for a long time.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.870
Clicking the button on the
desktop site allows you to

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.870
connect with the creator
behind the video.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.300
But what we launched recently is
the ability for creators to

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.450
embed the same subscribe
button that you find on

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.600
YouTube.com actually on their
own site, so on a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.300
third party web app.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.200
So the motivation is
pretty simple.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.050
There's a lot of creators
who have a

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.650
presence off of YouTube.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.530
And we wanted to give those
folks away for their fans, for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.410
their followers, to subscribe
to their channel directly on

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.660
their property.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.520
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Sounds good.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.860
But how is it different than
the subscribe button on the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
YouTube website already?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.520
KURT WILMS: So previously there
was never a way directly

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.660
to subscribe to a channel
on a third party site.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.210
So what we've tried to do is
emulate the button in every

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.110
way we can.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.590
So it's very similar to how it
is on YouTube.com itself.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.290
We give them a couple additional
options to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.070
developers for the third party
button, where they can change

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.010
the style and the color to make
it integrate well into

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.620
their property.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.550
But otherwise, it behaves just
like the button behaves on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.085
YouTube.com.

00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:58.990
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Oh, that
sounds great actually.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.290
And what are some advantages of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.910
implementing this button actually?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.400
KURT WILMS: So the main thing
behind this button, or the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.030
main reason why you'd want to
put this on your side is like

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.330
I mentioned before.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140
You can give the folks who come
to your web property an

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.180
easy way to subscribe to your
channel without actually

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.910
leaving your site.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.560
So prior to the launch of this
button, there was no way for

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.910
your fans, your followers to
subscribe to your channel on

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.330
your own site.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.180
You would have to go to YouTube,
you have to sign in,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.510
you'd have to find the button
and subscribe there.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.640
This is sort of a way for your
fans and your followers to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.140
connect with you directly on
your property without leaving.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.960
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: That's great.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.460
So how can I show the develops
to start using this button?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.810
How can they generate the
code for this button?

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.970
KURT WILMS: So we've launched
documentation which is live.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.360
And when you go to the
documentation site, we have a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.800
nice editor where you can go.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.930
You can click around, you can
see how the button would

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.770
render on your page.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.840
And we give you right there some
HTML code that you could

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350
put on your site to
render the button.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.930
If you're more advanced, if
you want more advanced

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.480
features, we also dive into the
details about how you can

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.690
customize this on your own.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.700
How you can tweak the HTML and
JavaScript in various ways to

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.440
solve your use case.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.150
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Maybe actually
we can show this in a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.620
demo right now.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.030
So if you guys go to
developers.google.com/youtube,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.750
and you will just click the
YouTube subscribe button here

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.600
on the left navigation.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.120
And you will be able to see that
all the content, all the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.150
confirmation options here.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.490
So if you're a standard channel
or a paid channel,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.770
you'll see the default button.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.890
Or, you will have different
options having like a full

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.250
layout or with a [INAUDIBLE]
team.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.430
And all you need is actually
go to the configure button

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.540
option here.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.050
And you'll put your channel
name or your channel ID.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.240
And as you see, there's
already a preview

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.270
on the right side.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.240
And you can change the preview
as having the whole full

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.580
preview of the channel's image
and the channel's name.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.850
And you can even go for
a darker layout.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.000
And all you need to do is,
actually-- if you are a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.300
beginner and you want to do an
easy way-- all you need to do

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.545
is copy this code and paste
it in your own HTML.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:15.420
And from that, you will have
the Subscribe button.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.339
But if you want to go further
ahead, you want to use the

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.800
dynamic rendering.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.245
And then we will actually have
the dynamic rendering code

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.080
here, or the documentation
as well.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.950
So that should be pretty
easy for that.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:38.600
And besides this one actually,
say that you can render this

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.580
dynamically.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.600
And what are the advantages
of rendering dynamically?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520
KURT WILMS: Yeah, so we've been
able-- for advanced folks

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.840
who want to render the button
dynamically and improve the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.050
speed of their pages rendering
time, as well as

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.780
do different things.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.160
If you want to do some custom
integrations on your site, or

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.870
you want to do some advanced
features, we enable that too.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.080
But yeah, like you mentioned,
for the simple user just wants

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.290
to common embed the button,
we have a nice editor

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.830
to let you do that.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.995
But the documentation discusses
about rendering the

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:10.960
button dynamically and doing
various different things.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.830
So we have the whole
spectrum from

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.060
beginner to advanced user.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.160
We support both cases.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.460
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: As you
mentioned, the subscribe

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.000
button is a great tool for
people to subscribe to your

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.940
channel without leaving
your own

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.430
website or your web property.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.950
But which mediums the user will
see once they actually go

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.580
to your website, or could they
be using other mediums?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.800
KURT WILMS: So once a user
actually click subscribe, the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.790
one big advantage of that is
your channel will show up

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.940
across all of YouTube's
platforms.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.510
So not just on the desktop
site, but our mobile

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.460
applications, on TV, on third
parties, et cetera.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.710
So an advantage to putting the
Subscribe button on your site

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.270
is when your fans come and
they click it, now your

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.520
channel will be unlocked
on all the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.550
platforms YouTube is on.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.390
Not just on desktop, but
across our mobile

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.300
apps, TV, et cetera.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.520
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Wow, that's
great actually.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.650
I hope all our actual users
start using that.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.750
And that will add them to
all their channels.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.610
And there will be way more
subscribers just

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.670
using that, I believe.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.670
KURT WILMS: Yeah, it's a great
way to improve your channel,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.680
gain more subscribers,
et cetera.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.570
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: OK.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.640
Thanks for joining
me today Kurt.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.260
That was great, and I'm
sure users will

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.200
start using it already.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.850
KURT WILMS: Thank you.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.890
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: And for
a last thing I want to

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.630
plug all the time.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.150
And as a developer relations
engineer, developer relations,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.180
we are hiring.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.980
You can just go to

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.520
And we are hiring almost

the best for you.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.990
I hope you guys go
