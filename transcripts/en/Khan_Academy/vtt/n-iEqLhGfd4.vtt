00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's see if we can
take the antiderivative

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.250
of x squared times
e to the x dx.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.490
Now, the key is to recognize
when you can at least attempt

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.839
to use integration by parts.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.380
And it might be a
little bit obvious,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.300
because this video is
about integration by parts.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
But the clue that
integration by parts

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.010
may be applicable
is to say, look,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.890
I've got a function
that's the product of two

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.650
other functions-- in this
case, x squared and e to the x.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.438
And integration by
parts can be useful is

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:32.229
if I can take the
derivative of one of them

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.130
and it becomes simpler.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.213
And if I take the
antiderivative of the other one,

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.714
it becomes no more complicated.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:39.130
So in this case, if I were to
take the antiderivative of x

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.450
squared, it does become simpler.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.222
It becomes 2x.

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.180
And if I take the
antiderivative of e to the x,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.530
it doesn't become
any more complicated.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580
So let's assign f of x
to be equal to x squared.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.317
And we want that one
to be the one where

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.150
if I take the derivative
it becomes simpler.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.358
Because I'm going to have
to take the derivative of f

00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:58.140
of x right over here in the
integration by parts formula.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.981
And let's assign g prime of
x to be equal to e to the x.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.480
Because later, I'm going to
have to take its antiderivative,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.500
and the antiderivative of e to
the x is still just e to the x.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.270
So let me write this down.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.600
So we are saying that f of x--
I'll do it right over here--

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.090
f of x is equal to x squared,
in which case f prime of x

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.780
is going to be equal to 2x.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.000
And I'm not worrying about
the constants right now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.670
We'll just add a
constant at the end

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.295
to make sure that
our antiderivative is

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.020
in the most general form.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.590
And then g prime of x is
equal to e to the x, which

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.240
means its
antiderivative, g of x,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.100
is still equal to e to the x.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.510
And now we're ready to apply
the right-hand side right over

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.140
here.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.100
So all this thing
right over here

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.330
is going to be equal to f
of x, which is x squared--

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.910
and let me put it right
underneath-- x squared times g

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.260
of x, which is e
to the x, minus.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.455
Let me do that in
that yellow color.

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.200
I want to make the
colors match up--

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.590
minus the antiderivative
of f prime of x.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.290
Well, f prime of x is
2x, times g of x. g of x

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.598
is e to the x dx.

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:26.880
So you might say,
hey, Sal, we're

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.260
left with another
antiderivative,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.620
another indefinite
integral right over here.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.550
How do we solve this one?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.000
And as you might
guess, the key might

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.590
be integration by parts again.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.689
And we're making progress.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.980
This right over here is a
simpler expression than this.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.880
Notice we were able to reduce
the degree of this x squared.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.639
It now is just a 2x.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.680
And what we can do to
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.410
Since 2 is just a
scalar-- it's a constant,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.170
it's multiplying the
function-- we can take that out

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.940
of the integral sign.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.100
So let's take it this way.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430
So let me rewrite it this way.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.590
We can only do that
with a constant

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.070
that's multiplying the function.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.790
So let me put the
2 right out here.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.450
And so now what
we're concerned about

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.470
is finding the integral--
let me write it

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.510
right over here-- the
integral of xe to the x dx.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.760
And this is another
integration by parts problem.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.780
And so let's again apply the
same principles of integration

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.280
by parts.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.654
What, when I take
its derivative,

00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:28.690
is going to get simpler?

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.148
Well, x is going to get simpler
when I take its derivative.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.550
So now, for the purposes
of integration by parts,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.320
let's redefine f of x
to be equal to just x.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:45.660
And then we can still have g
prime of x equaling e to the x.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.460
And so in this case, let
me write it all down. f

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.912
of x is equal to x.

00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:54.780
f prime of x is equal to 1.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.556
g prime of x is
equal to e to the x.

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:02.830
g of x, just the
antiderivative of this,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.920
is equal to e to the x.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.550
So let's apply integration
by parts again.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.310
So this is going to be equal
to f of x times g of x.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.823
Now f of x is x.

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:24.950
g of x is e to the x, minus
the antiderivative of f prime

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.490
of x-- well, that's just 1--
times g of x-- e to the x.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:37.530
It's just 1 times e to the x dx.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.550
And remember, all
I'm doing right now--

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.100
you might have lost
track of things--

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.060
I'm just focused on
this antiderivative.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.982
That antiderivative is
that antiderivative there.

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:48.440
If we can figure
out what it is, we

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.220
can then substitute back
into our original expression.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.020
Now, you might appreciate
integration by parts.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.370
What does this right
over here simplify to?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.460
What is the antiderivative
of 1 times e to the x dx?

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.950
Or what is the antiderivative
of 1 times e to the x?

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.575
Well, it's just the
antiderivative of e

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:07.300
to the x, which is
just e to the x.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.150
So this simplifies
to x times e to the x

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.720
minus the antiderivative of
e to the x, which is just

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.470
e to the x, so minus e to the x.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.020
And then we can take this
and substitute it back.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.640
This is the
antiderivative of this.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.580
So we can substitute
it back up here

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.817
to figure out the antiderivative
of our original expression.

00:05:32.817 --> 00:05:34.900
So the antiderivative of
our original expression--

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.450
we're getting really
close-- is going

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.060
to be equal to-- I'm going
to use different colors so we

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.720
can keep track of things.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.520
It's going to be equal
to x squared times

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:56.400
e to the x minus 2 times
all of this business.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.190
So minus 2 times-- well,
this antiderivative

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.360
we just figured out is this.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.140
Minus 2 times xe to
the x minus e to the x.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.780
And if we want, now is a
good time to put our plus C.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.870
And of course, we
can simplify this.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.860
This is equal to x squared.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.720
I like to keep the same colors.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.440
This is equal to x
squared e to the x.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.380
You distribute the negative 2.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.730
You get minus 2xe to
the x plus 2e to the x,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.500
and then finally, plus
C. And we're done.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.210
We figured out
the antiderivative

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.920
of what looked like a kind of
hairy-looking expression using

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.180
integration by parts twice.
