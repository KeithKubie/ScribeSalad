00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.086
Scientists at MIT have created
a synthetic material

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.868
that mimics the texture
and color-shifting skin

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:09.467
of an octopus,
and a new type of edible fungus

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.555
has been discovered growing
inside of salami,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:15.968
and it's fittingly been named
penicillim salami.

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:19.404

A new device allows you
to hear with your tongue.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.573
Researchers at Colorado State University
are developing a technology

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:32.474
which uses a Bluetooth-enabled earpiece
to detect sound

00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:35.585
and then send the electrical impulses
to a retainer

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.511
that wearers press against their tongue
to hear.

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:40.716
They're currently mapping the nerves
on the tongue,

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.642
then they say it could take two to three months
of wearing the device

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:47.125
to teach your brain to interpret
the signals on your tongue

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.125
as words or sounds.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.535
Eventually, those with substantial hearing loss
could use this

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:56.059
as a significantly simpler
and less expensive alternative

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.059
to cochlear implants.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.132
Researchers at Harvard University
have developed

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:05.588
an organic, non-metal flow battery
that is chemically similar to rhubarb.

00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:09.977
The battery is 97% cheaper to make
than those made with metal,

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:12.066
and it's environmentally friendly.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.317
A few models already exist,
and the technology could be used

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:18.405
to take greater advantage
of intermittent energy sources,

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:20.588
like wind or the sun.

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:24.558
An engineer in London has created
functioning synthetic leaves.

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:28.157
They're created
by extracting chloroplasts from plants

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:30.595
and binding them together
with some silk fibers.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.707
These synthetic leaves
engage in photosynthesis,

00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:38.165
and could be used
to clean city air

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.926
or create oxygen in spaceships
or space colonies.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:44.636
Sixth Sense has created
a motion-tracking platform

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:47.539
built specifically
for virtual reality.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.766
Instead of using only a camera
to track a user's motion,

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:55.360
the Stem System has a base station
that sends out electromagnetic waves,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.124
which are then picked up
by sensors on the head,

00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:00.515
in the controllers,
and on the legs.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.204
It allows for a wider range of motion
by the user

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:08.103
as well as greater accuracy,
so it'll be easier than ever to be a Jedi

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.103
or go virtual shoe shopping.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:14.233
Wetlands Work is hoping to implement
floating toilets made with plants.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.414
There are a number of floating villages
in Cambodia

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:19.527
where traditional plumbing
is impossible,

00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:22.986
thereby increasing the risk
of contracting deadly diseases.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:25.703
These toilets use pods
filled with plants,

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:28.698
like hyacinth,
to reduce harmful bacteria

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:31.647
in the waste by 99.9%,

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:34.108
and the hope is to implement them
in other countries

00:02:34.108 --> 00:02:36.988
where villages exist
on or near water.

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:41.771
The Bloodhound is a rocket car
aiming to break the land speed record this year.

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:44.812
It has a jet engine
and a hybrid rocket motor

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:49.386
and hopes to achieve speeds
higher than 763 miles per hour,

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:52.057
and it's outfitted
with 500 sensors

00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:55.307
and a number of cameras
that transmit data in real time

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.906
to help teach children about engineering
and aerodynamics.

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:02.900
Termites help prevent
the spread of desert into drylands.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.942
A recent study from Princeton reveals
that termite mounds

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:08.612
are excellent at storing minerals
and moisture,

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.119
and as a result,
help plant life flourish.

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.695
Drylands that had termites
were less likely to turn into desert

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.969
and needed less rainfall
to sustain their ecosystems.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.477
This study suggests
that other burrowing animals

00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:23.101
might have similar impacts
on drylands,

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:26.467
and this could change the way we look
at microecosystems.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.181
Starry Sky is a project
by a Dutch startup

00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:32.362
to power 300 LEDs
using plants.

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:35.636
It works by harvesting discarded protons
and electrons

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:40.210
from the bacteria near the plant's roots,
so all you need to generate electricity

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.880
is water, CO2, and sunlight.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.940
The project marks
Plant-e's first commercial installation,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.980
and you can now buy
plant-powered cell phone charging stations,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.787
Wifi hotspots, and rooftop electricity modules
from their website.

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:57.109
Finally, students at MIT
are experimenting

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.109
with ice-based architecture.

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.814
By freezing thin cloth
with layers of water,

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:05.901
they're able to create winter shelters
that utilize gravitational geography

00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:07.901
to remain upright.

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.885
But those shapes still stood
by themselves,

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.275
so it was very nice to see
that the frozen fabrics

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:17.837
is very strong.

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:22.945
[laughing and speaking Dutch]

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:26.242
You can see it's a very stiff shelter.

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:29.260
I'm going to leave you
with a tiny zipper robot,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.954
and as always, thanks for watching.
