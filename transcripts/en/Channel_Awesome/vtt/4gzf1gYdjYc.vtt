00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.900
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.100
I remember it, so you don't have to!

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.380
With a certain themed month coming up in December...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.400
and that certain theme containing

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.800
a lot of direct-to-DVD sequels...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.600
*whimpering noise*

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
I figured it only makes sense to talk

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
about a certain aspect of those sequels.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.360
You see, in the late 90's and early 2000's

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.080
Disney struck it big...ish...

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.680
...with their direct-to-DVD sequels.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.760
For whatever reason, kids really want to know what happened after "Happily ever after"

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.860
You name it: "Cinderella 2", 'Pocahontas 2", even "Hunchback of Notre Dame 2"

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.380
Ooooh! Maybe now we finally get the original book ending!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020
Despite some of them being given an impressive animation budget,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.480
almost on par with their theatrical hand-drawn movies,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.900
...most of them are known as some of the worst material Disney's put out.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.220
Who was really asking for another Brother Bear?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.200
Who couldn't sleep at night if they didn't know what happened to Kronk's groove?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.640
Looking these over though, I did start to wonder... which Disney sequels did we WANT to see?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600
Which ones could actually be explored more and we'd welcome another film about?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.300
Some of these are already in demand, and being made, like Wreck-it-Ralph, The Incredibles and so on...

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.920
But we are also getting Cars 3 and Toy Story 4,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.440
after Cars 2 and Monsters University.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.600
So, not that it's likely that these are gonna happen,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.580
but I thought it'd be fun to explore the Disney sequels that we actually wanted to see.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.440
In fact my first choice isn't even a 'Part Two', it's a 'Part Three'.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420
...To... maybe make up for parts of Part Two.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.280
I'm talking about Fantasia.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.520
The first film is seen by many as an artistic masterpiece

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.060
and it was meant to continue with a ton of varying sequels.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.840
Well, sadly we only got 1 with Fantasia 2000,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.680
which not only did poorly at the box-office

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.760
but it kind of pissed off those who loved the first film

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.540
with edited versions of the music,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440
slightly more childish segments,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.900
and painful, PAINFUL cameos.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.060
[Penn Jillette]: FRAUD! Dismemberment!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.600
Rip-off!

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.480
[Critic]: *groan*

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.180
You can figure out their target audience when they refer to Salvador Dali as the "melting watch guy"

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.560
[Bette Midler]: ...Now Salvador Dali, you know the 'limp watches' guy...

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.660
[Critic]: Yeah! I can really see them doing something similar in the first film!

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.380
[Critic as the conductor]: ...Leonardo Da Vinci - you know, one of the Ninja Turtles...

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.000
[Critic]: But still, it had some beautiful moments

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.180
and exceptional animation and ideas.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.520
So, maybe a third one could work

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.940
if they just knocked off talking down to the audience.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.960
When the first Fantasia failed, to make the money it needed back,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.700
they worked in the other segments they were gonna put into future Fantasias

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.160
into just short cartoons.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460
The same thing happened with Fantasia 2000,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.460
which gave us two wonderful segments:

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.640
Salvador Dali's --oh, sorry I mean "melting watch guy's" Destino,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.140
and a heart-breaking rendition of The Little Match Girl.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.960
Both of these are phenomenal

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.880
and give hope that maybe a third Fantasia could happen

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.220
if they're risky but also adult enough to pull it off.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.540
It's definitely worth taking that chance.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.620
But not all Disney sequels have to be adult - how about Robin Hood?

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.580
This was about as basic an action-adventure movie you could get

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.280
but it did it so...wonderfully

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.120
It was creative, exciting, had great action scenes

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.460
and one of the few Disney films that was entirely animamorphic life forms.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.620
No humans could exist in this world.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.860
With Zootopia being such a big hit,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380
-hell, maybe that'll get a sequel too-

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380
perhaps another one of these would be a lot of fun!

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.420
Everything seems kinda laid out.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040
Robin Hood and Maid Marian are married

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.820
They have a babysitter living with them who's also a baby...

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.420
Yeah, never got that part...

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.580
-But they could have kids and they could go on adventures too...

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.260
Just create another evil to fight,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.360
and this could be a very simple, but also very enjoyable adventure.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.380
Animation, especially, has come a long way

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.340
It'd be really cool to see these with much smoother lines,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.840
as opposed to that sketchiness

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.940
And maybe even give them the CG route

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.300
Again, they made them look great in Zootopia,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.780
It could probably work here too.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.500
It seems like the possibilities are strong enough to check out.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.520
And speaking of animal movies, why not The Great Mouse Detective?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.720
The film wasn't a huge hit when it came out,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720
but it's getting more and more of a following.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.720
Its hero, Basil of Baker Street,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.720
is uncontrollably likeable.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.720
He's funny, he's smart,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.160
he's got a ton of energy,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
and he's incredibly enjoyable to watch.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.300
Granted his arch nemesis Ratigan, who is also a fantastic character,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.340
is killed in the end, but... so what?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.760
The stories of Basil obviously have been influenced from Sherlock Holmes

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.200
-hell, he stays in Sherlock Holmes' walls.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.120
And Sherlock had more enemies than just Moriarty.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.580
So... why can't Basil?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.160
The ending even indicates he's starting a new mystery.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.820
Why don't we just pick up where that left off?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.060
A missing ring, okay, well who took it?

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.480
For what diabolical plan?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.040
Maybe it's part of some other villain's big scheme

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.140
and Dawson, his new assistant, has to get used to Basil's eccentric nature.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.660
There's ideas here!

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.520
Maybe he can even be solving a crime

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980
while Sherlock is solving one parallel to his!

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.660
Come on, there was a cool clock tower scene in the last one,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.980
we can go even bigger,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.100
even more exciting!

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.940
Look into it, Disney, there's something cool here.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.660
Now a lot of Disney animated films are based on books,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.980
and if the book has a sequel, shouldn't the movie too?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.980
I'm of course talking about Alice in Wonderland.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.500
Now, I know what you're thinking:

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.260
"Come on, that first film was perfect, leave it alone,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
don't add any more to what was fine."

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.580
But here's the thing:

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.220
There's so many versions of Alice in Wonderland out there.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.080
Many of them trying to be line for line

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
'the definitive version',

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.900
and some of them not even getting the title right...

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.040
But out of all of that, Disney's is still the best.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.760
Because they knew it had to be a movie first

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.440
and they had to change things around to make it flow like one.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.900
Though with that said,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.040
that means there's still a ton of things left out.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.040
Characters like the Jabberwocky,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.700
the Griffin,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.560
the Knight...

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.780
There's a ton of places you can go with this.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.340
And because the narrative is not very story-based

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.980
and more of a person just coming across strange thing after strange thing,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.700
you don't even have to worry that much about the story.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.700
Just focus on the Surrealism,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.720
the imagination,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.060
the humor, all the fun stuff that made the first film so cool!

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.060
You can make Through the Looking Glass

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.960
actually LIKE Through the Looking Glass,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.420
unlike... Through the Looking Glass.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.420
Even the original voice actress, Kathryn Beaumont, is still alive!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.420
And she still reenacts her role!

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.720
It seems silly not to make this!

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.720
All the pieces are right there!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.720
Don't give it a complicated story

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.820
about prophecies or Narnia rip-offs,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.560
just do mad people acting like mad people,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.880
and you'll have something great!

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.300
Come on, this makes too much crazy sense not to happen.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.060
But it doesn't just have to be one the hand-drawn movies,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.060
the CG movies are perfectly eligible too!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.000
With all the sequels Pixar says they're bringing out,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.640
I'm surprised there's no interest in another Inside Out.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.400
Not only was the first film incredibly poignant as well as funny,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.860
but the ideas were literally mindblowing.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.680
When growing up, there's so many changes that happen

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.160
that can be more than just a puberty joke.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.540
Maybe some emotions get more powerful and become bullies,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.940
maybe some other people's emotions multiply

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.940
and start taking over her emotions...

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.720
I mean, come on,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.900
other people's emotions can have an effect on others',

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.200
I mean, why not have them, like, sneak into another person's brains

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.620
and emotions, and like, try to take over?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.500
Maybe even brand new emotions are born,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.220
new characters,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.120
the possibilities are endless!

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.900
Apparently, when making this movie

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.940
there were even more ideas

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.860
the filmmakers wanted to utilize,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.380
but they didn't have the time.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.380
Another movie, showing Riley growing up

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.180
and dealing with these new emotions,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.960
is a perfect way to explore 'em.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.960
It makes more sense than Cars 3,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.080
for god's sake!

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.480
Do me a favor, Pixar,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.140
and don't keep a closed mind on this one.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.300
But that's not the only pixar film. How about Monsters Inc.?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.040
...Let me explain.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.560
...I'm sure you're thinking of the follow-up film, Monsters University, as counting.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.240
first of all, that was a prequel, not a sequel, second...

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.960
...WHO THE HELL WANTED TO SEE THAT?!

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.940
What little kid is saying, "Mommy, i wanna see these monsters go through a degree-granting institution for higher learning!"

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.860
No one!

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.360
But ya know what would be interesting?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.440
Maybe Sully continues to see Boo and watches her as she grows up?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.140
Maybe as a teen or an adult, she starts to question whether or not

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.220
she should still be communicating with quote-unquote: "monsters in the closet".

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.740
Maybe she tries to convince herself they're not real, and that creates a rift between her and Sully.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.320
Maybe all those existential issues that always sneak their way into Pixar films

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.000
can have an explosion of self-conflict here!

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.940
Who wouldn't want to see a girl grow up talking to literal monsters and how it affects her and the people around her?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.320
It's sensible, it's strange, it's childish, it's adult...

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.880
It's a neat idea, dammit! It's a neat idea!

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.100
I don't wanna see a PG-rated version of Animal House,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.580
I have the R-rated version for that!

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.320
With Pixar's love of talking about growing up and moving on with things, this seems like a perfect format for that.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.660
Buuut it's not like animation and reality always went hand in hand...

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.860
...Look at Enchanted.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.460
An animated Disney peasant (note: princess?) sent to the real world,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.840
only to find out she's not looking for a prince, but instead a reasonable relationship.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.860
It was a cute film and it did well at the box office, but that does beg the question:

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.620
What about the prince?

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.740
And the woman he takes to the animated realm?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.340
Most of the movie was showing how an animated heroine reacted to the real world,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.620
but how about how a real heroine reacts to the animated world?

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.580
This character didn't get much focus in the original, and now that kids know she was played by Elsa, Disney's probably kicking themselves for that.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.860
So, here's your chance to expand on that character!

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.280
Disney had fun mocking its old tropes with this but how about their newer tropes now?

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.340
Not all Disney films are Snow White or Sleeping Beauty,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.720
we got our Mulans, and our Hunchback of Notre Dames and such.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.160
How fun would it be to see this character try to survive in that kind of animated world?

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.920
She can teach them about reality, and they can teach her about whimsical magic and such...

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.400
It could be pretty enjoyable!

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.320
Maybe there's something here, something that can be explored more.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.400
...Okay, probably nothing fantastic, but... a cute dive into the other side of things.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.360
It could be worth looking into.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.480
In fact, a lot of these are worth looking into.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.000
With so many Disney sequels that none of us ever wanted to watch...

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.020
...maybe we could start looking at the ones that we DO wanna watch.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.400
I mean, yes, in the long run, I wanna see new material like a lot of people do.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.660
We have enough repeats in the world.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.440
But... if you're gonna do sequels anyway, and they're just gonna keep making money...

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.400
...maybe... give these a thought.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.540
I'm not saying the'll be great, but they gotta be better than a lot of the ones that we got in the past.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.740
Disney, this is definitely worth looking into.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.300
I know it's a long shot, even dream-worthy, but if there's anything you tried to teach us,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.180
it's that dreams can definitely come true.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.680
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and if you'll excuse me...

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.780
...there's a certain holiday I need to get ready for.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.640
*running back*

Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.180
this week we are doing 'Prevent Child Abuse'.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.680
Prevent Child Abuse America was founded in 1972,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:48.320
it is the first organisation in the United States whose sole mission is to prevent the abuse and neglect of our nation's children.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.120
It undertakes its mission by affecting change at the governmental and community level,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.220
on the systems that support the full range of services needed to promote the child development process,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.800
and provide parents with better conditions.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:11.620
Based in Chicago, PCA America has state chapters in 47 states and over 400 Healthy Families America sites in 41 states.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.440
Together, approximately 500 staff in the national office and chapters

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:23.860
manage over 353 different locally-based strategies to meet their mission of the organization.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:33.240
They have an additional 2900 home visitation workers, supervisors, and program managers to oversee and implement this program.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:41.540
So much good has come from this organisation, and if you look at their website, or their Youtube page, you can see all the lives they helped to make better.
