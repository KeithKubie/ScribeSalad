Columbia University Libraries you have

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:47.529
Columbia University Libraries you have
 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:49.230
Columbia University Libraries you have
to advocate for resources being

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240
to advocate for resources being
 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.420

allocated to it right I mean the library

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430
allocated to it right I mean the library
 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.070

has time it has people it has money than

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080
has time it has people it has money than

it is not going to give it to us because

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400
it is not going to give it to us because
 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.980
it is not going to give it to us because
we want to do this we have to say this

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
we want to do this we have to say this
 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.600
we want to do this we have to say this
is important for the library's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
is important for the library's
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.490
is important for the library's
objectives for scholarship and for the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
objectives for scholarship and for the
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.290
objectives for scholarship and for the
larger community and then we put

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300
larger community and then we put
 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.820
larger community and then we put
together a collaborative project on it

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830
together a collaborative project on it
 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.649
together a collaborative project on it
so let me tell you how we did that one

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659
so let me tell you how we did that one
 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:05.790
so let me tell you how we did that one
of the things is we looked at the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800
of the things is we looked at the
 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.249
of the things is we looked at the
strategic goals for the library and we

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259
strategic goals for the library and we
 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.140
strategic goals for the library and we
said does making this collection widely

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
said does making this collection widely
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.409
said does making this collection widely
accessible makes sense so we did a

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419
accessible makes sense so we did a
 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.290
accessible makes sense so we did a
little presentation I see it meets these

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
little presentation I see it meets these
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.050
little presentation I see it meets these
parts of our strategic goals it will

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060
parts of our strategic goals it will
 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.369
parts of our strategic goals it will
certainly be easier to find the

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379
certainly be easier to find the
 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.469
certainly be easier to find the
digitized photos it will serve an

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479
digitized photos it will serve an
 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.159
digitized photos it will serve an
incredibly broad community of people who

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169
incredibly broad community of people who
 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.529
incredibly broad community of people who
need access to these photographs from

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539
need access to these photographs from
 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.929
need access to these photographs from
scholars and this kind of social

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939

to history to art history and people are
constantly coming in to use this

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
constantly coming in to use this
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.730
constantly coming in to use this
collection it's one of our most use

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740
collection it's one of our most use
 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.559
collection it's one of our most use
collections and obviously the more it

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569
collections and obviously the more it
 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.209
collections and obviously the more it
gets handled the worse it is as a

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219
gets handled the worse it is as a
 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:46.469
gets handled the worse it is as a
special collection so one of our

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
special collection so one of our
 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.269
special collection so one of our
arguments for digitizing it is

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279
arguments for digitizing it is
 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.490
arguments for digitizing it is
preserving it right if it's digitized

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500
preserving it right if it's digitized
 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.959
preserving it right if it's digitized
less people will be coming and pawing

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969
less people will be coming and pawing
 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:52.950
less people will be coming and pawing
through it so that's one of the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
through it so that's one of the
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.510
through it so that's one of the
arguments we made a whole series of

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520
arguments we made a whole series of
 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.089
arguments we made a whole series of
arguments about serving scholarship

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099
arguments about serving scholarship
 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.839
arguments about serving scholarship
describing the collection we're going to

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849
describing the collection we're going to
 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.119
describing the collection we're going to
create 30 different metadata categories

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129
create 30 different metadata categories
 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.769
create 30 different metadata categories
for each object so people will know the

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779
for each object so people will know the
 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.019
for each object so people will know the
date who did it what it was used for and

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029
date who did it what it was used for and
 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.339
date who did it what it was used for and
things like that so we made I think a

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349
things like that so we made I think a
 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.559
things like that so we made I think a
pretty effective argument um for the

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569
pretty effective argument um for the
 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.450
pretty effective argument um for the
library we also want to make an argument

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460
library we also want to make an argument
 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.249
library we also want to make an argument
I think it's useful for the donor

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259
I think it's useful for the donor
 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.499
I think it's useful for the donor
because they gave us the collection and

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509
because they gave us the collection and
 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.719
because they gave us the collection and
they use the collection a lot and if you

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729
they use the collection a lot and if you
 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.129
they use the collection a lot and if you
look at community service society's

that's the context that will be
 

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.350
that's the context that will be
discussing it as well and our hope is

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360
discussing it as well and our hope is

what works for you and what wouldn't
 

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.580
what works for you and what wouldn't
work for you necessarily so this is an

go about doing that and what the pros

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539
go about doing that and what the pros
 

00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:29.119

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:04.560
little more complex that deals with
 

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.060
little more complex that deals with
humans relationships and so if you look

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.070
humans relationships and so if you look
 

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.370

in the current environmental education
 

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.410
in the current environmental education
literature there winds up being quite a

literature there winds up being quite a
 

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.930
literature there winds up being quite a
bit being written currently and it

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940
bit being written currently and it
 

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.120

now I can go out and I can teach

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:46.389
now I can go out and I can teach
 

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:49.409
now I can go out and I can teach
students about air air currents and

00:29:49.409 --> 00:29:49.419
students about air air currents and
 

00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:51.389
students about air air currents and
thatthat's that some air currents are

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399
thatthat's that some air currents are
 

00:29:51.399 --> 00:29:53.340
thatthat's that some air currents are
very small and don't produce very much

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:53.350
very small and don't produce very much
 

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.590
very small and don't produce very much
energy some air currents are very large

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600
energy some air currents are very large
 

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.289
energy some air currents are very large
and therefore do have a lot of energy in

00:29:58.289 --> 00:29:58.299
and therefore do have a lot of energy in
 

00:29:58.299 --> 00:29:59.700
and therefore do have a lot of energy in
them and I can do that with a little

00:29:59.700 --> 00:29:59.710
them and I can do that with a little
 

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.399
them and I can do that with a little
mini wind turbine or show them images of

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:02.409
mini wind turbine or show them images of
 

00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:04.799

environmental in nature but they place
them in the environment and you can see

is was possible to give them ideas to
 

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.460
is was possible to give them ideas to
see forms that they aren't used to

thought well let's jump on board with
 

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.660
thought well let's jump on board with
this and let's create a unit for my

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:12.670
this and let's create a unit for my

scientist I know to do research and when
 

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.570
scientist I know to do research and when
I do research I go to my library and

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:39.580
I do research I go to my library and
 

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.940
I do research I go to my library and
when i go to my library i seek help from

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:41.950
when i go to my library i seek help from
 

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.390

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.410
be interdisciplinary so he was really
focusing on getting faculty professors

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:14.420
focusing on getting faculty professors
 

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.300
focusing on getting faculty professors
especially to work across campus and

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:16.310
especially to work across campus and
 

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.970
especially to work across campus and
other disciplines to put together

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:17.980
other disciplines to put together
 

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.650
other disciplines to put together
co-developed co-taught

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:19.660
co-developed co-taught
 

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.270
co-developed co-taught
cross-disciplinary courses and that was

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280
cross-disciplinary courses and that was
 

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.730
cross-disciplinary courses and that was
sort of an OLE and so he put together

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:24.740
sort of an OLE and so he put together
 

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.030
sort of an OLE and so he put together
this tuple grant program was an internal

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040
this tuple grant program was an internal
 

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.609
this tuple grant program was an internal
to the college competitive grant where a

00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:30.619
to the college competitive grant where a
 

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:32.400
to the college competitive grant where a
couple of faculty could work together

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:32.410
couple of faculty could work together
 

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.620
couple of faculty could work together
design a interdisciplinary course and

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:35.630
design a interdisciplinary course and
 

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.750
design a interdisciplinary course and
the the college would produce some

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760
the the college would produce some
 

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.880
the the college would produce some
funding to allow us to spend a little

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:39.890
funding to allow us to spend a little
 

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.230
funding to allow us to spend a little
time in the summer to develop that

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240
time in the summer to develop that
 

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.910
time in the summer to develop that
course and to provide some additional

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920
course and to provide some additional
 

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.760
course and to provide some additional
support for our for our course expenses

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:45.770
support for our for our course expenses
 

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.350
support for our for our course expenses
now some colleges and I don't

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:47.360
now some colleges and I don't
 

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.609
now some colleges and I don't
necessarily have these same sort of

00:36:48.609 --> 00:36:48.619
necessarily have these same sort of
 

00:36:48.619 --> 00:36:50.830
necessarily have these same sort of
internal financial problems but I can't

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:50.840
internal financial problems but I can't
 

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.750
internal financial problems but I can't
hide purchase or at least sunnis

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760
hide purchase or at least sunnis
 

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.020
hide purchase or at least sunnis
financial problems from anybody

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.030
financial problems from anybody
 

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.700
financial problems from anybody
especially given the writings that are

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:57.710
especially given the writings that are
 

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.520
especially given the writings that are
in the newspaper these days so to have a

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:00.530
in the newspaper these days so to have a
 

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.990
in the newspaper these days so to have a
grant that was supporting this

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000
grant that was supporting this
 

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.650
grant that was supporting this
particular program was very enticing so

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:05.660
particular program was very enticing so
 

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.540
particular program was very enticing so
Heather and I were both new to the

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:07.550
Heather and I were both new to the
 

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:11.140
Heather and I were both new to the
College were both eager to make our mark

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.150
College were both eager to make our mark
 

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.660
College were both eager to make our mark
on the campus and we had worked together

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:13.670
on the campus and we had worked together
 

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.359
on the campus and we had worked together
pretty well to develop one unit so I

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:16.369
pretty well to develop one unit so I
 

00:37:16.369 --> 00:37:18.640
pretty well to develop one unit so I
thought to myself I wonder if Heather

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:18.650
thought to myself I wonder if Heather
 

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.609
thought to myself I wonder if Heather
would be interested in embedding herself

00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:21.619
would be interested in embedding herself
 

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:25.090
would be interested in embedding herself
in my class and and coming and being a

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:25.100
in my class and and coming and being a
 

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.120
in my class and and coming and being a
partner with me in developing a topol

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.130
partner with me in developing a topol
 

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.310
partner with me in developing a topol
grant so we could see if we could put

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320
grant so we could see if we could put
 

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.650
grant so we could see if we could put
together a interdisciplinary course so

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:32.660
together a interdisciplinary course so
 

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.480
together a interdisciplinary course so
so I came together with this particular

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:34.490
so I came together with this particular
 

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:39.849
so I came together with this particular
proposal so here are some factors to

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:39.859
proposal so here are some factors to
 

00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:41.920
proposal so here are some factors to
consider my impulse generally when I

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:41.930
consider my impulse generally when I
 

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.109
consider my impulse generally when I
have an opportunity is say us now and

00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119
have an opportunity is say us now and
 

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:46.390
have an opportunity is say us now and
figure out the details later but it's

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400
figure out the details later but it's
 

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.280
figure out the details later but it's
probably a good idea to consider some of

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:48.290
probably a good idea to consider some of
 

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.130
probably a good idea to consider some of
the factors so first of all how high

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.140
the factors so first of all how high
 

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.920
the factors so first of all how high
profile is the collaboration that you

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:53.930
profile is the collaboration that you
 

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.330
profile is the collaboration that you
are able to dive into if you do one shot

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:58.340
are able to dive into if you do one shot
 

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.700
are able to dive into if you do one shot
bibliographic instruction session and it

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:00.710
bibliographic instruction session and it
 

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.050
bibliographic instruction session and it
doesn't go well maybe you've got a

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.060
doesn't go well maybe you've got a
 

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.050
doesn't go well maybe you've got a
migraine no one's going to hear about it

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:05.060
migraine no one's going to hear about it
 

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.340
migraine no one's going to hear about it
because no one's going to bother talking

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:06.350
because no one's going to bother talking
 

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.050
because no one's going to bother talking
about it but if it's an entire course

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:08.060
about it but if it's an entire course
 

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.450
about it but if it's an entire course
people will be watching so that's one

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:10.460
people will be watching so that's one
 

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.280
people will be watching so that's one
factor to consider secondly

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:12.290
factor to consider secondly
 

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.200
factor to consider secondly
administrative support so Ryan mentioned

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.210
administrative support so Ryan mentioned
 

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.080
administrative support so Ryan mentioned
that we certainly had reason to believe

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.090
that we certainly had reason to believe
 

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.510
that we certainly had reason to believe
that our Provost would be excited about

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520
that our Provost would be excited about
 

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:19.960
that our Provost would be excited about
it

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:19.970
it
 

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.880
it
and consequently the library director as

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:21.890
and consequently the library director as
 

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.060
and consequently the library director as
well we were both on tenure tracks and

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:25.070
well we were both on tenure tracks and
 

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.770
well we were both on tenure tracks and
so it really made sense to collaborate

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:26.780
so it really made sense to collaborate
 

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.099
so it really made sense to collaborate
and i think that the collaboration is

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:30.109
and i think that the collaboration is
 

00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:32.770
and i think that the collaboration is
the key component of this type of

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:32.780
the key component of this type of
 

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:38.710
the key component of this type of
endeavor and pardon me we also had the

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720
endeavor and pardon me we also had the
 

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.960
endeavor and pardon me we also had the
advantage of because we knew that the

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:40.970
advantage of because we knew that the
 

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.880
advantage of because we knew that the
campus theme was environment is

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:42.890
campus theme was environment is
 

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.680
campus theme was environment is
everything the library was anticipating

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:44.690
everything the library was anticipating
 

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.690
everything the library was anticipating
more research in this area and so we

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:46.700
more research in this area and so we
 

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.010
more research in this area and so we
started to bolster our collection

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:48.020
started to bolster our collection
 

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.740
started to bolster our collection
accordingly and this offset one of the

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:50.750
accordingly and this offset one of the
 

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.180
accordingly and this offset one of the
potential frustrations that's been

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:52.190
potential frustrations that's been
 

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.190
potential frustrations that's been
identified for embedded librarians which

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200
identified for embedded librarians which
 

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.490
identified for embedded librarians which
is not having a sufficient collection to

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:56.500
is not having a sufficient collection to
 

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.920
is not having a sufficient collection to
enhance that collaboration and next up

00:38:59.920 --> 00:38:59.930
enhance that collaboration and next up
 

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.500
enhance that collaboration and next up
is a track record do you have a track

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:02.510
is a track record do you have a track
 

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.870
is a track record do you have a track
record to build off of so in our case we

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880
record to build off of so in our case we
 

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.140
record to build off of so in our case we
did have this one isolated lecture that

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:08.150
did have this one isolated lecture that
 

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.420
did have this one isolated lecture that
we could use as a model and in our case

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.430
we could use as a model and in our case
 

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.070
we could use as a model and in our case
we're hoping that if you haven't tried

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.080
we're hoping that if you haven't tried
 

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.599
we're hoping that if you haven't tried
anything like this perhaps today's

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:13.609
anything like this perhaps today's
 

00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:16.060
anything like this perhaps today's
session might inform the direction you

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.070
session might inform the direction you
 

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:18.190
session might inform the direction you
might take and act as a jumping-off

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200
might take and act as a jumping-off
 

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.680
might take and act as a jumping-off
point and lastly is there someone you

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:20.690
point and lastly is there someone you
 

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.810
point and lastly is there someone you
can trust so of today's a classic

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:22.820
can trust so of today's a classic
 

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.490
can trust so of today's a classic
example I'm recovering from laryngitis

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:24.500
example I'm recovering from laryngitis
 

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.040
example I'm recovering from laryngitis
and Ryan I needed to be able to trust

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.050
and Ryan I needed to be able to trust
 

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.020
and Ryan I needed to be able to trust
him that if I was sick and delayed in

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.030
him that if I was sick and delayed in
 

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.510
him that if I was sick and delayed in
Canada he could step in and speak as a

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520
Canada he could step in and speak as a
 

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.140
Canada he could step in and speak as a
librarian in a librarian symposium and I

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.150
librarian in a librarian symposium and I
 

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.910
librarian in a librarian symposium and I
knew that he would pull through and

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920
knew that he would pull through and
 

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.400
knew that he would pull through and
likewise he would need to trust that if

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:39.410
likewise he would need to trust that if
 

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.440
likewise he would need to trust that if
I couldn't make it i would keep the

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:41.450
I couldn't make it i would keep the
 

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.150
I couldn't make it i would keep the
lines of communication open constantly

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160
lines of communication open constantly
 

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.280
lines of communication open constantly
so i think this is a classic example of

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:45.290
so i think this is a classic example of
 

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.710
so i think this is a classic example of
needing to have absolute trust with the

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720
needing to have absolute trust with the
 

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.550
needing to have absolute trust with the
person that you're collaborating with so

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560
person that you're collaborating with so
 

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.589

environmental studies courses and there

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:11.420
environmental studies courses and there
 

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.660

this was a great opportunity but he
 

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.000
this was a great opportunity but he
certainly let the responsibility rest

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:25.010
certainly let the responsibility rest
 

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.730
certainly let the responsibility rest
with me saying you know let me let me

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:27.740
with me saying you know let me let me
 

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.920

know exactly
 

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.280
know exactly
what you need so for example we had my

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:37.290
what you need so for example we had my
 

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.510
what you need so for example we had my
colleagues filling in for me at the

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520
colleagues filling in for me at the
 

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.730
colleagues filling in for me at the
reference desk because it's taking you

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740
reference desk because it's taking you
 

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.800
reference desk because it's taking you
away from the front lines but you really

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:42.810
away from the front lines but you really
 

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.420
away from the front lines but you really
need to be communicating with your

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:44.430
need to be communicating with your
 

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.280
need to be communicating with your
colleagues why you need them to fill in

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.290
colleagues why you need them to fill in
 

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.290
colleagues why you need them to fill in
for you and how it's benefiting the

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300
for you and how it's benefiting the
 

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.450
for you and how it's benefiting the
profile of the library in general and

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460
profile of the library in general and
 

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.370

on writing critical analyses of still

images of artwork and so then it was a

00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:24.549
images of artwork and so then it was a
 

00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:26.819
images of artwork and so then it was a
great move to go from that to a gallery

00:45:26.819 --> 00:45:26.829
great move to go from that to a gallery
 

00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:28.739
great move to go from that to a gallery
environment and use those same skills

00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:28.749
environment and use those same skills
 

00:45:28.749 --> 00:45:31.890
environment and use those same skills
and then once they were comfortable with

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:31.900
and then once they were comfortable with
 

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.539
and then once they were comfortable with
that once they'd been interacting with

00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:33.549
that once they'd been interacting with
 

00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:35.609

curators at galleries they were ready to

00:45:35.609 --> 00:45:35.619
curators at galleries they were ready to
 

00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:37.349
curators at galleries they were ready to
curate their own show so we had the

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359
curate their own show so we had the
 

00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:40.979
curate their own show so we had the
students create a gallery show of art

00:45:40.979 --> 00:45:40.989
students create a gallery show of art
 

00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:42.660

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:42.670
made from recycled materials will show
 

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.609
made from recycled materials will show
you some images in a minute and that was

00:45:44.609 --> 00:45:44.619
you some images in a minute and that was
 

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:48.059
you some images in a minute and that was
in the library and that necessitated

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:48.069
in the library and that necessitated
 

00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:50.190
in the library and that necessitated
having a liaison because we didn't want

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200
having a liaison because we didn't want
 

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.049
having a liaison because we didn't want
our library director to be surprised by

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:52.059
our library director to be surprised by

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:53.410
all of a sudden there's students
 

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:55.859
all of a sudden there's students
patching up the walls or you know doing

00:45:55.859 --> 00:45:55.869
patching up the walls or you know doing
 

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:58.019

know little areas to try to fit in

00:45:59.880 --> 00:45:59.890
know little areas to try to fit in
 

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.670
know little areas to try to fit in
sculptures and what's going on so I was

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680
sculptures and what's going on so I was
 

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.739
sculptures and what's going on so I was
the liaison for that and probably the

00:46:04.739 --> 00:46:04.749
the liaison for that and probably the
 

00:46:04.749 --> 00:46:07.170
the liaison for that and probably the
most overt librarian role I had in this

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.180
most overt librarian role I had in this
 

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.209
most overt librarian role I had in this
capacity was helping the students to

00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:09.219
capacity was helping the students to
 

00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:10.799
capacity was helping the students to
navigate through the classroom

00:46:10.799 --> 00:46:10.809
navigate through the classroom
 

00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:12.690
navigate through the classroom
management software but otherwise I

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:12.700
management software but otherwise I
 

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.779
management software but otherwise I
didn't really have a really forceful

00:46:15.779 --> 00:46:15.789
didn't really have a really forceful
 

00:46:15.789 --> 00:46:18.630
didn't really have a really forceful
approach to it was almost like I was

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640
approach to it was almost like I was
 

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.190
approach to it was almost like I was
more there's a subject specialist who

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200
more there's a subject specialist who
 

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.779
more there's a subject specialist who
happened to be there co-instructor and

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:21.789
happened to be there co-instructor and
 

00:46:21.789 --> 00:46:23.670
happened to be there co-instructor and
who happened to also work at the library

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680
who happened to also work at the library
 

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.099
who happened to also work at the library
but I don't think that the students

00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:26.109
but I don't think that the students
 

00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:27.959
but I don't think that the students
necessarily saw me as a librarian who's

00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:27.969
necessarily saw me as a librarian who's
 

00:46:27.969 --> 00:46:29.880
necessarily saw me as a librarian who's
sitting in on the class which i think

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:29.890
sitting in on the class which i think
 

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.109
sitting in on the class which i think
worked well I think it felt a little

00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119
worked well I think it felt a little
 

00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:33.749
worked well I think it felt a little
more natural so the rest of the

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:33.759
more natural so the rest of the
 

00:46:33.759 --> 00:46:35.339
more natural so the rest of the
logistics were more or less how we would

00:46:35.339 --> 00:46:35.349
logistics were more or less how we would
 

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:36.930
logistics were more or less how we would
put a unit together how would we work

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:36.940
put a unit together how would we work
 

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.279
put a unit together how would we work
that's art that's sort of like how the

00:46:38.279 --> 00:46:38.289
that's art that's sort of like how the
 

00:46:38.289 --> 00:46:40.979
that's art that's sort of like how the
students solve division of labor this is

00:46:40.979 --> 00:46:40.989
students solve division of labor this is
 

00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:42.900
students solve division of labor this is
sort of behind the scenes on how we

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:42.910
sort of behind the scenes on how we
 

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.269
sort of behind the scenes on how we
would develop a unit and so one of the

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:45.279
would develop a unit and so one of the
 

00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:46.680
would develop a unit and so one of the
things that that we would do is I would

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:46.690
things that that we would do is I would
 

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.329
things that that we would do is I would
come up I would I would comb through the

00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:48.339
come up I would I would comb through the
 

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:49.680
come up I would I would comb through the
environmental literature and I would

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:49.690
environmental literature and I would
 

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:50.999
environmental literature and I would
come up with at least a couple of

00:46:50.999 --> 00:46:51.009
come up with at least a couple of
 

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:53.160
come up with at least a couple of
artists who are working with an

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.170
artists who are working with an
 

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.319
artists who are working with an
environmental issue that I would like

00:46:55.319 --> 00:46:55.329
environmental issue that I would like
 

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:57.029
environmental issue that I would like
for the students to better understand

00:46:57.029 --> 00:46:57.039
for the students to better understand
 

00:46:57.039 --> 00:46:58.920
for the students to better understand
and I would kick those artists over to

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:58.930
and I would kick those artists over to
 

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:04.499
and I would kick those artists over to
Heather okay gesture sorry and then I

00:47:04.499 --> 00:47:04.509
Heather okay gesture sorry and then I
 

00:47:04.509 --> 00:47:08.190
Heather okay gesture sorry and then I
would look for images that would be sort

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200
would look for images that would be sort
 

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.499
would look for images that would be sort
of the key images from those artists the

00:47:10.499 --> 00:47:10.509
of the key images from those artists the
 

00:47:10.509 --> 00:47:11.789
of the key images from those artists the
famous ones are the ones that really

00:47:11.789 --> 00:47:11.799
famous ones are the ones that really
 

00:47:11.799 --> 00:47:14.220
famous ones are the ones that really
encapsulate encapsulated an idea

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.230
encapsulate encapsulated an idea
 

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.440
encapsulate encapsulated an idea
and then we kind of fine tune the list

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:16.450
and then we kind of fine tune the list
 

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.330
and then we kind of fine tune the list
of artists that would be appropriate for

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:18.340
of artists that would be appropriate for
 

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.280
of artists that would be appropriate for
the lecture right so Heather would

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:20.290
the lecture right so Heather would
 

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.570
the lecture right so Heather would
expand the list she would give me more

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:21.580
expand the list she would give me more
 

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.760
expand the list she would give me more
options than I knew were available and

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:23.770
options than I knew were available and
 

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.960
options than I knew were available and
then she would give me their whole

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:24.970
then she would give me their whole
 

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:26.400
then she would give me their whole
bodies of work or at least large

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:26.410
bodies of work or at least large
 

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.440
bodies of work or at least large
portions of their bodies of work I would

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:28.450
portions of their bodies of work I would
 

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.480
portions of their bodies of work I would
then go through that and think about the

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:30.490
then go through that and think about the
 

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.700
then go through that and think about the
environmental issue I wanted to focus on

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:32.710
environmental issue I wanted to focus on
 

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.530
environmental issue I wanted to focus on
for the day what is this environmental

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:34.540
for the day what is this environmental
 

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.540
for the day what is this environmental
topic and an artist might produce a

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:36.550
topic and an artist might produce a
 

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.640
topic and an artist might produce a
whole bunch of a whole huge body work

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:38.650
whole bunch of a whole huge body work
 

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.020
whole bunch of a whole huge body work
talk because spanning a whole bunch of

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:40.030
talk because spanning a whole bunch of
 

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.240
talk because spanning a whole bunch of
subjects and so we would call out those

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.250
subjects and so we would call out those
 

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.910
subjects and so we would call out those
ones that were specific and would kind

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920
ones that were specific and would kind
 

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.710
ones that were specific and would kind
of revolve around this one issue for the

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720
of revolve around this one issue for the
 

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.859
of revolve around this one issue for the
day and so with I'd say okay just these

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:49.869
day and so with I'd say okay just these
 

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:51.750
day and so with I'd say okay just these
let's talk about just these and I and I

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760
let's talk about just these and I and I
 

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.880
let's talk about just these and I and I
could see like the heart crushing of

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:53.890
could see like the heart crushing of
 

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.160
could see like the heart crushing of
true art historians and art librarians

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.170
true art historians and art librarians
 

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.480
true art historians and art librarians
what are you doing what are you doing

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:57.490
what are you doing what are you doing
 

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.640
what are you doing what are you doing
you're taking this but I was talking

00:47:59.640 --> 00:47:59.650
you're taking this but I was talking
 

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.349
you're taking this but I was talking
about the environment so I felt I had

00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359
about the environment so I felt I had
 

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:03.450
about the environment so I felt I had
license there and so I say let's just

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:03.460
license there and so I say let's just
 

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.240
license there and so I say let's just
let's just focus on this um and then and

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:06.250
let's just focus on this um and then and
 

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.130
let's just focus on this um and then and
then Heather would then take that you

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:08.140
then Heather would then take that you
 

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.810
then Heather would then take that you
want me just do this person here Heather

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:09.820
want me just do this person here Heather
 

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.520
want me just do this person here Heather
Heather would Heather would take it and

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:11.530
Heather would Heather would take it and
 

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.960
Heather would Heather would take it and
would sort of construct a historical

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:12.970
would sort of construct a historical
 

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.250
would sort of construct a historical
time with you she would try to piece

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:14.260
time with you she would try to piece
 

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.780
time with you she would try to piece
back the fabric that I had ripped

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:15.790
back the fabric that I had ripped
 

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.270
back the fabric that I had ripped
completely out of it all right so that

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280
completely out of it all right so that
 

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.099
completely out of it all right so that
there was context for the students and

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:20.109
there was context for the students and
 

00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:22.650
there was context for the students and
the idea of this was that in the

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:22.660
the idea of this was that in the
 

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.510
the idea of this was that in the
lectures that we would give them a

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520
lectures that we would give them a
 

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.310
lectures that we would give them a
concept here's environmental concept

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:26.320
concept here's environmental concept
 

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.590
concept here's environmental concept
here are some artists here are some key

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:28.600
here are some artists here are some key
 

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.740
here are some artists here are some key
Sentinel works on this now during the

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:31.750
Sentinel works on this now during the
 

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.770
Sentinel works on this now during the
class as you spend some time looking up

paralleling back the making it a
 

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.000
paralleling back the making it a
skeleton so the students could flesh it

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.010
skeleton so the students could flesh it
 

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.250

back out again was sort of the idea so I

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:53.260
back out again was sort of the idea so I
 

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.930
back out again was sort of the idea so I
would then take Heather's back

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:54.940
would then take Heather's back
 

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.310
would then take Heather's back
reconstructed thing and I would put it

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:56.320
reconstructed thing and I would put it

that embedded librarianship is outside

of the the target of work plan of a lot
 

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.850
of the the target of work plan of a lot
of librarians and what results from that

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:42.860
of librarians and what results from that
 

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.070
of librarians and what results from that
is that it's hard to manage all of your

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:45.080
is that it's hard to manage all of your
 

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.170
is that it's hard to manage all of your
responsibilities so of course it's great

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:47.180
responsibilities so of course it's great
 

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.600

think part of the challenge is that

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000
think part of the challenge is that
 

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.270
think part of the challenge is that
there's sort of a gray zone where

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280
there's sort of a gray zone where
 

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.200
there's sort of a gray zone where

again I think it was the teaching

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:14.390
again I think it was the teaching
 

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.450
again I think it was the teaching

where do librarians exist and can they

where do librarians exist and can they

so fortunately our administration was

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.260
so fortunately our administration was
 

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.540
so fortunately our administration was
really supportive but we did have a

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:37.550
really supportive but we did have a
 

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.550
really supportive but we did have a
number of challenges so for example I

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:39.560
number of challenges so for example I
 

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.180
number of challenges so for example I
have a 12 month or

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.190
have a 12 month or
 

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.650
have a 12 month or
had pardon me a twelvemonth appointment

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660
had pardon me a twelvemonth appointment
 

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.530
had pardon me a twelvemonth appointment
and Ryan had a nine-month appointment so

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540
and Ryan had a nine-month appointment so
 

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.540
and Ryan had a nine-month appointment so
that would interfere with when you start

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:47.550
that would interfere with when you start
 

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.220
that would interfere with when you start
planning the course the summer time for

their their obligation for the school

10-year standards fortunately it was

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:03.930
10-year standards fortunately it was
 

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.200
10-year standards fortunately it was
seen as a positive move for me to try

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:06.210
seen as a positive move for me to try
 

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.150
seen as a positive move for me to try
this type of thing but still there were

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160
this type of thing but still there were
 

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.450
this type of thing but still there were
certainly workload expectations that I

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460
certainly workload expectations that I
 

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.370
certainly workload expectations that I
really did need to rely on Ryan to do

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380
really did need to rely on Ryan to do
 

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.589
really did need to rely on Ryan to do
the heavy lifting because it was hard to

00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599
the heavy lifting because it was hard to
 

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.390
the heavy lifting because it was hard to
get away as much as I would have liked

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400
get away as much as I would have liked
 

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.800
get away as much as I would have liked
to have gotten away to work on the

to have gotten away to work on the
 

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:23.420
to have gotten away to work on the

being sort of a technical issue with the

00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:25.589
being sort of a technical issue with the
 

00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:28.160
being sort of a technical issue with the
tenure standards was because this was a

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:28.170
tenure standards was because this was a
 

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.099
tenure standards was because this was a
co instructed course we only had one

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:31.109
co instructed course we only had one
 

00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:33.250
co instructed course we only had one
still only had one course evaluation

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:33.260
still only had one course evaluation
 

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.800
still only had one course evaluation
which says evaluate your instructor and

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:36.810
which says evaluate your instructor and
 

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.829
which says evaluate your instructor and
and not to not evaluate Heather then

00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839
and not to not evaluate Heather then
 

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:41.839
and not to not evaluate Heather then
evaluate Ryan it was evaluate your

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:41.849
evaluate Ryan it was evaluate your
 

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:45.400
evaluate Ryan it was evaluate your

professor those those evaluations are

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440
professor those those evaluations are
 

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.579
professor those those evaluations are
very very important so we were so we may

00:52:52.579 --> 00:52:52.589
very very important so we were so we may
 

00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:54.020
very very important so we were so we may
we had to wind up making clear for

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.030
we had to wind up making clear for
 

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.690
we had to wind up making clear for
students that that that the the teacher

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700
students that that that the the teacher
 

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.160

evaluations we're not going to factor

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.170
evaluations we're not going to factor
 

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.890
evaluations we're not going to factor
into Heather's tenure consideration they

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900
into Heather's tenure consideration they
 

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.569
into Heather's tenure consideration they
were going to factor into mine so when

00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579
were going to factor into mine so when
 

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:06.410
were going to factor into mine so when
you do this fill it out for me and so

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420
you do this fill it out for me and so
 

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.180
you do this fill it out for me and so
there wasn't an opportunity to fill it

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:08.190
there wasn't an opportunity to fill it
 

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.210
there wasn't an opportunity to fill it
out a separate type of thing for Heather

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:10.220
out a separate type of thing for Heather
 

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.920
out a separate type of thing for Heather
and so that was sort of it as one of

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:12.930
and so that was sort of it as one of
 

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.690
and so that was sort of it as one of
those situations where we tried the best

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700
those situations where we tried the best
 

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.089
those situations where we tried the best
we darn could to make this equal and

00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099
we darn could to make this equal and
 

00:53:17.099 --> 00:53:19.220
we darn could to make this equal and
then when it came down to evaluating it

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:19.230
then when it came down to evaluating it
 

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.200
then when it came down to evaluating it
we you know we either we dropped the

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.210
we you know we either we dropped the
 

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:22.670
we you know we either we dropped the
ball or we just couldn't do it one way

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680
ball or we just couldn't do it one way
 

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.589
ball or we just couldn't do it one way
or the other and so this sort of just

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599
or the other and so this sort of just
 

00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:26.809
or the other and so this sort of just
something I wanted to highlight to keep

00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819
something I wanted to highlight to keep
 

00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:28.880
something I wanted to highlight to keep
you guys abreast of how that kind of

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:28.890
you guys abreast of how that kind of
 

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.520
you guys abreast of how that kind of
worked out there do you wanted it this

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:31.530
worked out there do you wanted it this
 

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:32.920
worked out there do you wanted it this
part you want me to look at you alright

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:32.930
part you want me to look at you alright
 

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.480
part you want me to look at you alright
so one of the things that we were really

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:35.490
so one of the things that we were really
 

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.370
so one of the things that we were really
excited about was that there was kind of

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380
excited about was that there was kind of
 

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.880
excited about was that there was kind of
a dual model of embeddedness so usually

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:40.890
a dual model of embeddedness so usually
 

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:42.800
a dual model of embeddedness so usually
when you hear of embedded librarians the

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:42.810
when you hear of embedded librarians the
 

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.450
when you hear of embedded librarians the
librarian is taken out of the library

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460
librarian is taken out of the library
 

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.470
librarian is taken out of the library
and isn't another classroom or somewhere

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480
and isn't another classroom or somewhere
 

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.700
and isn't another classroom or somewhere
outside the library that's sort of the

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:49.710
outside the library that's sort of the
 

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.500
outside the library that's sort of the
the key component in our case we

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:51.510
the key component in our case we
 

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.300
the key component in our case we
actually had the course within the

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:53.310
actually had the course within the
 

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.240
actually had the course within the
library

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:54.250
library
 

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:58.350
library
and so that offered it was really

00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:58.360
and so that offered it was really
 

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.340
and so that offered it was really
exciting because it would mean that

00:53:59.340 --> 00:53:59.350
exciting because it would mean that
 

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.450
exciting because it would mean that
students would be closer to the

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:00.460
students would be closer to the
 

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.910
students would be closer to the
reference desk and studies showed that

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920
reference desk and studies showed that
 

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.530
reference desk and studies showed that
there tends to be an increase in

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:04.540
there tends to be an increase in
 

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.970
there tends to be an increase in
reference questions when you have

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:05.980
reference questions when you have
 

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.790
reference questions when you have
embedded librarians and the students

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800
embedded librarians and the students
 

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.290
embedded librarians and the students
would be walking past the reference desk

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:10.300
would be walking past the reference desk
 

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.230
would be walking past the reference desk
as they exited it was the only path out

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240
as they exited it was the only path out
 

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.480
as they exited it was the only path out
of the library or when they were done

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:15.490
of the library or when they were done
 

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.130
of the library or when they were done
class if they wanted to check out a book

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:17.140
class if they wanted to check out a book
 

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.930
class if they wanted to check out a book
on an artist that they just learned

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:18.940
on an artist that they just learned
 

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.640
on an artist that they just learned
about they had that opportunity so it

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:20.650
about they had that opportunity so it
 

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.920
about they had that opportunity so it
was really a chance to welcome an active

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:22.930
was really a chance to welcome an active
 

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.140
was really a chance to welcome an active
library users and so that was quite

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:25.150
library users and so that was quite
 

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:29.790
library users and so that was quite
exciting so very similar to Colombia's

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:29.800
exciting so very similar to Colombia's
 

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.500
exciting so very similar to Colombia's
layout you know with the libraries being

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.510
layout you know with the libraries being
 

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.660
layout you know with the libraries being
right in the center of campus our

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:33.670
right in the center of campus our
 

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.430
right in the center of campus our
library also is in the center campus we

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440
library also is in the center campus we
 

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.350

going to being a little tongue-in-cheek

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:38.410
going to being a little tongue-in-cheek
 

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:42.150
going to being a little tongue-in-cheek
is we just have one library and it's and

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160
is we just have one library and it's and
 

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.940
is we just have one library and it's and
it's quite a bit smaller but but on our

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:44.950
it's quite a bit smaller but but on our
 

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:46.650
it's quite a bit smaller but but on our
campus you know we've got the natural

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:46.660
campus you know we've got the natural
 

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.330
campus you know we've got the natural
science side of the campus and then

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:48.340
science side of the campus and then
 

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.890

we've got the artist side of the campus

to walk into that science class that's

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:13.420
to walk into that science class that's
 

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.610
to walk into that science class that's
why I came into that science building

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:14.620
why I came into that science building
 

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.290
why I came into that science building
it's why I came to purchase or I'm never

not going to have the scientists come
 

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.470

it so put it in the library that way

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:48.340
it so put it in the library that way
 

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.090
it so put it in the library that way
everyone can see it and it's right there

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:51.100
everyone can see it and it's right there

being a sort of a a very useful tactic

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:58.150
being a sort of a a very useful tactic
 

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.590
being a sort of a a very useful tactic
for us and give you this sort of layout

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:01.600
for us and give you this sort of layout
 

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.230
for us and give you this sort of layout
of our library a little bit here this

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240
of our library a little bit here this
 

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.490
of our library a little bit here this
isn't all the library but this is sort

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:05.500
isn't all the library but this is sort
 

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.020
isn't all the library but this is sort
of the central floor of the library

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.030
of the central floor of the library
 

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:10.570
of the central floor of the library
and when it came time to doing the class

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:10.580
and when it came time to doing the class
 

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.540
and when it came time to doing the class
you can see that nothing in here is

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:13.550
you can see that nothing in here is
 

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:16.390
you can see that nothing in here is
listed as an actual lecture hall or or

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400
listed as an actual lecture hall or or
 

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.090
listed as an actual lecture hall or or
true classroom the best we had were

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:19.100
true classroom the best we had were
 

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.820
true classroom the best we had were
these computer labs which actually

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:21.830
these computer labs which actually
 

00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:25.600
these computer labs which actually
worked well for us because we wanted

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:25.610
worked well for us because we wanted
 

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.060
worked well for us because we wanted
students researching more about the the

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.070
students researching more about the the
 

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.100
students researching more about the the
artists as we talked about them we

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:30.110
artists as we talked about them we
 

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.380
artists as we talked about them we
wanted them to get online so we chose

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.390
wanted them to get online so we chose
 

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.850
wanted them to get online so we chose
one of the computer labs to be our

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:33.860
one of the computer labs to be our
 

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.710
one of the computer labs to be our
classroom and we're not the kind of

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720
classroom and we're not the kind of
 

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.390
classroom and we're not the kind of
college that encourages everyone or

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400
college that encourages everyone or
 

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.160
college that encourages everyone or
requires everyone to have a laptop that

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.170
requires everyone to have a laptop that
 

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:41.560
requires everyone to have a laptop that
kind of thing so to have a class with

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:41.570
kind of thing so to have a class with
 

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.380
kind of thing so to have a class with
students having the omnipresent internet

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:44.390
students having the omnipresent internet
 

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:46.780
students having the omnipresent internet
right in front of them between you and

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:46.790
right in front of them between you and
 

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:51.610
right in front of them between you and
them is sort of a big deal and so but we

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:51.620
them is sort of a big deal and so but we
 

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.260
them is sort of a big deal and so but we
wanted that to happen so we could say

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:53.270
wanted that to happen so we could say
 

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.740
wanted that to happen so we could say
here is a particular artist visit their

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:56.750
here is a particular artist visit their
 

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.090
here is a particular artist visit their
website and look at some more of their

00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:58.100
website and look at some more of their
 

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.820
website and look at some more of their
work so that was something that we that

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:00.830
work so that was something that we that
 

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.400
work so that was something that we that
wound up working very well for us the

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:03.410
wound up working very well for us the
 

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.170
wound up working very well for us the
other thing when we had visiting artists

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:05.180
other thing when we had visiting artists
 

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.550
other thing when we had visiting artists
you can imagine a visiting artist would

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:06.560
you can imagine a visiting artist would
 

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.560
you can imagine a visiting artist would

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:48.320
consider embedding some courses in the
 

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.500
consider embedding some courses in the
library and not just bringing librarians

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:50.510
library and not just bringing librarians
 

01:03:50.510 --> 01:04:06.470
library and not just bringing librarians
outside of the library thank

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480

Ryan is there an alternative course that
 

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.240
Ryan is there an alternative course that
you or someone else teaches it it's SUNY

the technical or political aspects of
 

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.630
the technical or political aspects of
environmental science well we t we teach

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640
environmental science well we t we teach
 

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.220
environmental science well we t we teach
a number of classes in our and our

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:32.230
a number of classes in our and our
 

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:35.640
a number of classes in our and our
program that there's a policy course

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:35.650
program that there's a policy course
 

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.130
program that there's a policy course
that's focuses solely on environmental

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:38.140
that's focuses solely on environmental
 

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.630
that's focuses solely on environmental
policy then there are more technical

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640
policy then there are more technical
 

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.370
policy then there are more technical
classes like regulations there are

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:41.380
classes like regulations there are
 

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.400
classes like regulations there are
ecology courses human ecology I mean we

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:44.410
ecology courses human ecology I mean we
 

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.430
ecology courses human ecology I mean we
have very specific classes that wind up

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440
have very specific classes that wind up
 

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.690
have very specific classes that wind up
being single discipline though and this

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:51.700
being single discipline though and this
 

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.950
being single discipline though and this
was the we do have a few that are

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960
was the we do have a few that are
 

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.970
was the we do have a few that are
cross-disciplinary like environmental

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:56.980
cross-disciplinary like environmental
 

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.190
cross-disciplinary like environmental
journalism where where one of the

01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200
journalism where where one of the
 

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.500
journalism where where one of the
professors dr. Kramer teaches it with it

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:01.510
professors dr. Kramer teaches it with it
 

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.900
professors dr. Kramer teaches it with it
with it with a journalist professor so

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:03.910
with it with a journalist professor so
 

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:05.490
with it with a journalist professor so
and then and then they art in the

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:05.500
and then and then they art in the
 

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.710
and then and then they art in the
environment course and then we're

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720
environment course and then we're
 

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.600
environment course and then we're
developing an art history course as well

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:09.610
developing an art history course as well
 

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.760
developing an art history course as well
that'll be a co instructed course so we

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:11.770
that'll be a co instructed course so we
 

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:13.770
that'll be a co instructed course so we
do have some courses that are co-taught

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:13.780
do have some courses that are co-taught
 

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.610
do have some courses that are co-taught
with other faculty and but we do have

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:17.620
with other faculty and but we do have
 

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.320
with other faculty and but we do have
multiple environmental courses that

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:19.330
multiple environmental courses that
 

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.370
multiple environmental courses that
students take where they deal with

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:20.380
students take where they deal with
 

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.680
students take where they deal with
different issues around the environment

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:22.690
different issues around the environment
 

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:25.560
different issues around the environment
to that okay all right this isn't the

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:25.570
to that okay all right this isn't the
 

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:36.320
to that okay all right this isn't the
only environmental course we have

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:36.330
 

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:39.359
do you have any suggestions for doing

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:39.369
do you have any suggestions for doing
 

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:41.160
do you have any suggestions for doing
outreach with faculty because typically

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:41.170
outreach with faculty because typically
 

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.109
outreach with faculty because typically
at the campus I met we don't have many

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119
at the campus I met we don't have many
 

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:44.760
at the campus I met we don't have many
faculty coming to the library and saying

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:44.770
faculty coming to the library and saying
 

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:46.740
faculty coming to the library and saying
could you take over half of my course um

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:46.750
could you take over half of my course um
 

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.430
could you take over half of my course um
so what what tips do you have for doing

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440
so what what tips do you have for doing
 

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.910
so what what tips do you have for doing
outreach is that for you Heather I don't

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920
outreach is that for you Heather I don't
 

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.109
outreach is that for you Heather I don't
know that's for you this might be a

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119
know that's for you this might be a
 

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.810
know that's for you this might be a
question for me I guess it might be sort

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:57.820
question for me I guess it might be sort
 

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.030
question for me I guess it might be sort
of a vague answer but I think finding a

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:00.040
of a vague answer but I think finding a
 

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.849
of a vague answer but I think finding a
way to communicate your willingness and

01:06:02.849 --> 01:06:02.859
way to communicate your willingness and
 

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:05.750
way to communicate your willingness and
your worth I guess in my situation I

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760
your worth I guess in my situation I
 

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.339
your worth I guess in my situation I
kind of had a another embedded

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:08.349
kind of had a another embedded
 

01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:10.020
kind of had a another embedded
librarianship opportunity which was

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.030
librarianship opportunity which was
 

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.210
librarianship opportunity which was
sitting on a board of study which is

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:12.220
sitting on a board of study which is
 

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.730
sitting on a board of study which is
kind of like in a department and I think

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:14.740
kind of like in a department and I think
 

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.200
kind of like in a department and I think
if you can be out there and in a

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:19.210
if you can be out there and in a
 

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.940
if you can be out there and in a
completely different context from what

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:20.950
completely different context from what
 

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:22.680
completely different context from what
you're actually after so say I was

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:22.690
you're actually after so say I was
 

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.020
you're actually after so say I was
taking minutes and faculty meetings but

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:25.030
taking minutes and faculty meetings but
 

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:27.300
taking minutes and faculty meetings but
at least it got me in touch with my

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:27.310
at least it got me in touch with my
 

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.160
at least it got me in touch with my
colleagues and so I think if I tried to

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:29.170
colleagues and so I think if I tried to
 

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.680
colleagues and so I think if I tried to
broach something like this with one of

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:31.690
broach something like this with one of
 

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.810
broach something like this with one of
them it would have I would have had a

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:33.820
them it would have I would have had a
 

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.790
them it would have I would have had a
better shot at it from I guess doing

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:35.800
better shot at it from I guess doing
 

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.180
better shot at it from I guess doing
them a favor but I think that's probably

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:39.190
them a favor but I think that's probably
 

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:40.650
them a favor but I think that's probably
something that we still need to think

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:40.660
something that we still need to think
 

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.520
something that we still need to think
about I guess I guess getting getting

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:44.530
about I guess I guess getting getting
 

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.410
about I guess I guess getting getting
this hypothetical support of a library

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:46.420
this hypothetical support of a library
 

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.690
this hypothetical support of a library
director in advance so that if you're in

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:48.700
director in advance so that if you're in
 

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.839
director in advance so that if you're in
a conversation with somebody you can let

01:06:51.839 --> 01:06:51.849
a conversation with somebody you can let
 

01:06:51.849 --> 01:06:54.000
a conversation with somebody you can let
them know that the opportunity exists I

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.010
them know that the opportunity exists I
 

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.540
them know that the opportunity exists I
guess it would be very risky to kind of

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:57.550
guess it would be very risky to kind of
 

01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.430
guess it would be very risky to kind of
indicate your willingness and then find

01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440
indicate your willingness and then find
 

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.650
indicate your willingness and then find
out that you don't have the resources to

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:01.660
out that you don't have the resources to
 

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.050
out that you don't have the resources to
support you while you're actually trying

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:04.060
support you while you're actually trying
 

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.290
support you while you're actually trying
to make it happen yeah I think if

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:07.300
to make it happen yeah I think if
 

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.940
to make it happen yeah I think if
there's anything I can add to that it's

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:08.950
there's anything I can add to that it's
 

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.010
there's anything I can add to that it's
it's the fact that we were in two

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:11.020
it's the fact that we were in two
 

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.130
it's the fact that we were in two
different programs or two different

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140
different programs or two different
 

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.589
different programs or two different
specializations to where the need wasn't

01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599
specializations to where the need wasn't
 

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.450
specializations to where the need wasn't
necessarily coming to Heather where she

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:18.460
necessarily coming to Heather where she
 

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.589
necessarily coming to Heather where she
might have thought the need would come

01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599
might have thought the need would come
 

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.540
might have thought the need would come
from that she wasn't coming someone

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:21.550
from that she wasn't coming someone
 

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:22.950
from that she wasn't coming someone
wasn't coming to her from the art

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960
wasn't coming to her from the art
 

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.950
wasn't coming to her from the art
history or the visual arts faculty but

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960
history or the visual arts faculty but
 

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.970
history or the visual arts faculty but
it was coming from someone on the

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:26.980
it was coming from someone on the
 

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.700
it was coming from someone on the
outside where you know if you think

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:29.710
outside where you know if you think
 

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.230
outside where you know if you think
about it I'm the one who needed to help

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240
about it I'm the one who needed to help
 

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.280
about it I'm the one who needed to help
the most for for her not so much for a

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:35.290
the most for for her not so much for a
 

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.230
the most for for her not so much for a
classroom instruction so that's that's

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240
classroom instruction so that's that's
 

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.609
classroom instruction so that's that's
the other thing I think is to think

01:07:38.609 --> 01:07:38.619
the other thing I think is to think
 

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:41.940
the other thing I think is to think
about where your radars is aimed for

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:41.950
about where your radars is aimed for
 

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.349
about where your radars is aimed for
looking at opportunities coming

01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359
 

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:48.059
hi thank you for your presentation it's

01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:48.069
hi thank you for your presentation it's
 

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:50.609
hi thank you for your presentation it's
a great example of an academic

01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:50.619
a great example of an academic
 

01:07:50.619 --> 01:07:52.440
a great example of an academic
collaboration with the library and

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.450
