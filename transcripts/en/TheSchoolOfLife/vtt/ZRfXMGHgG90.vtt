00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
You're turning the pages and a very strange and very nice thing dawns on you.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.540
This book gets you.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.700
Obviously the author, who might have died centuries back,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.560
never knew you at all.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.480
But they write as if they did

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.820
It's as if you'd confessed your secrets to them

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.380
and then they'd gone of and written this work around what you told them.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.080
Transformed of course into a story about people with different names,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.740
or into a essay that doesn't cite your case explicitly.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.100
But might as well do, because it's so completely on target.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.300
We never quite feel we are understood well enough.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
Even by the people who we genuinely like and who are emotionally attached to us.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
A permafrost of loneliness often persists just below the surface.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.100
Even when things are broadly speaking going well enough.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.740
All this, the book that understands you, appears to know and to be able to correct.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.560
The book in question might be one that speaks to millions, like the Harry Potter series.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.340
Or it could be an almost unique discovery of your own.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.500
Perhaps Schiller's 'Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Mankind'

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.620
Written at the very end of the eighteenth century

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.120
With it's haunting efforts to fuse a noble idealism with political realism

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.040
It could be a self-help book about sex

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000
but alights on just the things that are troubling you

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.840
Or you might feel that 'Mademoiselle de Maupin'

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.580
Written by ThÃ©ophile Gautier in the middle of the 19th century

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.980
And which tells the story of a man and a woman

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.760
who are both in love with a central character.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.840
the operasinger Madeline de Maupin

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.400
Was written by historical miracle exactly for you

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.280
A book knows you by pinpointing

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.100
And taking very seriously, a major but often ignored problem

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.480
that happens to be looming in your existence.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320
For instance, when Harry Potter is with the Dursleys

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.040
the feeling of being an alien

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380
in a familiar environment

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.640
For long stretches of time Harry has to live around people

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.860
who have no idea of his real nature

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.840
They never acknowledge his actual strengths

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.260
He's regarded as a contemptible freak

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.560
for things that elsewhere would make him popular and important.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.200
The book is hugely alive to the feeling of not being appreciated.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.520
With many books we're pleased because we encounter sympathy for things that deserve generous treatment

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200
but normally don't get it.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.140
The darker aspects of one's character are getting a tender hearing.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.340
You've been heard, you've heard others

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.000
And the book says - I know

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.260
So often despite all the people around us

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.920
We're lonely and ashamed

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.460
We're haunted by the worry that no reasonable person

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.660
could feel anything but derision or contempt for our problems.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.140
We feel that to share them with our friends

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.660
would lead to bewildered rejection.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.440
A book that understands you is like an ideal parent or friend,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.480
who makes it acceptable to suffer in the way we do.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.000
Our weirdest sorrows or enjoyments

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.220
are recast as valid parts of human experience

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.900
which can be met with sympathy and kindness.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.480
It is, even though the relationship is with paper and ink only, a kind of love.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.060
And perhaps one of the deepest kinds of love we'll ever know.
