00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:11.176
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today we're
going to take SAT I.

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:14.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Tests, from
national, standardized tests

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:19.116
to final exams are the most
common form of student assessment.

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:22.616
But many educators
believe we need better ways

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.546
to measure learning and achievement.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.666
&gt;&gt;Howard: People may be good test
takers but once you leave the world

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.186
of testing you have
to think for yourself

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:33.216
because the world doesn't
come organized in four choices

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.796
with the fourth one being
"None of the above".

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:37.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Well can I show
you something on the computer?

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:37.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Absolutely.

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:40.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Comprehensive
assessment provides ongoing feedback

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:43.186
so that teachers, principals,

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:47.726
parents and students can constantly
improve teaching and learning

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:50.026
on a daily and weekly basis.

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:52.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: As far as
listening and speaking

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.156
and writing you're
making steady progress.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:58.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Comprehensive
assessments provide a picture

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:02.016
of the whole student, and can
include more traditional measures

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:08.516
like multiple choice tests and essays
as well as portfolios, experiments,

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.956
and role play that
mirrors real life tasks.

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:12.926
&gt;&gt;Hi my name is Eddie Kim.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:16.156
I am a site planner and thank you
for letting us propose a plan.

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:20.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the Urban Plan project
students learn state standards

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:24.206
and economics by working in teams
to create development proposals.

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:25.196
&gt;&gt;Yeah, that's way too high.

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:28.226
How do we kill our percent
but still make the city go up?

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:31.126
&gt;&gt;Dong-Jin: The project as a whole,
it gets you ready for the real world.

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:33.226
Just looking out of the
book it gets pretty tedious,

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.266
like you're just looking in a book.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.676
You're memorizing facts and stuff.

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:38.956
But once you learn how to
actually use those facts,

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:42.426
you get a deeper understanding and
you can better interpret questions

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:44.846
and so you build up like
really useful skills.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.056
&gt;&gt;The number is going to be
about one point five million.

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:50.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While comprehensive
assessment requires a significant

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:55.036
amount of time and energy,
proponents insist the investment pays

00:01:55.106 --> 00:01:56.106
big dividends.

00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:58.266
&gt;&gt;Linda: Students have to
develop the performances.

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.476
The teachers have to evaluate them.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.236
But the time is not lost
to teaching and learning.

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:08.866
The time is teaching and learning
because the actual conduct

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.686
of the assessment is a learning
experience for the students.

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:14.146
It informs teaching.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.616
It actually gives teachers feedback
immediately about what they need

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:21.486
to do to meet students' needs,
so it's actually productive time.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:25.286
&gt;&gt;In the year 2050 education
has become project-based.

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Comprehensive assessment
promotes student accountability

00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:31.136
for learning, self-reflection,

00:02:31.136 --> 00:02:34.396
and presentation skills
needed for the work world.

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:35.676
&gt;&gt;Transportation, four facts.

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:39.806
&gt;&gt;Hugh: As I was mulling all
these issues about assessment,

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.806
I was struck by the fact that there
are all other sorts of attributes

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:45.096
like drive and grit
and determination,

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:48.726
ability to problem solve,
communication skills,

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:52.386
leadership skills, these intangibles
that were critically important.

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:55.146
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Football field
100 yards, 300 feet.

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.946
&gt;&gt;Hugh: And that by virtue
of the excessive reliance

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:01.496
on the testing scores you're ruling
out large numbers of youngsters

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:03.336
of all races, and all complexions

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.076
who may not have stratospheric
test scores,

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:08.696
but who have these other
kinds of attributes

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:12.956
that experience shows contribute to
high-level success in the real world.

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:17.206
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oh so you're just going to
have a bunch of paths through here?

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:17.286
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah.

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:19.436
