00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.750
NARRATOR 1: At first, this photo
doesn't look that significant.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.700
It's just a guy taking a
break during some hike.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.670
But if you were to zoom
out, you'd see this.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
That guy is chilling here,
on Mount Everest, the tallest

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.355
and most dangerous
mountain on earth.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.646
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.390
The photographer alongside
him was this guy.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.400
DAVID RUIZ: Hi, my
name is David Ruiz.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.754
I'm from Barcelona, Spain.

00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:58.060
NARRATOR 1: David
and the other hikers

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.110
in his group stopped
at the Black Rock

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.072
to acclimate to
the thinning air.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:04.280
From here, they begin the
hardest part of their climb

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
up Island Peak, 6200
meters in the sky.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:19.190
NARRATOR 1: Hundreds of extreme
adventurers and climbers

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.090
come from all over the world
to summit Everest each year,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.420
but they can't do it alone
if they want to survive.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.970
They require expert
guides to lead the way.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.380
NARRATOR 1: Sherpas, meaning
Eastern People in Tibetan,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.500
are highly skilled mountaineers
raised in the heart of Nepal's

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.620
Himalayas.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.460
They've been guiding explorers
in the region for decades.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.750
Trekking Mount Everest
is their day job.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.697
That's why this guy
looks so at ease.

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.530
He was just catching a
break between summits

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.210
and had seen this before,
but, to David, this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.570
was an amazing moment.

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:39.590
NARRATOR 1: This
[INAUDIBLE] aims

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.979
to share captivating photos
and the stories behind them.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.020

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.970
on Eagle Hunters in Mongolia.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.350
NARRATOR 2: The eagles
are used to hunt primarily

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.390
foxes, wolves, marmots,
which the hunters obviously

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.120
use for food in
the harsh winters,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.474
and they also use the fur
from animals for clothing.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:03.390
NARRATOR: And, as always,
thanks for watching.
