on for several years in the nuts project
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.780
on for several years in the nuts project
but we're really committing a lot of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
but we're really committing a lot of
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.990
but we're really committing a lot of
infrastructure to it and programmer time

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000
infrastructure to it and programmer time
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.150

and the basic idea here is to say that
 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.640
and the basic idea here is to say that
you know search is the one key piece of

you know search is the one key piece of
 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.890
you know search is the one key piece of
the infrastructure of the internet that

the infrastructure of the internet that
 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.530
the infrastructure of the internet that
is still very much a proprietary closed

is still very much a proprietary closed
 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.229
is still very much a proprietary closed
secretive and we want to try to change

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
secretive and we want to try to change

all the software so people can see it
but additionally what we're trying to do

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
but additionally what we're trying to do
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.049
but additionally what we're trying to do
is bring in the element of mass

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
is bring in the element of mass

decisions that are made within the
 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.480
decisions that are made within the
search engine company and push those out

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
search engine company and push those out
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.300
search engine company and push those out
into the community as much as possible

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310
into the community as much as possible
 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.359
into the community as much as possible
so that you know the search results

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
so that you know the search results
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.120
so that you know the search results
reflect well whatever this community

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
reflect well whatever this community
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340
reflect well whatever this community
things should be ranked in certain ways

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
things should be ranked in certain ways
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.399
things should be ranked in certain ways
so we just launched a very preliminary

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
so we just launched a very preliminary
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.940
so we just launched a very preliminary
alpha version a couple months ago we are

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
0.2 which will be releasing within the
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.029
0.2 which will be releasing within the
next month or two we haven't really

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039
next month or two we haven't really
 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.590

something I need to be working on right
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.499
something I need to be working on right
now is my release schedule but yeah

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
now is my release schedule but yeah
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539

we're really looking forward to getting

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
we're really looking forward to getting
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.889
we're really looking forward to getting
that out because there's a lot of cool

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
that out because there's a lot of cool
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.969
that out because there's a lot of cool
new tools and things so

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
 
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.440
 
in terms of the user experience we

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450
in terms of the user experience we
 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.080
in terms of the user experience we
expect it to be really quite a bit

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090
expect it to be really quite a bit
 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.539
expect it to be really quite a bit
similar I mean in other words you come

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549
similar I mean in other words you come
 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.560
similar I mean in other words you come
and you type something you're looking

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
and you type something you're looking
 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.240
and you type something you're looking
for and you hit search and you get some

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250
for and you hit search and you get some
 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.880
for and you hit search and you get some
stuff back the one major difference at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890
stuff back the one major difference at
 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.309
stuff back the one major difference at
that point is that you'll be able to

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319
that point is that you'll be able to
 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.559
that point is that you'll be able to
edit the results in essence so you'll be

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569
edit the results in essence so you'll be
 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.229
edit the results in essence so you'll be
able to delete things add things and

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239
able to delete things add things and
 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.000
able to delete things add things and
those are going to be public actions

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
those are going to be public actions
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250
those are going to be public actions
just as a public when you edit Wikipedia

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260
just as a public when you edit Wikipedia
 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.650
just as a public when you edit Wikipedia
that's a public action and there'll be a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660
that's a public action and there'll be a
 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.300
that's a public action and there'll be a
whole community of people monitoring and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
whole community of people monitoring and
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.600
whole community of people monitoring and
and you know overseeing all that that's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
and you know overseeing all that that's
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.130
and you know overseeing all that that's
the main difference from the end user

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
the main difference from the end user
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.860
the main difference from the end user
point of view but for me I think the the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
point of view but for me I think the the
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.710
point of view but for me I think the the
deeper implication here is not about

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720
deeper implication here is not about
 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.310
deeper implication here is not about
sort of just the user experience but

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
sort of just the user experience but
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.650
sort of just the user experience but
about the open source nature the free

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
about the open source nature the free
 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.780
about the open source nature the free
software nature the way I look at that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
software nature the way I look at that
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.000
software nature the way I look at that
for for the average user obviously

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
for for the average user obviously
 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.440

you're not going to go and download all
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.610
you're not going to go and download all
our source code and read it that's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
our source code and read it that's
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.060
our source code and read it that's
really not that important but what is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
really not that important but what is
 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.320
really not that important but what is
important it is as being very similar to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
important it is as being very similar to
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.650
important it is as being very similar to
you know free society in an open society

we insist that our court systems operate

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
we insist that our court systems operate
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.890
we insist that our court systems operate
in a public fashion so you can go down

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
in a public fashion so you can go down
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.930
in a public fashion so you can go down
to the courthouse today and go in and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940
to the courthouse today and go in and
 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.910
to the courthouse today and go in and
and watch a trial unfold and that's done

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920
and watch a trial unfold and that's done
 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.030
and watch a trial unfold and that's done
in public and that's a valuable

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
in public and that's a valuable
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.620

safeguard for Human Rights democracy
even though most of us never actually

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
even though most of us never actually
 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.830
even though most of us never actually
bother going down to the courthouse but

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
bother going down to the courthouse but
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.420
bother going down to the courthouse but
it's important that there are people who

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
it's important that there are people who
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.940
it's important that there are people who
can and people who do and they'll raise

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950
can and people who do and they'll raise
 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.699
can and people who do and they'll raise
the alarm if something untoward is going

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709
the alarm if something untoward is going
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.810
the alarm if something untoward is going
on and that's really the way it works

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
on and that's really the way it works
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.240
on and that's really the way it works
with open source software there's also a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
with open source software there's also a
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.490
with open source software there's also a
lot of practical benefits open source

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
lot of practical benefits open source
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.810
lot of practical benefits open source
software which I think we can realize

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820
software which I think we can realize
 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.140
software which I think we can realize
here you know right now you know

hands-down the best web browser is
 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.330
hands-down the best web browser is
Firefox which is an open source project

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340
Firefox which is an open source project
 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.710
Firefox which is an open source project
and you know that's the that development

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
and you know that's the that development
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.060

highly effective one of the things we're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
highly effective one of the things we're
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.530
highly effective one of the things we're
looking at is that there are a lot of

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540
looking at is that there are a lot of
 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.930
looking at is that there are a lot of
parts of the search business that are

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
parts of the search business that are
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.039
parts of the search business that are
duplicated efforts lots of different

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049
duplicated efforts lots of different
 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.699
duplicated efforts lots of different
smaller competitors are wasting a lot of

smaller competitors are wasting a lot of
 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.500
smaller competitors are wasting a lot of
money duplicating a lot of effort to

money duplicating a lot of effort to
 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.150
money duplicating a lot of effort to
doing some very basic infrastructure

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160
doing some very basic infrastructure

doing some very basic infrastructure
thing

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590
thing
 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.910
thing
that are really not necessary to do

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920
that are really not necessary to do
 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.130
that are really not necessary to do
multiple times I mean crawling the web

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140
multiple times I mean crawling the web
 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.820
multiple times I mean crawling the web
it's a big job but what it means is you

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830
it's a big job but what it means is you
 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.400
it's a big job but what it means is you
have to go and fetch you know lots and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410
have to go and fetch you know lots and
 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.840
have to go and fetch you know lots and
lots and lots of pages from all over the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850
lots and lots of pages from all over the
 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.379
lots and lots of pages from all over the
internet and it's it's a bit of a

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389
internet and it's it's a bit of a
 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.790
internet and it's it's a bit of a
commodity commodity item I mean anyone

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800
commodity commodity item I mean anyone
 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.310

can crawl the web it just takes a lot of

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320
can crawl the web it just takes a lot of
 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.710
can crawl the web it just takes a lot of
engineers and money and time and you

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720
engineers and money and time and you
 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.240
engineers and money and time and you
know the techniques for doing it are

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250
know the techniques for doing it are
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.180
know the techniques for doing it are
pretty robust and well known so what

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190
pretty robust and well known so what
 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.879
pretty robust and well known so what
we're all hoping to do is using the the

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889
we're all hoping to do is using the the
 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.469
we're all hoping to do is using the the
social model of free licensing which has

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479
social model of free licensing which has
 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.600
social model of free licensing which has
already allowed lots of different

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610
already allowed lots of different
 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.909
already allowed lots of different
companies to come together you know IBM

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919
companies to come together you know IBM
 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.460
companies to come together you know IBM
contributes a lot to free software Red

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
contributes a lot to free software Red
 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.960
contributes a lot to free software Red
Hat you know all these different

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
Hat you know all these different
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.400
Hat you know all these different
companies are working in this space and

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410
companies are working in this space and
 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.379
companies are working in this space and
they're able to do it because the the

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389
they're able to do it because the the
 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.570
they're able to do it because the the
free licensing model creates a level

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580
free licensing model creates a level
 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.070
free licensing model creates a level
playing field for that so we're hoping

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
playing field for that so we're hoping
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.840
playing field for that so we're hoping
to see the same kinds of things start to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850
to see the same kinds of things start to
 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.390
to see the same kinds of things start to
develop with with search data in other

want to do is is say well look if we
 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.820
want to do is is say well look if we
make all the source code open-source any

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830

and and really for let's provide some
 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:25.169
and and really for let's provide some
infrastructure for that so that's kind

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:25.179
infrastructure for that so that's kind
