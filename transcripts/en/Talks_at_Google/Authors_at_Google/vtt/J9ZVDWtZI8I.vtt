&gt;&gt;commentator: So, today we are excited to
welcome Jack Bowen to discuss his latest work,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.610
his third: "If You Can Read This: The Philosophy
of Bumper Stickers."

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.670
By way of introduction, Jack graduated from
Stanford University in 1995 with honors in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.750
human biology. While he was there he was also
an All-American water polo player. He went

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.160
on to earn his Master's Degree in philosophy
at Cal State. Currently, Jack teaches philosophy

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
and coaches water polo at Menlo School in
Atherton.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.809
His debut novel, "The Dream Weaver" made the
San Francisco Chronicle best seller list for

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.949
March 2006 and was one of Kepler Book Stores
top ten sellers for that year.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.239
His second work, "Journey Through the Landscape
of Philosophy" is a college philosophy textbook.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.429
And he's accom, accompanied both of these
by publishing in numerous philosophy journals

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.909
primarily in ethics.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.440
And finally, Jack is a senior lecturer with
the Great Books Program at Stanford University

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.750
in the summers.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.780
He's an avid musician, member of numerous
bands. He currently lives in Redwood City

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.820
with his wife and their dog Chewbacca and
two cats, Patches and Plato. [laughs]

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.240
So please join me in welcoming Jack Bowen.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
[applause]

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.170
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Well I am very excited to be
here at Google. First of all, I have a bumper

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.480
sticker, a new bumper sticker for my collection.
This doesn't happen very often for me.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.480
[laughter]

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.500
This is actually the final day; the book came
out almost exactly a month ago and I've been

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.210
doing basically about two events a day for
the last month throughout the country and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.840
today's the final day. I'm at Google today
and Santa Clara University tonight.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.700
And in my two and a half years of researching
I developed a, a, a document, sits right at

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.751
the top left corner of my computer that ended
up with about 2200 bumper sticker slogans

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:10.770
from which I distilled the, about 160 that
end up in the book.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.500
So rarely do I get bumper stickers that I
haven't seen. And I actually did see this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.230
on someone's computer along with the one to
which it responds and thought, "Wow, like

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.300
that's really cool and I kind of don't get
it," which is also really exciting -

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300
[laughter]

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
for me.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.670
And I didn't really want to admit this at
the beginning of this talk or I'm like the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.140
"bumper sticker guy" and "I'm the expert on
bumper sticker slogans". But I was gifted

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.280
this, this will find a special spot.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.590
So I'm also feeling a little bit overwhelmed
'cause I heard someone whispering, "NPR" yesterday

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.000
and I would this morning, which I shouldn't
have done, I should have saved it for tomorrow.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.720
I went through -- there were about 200 blog
posts regarding the talk with Michael Krasny

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.120
yesterday on, on Forum with a lot of new twists
to bumper stickers and so my head is like

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.020
buzzing in a very exciting, intellectual buzzing
sort of way.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.410
So I'm gonna just try to stay focused with
what I came here to do today, which is to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.569
sort of, what I'd like to do is share a few
of the insights that I garnered from, from

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.420
spending a few years writing about and discussing
the big ideas couched within bumper sticker

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.500
slogans and read a few excerpts and I know
many of you have the book - I believe you

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.819
get the book; this is a really cool place
to work.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.370
So I don't wanna stand here and just read
these bumper sticker entries and then absolutely

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.319
if we have any favorite or, what often is
the case, least favorite bumper sticker slogans

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.440
or questions, I understand we'll have a little
bit of time for that and I'll kind of stick

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.250
around afterwards if guys don't have work
that you have to be doing or if this is one

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.550
of those 20 percent of the time where you
don't have to do that thing where you focus

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.360
and you get to do whatever you want to do.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360
[laughter]

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360
Right?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
We know about that.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.300
And so on the heels of that and I wanna to
get started which I think will be an interesting

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.040
insight given where we are.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.910
When you are hoping to publish a book you
fill out, you do this sort of annoying process

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.280
of putting together a book proposal and it's
about this 20, it's a 20 page document or

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.010
so that basically says to, eventually to Random
House, "Here's the book that I envision; here's

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.410
why it will be popular." You're required to
put other books like yours which you always

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.989
wanna say, "There are none; mine's the on,
one of a kind." And you, you want to put the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.169
ideal demographic, the sort of target audience.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.391
Now my first answer, what I actually put on
the book proposal that I sent to Random House

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:34.160
which they ended up coming back and saying,
"We want this book. We wanna go big with it."

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.080
But I still get a hard time from Barbara,
my editor, is my target audience was everyone.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.430
[laughs]

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.882
And they said, "Jack, you know, you, your
book can't be targeted at everyone. That's,

00:04:44.882 --> 00:04:48.930
if it's targeted at everyone, it's targeted
at no one and we can talk about sort of Vickenstein's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.810
notions of Philip, The Philosophy of Language,
if we want to, but they said, "You can't,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.490
you can't say everyone. Your book, no one's
book is for everyone."

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.419
My hope was philosophy is this sort of universal
pursuit of big ideas and that the five-year-old,

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.639
the incessant, "why, why, why," can discuss
big ideas with his or her grandparents. And

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.500
I've actually had great, really fun, philosophical
discussions with five-year-olds and eighty-year

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
olds.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.750
So they did some back and say, "Okay, we kind
of now get why you, you chose everyone and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.699
we are spreading our target audience."

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.801
But when they forced me, they said, "You,
you need to come back and be a little bit

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.750
more specific," I said, "Googlers,"

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.750
[laughter]

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.139
was one of my, actually was the first sort
of target audience that I came back at. Sort

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.820
of people who in, in my mind are very interested
in [background noise - bad audio]

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.810
Stay focused; ignore; abstract.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.800
&gt;&gt;Background voice: Mute. Success.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.570
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: This is okay; I like this; are
we doing super special interaction - oh, their

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.510
microphones just started working.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.570
[laughter]

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.150
And the, the idea being that it, in my, in
the three books that I've written, the id,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.330
the hope for me as, as a writer, as an educator,
is to not only show people that philosophy

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.020
is doable because one of the things that I
encounter when people say, "Oh, what did you

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.181
study or what do you do?" And occasionally
just to throw people a little bit I say, "Well,

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.210
I'm a philosopher."

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.210
[pause]

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.210
[laughter]

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.210
They say, "What?"

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.210
[laughter]

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.590
"What did he, he's a, we should go. Like we're
gonna go get some punch." [ ] or the other

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.320
response is, they kind of cringe, like "uhhh,"
because their experience with college, their

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.860
one college philosophy class that they took
to fulfill a requirement probably tended to

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.230
be relatively boring and unnecessarily abstract.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.551
And I understand that's, it's a fair criticism
of sort of academic philosophy. And so what

00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:45.810
my hope has been is to bring philosophy into
the mainstream and to show people not only

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.020
that it's something that we can do, but it's
something that we're doing all the time anyway.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.930
When we're talking about politics or the Tea
Party or who should get health care, we're

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.530
doing philosophy. When we talk about our favorite
band and which band is better than who or

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.930
which sports team is better than which, we're
doing philosophy. When we're talking about

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.710
love and relationships, we're doing philosophy.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.360
And so this is what I've tried to do with
the three books; this one I think considerably

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.081
better than the other two. And there's something
that a, the introduction at Harvard University

00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:22.880
last week; it was a very thoughtful introduction;
it was about a five minute introduction and

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.470
he was sort of talking about big ideas and
sort of giving a talk of his own and in the

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.090
introduction he said, "What Mr. Bowen has
done here is he has taken all of the these

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.380
books" and we were actually in the philosophy
section which was also extremely distracting

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.870
for me; I had to give my talk like this; it's
like being in a candy store for a philosopher.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.720
And he said, "Mr. Bowen has taken all of these
works that nobody wants to read; no one wants

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.580
to sit down and read Aristotle and Derrida
and Wittgenstein and philosophy for most people

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.250
is akin to here's what he came up with: "copulating
with a cactus."

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.190
[laughter]

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.430
That was the imagery that he wanted to go
with on that evening at, at Harvard University.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:08.600
So we had some fun with that during the talk,
but I guess I have done that work for you

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.720
 -

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
and -

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
[laughter]

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.620
[laughs] and then ideally -

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.620
[phone ringing]

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:22.560
couched them in these slogans that serve as
the sort of catalyst for talking about these

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:30.270
ideas. So, this all kind of got started with
a bumper sticker that I used in, in a class

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.140
one day. We were discussing the -- this is
madness at Google.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.140
[laughter]

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.760
I was discussing, we were, we were doing a
segment on the death penalty and that morning

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.390
I was out and about getting my morning coffee
and pulled up behind a car that had sort of,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.630
it was excessively verbose, right? I will,
for, for spending your lunch time with me

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.760
I will give you this little tidbit. In a,
in a fit of procrastination if you can remember

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.490
back to writing papers or having projects
due and when these thing happen right your,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.190
your room becomes immaculately clean and you
write all your letters to your grandparents,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.230
etc. Well, when you have a book due, you also
find ways to procrastinate.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:16.550
So one afternoon I took the time to average
all 2200 bumper sticker slogans; the average

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.790
length of a bumper sticker is 8.1 words. So
there you go. There's your factoid for the

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.790
day.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:29.390
And, which reminds me of a bumper sticker
and this is, I, I saw this sticker on the

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.540
way home from my East Coast portion of the
tour; the last day of it.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.361
Part of my hope in researching was to make
sure this book had the best bumper stickers

00:09:37.361 --> 00:09:41.430
in it. There was a little part of it that
was for me that when I turn that final draft

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.690
into Random House and this book came out,
I didn't then see this amazing bumper sticker

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.350
that would have worked perfectly in my book.
So it was a little bit for, for my own, edification

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.250
and knowing that I wasn't going to encounter
this.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.540
So along the lines of this stat, this 8.1
words, by the way, nice job 7 words, I noticed.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.870
[laughter]

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.990
I saw a bumper sticker it would have fit very
nicely in with the introduction where I mention

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.541
the statistic and the bumper sticker is:

00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:09.220
[pause]

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.810
"If it doesn't fit on a bumper sticker - comma"
 -

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.120
[pause]

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.430
[laughter]

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:20.290
Good. Yes. It's amazing it would have fit
so nicely in the introduction, but. So I pulled

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:26.491
up behind this 14 word bumper sticker. It
was practically a novel and fortunately, it

00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:32.250
was at a red light and the bumper sticker
said: "Why do we kill people to show people

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.270
that killing people is wrong?"

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:38.860
It's a very popular argument against the death
penalty. It's somewhat flawed which I discussed

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:47.220
in the book. But I took that slogan and started
class. Basically class began; it was an afternoon

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.760
class that day and I walked up to the board
and just wrote the slogan on the board; we're

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.110
very concerned about plagiarism at the Menlo
School so I cited my source, "bumper sticker,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.390
Menlo Park, September 2nd".

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.730
And almost immediately the students had the
vision I have, students had sunk their intellectual

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:12.640
talons into it and were doing philosophy.
They were engaged in philosophical discourse.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.870
Now this is somewhat typically, it's a challenge
as a teacher especially afternoon course;

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.990
like, like Google we have great food at Menlo
so we had just finished a great meal, 45 minutes

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:30.250
of good solid flirting and now they're coming
to class to, to talk about philosophy.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.550
Now I've tried the other approach:

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.510
[pause]

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.880
"Welcome students, take your seats. Today,
get your pencils out I want you to write this

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.090
term down we're going to talk about Immanuel
Kant's notion of reciprocal retrividivism."

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.090
[laughter]

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.820
And they're etching it into their notebooks.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.530
[laughter]

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.850
But instead what happened is after about eight
to ten minutes of their vibrant discussions,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:58.190
I was sort of able to say, "Okay, the two-thirds
of you who are defending this are arguing

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.420
on behalf of Immanuel Kant's notion of this
thing that he called reciprocal retrividivism,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.630
where we ought to mete out punishments as
closely as possible to the crimes or actions

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.060
that were committed. And instead of the, the
wincing and the etching it, it was this sense

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.700
of "tell me more, tell me more".

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.950
The third of you who argued against this are
arguing along the lines of utilitarianism,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.200
that we ought to always strive to do the greatest
amount of good for the greatest number. And

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.490
instead of me sort, feeling like I was forcing
these ideas on students, they were asking

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.100
me for more; they were discussing these ideas
after class; they were sharing the bumper

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.560
sticker with friends. And I realized that
this is a really great catalyst for sort of

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.550
tearing down the, the fears or the, the concerns
of what doing philosophy is and getting people

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.550
engaged.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:52.010
So that weekend I did the unthinkable. Emily
Post who certainly I think gave many of our

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.709
parents their semblance of manners and then
were passed on to many of us, right always

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:02.420
says, "When you're at a dinner party no talking
about politics, purpose of life, religion,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:08.089
etc." You're, you're focusing on -- I don't
know -- sports teams, the, the golf and the,

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:15.410
the basketball and current events. Chris Martin
of Coldplay and Gwyneth Paltrow are considering

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:20.290
an open relationship, you know this. These
sorts of things. Thank goodness you don't

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.940
actually know that and I wish I didn't.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.940
[laughter]

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.740
But it tended to be a little more mundane
from my vantage point.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:35.700
Now as a philosopher if you show up to a dinner
party and say, "Hey, pass the green beans

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.920
and maybe do you guys wanna maybe try to solve
the purpose of life question?"

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.899
[pause]

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:46.700
That's actually usually the reaction that
you, one gets. My wife is nudging me like,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.440
"We wanna get invited back, don't do your
philosophy stuff here; do the Chris Martin

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.480
thing and we'll all have a good time."

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.111
So I brought in, well mentally brought in
a bumper sticker, and this is before I was

00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:05.120
known as "The Bumper Sticker Guy", before
this project has, had started. And so I sort

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.870
of threw out I said, "Hey, I saw this bumper
sticker the other week, let's see what was

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.490
it? 'What if the hokey pokey is what it's
all about?'"

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:21.300
Everyone had a good laugh and then someone
chimed in, "Well, but yeah, I mean isn't that

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.290
kind of what life is about? Like whatever
your version of shaking it all about is."

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.180
Right? And someone added on, "Well, yeah if
we're not pursuing happiness like what is

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.769
the purpose of life?" And then inevitably
someone countered, "But there's gotta be something

00:14:35.769 --> 00:14:41.380
sort, sort of more intrinsically meaningful
and purposeful to our lives than just shaking

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
it all about."

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.160
And so there we were really actually discussing
the purpose of life without me announcing

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.380
that we were doing this and Jessica and I
were nudging each other under the table and

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.529
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I get to write
this really fun book," and she's thinking,

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:57.170
"Oh my gosh, they're doing this thing you
wanted to do that usually annoys everyone

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.170
 -

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.170
[laughter]

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.170
and it's fun for everyone."

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:06.899
And the day after the book came out I spoke
at Oracle and there were, do we boo them or

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:11.060
how does this work here? No we're good. I,
I don't know how this stuff works.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.970
There were two gentlemen sitting in the sort
of the on the, on the aisle in the very back

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:21.430
row, faces down, not looking at me once, not
listening to a, an iota of all this wisdom

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:28.750
that I was giving out and the talk ended,
"Thank you" and he has the first hand.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.829
So this is a bad sign; you give a talk, they
don't listen to a thing you say, they've got

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:37.150
the first question right out of the gates.
So, "Yes sir, you in the back." "Well it's

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.839
not a question, it's a comment." That's the
second bad sign, he doesn't have a question,

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:41.839
he has something to say, [laughs]

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:42.839
[laughter]

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:46.579
and he wasn't listening in the first place.
A third bad sign. I say, "Yeah, what's the

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.440
comment?" "Well my, we're, we're on to you."

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440
[pause]

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.290
Umm; a tough start to the book tour.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.870
[laughter]

00:15:53.870 --> 00:16:00.070
"Yes, and what is it? What have you figured
out?" [laughs] He said, "Well, we've been

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:06.449
perusing your book and you're basically using
bumper stickers as the sugar on top to actually

00:16:06.449 --> 00:16:07.800
get us to read about philosophy."

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.950
[pause]

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:16.050
"Wow, that's the sugar on top analogy is really
apt. Oh, kind of wish I'd thought of that."

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.050
[laughter]

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.699
"That's exactly what I'm doing. Is that, have
I been saying something like" - and I thought,

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:26.880
"Well", my tail is starting to tuck between
my legs and I said, "Yeah, yes. Yes. That's

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.139
what I'm, that's what the book is about."
And he said, "Well it's great. We love it."

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:33.800
I said, "Oh yeah, this is a great book. I'm
very proud of that and that's exactly what's

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:43.339
going on here is that we're using bumper stickers
to get people engaged and to, to really feel

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:49.230
like they can discuss these philosophical
issues in a way that's relevant to us."

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.699
Because that's, I think, the real power and
beauty of these ideas is that they're not

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:59.130
merely these abstract notions given to us
by sort of the, the tall ivory towers of academia.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.020
That's certainly being done and there's a
lot of what's being written and discussed

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:08.739
in, in academics that is extremely almost
unnecessarily abstract, but the bulk of philosophical

00:17:08.739 --> 00:17:14.109
discourse is extremely relevant and accessible
and I've just, I'd come to find that these

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.329
bumper stickers, bless all of you, were a
great way to go about doing this.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:23.909
And so in this book proposal that I sent to
Random House it included ten entries [ ]; along

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:29.549
with the proposal you include a sample of
the writing. And when they wrote back and

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:35.200
said, "We wanna do this" they said "What we
don't want is the, the guy who wrote these

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.889
five entries." And if, if you've seen the
book there are about 160 bumper stickers and

00:17:39.889 --> 00:17:43.989
in a page and a half to two pages, I distill
sort of the deeper meaning behind them, and

00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:45.059
many cases lack thereof.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:49.899
And they said, "We don't want these five."
And I said, "What, what didn't you like about

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:54.979
those five?" "We, we felt like we were reading
a book by a philosophy professor," which is

00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:59.580
what my first two books kind of were. The
second book is blatantly a, a university textbook

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.749
which followed this novel that, that the characters
in the novel sort of living out these philosophical

00:18:05.749 --> 00:18:07.879
ideas, but it's heavily rooted in philosophy.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:12.899
And then the second book, it's an 800 page
philosophy textbook. Note to self, "don't

00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:19.269
write any more textbooks". I even have gotten,
I won't call it hate mail, but strong emails

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:24.131
on my book account after 'The Dream Weaver'
came out and it said, "What's wrong with you?

00:18:24.131 --> 00:18:25.250
This book sucks.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.250
[laughter]

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.799
Like are you depressed?" And I wrote back,
"It's a textbook, like why are you buying

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.279
a philosophy textbook?"

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:37.029
So I, I have to warn my publisher says, "Don't
fly around the world and tell people not to

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:40.799
buy your books." I'm telling you right now
the second, don't buy it, the second book.

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:44.220
I just, I don't wanna deal with the mail that
you're gonna be sending me.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220
[laughter]

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.570
So those two books were, were very serious
and this one much more playful that we're

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:57.509
inserting sort of pop culture and things that
are really in, in, in our daily lives into

00:18:57.509 --> 00:19:03.769
these and then, and then allowing us to spend
a paragraph or two paragraphs actually understanding

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.399
and being able to connect with these big ideas.

00:19:06.399 --> 00:19:11.999
So one of those that I'd like to share with
you, and if you have your reading is fun books

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.720
this is on page -

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.179
[sound of pages turning]

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:21.399
45.

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:26.450
There's an image, many of the bumper stickers
have images next to them, this has the image

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:36.190
of a, a, a baby bottle and one of the things
that, that I included in this sticker is an

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.330
idea from a philosopher from Peter Singer
who's a, one of the most well-known living

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.120
philosophers; somewhat controversial, but
he has this great image of being part of a

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.279
global village and he uses that to drive home
his sort of utilitarian calculus of morality.

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:57.570
And he doesn't use it to talk about this topic
per se, but he does weigh in on this topic

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.619
a little bit later.

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.190
So I found that this was a great example of,
and this is one of the original five. Random

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.799
House didn't like these five and they liked
these five. This is one of their original

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:11.940
five where they came away saying, "Hey, we've
heard of Peter Singer and his global village.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:17.009
We never really got it until now and by the
way we now react differently towards bottled

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:18.009
water."

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:22.330
So the bumper sticker is: "Bottled water is
for suckers."

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.809
[pause]

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:30.200
"Nowhere in history does the phrase 'selling
ice to Eskimos' apply more aptly than to the

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.679
bottled water fiasco, and not just because
the analog to ice in this case is its melted

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:41.900
counterpart. We Eskimos have been duped. 'There's
gold in them thar hills' came the cry in the

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.840
1980s. Blue gold. Wait you're going to put
dirtier, less palatable water in a bottle

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.289
and ship it around the world to sell?' pausing
between sips of tap water, 'to people that

00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:57.210
already get it for free?' 'Well if they're
willing to spend billions of dollars each

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.830
year on phone psychics, this will be even
easier. We'll even name our first bottling

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.190
'Naïve'. Or maybe we should spell it backward
just to slip it by the consumer; take the

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.490
weird little dots off the 'i'. Evian still
has a nice ring to it. We'll put a picture

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.799
of a mountain on it.'

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.799
[laughter]

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:17.919
If this week in America is like the week before
and the week before that, then we drank a

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:21.519
billion bottles of water and we'll drink another
billion next week.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:25.809
In a time of great financial struggle and
concern for our planet's survival this life

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:32.279
force must be cleaner and better tasting.
Right? Most blind taste tests actually show

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:37.259
the palatability of tap water. This should
be of no surprise as tap water is more highly

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:42.740
regulated. Even in our more high brow case
of wine tasting, expert oenophiles, fancy

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.739
name for wine snobs, are easily tricked into
thinking a white wine with red food coloring

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:53.019
is actually red wine, or that a bottle, or
that wine from a 90 dollar bottle tastes better

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:56.989
than the same wine in a bottle with 10 dollars
on it.

00:21:56.989 --> 00:22:02.489
Okay, so humans are gullible; they form pre-conceived
notions; what's the harm?

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:07.460
For you, the consumer, the only harms are
you're drinking a less regulated product at

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.330
greater cost. For you, the environment, the
only harms are the massive fuel and emissions

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.129
required to ship this heavy substance around
the world and all the bottles left to deal

00:22:16.129 --> 00:22:20.570
with. For you, one of the billion who don't
have access to safe drinking water, you're

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.919
probably not reading this book.

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:27.149
To further illustrate, Princeton University
ethicist, Peter Singer, uses the concept of

00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:33.309
a global village. He suggests that we have
a moral duty to all of the members of our

00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:38.909
village, even if we don't see them, and especially
if we can do so without sacrificing anything

00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:44.299
of comparable moral, comparable moral importance,
as in his clear cut example in which we should

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:48.470
muddy our pants if it saves the life of a
drowning child.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:54.169
A quick trip to Fiji provides a perfect application.
Due to the country's isolation and volcanic

00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:58.869
soil, much of their population cannot get
safe drinking water. The Fiji Company boasts

00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:03.429
of this on their Website. 'Fiji is far away,
but when it comes to drinking water remote

00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:05.539
happens to be very, very good.'

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:10.789
So they paint a hibiscus flower on every bottle
and ship it ten thousand miles to San Francisco

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:15.460
where someone sits in a bath of perfectly
safe drinking water straight from the springs

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.440
of Yosemite, sipping Fiji.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.849
Little does our bather know there is likely
more fecal matter in the bottle than in the

00:23:22.849 --> 00:23:28.889
tub. Fiji water has three times the colony
forming units for E. coli, the bacteria found

00:23:28.889 --> 00:23:32.429
in human feces, than the recommended maximum.

00:23:32.429 --> 00:23:37.070
As other bumper sticker wisdom reminds us,
'shit happens,' but who'd of thunk it happens

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.211
in our now strangely nutty tasting premium
bottled water?

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.480
[laughter]

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.399
So in light of the thousands in our global
village who die daily from diseases transmitted

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:53.460
through contaminated water, Singer suggests
we instead 'put that dollar in a jar, carry

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.799
a water bottle, send all the money to someone
who has real needs and you're no worse off.'

00:23:57.799 --> 00:24:02.919
It's funny in that not so funny way, that
we'll drive ten minutes out of our way to

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:07.479
buy 15 gallons of gas for 20 cents cheaper
per gallon and then walk in the gas mart and

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:11.070
plunk down 3 dollars for something we get
for free. Sucker."

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.320
[laughter]

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.919
So, there we have a, a very good example,
and none of these in any way follow templates

00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:23.100
or formulas. I mean that was sort of the fun
of writing the book. Sometimes the pop culture

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.139
sneaks in at the end; sometimes we don't have
direct quotes from philosophers; sometimes

00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:32.249
it's a little heavier on the philosophy with
some of the more serious topics. But the idea

00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:37.029
being that we have the, the bumper stickers
serving as the sugar on top; that the Oracle

00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:42.859
guy is so in my head. We have the sugar on
top; we have something in pop culture that

00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:48.840
we connect with; and then we get sort of one
or two of these big ideas from big thinkers

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.269
and can tie it all together.

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:53.389
So one of the other ones and I'll paraphrase
a few and then have one I'd like to finish

00:24:53.389 --> 00:25:00.159
with, that Random House liked is the bumper
sticker: "Size does matter" typically on a

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.759
Hummer.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:07.349
And what this allowed me to do, I went and
looked at the cup sizes from fast food chains

00:25:07.349 --> 00:25:14.100
and found that in almost exactly 10 years,
the large of 10 years ago, the exact same

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.719
size cup is now small, and they go up from
there. And some don't even offer small anymore,

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:23.479
they just start with medium or Starbucks has
that creepy tall that's like the smallest

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:29.549
is a tall. So we can sort of start to look
at this relativity of size. How can the same

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:33.249
size cup be both large and small?

00:25:33.249 --> 00:25:41.009
So then 7-11 comes along, gives us the Big
Gulp; 32 ounces of this carbonated elixir.

00:25:41.009 --> 00:25:48.169
Now the, the human stomach is on average 30
to 34 ounces. So the Big Gulp fills an empty

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:51.289
human stomach with soda.

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:56.629
Now about three years later they perform what
I and my philosophical mindset consider to

00:25:56.629 --> 00:26:04.399
be metaphysical magic; they turned the Big
Gulp without even touching it into just Gulp;

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:07.760
with the Super Gulp, 64 ounces.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.869
[laughter]

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:12.870
Now on the West Coast I realize we didn't
have this on the East Coast. The West Coast

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:20.840
I have to actually brace myself here a little
bit. Arco has given us a handle on each side,

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840
The Beast.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.940
[laughter]

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.669
Eighty-eight ounces; you can't drink it in
under 45 minutes or your body will expel -

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:28.669
[laughter]

00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:29.749
the liquid.

00:26:29.749 --> 00:26:34.529
So we have this inroad with everybody kind
of looking at the relativity of size, and

00:26:34.529 --> 00:26:39.080
I'm not sure if we saw three weeks ago in
the New York Times there was an article on

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.629
the, the Last Supper, the rendition of the
Last Supper and how it's been reproduced over

00:26:43.629 --> 00:26:48.940
the years. And as it's been reproduced over
the years, the food portions have grown 47

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.200
percent. They saw this is clearly isn't enough
bread to feed all these guys, so the food

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
has grown.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200
[laughter]

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.430
So we're sort of looking at the relativity
of size and we've got this bumper sticker

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.769
to frame it and talk about like size does
matter, but the question is in what way does

00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:07.970
it matter? And it now allows us this inroads
to this fascinating discussion that was going

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.320
on between Philosopher Gott, Gottfried Leibniz
and Sir Isaac Newton.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.749
Now Leibniz was actually arguing on behalf
of what we've seen here; the relativity of

00:27:17.749 --> 00:27:21.909
size. That it's not so much the intrinsic
size of the object, but the, the size of things

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:25.850
relative to it and he gives a couple of really
engaging thought experiments to drive that

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.850
home.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.769
Newton, on the other hand, was arguing that
sort of the more intuitive position that the,

00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:35.519
the intrinsic size of the object is what matters
regardless of what's next to it or over time.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:43.759
And then along comes Einstein relativity theory
and as Barbara said at Random House, "I finally

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:46.999
understood relativity theory. I didn't get
it from1 Stephen Hawking's book," (which I

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:51.009
think is actually very eloquent) "but I got
it from this, because you were able to sort

00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:54.859
of frame it in this way that's made more relevant
to us."

00:27:54.859 --> 00:28:01.609
So again that's, that's sort of the, the overall
approach to how I went about writing, writing

00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:06.580
the book, is that I'm basically, I'm, I'm
trying to share the excitement that I had

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:12.450
initially when I left; really nice introduction
mentioned that I was a human biology major

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.619
and headed to med school. I was actually about
a month away from med school. I'd gotten in

00:28:16.619 --> 00:28:23.419
and found this philosophy book. It's blue
and white bound actually written by the philosopher,

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:28.330
philosophy professor at Stanford who does
NPR's philosophy talk and then sort of serendipitously

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:33.519
all comes back full circle and blurbed this
book. Sort of it's all his fault in, in the

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:35.619
good way that I'm here today.

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:42.469
And it steered me away and I called my parents
and I said, "Hey, thanks for that great education.

00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:46.440
By the way, I'm going to get a degree in philosophy
instead." Like, "we'll be in touch."

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440
[laughter]

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.129
And, and I was trying to share all of these
ideas with family and friends and their responses

00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:56.029
were typically, "I don't understand what you're
saying," or "I don't really see how that's

00:28:56.029 --> 00:29:00.909
relevant in my life." And it was the exact
opposite experience that I was having. And

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:05.719
I found that 12 years later, two books later,
umpteen number of courses and classes later,

00:29:05.719 --> 00:29:10.590
this is by far the best way that I could figure
out how to get these ideas out and get people

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.929
engaged in talking.

00:29:11.929 --> 00:29:17.499
And one of the best reviews that I've gotten
was actually at a book club two nights ago

00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:23.070
who read this book and one of the women there
said, "My son and I have been reading this

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.789
book and just the other day we were driving
around and he saw a bumper sticker and" (she

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:30.230
says this has happened a lot; the one that
she referenced was "Jesus is coming, look

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.230
busy."

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.230
[laughter]

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.950
But what he did is he said, "Hey, Mom look
at that bumper sticker. Now what is the difference

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.100
between sort of Christianity and Judaism?"
And they had this discussion about like what

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.460
they should be doing with their lives; they
weren't very religious; since they were sort

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.919
of talking about these ideas through the bumper
sticker, and she said it was the best discussion

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:55.359
she's ever had with her son because they were
open to this notion that these bumper sticker

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:57.960
slogans had something real behind them.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.729
And I mean that's exactly what I wanted to
hear. A bumper sticker and eight words doesn't

00:30:03.729 --> 00:30:09.279
capture the depths of these big ideas. Charles
Schultz, the creator of the Peanuts cartoon

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:13.679
once said, you might have seen it on the music
video, "There's a difference between a philosophy

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:18.469
and a bumper sticker." Absolutely; let's hope
so. I mean I think the problem and why many

00:30:18.469 --> 00:30:23.950
of these bumper sticker slogans seem so antagonistic
is that they're, they're monologues. When

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.509
someone yells, basically yells at you from
their bumper and then drives away and you

00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:30.559
don't get to have that discourse.

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:36.080
And so what I, what I did was had that discourse
for two pages, and then what I love to hear

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.409
from readers is and then we had discourse
for another hour over a cup of coffee or beer

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:45.580
or whatnot; that it's used as sort of that
springboard.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:52.389
So to get to the, the final reading, one of
the questions that comes up a lot so I'm just

00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:58.809
going to nip it in the bud is my favorite
bumper sticker. And I typically come up with

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:03.259
two. It's a little bit like choosing my favorite
child at this point, but I can typically get

00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:04.259
to about two.

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:08.879
One slightly more serious: "If ignorance is
bliss, then why aren't more people happy?"

00:31:08.879 --> 00:31:13.710
And it's a little bit of my motivation in
studying philosophy and I think it goes all

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.820
the way back to Plato, is this idea that Plato
gives us this, this notion of the cave and

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.820
we're all born into this false reality, and
we should be motivated to come out of the

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.499
cave even though were experiencing this sort
of blinding, painful light and this frightening

00:31:28.499 --> 00:31:31.799
new world in three dimensions, because it's
reality.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:36.490
And you can think of "The Matrix", "Truman
Show" where Truman's born into a movie set

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.259
and everything's set up perfectly for him.
This is played by Jim Carrey, but we're all

00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:46.190
sitting here on the outside thinking, "Gosh
even though his world is perfect it's, it's

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:51.349
fake, it's a movie set. He should be out here
with us even though it's not as perfect and

00:31:51.349 --> 00:31:54.979
shiny, dealing with all the stuff we're doing
because it's couched in reality."

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:59.139
So that's the one I think that I'm drawn to
philosophically speaking.

00:31:59.139 --> 00:32:04.739
And the other where I wanted to finish and
like I said I'd love to take questions or

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:11.539
comments or favorite, least favorite bumper
stickers from you guys, is one, and the story

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:15.999
how I acquired it I think is kind of funny
or endearing.

00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:20.919
Jessica had left for the day and I was at
home solving the meaning of life, which actually

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:26.180
is solved in this book, along with the chicken
and the egg question, which I know people

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.940
are really concerned about. The answer to
that is chicken; and again you can read the

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.320
book to find out why, but it's solved.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.769
The answer to the, what is the meaning of
life is it's just a bogus question. Like what

00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:42.559
is the meaning of x isn't a real question
at all. That's why it's unsolvable. And it

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:46.200
just distills into what is the purpose of
x and you're the owner of x because it's your

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.789
life and you get to decide it. It's kind of
empowering/scary depending on how you look

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:52.883
at it. But anyway we expand on that a little
bit. I just gave away the answer.

00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:53.883
[laughter]

00:32:53.883 --> 00:32:54.883
Umm.

00:32:54.883 --> 00:32:57.529
But you should still read it, there's some
other -

00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:58.529
[laughter]

00:32:58.529 --> 00:32:59.529
things that it says.

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:05.700
And so there I was working on the meaning
of life and I get a text from Jessica, my

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.720
wife: "Reading is sexy."

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720
[pause]

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.470
Umm, yeah, yeah, I'm reading three books right
now, (sound of kissing). "No, no, it's a bumper

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:21.269
sticker." So I push everything aside; I search
online and find the bumper sticker; there's

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:25.669
actually T-shirts so I buy his and her T-shirts.
We now have "Reading is sexy" T-shirts.

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:26.669
[laughter]

00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:34.880
And defend, this is one of the somewhat lighter
bumper stickers in the book. The bumper sticker

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.760
has the, the retro reading glasses next to
it and is, the text is, "Reading is sexy."

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.479
[pause]

00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:48.000
"This bumper sticker was dem, really preaches
to the converted with this self-selecting

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.419
demographic.

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:53.869
While sexy clearly involves some apples to
oranges style value judgments; for you may

00:33:53.869 --> 00:33:58.950
disagree as to whether Justin Timberlake is
bringing sexy back; it's worth seeking a foundation

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.379
for sexiness.

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:05.369
Of course one must consider the content of
the reading. Reading up on how to eat road

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:11.379
kill - not sexy; reading about the deeper
meaning behind bumper stickers and thus an

00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:16.980
intrinsic connection with one's self and their
intimate bond to those around them - sexy.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.639
Ironically reading about gametes and the fertilization
process and development of chromosomes through

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:27.490
sexual reproduction; not that sexy, but reading
about the locked eyes of two impassioned lovers

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:33.200
and gentle embrace on a cool summer evening
leading up to all of the gamete stuff; sexy.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.960
Surveying the dictionary definitions of "sexy"
and their relation to the act of reading will

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.569
help to further our investigation.

00:34:41.569 --> 00:34:46.730
Definition one: tending to arouse sexual desire
or interest.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.829
Freud suggests that much of our sexuality
hibernates in our subconscious. The more we

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:56.710
come to know ourselves and bring to the surface
what our superego suppresses, the more we

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:00.779
avoid our ego's defense mechanisms and tap
into our libido.

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:06.299
Reading plays an instrumental role in such
deep introspection. That's pretty sexy.

00:35:06.299 --> 00:35:11.480
Definition two: Slang; highly appealing; interesting.
You're the one choosing the books for the

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.230
likely reason exactly stated in this definition.
Sexy is charged.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:21.220
Definition three: Provoking. Given that you're
reading someone else's book with ideas not

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:27.069
your own, reading is by definition provoking.
And if you're reading your own book, aside

00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:32.059
from copy editing, get over yourself and go
get sexy.

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:37.450
Definition four: Naughty. Isn't it just a
little naughty getting into the mind of someone

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:42.980
else who's sharing their fantasies, stories,
thoughts and discoveries? Readers can be such

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.140
naughty voyeurs.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.940
And definition five: Lively. Reading actually
burns calories, especially if you read books

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.740
that make you laugh, cry, or pound your fist.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:59.120
In contrast to the, to the non-lively, un-sexy,
couch potato, readers can avoid couches and

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.700
read under trees, in cafes sipping tea, or
nuzzled up in bed with a lover.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.769
Additionally, maintaining an active brain
has been proven to ward off Alzheimer's disease.

00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:13.029
In the use it or lose it mentality of a muscle,
reading is like a lively little weight room

00:36:13.029 --> 00:36:16.430
for the brain; how lively; how sexy.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.549
So keep reading; you're only getting sexier
by the page."

00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:21.549
Thank you.

00:36:21.549 --> 00:36:22.549
[applause]

00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:31.359
&gt;&gt;commentator: Once again I'd like to thank
Jack for stopping by. I apologize for some

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:32.359
of those technical difficulties -

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:33.359
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: No, that's fine.

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:34.359
&gt;&gt;commentator: earlier.

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:35.359
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Mix it up.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.359
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah, just make it a little
challenging.

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:38.780
So if you have any questions, we've got the
room for another 15 minutes or so, maybe a

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:44.299
little less and please use the mic for our
viewers on YouTube. And that's it. I believe

00:36:44.299 --> 00:36:47.900
he's gonna stick around for a few more minutes
in the lobby if you'd like to, to talk to

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.900
him personally.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.020
So to start if off, I'll ask a question that
I had in my mind which is to say, bumper stickers

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.349
are nice for a car conversation and you can
kind of inorganically work them into general

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:02.690
like bar conversation, but they're not always
as convenient as you want to get that, to

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:07.029
get that ball rolling on a philosophical topic
without saying, "So what do you think the

00:37:07.029 --> 00:37:08.200
meaning of life is to you?"

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.810
Have you come you up with any other kind of
either tricks or, or, or thoughts about how

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:18.721
you can introduce a philosophical topic organically
without feeling like you're pressuring people

00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:19.721
to talk about it?

00:37:19.721 --> 00:37:22.420
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Right. I actually did. I gave,
right before the, the book came out I gave

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:29.519
a talk at a teaching conference in Los Angeles
and the whole approach was how can we get

00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:32.980
students, I mean I think they don't have to
be high school students, this was the group

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:38.339
to whom I was speaking. How can we get students
engaged in caring about discussing philosophical

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:39.339
ideas?

00:37:39.339 --> 00:37:45.109
Now in that terrible, awful, boring textbook,
I did spruce it up as much as I could while

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:49.460
maintaining the rigor of a college textbook,
and then at the end of every chapter I include

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.900
movie titles that relate to themes. So like
in the reality chapter: "Matrix", "The Truman

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:59.490
Show", etc, there are a myriad ethical movies
to talk about the death penalty or cloning

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:05.020
or abortion, euthanasia. So that's one way
is to watch this movie and it's another way

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.140
to, what we want people to do is to become
in sort of emotionally invested in the topic

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.269
which bumper stickers do a decent job of because
of the rhetoric that's built into them.

00:38:14.269 --> 00:38:17.510
Certainly a, a good film can do this where
you connect with the character and the issue

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.339
and you, you can sort of live out the drama
of the idea.

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:26.700
There are a lot of songs. I also, the textbook
has lists of popular songs, whether it's rap

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.470
songs, '70s songs, current rock songs, that
deal with these ideas topic by topic.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:38.170
Students love to come in, I have them either
pick a song off of the list or bring a song

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:44.060
in of their own and, and we crank it up and
we're sitting in class listening to Tupac

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.529
or Jay-Z and then we're, we've got the lyrics
on the board and then all of a sudden we're

00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:50.269
discussing the ideas behind it.

00:38:50.269 --> 00:38:55.370
So I mean those are two of the ways amongst,
I mean there, there are I guess those are

00:38:55.370 --> 00:39:00.769
the two most popular ways is finding something
in, benefits students' lives.

00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:07.569
Sports I find are a great way to convey, to
get ethical conversations started. I, we talk

00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:11.760
about ethics all the time on my team because
you can say, "Well what if in soccer you've

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.630
got this player who's acting like he's tripped
but he wasn't? Is that moral?" And some of

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.490
them want to say, "Well of course its fine.
He's actually earning a foul, that's a way

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:24.470
of like earning a free kick that makes your
team have greater success." And then someone

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.630
says, "But he's, he's not earning, he's lying.
He's lying to the referee."

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:32.589
You have this discussion of sort of what you
owe competitors, what you owe the people who

00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:38.460
are overseeing the competition. I mean it's
a really rich topic to, to discuss these,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.750
these issues in a, in a, in a realm that people
already can kind of own what's going on. So

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:48.609
that's an, that's, if they're athletically
inclined at all, that's my favorite sort of

00:39:48.609 --> 00:39:49.609
go to.

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.230
Yeah, thanks for that.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.230
[pause]

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.329
&gt;&gt;commentator: Questions?

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.329
[pause]

00:39:54.329 --> 00:40:02.050
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'm just curious if
you have any bumper stickers on your car?

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.430
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Yes, you are.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.829
[laughter]

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:09.980
Well, so the answer is no, but, and that's
also a very popular question, I think people

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.299
are like, "Ooh, I'm gonna get him 'cause I'm
gonna make him explain his bumper sticker."

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:17.470
I always answered, "No, I don't and I never
have."

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.779
And then when I was in Chicago, it was actually
the first night of the non-California tour

00:40:20.779 --> 00:40:24.630
about two weeks ago, I went out with cool
Uncle Dave, my Mom's brother; who's actually

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.569
cool. I don't say it like that 'cause he's
like not cool. He's really cool.

00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:32.880
And we went out for beers after the event
and he said, we were talking about Judy, his

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.119
sister, my mother, and I remember I said,
"Oh my gosh, I've been always answering this

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:41.551
question, 'no I don't and never have,' as
if I'm somehow above bumper stickers. It would

00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:44.440
be a terrible thing." And he said, "Oh no,
that's not true."

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:51.010
My junior year at Stanford when I was home
on a break my parents gave me the keys to

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:56.109
the 1980 Volvo. I'm making the, this is what
the Volvo looked like in 19, it's a big box.

00:40:56.109 --> 00:41:01.059
And they gave me the keys and as I was getting
ready to drive back up the coast to school

00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:10.080
my mom came out, slapped a Christian fish
on the car; the two half circles and said,

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.541
"This will help you meet a nice, young woman."

00:41:12.541 --> 00:41:14.859
[laughter]

00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:19.450
So, and I do, in, in the book I spend two
pages not just looking at the Christian fish

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.470
symbol and sort of the history behind it,
but all of the responses to it where you can

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.529
put your respective God's name in, in the
middle to say, "This is who I think created

00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:31.310
everything" or "Darwin and evolution" and
now there are feet on it and carrying wrenches

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.380
and actually dinosaurs eating the fish; there's
the Darwin fish having sex with the Christian

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.380
fish -

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.380
[laughter]

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.079
People have put "gefilte" and "and chips"
in the middle to show how wacky and zany they

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.079
are.

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:44.079
[laughter]

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:47.769
But it never happened that I was driving up
the coast and like, "Beep, beep"

00:41:47.769 --> 00:41:48.950
&gt;&gt;male voice: [unintelligible]

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.519
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: "Me too.

00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:51.519
[laughter]

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:57.880
Did you see my fish? Pull over, pull over."
I kind of think like this, this never happened

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.079
and thankfully so 'cause I ended up with this
nice young woman that they were hoping for

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.079
anyway.

00:42:03.079 --> 00:42:04.460
So that's the long winded answer.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.460
[laughter]

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.460
I don't, but I did.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.460
[laughter]

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.460
[pause]

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.580
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Thank you very much for
coming.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.580
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Yeah, that.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.330
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I just wanted to ask are
you ever concerned I guess in the classroom

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.910
setting that some of these tangible items,
whether they be bumper stickers or the scenario

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:29.789
with the soccer player, that they ever kind
of distort some of the greater arguments that

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:32.180
our great thinkers have proposed?

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.010
For instance, your students saying, "Well,
Tupac has it instead of Aristotle."

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.589
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen. Right. This is a great question.
My answer is no. Yeah and I'll, and I'll,

00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:42.589
I'll frame why.

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:46.930
I think we were discussing early on while
I was at Princeton there was a student who

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:53.140
was sitting right in this area, it's just
my mental image of him and he sat there -

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.140
[pause]

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.670
like this the whole time. So here I am we
had this great, great event and all the time

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:03.740
I'm just trying to see if I can just get him
to crack a smile or nod his head, so ends,

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.200
first question, "Yes." And he said, "Well
I came here as a skeptic."

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200
[pause]

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.250
And I'm like, "Really. You're skeptical of
The Bumper Sticker Guy? Like I'm not here

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:17.589
to talk about like you know global warming
is a farce, like, it's like okay and then

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:21.599
he went through and read all of the books
that he's read, etc, etc, and, and he said

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:26.589
sort of rhetorically, "Basically I can't tell
if you're a comedian or a philosopher." And

00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:30.570
this was meant as a criticism. And I said,
"Well, first of all you actually just paid

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.029
me a really good compliment. Like do you wanna
do all," and I didn't have this image yet

00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:37.619
because Harvard happened after Princeton.
"If you wanna do all of the copulating with

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:41.710
cactus stuff, there are thousands of those
books and they're great and I've, I've read

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.869
a lot of them. That's not what this book is."

00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:49.730
And I surmised at that time that I would,
I would love to know, I surmised that probably

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:56.569
half of the philosophy professors on Princeton's
campus would say, "Rubbish. He's watering

00:43:56.569 --> 00:44:01.789
it down. He spent not even a full paragraph
on Peter Singer's global village and Peter

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:06.099
Singer's global village runs much deeper than
that in, in some instances."

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:10.599
And my guess is that half of 'em would take
what's more my stance, it was actually one

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:14.339
of the first interviews I did was at University
of San Francisco. I had a professor who said,

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:17.740
"I'm actually using this book in my class
next semester." I said, "Have you read the

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.170
whole book? Like do you know what this is?"
He's like, "I've read the whole book and it's

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:26.099
great. I'm gonna use this textbook and this
book, we're gonna read the euthanasia entry

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:30.930
here and then we're going to read what the
philosophers have to say about euthanasia."

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:37.151
And my, my take would be for a Philosophy
One class or the university setting, Philosophy

00:44:37.151 --> 00:44:42.869
101. This should be fun; it should be engaging;
you should be able to go to a cocktail party

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:47.559
and speak for 30 seconds about what "I think
therefore I am" means and its relevance; Plato's

00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:50.049
cave; Singer's global village.

00:44:50.049 --> 00:44:55.549
And after that if you find these ideas alluring
and important, then you take Philosophy 2

00:44:55.549 --> 00:45:02.369
or 201 and you sit down and read Aristotle's
Nicomachean Ethics because you get why it's

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:06.039
important; you're engaged; you already see
that the ideas are relevant in your life and

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:10.950
you now want to work through, and it's a beautiful
text, but it's not that beautiful if you just

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.640
sit down and pull it off a shelf and say,
"It doesn't start out 'it was a dark and stormy

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.759
night.'" We got some tough text to get through.

00:45:16.759 --> 00:45:22.039
So I think, I hope I've answered your question.
I think some professional philosophers would

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:27.930
say, "This is, this is bad news; it's watering
it down." I think some would celebrate the,

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.869
the, the, the invitation to do philosophy
and that's much more where I lie.

00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:33.869
Yeah. Thanks for that.

00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:34.869
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Thank you. I agree.

00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:35.869
[pause]

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:41.299
&gt;&gt;commentator: So just a couple minutes left;
any last questions from the audience?

00:45:41.299 --> 00:45:42.299
[pause]

00:45:42.299 --> 00:45:43.299
No.

00:45:43.299 --> 00:45:45.859
So you actually had mentioned you didn't understand
the bumper sticker we gave you.

00:45:45.859 --> 00:45:51.009
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: I kind of do now. It's been
explained. Because there was a response to

00:45:51.009 --> 00:45:53.130
"My other computer is a laptop"?

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.289
&gt;&gt;commentator: My other computer is a data
center which refers to keeping your information

00:45:57.289 --> 00:46:01.079
that you normally keep on your computer in
the cloud and the authors teams' response

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:06.319
to that was, "Well, my other data center is
a book," discussed. [laughs]

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:07.569
[laughter]

00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:12.180
No, it, it, I just wanted to, to make sure
that we had at least properly explained what

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.180
was going on. I'm -

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:18.000
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: It was in my feeble computer
brain mind, I was able to connect the dots

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.799
and, and it's awesome; this is going right
to the top of my list.

00:46:20.799 --> 00:46:25.099
&gt;&gt;commentator: Wonderful. Well, we look forward
to that in Volume 2 and once again, Jack Bowen,

00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:26.099
everyone, round of applause.

00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:27.099
[applause]

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:28.099
&gt;&gt;Jack Bowen: Thanks for having me. Thank
you.

00:46:28.099 --> 00:46:28.100
[applause]
