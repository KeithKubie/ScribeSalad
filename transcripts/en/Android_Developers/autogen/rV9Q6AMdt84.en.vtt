00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:01.329 align:start position:0%
so we day one day three retention was

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
retention was too strong and and we just
 

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.630 align:start position:0%
retention was too strong and and we just

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:09.640 align:start position:0%

right over the next year and and that
that<00:17:19.150><c> number</c><00:17:19.419><c> can</c><00:17:19.540><c> be</c><00:17:19.689><c> high</c><00:17:19.900><c> because</c><00:17:20.530><c> the</c>

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:20.860 align:start position:0%
that number can be high because the
 

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.350 align:start position:0%
that number can be high because the

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:24.069 align:start position:0%
number can be high because everybody
 

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:25.689 align:start position:0%
plays for the first few weeks and then
 

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.409 align:start position:0%
plays for the first few weeks and then
drops<00:17:25.929><c> off</c><00:17:26.110><c> and</c><00:17:26.520><c> there</c><00:17:27.520><c> something</c><00:17:28.240><c> in</c><00:17:28.360><c> the</c>

00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:28.419 align:start position:0%
drops off and there something in the
 

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%

forty<00:17:31.240><c> is</c><00:17:31.360><c> good</c><00:17:31.570><c> right</c><00:17:32.230><c> so</c><00:17:32.470><c> you</c><00:17:32.530><c> have</c><00:17:32.710><c> 100</c>

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.070 align:start position:0%
forty is good right so you have 100
 

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
forty is good right so you have 100
installs<00:17:33.490><c> and</c>

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
installs and
 

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.490 align:start position:0%

then<00:17:34.520><c> on</c><00:17:34.640><c> average</c><00:17:34.820><c> they</c><00:17:35.240><c> play</c><00:17:35.450><c> 30</c><00:17:35.810><c> or</c><00:17:36.020><c> 40</c><00:17:36.320><c> days</c>

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:36.500 align:start position:0%
then on average they play 30 or 40 days
 

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.780 align:start position:0%

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:37.790 align:start position:0%
during the year but obviously
 

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.610 align:start position:0%
during the year but obviously
monetization<00:17:38.240><c> is</c><00:17:38.450><c> also</c><00:17:38.690><c> important</c><00:17:39.110><c> 30</c><00:17:39.230><c> to</c><00:17:39.380><c> 40</c>

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.620 align:start position:0%
monetization is also important 30 to 40

cutting<00:17:53.690><c> it</c><00:17:53.810><c> so</c><00:17:54.370><c> yeah</c><00:17:55.370><c> that's</c><00:17:55.580><c> the</c><00:17:55.760><c> way</c><00:17:55.880><c> we</c>

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.060 align:start position:0%
cutting it so yeah that's the way we

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.100 align:start position:0%
look at it now because we think numbers
 

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.860 align:start position:0%
look at it now because we think numbers
like<00:17:58.280><c> a</c><00:17:58.430><c> day</c><00:17:58.610><c> 30</c><00:17:58.820><c> retention</c><00:17:59.480><c> needs</c><00:17:59.630><c> to</c><00:17:59.750><c> be</c>

00:17:59.860 --> 00:17:59.870 align:start position:0%
like a day 30 retention needs to be
 

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.780 align:start position:0%
like a day 30 retention needs to be
about<00:18:00.050><c> 15</c><00:18:00.470><c> percent</c><00:18:00.620><c> or</c><00:18:01.040><c> they</c><00:18:01.130><c> 30</c><00:18:01.370><c> rate</c><00:18:01.580><c> and</c><00:18:01.730><c> she</c>

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:01.790 align:start position:0%
about 15 percent or they 30 rate and she
 

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
about 15 percent or they 30 rate and she
needs<00:18:01.940><c> to</c><00:18:02.060><c> be</c><00:18:02.150><c> 20</c><00:18:02.420><c> percent</c><00:18:02.540><c> that</c><00:18:03.410><c> that's</c>

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:03.650 align:start position:0%
needs to be 20 percent that that's
 

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be 20 percent that that's
that's<00:18:04.270><c> it's</c><00:18:05.270><c> just</c><00:18:05.390><c> a</c><00:18:05.570><c> number</c><00:18:06.080><c> it's</c><00:18:06.290><c> just</c><00:18:06.440><c> one</c>

we might as well talk about it so what

we might as well talk about it so what

why we did that is just to really get a

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:26.970 align:start position:0%
it's a good question so we think that

it's a good question so we think that

the definition for soft launch should be
