00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
You know what I love?  Being productive.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.920
Being productive isn't hard.  It just takes a little thought.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160
So first off, if you don't have a Life Map for 2016, make that right now.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.580
This is your big picture.  It's your goals, it's your dreams, and everything you hope to accomplish in the new year.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.740
Next, you're going to break down each of those things into executable actions.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.600
I do this with all of my big productions.  It's where you list each step

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.640
that needs to be taken in order to accomplish your goal.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.700
Now, taking these steps is not going to be that hard.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.160
But focusing on taking these steps probably will be.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.600
This is when you have to learn how to work smart instead of hard.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.680
And distribute your energy and efforts to the tasks that are going to bring you the most reward.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.640
For example, I used to riddle my To-Do List with meaningless tasks

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.640
like clean the cat litter, or do laundry.  Simply because I was addicted to the feeling of accomplishment that I got

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.080
when I crossed it off.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.960
Oh.  That feels good.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.040
(excited shudder)

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.700
Plus, even if I didn't do the most important things I had to do that day

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.340
I still felt good seeing that I did something.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.580
But if you only write down imperative tasks--the ones that would create some real progress in your work

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.200
you'll notice exactly how much you're getting done.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.240
Or not.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.500
Some people also find writing a To-Not-Do List helpful.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.360
This helps remind them that they don't want to succumb to time-wasting tasks

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.940
like refreshing social media or watching TV

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.460
at least when it's not scheduled break time.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.080
The best thing you can do for long-term productivity is to create a Daily Ritual

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.580
That way you're productive on auto-pilot.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.400
Next, learn how to say no.  This is something that I still personally struggle with.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.540
You know, I want to do everything.  I want to take every opportunity--you never know what's going to lead to what!

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.020
But remember the Life Map.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.220
Keep your eye on the prize.  If you say yes to a bunch of projects that don't give you great results

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.620
that's wasted time.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.380
Stop multi-tasking!

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.000
Multi-tasking is just a fancy word for being bad at everything you're doing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800
Don't neglect execise and healthy eating.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.380
That's your energy.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.860
Kill distractions!

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.820
If you really need to write, I recommend going out of the house and turning off your Wifi.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.860
And there are plenty of programs online that you can install that will block social media sites

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.340
for certain hours of the day.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.720
Now this is all stuff we know, right?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.400
Spend less time on the internet, get more done--this isn't new.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.360
But sometimes it's good to hear.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.600
It's good to have that reminder of all the things we know we should be doing.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.320
I mean you probably clicked on this video because you wanted to sort of feel like you were kinda doing something.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.000
Right?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.680
Wrong.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620
So get off Youtube, and get to work.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.280
Thank you for waiting.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.800
And thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's episode.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.480

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.600

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.440
across all types of literature.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.920
I like listening to audiobooks when I'm commuting to the hospital or washing my lab coat at the end of the day.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.360
Currently, I'm listening to "Getting Things Done" by David Allen

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.580
because I want to increase my productivity on diagnosing patients like yourself

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.920
while simultaneously juggling my ground breaking cancer research

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.280
Right now Audible is offering a free 30 day trial

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.580

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.260

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.440
That's Audible.com/Anna

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.800
Just what the doctor ordered.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.020
(chuckling)
