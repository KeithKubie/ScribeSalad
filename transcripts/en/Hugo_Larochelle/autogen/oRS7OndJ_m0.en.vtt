00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 in this capture we will see some 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.470
 some rustic to improve 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.660
 the bac tracking algorithm such that the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.700
 influenza crafting search without any 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.269
 rustic little still allow to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 solve for example the problem of 25 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.160
 May 25th to nothing more than it starts to be 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.320
 a little limited ie the grid 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 to take a little time a people too 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 long to be able to solve this 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.680
 problem in a reasonable time 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 what we need to improve 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.710
 the execution of algorithms makes it okay 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 to be general heuristics that go 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.219
 apply for any problem 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 as long as we have crises 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.960
 of a poem of satisfaction of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 constraints 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.930
 it will allow us to have some 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 substantial improvements to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.550
 the execution of the jaws we can 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 categorize locklerie stickler in three 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.489
 categories the first category this is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.039
 in choosing the next variable 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 for which we will try to sign a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.579
 certain value so that's the method 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.480
 in the worst codes that we have shown 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.570
 previously 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.580
 it is the method verne one assigns so 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 we will see two jurists iq including two 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.549
 definitions for this method there which 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 will allow to obtain better 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.240
 results 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.310
 then from one to another type of 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 ristic is the choice of the next 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 value signed for the chosen variable 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.650
 so this is the ordered value method 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.470
 so this is the method that orders the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.759
 field of smallpox that one chooses 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 before starting interest on these 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.900
 values ​​then to do to test 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.400
 different assignment smallpox and one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.350
 going to see a logistics so a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 definition of this method there for 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 speed up the execution of bakker king 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.270
 sturge and finally they algorithms 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.970
 of inference that go first 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.369
 detect whether we have introduced a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.130
 assignment that is conflictual it's 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 to say that they will necessarily who does not 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 will not allow which one is sure that one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 will not arrive at a subpoena 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.390
 complete is compatible if we do this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.460
 assignment the man and in the case 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.140
 otherwise if that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.720
 will not lead a conflict that will him 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.610
 to reduce the areas of 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.410
 other variables to possibly have 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.540
 to consider but less value for 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.569
 its the other variables of the problem and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 so this is the inferences method in the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.470
 bios of code we've seen and we'll see 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 a first technique of inference a 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.010
 first definition of this method 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:30.239
 in this capsule so just a little 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.400
 reminder in the office kde we saw on 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.920
 do what we will see in this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.320
 capsule if it's a possible definition 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.060
 of this method that we see here 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.680
 signed that allows to choose the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.380
 variable assigned in an interaction 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.260
 of bach tracking sure we see a 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.209
 orderly value definition that goes 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.090
 order the values ​​of the domain of the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.430
 variable chosen in an order that will 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.720
 enable us to reach we hope 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.810
 more quickly a solution to our 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 problem and we'll see a definition of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.380
 the inference method that will be the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.150
 definition of our premium of 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.190
 constraint satisfaction and keane to 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.079
 the returns a new one will have 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.260
 possibly reducing the areas of 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.260
 variables then a kir rotated ok that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.840
 determines if there is a conflict there that we have 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.220
 detected a conflict that will not be possible 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.260
 to solve the latest in the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.049
 search and so that would indicate that we 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.190
 should not do this assignment of 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:34.519
 values ​​there at this variable then the 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.579
 first rustic we'll see it's in 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.900
 the choice of the east of which variable one 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.180
 must assign to a given iteration 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 myristic logistics we will see it 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.100
 what's called the minimum manning 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.609
 value or moscone strain verbal lloris 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.820
 tic and very simply what she does 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.060
 it is that she chooses the variable that has 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.239
 the least compatible values 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.910
 remaining so in this nice it's going 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.140
 to be the variable that makes it see the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.780
 number of value variables 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.790
 compatible 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.180
 the smallest of all the variables 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.000
 who remain assigned then we have a 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.410
 example right here but so this is at 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.260
 very early in our research we have a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.169
 empty assignment and one must choose 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.930
 a variable in that that if the whole 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.810
 variables are the looks all so 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.030
 the set of states of our from 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.220
 australia are the looks while 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.110
 they can take anything 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.400
 which of the three colors possible 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.020
 since there are no other variables 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.669
 who were assigned so in what if 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.760
 the choice is arbitrary say we 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.440
 choose this variable is here 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.890
 the man is time to choose second 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.050
 iteration so second level of our 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.790
 search dubbed bing search 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.830
 we must choose the next variable a 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.190
 signed and the order in this case what we 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.050
 note that this vise 6 and 7 and 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.300
 so can not take as 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.490
 red value since that would come the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.520
 constraint with errors and at 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.590
 neighbors here so while all 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.570
 other states this one this is 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.610
 that one then this one can take 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.680
 any of the three values ​​then 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.690
 in this case we have two states that have 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.270
 a number of compatible values 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.520
 remaining 2 while the others are 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.620
 to 3 so we would have the choice between according to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.380
 this killie stick in 7 and also this 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.820
 state there suppose we choose the one 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.169
 there is so assigns him values ​​that one 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.770
 is at the third level of our 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.260
 research 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.760
 we have to choose a new variable and 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.880
 in this case if there is only one 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.130
 variable as the smallest number of 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.229
 compatible values ​​remaining etc if 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.200
 this one is actually in that 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.630
 if this state here can take 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.910
 only as blue value will resume 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.160
 the cause of the stage above then for 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.990
 take red because of the state of worry 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.390
 so that will be our next variable 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.780
 which one would be chosen to whom 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.300
 made their institute sas and logistics 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.080
 minimum manning value that allows for 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.140
 to choose 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.539
 what is the next variable 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.100
 selected to consider these 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.100
 different values 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.070
 now we have seen that there were cases 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.510
 where in fact there was equality it's up to 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.610
 say that there is more than one variable that 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.460
 could take who had a number 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.530
 minimum remaining fighting values 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.510
 in what we can add another 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.180
 eastick what's called in English the 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.870
 dcri is rustic so in the echo there is 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.360
 equality one would choose the variable that has 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.530
 the most constraints that implies 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.780
 other variables that have not yet 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.020
 been assigned so we'll see an example 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.700
 of that then in this case at the very beginning 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.560
 of our research we had chosen in 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.350
 the previous example this variable to your 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.000
 roots and first but then actually 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.130
 all variables have the same number 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.380
 compatible values ​​then remaining 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.370
 in this case have privileged we will 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.920
 to forgive the variable that has 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.230
 the most constraints with which 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.580
 she shares by donation there is more than 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.980
 variables with which she shares a 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.740
 contrary and in this case it is done 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:17.210
 it's also because it's the state 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.710
 the variable that has the most variables 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.840
 with which sharing constraints the 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.550
 more state with which she shares a 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.930
 border this one is this one so this 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.030
 would be the variable we would select 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.370
 instead according to the grids 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:35.480
 heuristic then of his one must 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.920
 choose the next variable so in 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.660
 this case also firstly we start to 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.430
 look at all the variables the 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.000
 number of remaining combative values 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:49.280
 because if this variable 6 and daria 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.470
 psy is to say if these 26 each have a 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.740
 number of compatible variable variables 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.510
 remaining 2 then we will choose from 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.390
 these one would choose trial there because 

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.690
 what's left of it 3 there is none 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.920
 border state with which this star 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.720
 is connected we can take anything 

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.300
 what value any of the three 

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.860
 values ​​among the steps that remain 

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.640
 close that she stays there two values 

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.630
 compatible 

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.700
 the one that has the most variables that 

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.960
 remains to be signed and with which she 

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.850
 shares a constraint 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.030
 in fact I also have this one who has 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.710
 two is this one here this one but he 

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.690
 there are also those who have 2 that one 

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.169
 and if this one worse and this one too 

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.689
 this one was injured 

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:32.039
 share a contrary so there is no 

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:34.550
 the choice to make an arbitrary choice and 

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:38.940
 in this example if we choose it 

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.740
 and then afterwards to subtract from 

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.050
 this level if the research have chosen 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.600
 our third variable the third one has 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.610
 nothing we will choose balance that if it 

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.420
 will be the one that has the number of values 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:54.930
 remaining combatives the smallest is 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.970
 in fact so there are two variables 

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.699
 possible the one that received the value 

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.620
 red and then that also allowed 

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:03.000
 the two we will choose the one lived in 

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.339
 equality we're going I was doing the one that the 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.870
 number of variables it shares with 

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:08.459
 constraints and that is not yet to 

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.750
 sign who is the smallest is dense 

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:13.740
 that if it's this variable if he wants 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.209
 still share a constraint with 

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.310
 this variable which is not yet a 

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:19.500
 signed while this variable at 

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.850
 shares no constraint with others 

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.070
 variables that have not been yet to 

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.300
 sign since it is from them you are 

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.899
 also with whom she shares a 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.019
 constraint 

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:31.560
 in fact we have already been assigned so according to 

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:33.839
 this rustic of the name there grid 

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:39.209
 heuristic it's this variable here that 

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:41.040
 has been selected until now 

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:42.779
 we saw two rustic 

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.260
 so we can combine together to 

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:47.310
 choose what is the next variable 

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.430
 for which we will sign a value 

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.019
 now i was looking at another ristic 

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.079
 but who is different who she is going 

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:58.860
 order the possible values ​​assigned to 

00:09:55.079 --> 00:10:02.130
 the selected variable and the rustic 

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.160
 we're going to have one, it's a success 

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:08.270
 and who will choose who will actually put 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.300
 the valves the values ​​in 

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.970
 and we choose the value first that has 

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.490
 which invalidates the least possible value 

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.950
 for variables that have not yet 

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.990
 been assigned so to fully understand one 

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:24.830
 go see an example imagine we get 

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:28.100
 found at 7 at this stage of the 

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:31.040
 research and that chose this 

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.080
 variable here to sign and one has to 

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.590
 order his possible values ​​for 

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:39.110
 know what value have so to do 

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.510
 a value at this point every 

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.490
 consider is considered a 

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:47.090
 assignment of this variable value 

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:51.650
 forgiveness to a possible value in that 

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:53.480
 if we actually have two we had two choices 

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.940
 yes of choice of combative values 

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.650
 possible for assignment to yellow to 

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.070
 cause of this is also who is already 

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:03.470
 money we can sign it be a red 

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:07.040
 or blue 

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:11.240
 on the other hand if it is assigned to blue has 

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:15.590
 does this variable here and there this is the 

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.600
 variable sc letter of australia at most 

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.690
 no compatible value can be more 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.350
 there if mini has red neither money nor shelter by 

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:27.320
 against this value this is going to leave a 

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.330
 possible value for this state if is 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.430
 leave as possible the time when 

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.200
 a blue per year so actually it's 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.120
 to blues have satisfied the constraint with 

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.390
 the thais there is also the state here so 

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.930
 will remain a competitive value for 7 

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:44.200
 that's also so we're going to favor on 

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.240
 will select first as value 

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.240
 for the condition here for the disease if we 

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.810
 chosen bump first red then after 

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.400
 that we will try blue and if we had 

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.400
 selected blue we would have surrendered 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.120
 counts pretty quickly that his mine 1 and 

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.680
 compatibility 

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.490
 so we better start with red 

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.770
 first with the 3rd rustic suits 

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.380
 to see to select the next 

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:12.020
 variable and to determine from what 

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.840
 is the next value selected 

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.550
 in which to admit it the values ​​for 

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.010
 make our assignment to a variable 

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.390
 given we will understand all these 

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.980
 obstacles we are able to solve 

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.380
 in a reasonable time a problem of 

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.700
 2000 reindeer so grab istiqlal are 

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.110
 still powerful enough for him 

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.350
 to solve problems 

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.680
 much more complex in a time 

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.680
 reasonable 

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.910
 the last success and consorts in 

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.160
 this capsule is now a 

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.350
 tic nurse of inference so this is a 

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.510
 logistics that goes to detect lands 

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.580
 assignments that are conflicting 

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.020
 and that will in addition reduce the areas 

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:53.480
 other variables still to be signed 

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:58.420
 so ohrid lake is called jacking forest 

00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.680
 in French anticipatory verification and 

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:04.430
 the way the gallery works 

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:06.770
 who's going to check what are the 

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.900
 compatible values ​​of the variables that 

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.610
 are not yet to sign each time 

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.380
 we will make an assignment of one 

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.970
 variable has a value we are going to look 

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.950
 for other variables that have not 

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.590
 still been signed what are their 

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:21.140
 compatible values ​​remaining and we're going 

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.690
 finish the recursion so we're going 

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.500
 stop exploring this this 

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.210
 assignment there that we conquered the rates 

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:31.250
 short al of the search backdoor king 

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.690
 sturge when we find a variable 

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.150
 which is not yet signed but whose 

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:40.400
 its set of compatible values ​​and 

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:42.980
 rendering send example one to the state 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.320
 initial here that an empty assignment so 

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.970
 in that if the 

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.560
 set of compatible values ​​for 

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.660
 all the 

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.570
 all variables and klein contains 

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.310
 the three possible values 

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:59.540
 suppose we choose as first 

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:04.910
 variable assigned state here so that's 

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:06.500
 the state w then we will do with 

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.089
 the euphoria jacking is that girls 

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.470
 yes sorry let's also assume 

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:10.630
 understand this variable whose sinne 

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.920
 to red 

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.540
 once we've done that we'll call 

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.850
 inferences in what if it's going to be the 

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.440
 everyone's procedure is what we're going 

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.450
 to do is we will reduce 

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.430
 domains of the other variables that did not 

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.410
 not yet assigned the way we're going 

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.660
 to reduce is that we will resume the 

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:29.390
 variables that share a constraint 

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.910
 with the currently considered variable 

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:36.980
 that w so the variants that share 

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:39.260
 a constraint cnt that's here and s and 

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:43.100
 we will reduce their domain by removing 

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:45.170
 values ​​who would be in conflict 

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.930
 with the assignment should be done 

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.120
 so that means we would take away 

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.950
 red the domain of these psychic pariahs and of 

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.540
 this variable and that's what we did 

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:57.589
 there in the little diagram just down 

00:14:53.540 --> 00:15:00.620
 we removed red sold values 

00:14:57.589 --> 00:15:03.800
 remaining combatives for the variables 

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:06.620
 who have not yet sits when if 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.900
 we do not have any variables that are not 

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.270
 still to sign to which we do not sign 

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.300
 agree that there is a city estate a 

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.830
 number of possible values 

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.250
 compatible possible empty so we 

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:22.190
 continues the researches have chosen a 

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:24.440
 new variable this one so that's the 

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.570
 variable that we dispose we have 

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.510
 chose this one it is assigned to jean le 

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.459
 in this case we take the three 

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:40.550
 variables that share a constraint 

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:42.380
 with q so this cnts and nsw so that's 

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.320
 states that share a border and 

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.700
 we will reduce their area so their 

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.510
 possible value we will reduce them in 

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:53.510
 removing the value signed to the variable 

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:56.530
 what to know jean so we had nice if 

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:59.810
 we are nice if I removed people here 

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.260
 we have no empty set then we 

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:05.990
 continue research 

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:10.140
 suppose we choose this and also 

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:11.910
 so it's the state of life it's variable 

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.570
 with what sharing is constrained it is 

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:17.550
 another ca and nsw is what we're going 

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.400
 do it on because we signed to blood 

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:25.230
 this variable if we will remove the 

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:28.080
 domain of the variable is at and nsw the 

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:30.390
 blue value so that's what 

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.810
 absorbs if we removed blue here and blue 

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.930
 here and there in the search we notice 

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:39.270
 the domain so the compatible values 

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:43.050
 remaining for the unassigned variable 

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:45.030
 it's still empty 

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.620
 so when we do what Freud does 

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.100
 shaking will do is go back 

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:53.970
 at work and that says there is a conflict 

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:56.880
 that have been detected and search for 

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:59.240
 south ninh bin where will stop will stop 

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.340
 to explore continuing to sign 

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.890
 variables from that summer there he goes 

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.010
 to do a bac hunt so a return in 

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.010
 back 

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:14.100
 so we also go the code pso for the 

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.339
 fore-checking inference procedure so 

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.020
 fore-checking is what would replace 

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:28.710
 what we did not see in the pseudo psig 

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:30.150
 inference code of csp so what of 

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.410
 special here is that we replace 

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.090
 inferences from his evil spirits 

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:36.900
 also not if the variable 

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:38.010
 currently considered x ok so that's 

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.780
 a different method but which 

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:43.440
 requires one more argument which is the 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.780
 variable currently considered x then 

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.110
 here is a small ring for fore-checking 

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.850
 what we do is we will watch 

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.440
 the set of neighbors of x that is to say 

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.150
 the set of variables that share 

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.730
 a contrary in our problem of 

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.800
 sign graffiti coloring garages 

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.570
 of the map of australia it is 

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.720
 the set of variables that corresponds 

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.790
 to a state that shares a border 

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.160
 we will call them ex-cat so for 

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.330
 each of his neighbors the ex as we go 

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.520
 call does not surprise me that we are going to call 

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:15.230
 revised which takes input variable 

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.910
 ouazine our back now 

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.710
 considered that they obviously spend the 

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.630
 definition our premium satisfaction from 

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.740
 constraints does revising your 

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:26.120
 brothers turned a new 

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.210
 constraint satisfaction problem where 

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.350
 we changed the domain of the ex-hull 

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.530
 that is, we do not simply 

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:35.180
 reduces the number of possible values 

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.970
 for the widow of the ex body taking 

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.190
 counts constraints between x and x 

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.440
 let's go to the definition of revising 

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:45.350
 a protocol to revise I give a 

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.540
 definition good he'll go back also 

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.610
 the method must also return a 

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.160
 strand 1 which determines who is going to tell us 

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.560
 and the field of experts 

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.950
 change or not if the domain has changed 

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.650
 so if changed and that the domain of xk 

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:04.060
 became empty and well the forest 

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:06.440
 checking will return so do go there 

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.150
 company in the harbor like what we 

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.790
 was calling ok so he's saying that 

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.440
 it's not we're not in a 

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.540
 situation we think we can 

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:19.130
 eventually solve that problem 

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.510
 we detected a conflict is good for the 

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.830
 csp we return void we could 

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.170
 return the same his spirits but from 

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.430
 anyway the search will stop in 

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.320
 bac you have a king swatch so it's not 

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.840
 important we can return a pointer 

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.480
 null is so we do that because we have 

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.740
 we know that a variable that can take 

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.380
 no value 

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.309
 from now on and satisfy his 

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:44.640
 constraint with the variable x and the 

00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:46.920
 other variables and so that's it and 

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.630
 otherwise if we managed to reduce all 

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.610
 domains without ever arriving at a 

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.700
 variable which is an empty domain when 

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:56.730
 if we will return our new csp 

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:59.400
 with it's variable these areas of 

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:03.300
 variables modified we will return a 

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.809
 true for what corresponds to ok the in 

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.980
 the pure bach jacking circus odds 

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:09.600
 I take off language so we can see a little 

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.250
 better so now what are we going to do 

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:17.309
 save the definition of the method 

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.770
 revised so revise a reminder what 

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:23.670
 we have to do is change the domain 

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:26.100
 of the xxi variable according to the 

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.470
 variable and that i have is what we need 

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.330
 to face and to remove from the domain of 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.920
 ski the values ​​that are such that we 

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.679
 will never succeed in satisfying the 

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.230
 constraint between eksi and ichi then 

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:39.660
 how do we do that we will do 

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.120
 we're going to start by initializing 

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.170
 a variable changed so we need 

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.030
 suppose for the moment that we have 

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.790
 then actually at the very beginning we did not 

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.650
 makes no change to the field at the 

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:52.380
 variable etc otherwise it's what loaded 

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.750
 that's what it's all about 

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.150
 will iterate on all small values 

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:59.460
 what can it take so if so 

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.990
 x area that serves poorly turn 

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.760
 the set of possible values ​​for 

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.280
 so I'm going to iterate over all 

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.850
 these values ​​there I will call his 

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.480
 words the x for a given value of 

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:14.370
 Arabic xy 

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.190
 I'm going to check is what there is 

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:20.010
 a forgiveness variant of value y to the 

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:22.350
 variable xj which is such that I can 

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:25.200
 satisfy the constraint x between 

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:29.220
 explained ie that s that exists 

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.670
 a variable a forgiveness value y that I 

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:36.030
 may have signed at xj such as if I had 

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:38.570
 to sign xxi ax i will satisferai me 

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:42.960
 constraint between x that is required 

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:44.910
 now if there is no value y that 

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.700
 allows to make this satisfaction 

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:52.549
 constraint the between x that is required 

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:57.149
 I will remove x from the domain of eksi 

00:21:52.549 --> 00:22:00.059
 so I will change the value of the csp 

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:01.769
 is specifically so its the part of 

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:05.549
 the csp data structure that 

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:07.230
 determines the domain of x and i'm going to 

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:10.769
 change so that they do not contain 

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:12.990
 plus the value x and then i'm going 

00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:16.110
 note that actually I changed my 

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:19.320
 csp i changed the domain of eksi into 

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:22.260
 assignats by assigning haven is the 

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:27.149
 variable changed so I'm doing that for 

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:28.590
 all xxi values ​​that I note x 

00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:31.409
 in all possible values ​​x which 

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.820
 belong to the domain of xy and 

00:22:31.409 --> 00:22:33.090
 finally I will go back to the whole 

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.669
 end 

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:38.850
 if i changed my csps i changed 

00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:42.950
 the domain of eksi and I'm going back 

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:46.019
 the csp that has potentially been changed 

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:50.269
 and so that's what's called here 

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:50.269
 in the high heat algorithm
