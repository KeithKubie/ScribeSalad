00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.770
Kids, hello and welcome to Introduction
to High Performance Computing or

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.930
Intro the HPC for short.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.060
My name is Rich Vuduc, and
I'm a professor here in the School of

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.820
Computational Science and
Engineering at Georgia Tech.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.420
I'll be your guide in this course as
you explore what I think are some of

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.450
the big ideas in how to
extract parallelism and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.510
data locality from algorithms and
data structures.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.790
I thought we'd kick things off here at
the Klaus Advanced Computing Building.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.460
It's one of the main places on the GT
Campus where HPC is proudly spoken.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.110
Oh, Viva la HPC.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.520
Now there's another
reason to start here to.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.690
Although you might be attending
the course from some remote

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.870
part of the globe, I wanted to remind
you while your in my course at least,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.390
you're still here with us in spirit.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.100
And that makes you part of
the Georgia Tech family.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
So with that,
let's head to my office in Klaus, and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.550
I'll tell you a little bit
more about the course.
