00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.509
Ok, it's Mark Wiens here, I'm in Varanasi,
India.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.300
It's about seven am and I'm taking a morning
boat ride and the whole city is sort of waking

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.030
up, but there's a lot of fog.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.980
Every morning has fog?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.630
Almost, yes, but sometimes not fog, sometimes.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.630
Ok.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.079
What is your name?

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.050
My name is Mark.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.449
Ponkarch, ok, nice to meet you.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:01:21.700
Nice to meet you too.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.320
But one of the best ways to explore Varanasi
is just on foot walking along the river on

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.750
these ghats, and there are multiple, many
many ghats along the river.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.060
And a ghat is like a series of steps that
leads down to the river.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.340
So it makes a really great place to walk around.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:57.979
It's peaceful, yet at the same time it's mystical,
it's really magical as well.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:17.010
Hey it's Mark Wiens here and I am in Varanasi,
India, at the main ghat, and there's always

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.560
something exciting going down here.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:59.930
You can see over here today there's like a
mass wedding going on.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.389
One of the best ways to explore Varanasi is
by walking through the narrow alleyways, umm,

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:14.040
these alleyways are all over near the Ganges
river, and it's a maze, but it's filled with

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.829
shops, there's temples, little shrines, there's
restaurants and street food, but it's just

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:30.299
an always entertaining area to walk around
with many many people and just one of the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:48.230
joys of visiting Varanasi is just to explore
these back alleys.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:04:13.050
Mmm, it's so hot and fresh!

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:48.780
Green peas, and there's some onions and spices
on top, and you eat it with a leaf in a leaf.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.509
Oh yah!

00:04:52.509 --> 00:06:12.629
Malaiyo it's called, it's like a, wow 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:23.750
it's very foamy, wow, it's surprisingly delicious.
