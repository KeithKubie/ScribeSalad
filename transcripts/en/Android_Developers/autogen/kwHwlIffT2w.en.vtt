awesome now let's look at the code to
make this happen

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:21.830
 

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.960
so for apps which already support

introduced the concept of bringing

00:24:07.249 --> 00:24:07.259
introduced the concept of bringing
 

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:08.990
introduced the concept of bringing
content out and being able to show

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000
content out and being able to show
 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.779
content out and being able to show
things as grids or lists and by default

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:11.789
things as grids or lists and by default
 

00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:14.210
things as grids or lists and by default
Android auto will show browsable items

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220
Android auto will show browsable items
 

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.789
Android auto will show browsable items
the folders as lists because they

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799
the folders as lists because they
 

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:19.129
the folders as lists because they
generally have an icon and they'll show

00:24:19.129 --> 00:24:19.139
generally have an icon and they'll show
 

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:22.639
generally have an icon and they'll show
content or like playable items as grids

00:24:22.639 --> 00:24:22.649
content or like playable items as grids
 

00:24:22.649 --> 00:24:24.619
content or like playable items as grids
because they're usually much richer and

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:24.629
because they're usually much richer and
 

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.960
because they're usually much richer and
have a much more detailed artwork but

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:26.970
have a much more detailed artwork but
 

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.149
have a much more detailed artwork but
there are times when it's better to

00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159
there are times when it's better to
 

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:32.269
there are times when it's better to
switch that around so for instance let's

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279
switch that around so for instance let's
 

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:34.970
switch that around so for instance let's
say you have a podcast app in that case

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980
say you have a podcast app in that case
 

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.820
say you have a podcast app in that case
the podcasts which are browsable items

the podcasts which are browsable items
 

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.029
the podcasts which are browsable items
have a much richer artwork right but all
