00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.180
Can the activity of the sun predict your lifespan?

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.590
Hi everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.550
Does the sun really have an influence on human
lifespan and reproduction?

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.910
If the possibility sounds like some pseudo-scientific
astrological nonsense, listen up, because

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.350
biologists in Norway are proposing that exposure
to the sun rays can reduce your lifespan up

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.410
to 5 years, and if you’re female, make it
less likely that you yourself will reproduce.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.039
The study, published in Proceedings of the
Royal Society B relied on historical data

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:41.149
found in records from 1676 and 1878 so we
can be relatively sure that the people studied

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.979
spent most of their time localized to Norway
and experienced the same solar conditions.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.870
In a survey of the birth and death records
of 8,662 people over the two hundred year

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.280
period the researchers chose to sample, the
data showed a reduced life expectancy of up

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.379
to 5.2 years in people born during years of
increased solar radiation.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.689
And worse, women of the low socio-economic
classes born during those times, were likely

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.259
to experience reduced fertility and low lifetime
reproductive success.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.670
So what does this mean? and why would the
solar cycle, an ~ 11 year cycle of the sun’s

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.890
magnetic activity, have any influence on some
human on earth’s ability to reproduce?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.229
Well the answer may lie in UV radiation.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.119
Of all the types of radiation emitted from
the sun, it seems like UV radiation has the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.320
worst reputation.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.439
We know that UV radiation causes skin cancer
and contributes to premature aging and DNA

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.439
damage.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.799
But the authors of the Norwegian study attribute
the deadly effects of UV rays to a molecular

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.799
mechanism.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.640
Specifically, its destruction of folate.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.360
Folate or Folic acid is a crucial biological
molecule that helps out in many of the reactions

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.490
that keep our bodies going.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.439
It is also necessary for cellular division
because of its role in DNA synthesis and repair,

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.720
but exposure to UV radiation can destroy this
crucial nutrient and have physiological consequences.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.380
It is known that a deficiency in folate leads
to complications in pregnancy and development,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.710
but unfortunately for us, we can’t synthesize
it ourselves, we’ve got to eat it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.150
Most pregnant women are encouraged to take
folate supplements to promote proper fetal

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.150
development.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.770
but its an easy bet that those Norwegians
back in 1679 weren't able to pop a supplement

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.300
when they found out they were pregnant.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.240
And today’s scientists think that low folate
levels may be the reason for the low birth

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.140
rates and reduced life expectancy of people
born during periods of high UV exposure.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.880
Personally, I think it would be interesting
to see if these results could be reproduced

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.730
in a modern population with access to sunscreen,
and nutritional supplements.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.030
And honestly, there are so many other variables
that can influence lifespan and reproductive

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.060
success - like diet, and workload - in addition
to environmental factors like the sun, that

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.570
at best this should be taken as a study of
correlation, NOT causation.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.290
But it is interesting to think about how phenomena
we take for granted every day - like the sun

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.850
rising - may be having unknown consequences
on the very paths of our lives.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.850
What do you think?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.870
Could the sun be influencing our life spans?
