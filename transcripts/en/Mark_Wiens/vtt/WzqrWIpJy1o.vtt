00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:02.264
- Hey everyone, hope you're
having an amazing day,

00:00:02.264 --> 00:00:04.564
it's Mark Wiens, I'm in Chania,

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:06.546
on the island of Crete in Greece.

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:08.564
And I think one of the best
reasons that you can come

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.628
to Crete is to experience
the authentic Mediterranean

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:15.196
food culture, and so I'm
on my way this morning

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:18.151
to go eat at a restaurant which is known

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.083
for preserving authentic Cretan food,

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:22.641
we're gonna jump in a
taxi, it's a little ways

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.614
outside of town within the mountains,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.438
and I'm looking forward to eating

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:29.451
and to sharing with you
some authentic Cretan food.

00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:33.201
(soothing atmospheric music)

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:38.613
This restaurant?

00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:40.113
It is at Charamia?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.373
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:45.417
Okay, thank you.

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:47.627
Yeah, I think it's about 20 kilometers

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.759
just straight up in towards the mountain.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.259
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.625
We're driving further and
further into the mountain range,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.669
the rugged mountain range, we've passed

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.063
by just an endless sea of olive trees,

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:14.190
you can see vineyards, you can see all of,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.148
just the lush Mediterranean herbs,

00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:20.581
we passed by sheep,
flocks of sheep and goats.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.534
You can just sense how
rich the land is here,

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:26.367
and how fertile it is.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:30.029
When I thought of coming to Crete,

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:33.463
this is the dreamy
landscape and environment

00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:35.734
that I had literally dreamt about

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.078
and what I wanted to experience
when I came to Crete.

00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:40.292
It was really quite a journey to get here,

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:43.270
we wound around the mountain roads, and,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.510
oh, I'm standing kind of in the middle

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.674
of the road right now, but the owner

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.535
was here to greet us at the restaurant,

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:49.859
you can smell, he still cooks over fire,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.243
the restaurant is over here, we're gonna

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.255
definitely get a look at
all the food he's preparing,

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:55.838
but the dining room is up here.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.873
Wow, this is an absolutely
beautiful place.

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:05.672
Oh, I am already thrilled

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.498
that we made the journey here.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.105
Oh.

00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:10.032
Amazing!

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:12.000
- Where are you from, USA?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.118
- [Mark] From USA, my
wife is from Thailand.

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:15.293
- Thailand?
- Thailand, yes.

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.126
- You, you?

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.425
- [Mark] Thailand also,
America, from Arizona.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:19.760
- Arizona.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.405
Mountain goat.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.656
Why you here?

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:24.430
- [Mark] Because I love to eat.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.290
(chuckles)

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.040
Wow, this is amazing.

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:33.907
Wow.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:35.199
- Creta food.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.422
- [Mark] Creta food.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:40.589
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:44.386
- Come here, sir, come.
- Okay.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:48.399
Wow.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.396
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.843
Wow.

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:05.882
Dolma?
- Dolma.

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:09.549
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.540
- [Mark] Amazing.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.882
All wood, all traditional stuff.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:28.606
Everything is cooked in
traditional Cretan ceramic pots,

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:31.689
this is an amazing, an amazing place.

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:35.645
And outside is where he's
doing most of the cooking

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:38.028
over fire, the traditional way.

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:40.617
You can smell the aromas of the meat,

00:03:40.617 --> 00:03:42.534
the lamb, and the goat.

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.792
- Maybe you like to look garden?

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:49.625
- [Mark] Sure!

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.758
Everything is from your garden.

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:53.723
And from your, and the meat, also?

00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:56.621
- Here, it's no restaurant.
- Yes.

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.024
- Here is farm.
- Okay!

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:00.634
- Different.
- Okay.

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.868
- Restaurant, from supermarket,

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.285
farm, we want people, garden, and animal.

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:38.118
- He's such a nice,
friendly, passionate guy,

00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:42.263
you can tell how he has, he
pours his love into his cooking,

00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:45.365
and he cooks over fire, he
has all these stews going

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.091
over the coals, and he
has everything cooking

00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:51.301
in traditional Cretan clay, ceramic pots,

00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.731
and he made sure to tell me
that this is not a restaurant,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.132
this is a farm, so all of the ingredients

00:04:57.132 --> 00:04:58.569
are from right here on their farm,

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.490
the vegetables, they have animals,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.751
they have the livestock,
they have all the herbs

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:04.803
and all the ingredients, I know for sure

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.261
they get their own olive oil,

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:08.179
this being in the mountains of Crete.

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.929
This is a spectacular food place.

00:05:15.156 --> 00:05:16.512
Wow, thank you.

00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:18.602
- You're welcome.
- This is peaches?

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:19.602
Peaches, or?

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:26.198
Okay, because we get started eating

00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:29.111
some of those meaty stews,
I'm gonna walk around

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.425
with Adam around the garden, but first,

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.309
he just picked some, I think these are

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:34.399
either peaches or nectarines,

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.679
no, they're fuzzy, I
think they're peaches,

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.012
he picked them right off the tree there.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.247
Oh, it's like crisp like an apple,

00:05:43.247 --> 00:05:45.701
but then it has the flavor of a peach!

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.355
Oh, it's really good.

00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:48.605
Oh, cows, okay.

00:05:50.056 --> 00:05:52.122
- We have a family of cows.

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:54.455
- [Mark] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.344
- We have family on the mountains--

00:05:57.344 --> 00:06:01.956
(loud insect chirping drowns out dialogue)

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:06.123
And they take their (mumbles) every day.

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:09.395
- Wow.

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.427
We're taking a walk down to the farm

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:13.508
to see some of the
produce and some of the,

00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:14.827
are there are more animals also?

00:06:14.827 --> 00:06:16.630
- Yes, of course!
- Okay.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.495
And these are all olives.

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:21.498
Oh, lots and lots of olives.

00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:25.027
- [Adam] Every vegetable you
can eat at the restaurant

00:06:25.027 --> 00:06:26.110
is from here.

00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:30.868
- Everything that's cooked is
all from within the garden,

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:33.613
and from within the farm, it's a farm!

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:37.186
Wow, this is straight farm-to-table,

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:38.789
and when I talk about
straight farm-to-table,

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.263
this is like straight from
their backyard to the table,

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.096
that we're gonna eat.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:45.421
Look at this land!

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:47.671
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:06:48.857 --> 00:06:51.457
Okay, mama and big father.

00:06:51.457 --> 00:06:52.290
- [Mark] Okay!

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.772
This is absolutely a Mediterranean oasis,

00:06:54.772 --> 00:06:56.897
a Mediterranean paradise.

00:06:56.897 --> 00:06:58.911
(Adam bleats)

00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.661
(sheep bleating)

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.882
(sheep bell tolling)

00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:09.632
You wanna try?
- Okay.

00:07:22.584 --> 00:07:23.917
This is amazing!

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:42.907
Amazing.

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:48.075
Amazing.
- Soft, eh?

00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:50.774
- Yeah, really, really soft.

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:51.607
Hey, guy!

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:58.477
One of the things that fascinates
me about Cretan culture

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:00.831
is that, traditionally, people are known

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:03.771
for living very, very long lives,

00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.269
because of the way they eat,

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:09.090
and they always eat off the land,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.085
they eat seasonal, the
traditional Cretan diet,

00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:15.244
and this is a throwback to the past,

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:17.184
this is the way people ate in the past,

00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:19.222
this is the way they
would raise their animals,

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:21.612
eat from the land, and eat seasonally.

00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:24.279
And this is the best way to eat.

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:33.562
- You can taste.
- Okay.

00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:35.284
- It's very sweet.

00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:36.117
Superfood.

00:08:38.068 --> 00:08:39.026
- Oh, yeah.

00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:39.982
Mm.
- It's good, right?

00:08:39.982 --> 00:08:42.833
- Really good, thank you.

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.041
- Take it all.

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.503
If you want--
- No, they're really,

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:46.503
really good.

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:51.656
Are they blackberry,
maybe blackberries, or?

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.098
Mm.

00:08:53.098 --> 00:08:54.377
Really sweet and juicy.

00:08:54.377 --> 00:08:56.024
That was actually a completely unplanned

00:08:56.024 --> 00:09:00.361
trip to the farm, I just
started talking with Adam,

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.955
who runs the farm, and runs the livestock,

00:09:02.955 --> 00:09:04.233
and we just ended up walking further

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:06.382
and seeing all the livestock,

00:09:06.382 --> 00:09:08.150
but now we're sitting down to eat.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.844
That just increases my
hunger and my excitement.

00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:13.761
And this is some of the house wine.

00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.658
'Kay, gotta try some of that.

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:21.536
Wow.

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:23.108
That is spectacular.

00:09:23.108 --> 00:09:24.374
Oh, and I'm sure,

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:26.961
oh, actually, we're sitting
right under some grapevines.

00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:30.510
I know the wine is made
right here as well.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.060
I gotta try some of this bread.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.103
Oh, and it's very, very crispy.

00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:36.094
You can feel it's crunchy in your fingers,

00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:38.227
and then it looks like there is definitely

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:39.810
some oregano on it.

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:47.025
It's really crispy, it's really dense,

00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:48.775
it tastes like Crete!

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:51.955
And also, as we're sitting down to eat,

00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:54.158
they're about to play
some live Cretan music

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:55.651
right in front of us too.

00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.161
The view is spectacular,
(speaks in foreign language)

00:09:58.161 --> 00:09:59.621
can't get better either.

00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:02.964
And with live music as
we're hanging out here,

00:10:02.964 --> 00:10:06.797
this is relaxing
Mediterranean Crete paradise.

00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:10.932
- Mountain goat.
- Oh, mountain goat.

00:10:12.303 --> 00:10:13.636
Yes.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:15.899
The chef, he's just gonna bring us

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:17.992
five different dishes, I'm
not sure all the dishes,

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.483
but he's just gonna bring
his personal favorites.

00:10:20.483 --> 00:10:21.934
And the first dish that he brought out,

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.399
I was gonna wait for all
the dishes to come out,

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.194
but I absolutely cannot.

00:10:25.194 --> 00:10:27.942
The first is stewed Cretan mountain goat.

00:10:27.942 --> 00:10:31.390
Look at those chunks of all-natural meat.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.243
Look at, okay, I'm just gonna pick up

00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:35.236
one of these guys right
here, look at that.

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:38.403
(serene guitar music)

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:46.962
Oh, it's tender,

00:10:48.546 --> 00:10:51.567
but it has an amazing
almost herb flavor to it.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.650
Whoa, that's spectacular.

00:10:58.296 --> 00:11:01.822
That's about as meaty and
wonderful as you can get.

00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:05.503
Oh, that is flavor meat
overload right there.

00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:08.159
It's really, really good.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:11.329
And it is stewed and
cooked very, very tender.

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:15.711
But you can, it's a natural
free-range, grazing goat,

00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:18.794
so it has that natural texture to it,

00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:21.881
but it's very, very tender.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.264
Their white wine here is
absolutely fantastic too,

00:11:27.264 --> 00:11:29.208
and they just brought us one more dish.

00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:32.150
I'm still blown away by that
wild goat, that mountain goat.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.142
Next dish is aubergine, eggplant,

00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:36.186
this is a dish that
looks like it needs to be

00:11:36.186 --> 00:11:37.394
eaten with bread.

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:40.468
Gonna break some of this
bread, scoop on some of this,

00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:42.718
it's really nice and saucy.

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:49.297
Mm!

00:11:50.902 --> 00:11:53.057
You can taste the fire in that eggplant!

00:11:53.057 --> 00:11:55.786
It's been cooked over the
fire in that ceramic pot,

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:58.322
the eggplant is melt-in-your-mouth tender.

00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:00.217
And then it's just kind
of a mellow flavor,

00:12:00.217 --> 00:12:04.190
but what I love about it is
it just tastes so natural,

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.330
and also just the fact that the eggplant

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.764
is just melt-in-your-mouth.

00:12:07.764 --> 00:12:11.299
Another dish has arrived,
and the chef brought it

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:12.984
to our table himself.

00:12:12.984 --> 00:12:15.853
This is chunks of veal, and he
said this is from their farm,

00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:18.622
this is Cretan veal, this
is a traditional dish,

00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:21.147
it's been stewed again, you
can see the chunks of meat,

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:23.478
you can see the herbs in
here, I can see some rosemary,

00:12:23.478 --> 00:12:26.299
I can see some, mostly braised rosemary,

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:27.847
and I can smell the rosemary.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:31.548
Okay, this looks like I'm
gonna go in with my knife here,

00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:35.479
cut a piece of this, just let it soak up

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:37.925
some of that sauce on the bottom there,

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.314
and get a closeup look at that,

00:12:39.314 --> 00:12:40.746
that looks extremely tender,

00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:43.329
and that rosemary in there, oh!

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:47.632
Wow.

00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:49.295
Oh, you can taste the rosemary,

00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:51.212
and I think I can taste
the white wine in there.

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:52.085
Follow that.

00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:55.668
(traditional Cretan music)

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.543
Wow.

00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.702
This is the Cretan life right here.

00:13:01.702 --> 00:13:03.932
This is awesome, this is
absolutely outstanding,

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:05.099
I'm loving it!

00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:13.076
Oh, some veal juices!

00:13:14.468 --> 00:13:15.718
A little bread.

00:13:16.898 --> 00:13:20.675
Next up for some dolma, and
this is a plate that we got.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.172
I think these are actually wrapped in,

00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:25.131
I think zucchini flowers,

00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:26.663
and then there's rice
and the spices in here,

00:13:26.663 --> 00:13:29.262
and then this is a zucchini,
and then with yogurt.

00:13:29.262 --> 00:13:31.688
Let's cut this open so
we can see what's inside,

00:13:31.688 --> 00:13:33.005
oh yeah, you've got that rice,

00:13:33.005 --> 00:13:34.680
I think there's dill in there,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.924
and maybe some other herbs,

00:13:36.924 --> 00:13:40.674
and then I'm gonna dip
it with the side here.

00:13:44.344 --> 00:13:45.609
Oh.

00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:47.241
Oh, that dill!

00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:48.663
Comes in so nicely, and then that rice

00:13:48.663 --> 00:13:52.756
is nice and gooey and gummy,
almost like a pudding.

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:57.652
And then, yeah, I think
that is the zucchini flower.

00:13:57.652 --> 00:13:58.955
That's fantastic.

00:13:58.955 --> 00:14:00.872
It's really refreshing.

00:14:03.068 --> 00:14:03.901
Oh.

00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:05.984
The zucchini just melts in your mouth too.

00:14:05.984 --> 00:14:08.223
The owner just brought us a cup of tea,

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:12.390
and I think this is some
kind of Cretan mountain tea.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:15.770
Mm!

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.477
Rosemary tea!

00:14:17.477 --> 00:14:18.541
Yeah, that's what it tastes like to me,

00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:22.708
rosemary and probably some
other Cretan herbs as well.

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:28.296
You probably need this to
wash down that mountain goat.

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:31.879
(traditional Cretan music)

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.243
And the final dish we
got is a Cretan salad,

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.317
and just like the rest of the dishes,

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:42.955
they do not take the salad lightly here.

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:45.411
This is absolutely gorgeous,
this is one of the most

00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:47.605
beautiful salads I think
I've ever seen in my life!

00:14:47.605 --> 00:14:51.962
And you can be for sure
certain, 100% guaranteed

00:14:51.962 --> 00:14:54.206
that all of the ingredients in this salad,

00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:56.134
all the vegetables that you see here,

00:14:56.134 --> 00:14:57.185
everything that you see here,

00:14:57.185 --> 00:14:59.556
is from right here on this farm.

00:14:59.556 --> 00:15:02.371
I know the owner would
not have it any other way.

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:04.179
Some of the vegetables
appear to be roasted,

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:06.489
there's some eggplant and
potatoes that are roasted,

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.728
and some peppers, but then there's also

00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:12.104
an abundance of other
vegetables, there are cucumbers,

00:15:12.104 --> 00:15:15.587
there's some type of grain,
there're raisins in here,

00:15:15.587 --> 00:15:18.181
and beets, and tomatoes.

00:15:18.181 --> 00:15:19.431
This is insane.

00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:25.236
Oh.

00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:28.375
That's just bursting with natural flavor.

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:30.755
Oh, that tomato is ridiculous.

00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:33.724
It's so juicy, and so refreshing,

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.270
and then I got some corn in that bite,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.853
I got some raisins.

00:15:38.862 --> 00:15:42.279
This is definitely a roasted pepper here.

00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:47.610
Oh.

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:50.185
I think it's just olive oil on top.

00:15:50.185 --> 00:15:51.732
Oh, and as you dig deeper into the salad,

00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:55.247
you can see, there are chunks of the rusk,

00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:59.080
which are the crunchy
bread down here as well.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:05.713
Dig deeper, there're more
and more fresh herbs as well,

00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:06.963
and vegetables.

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.844
That just tastes like pure health.

00:16:12.844 --> 00:16:16.011
And some fresh watermelon for dessert.

00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:26.002
That is just the ultimate way
to end this Cretan food meal.

00:16:26.002 --> 00:16:29.252
(vibrant guitar music)

00:16:36.642 --> 00:16:39.270
(clapping)

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.076
- [Agust] We see you
next time, four people.

00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:44.308
One, two, three, and then one more.

00:16:44.308 --> 00:16:45.307
(chuckling)

00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:47.545
One, nothing, madame.
- I hope so.

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:49.236
- Is me, three.
- I hope so.

00:16:49.236 --> 00:16:51.859
This has been by far the best meal

00:16:51.859 --> 00:16:55.184
that I've ever had in Crete, and I think,

00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:57.284
and I haven't eaten at that many places,

00:16:57.284 --> 00:16:59.835
but I think this is a
place, if you love to eat,

00:16:59.835 --> 00:17:02.486
this is a place you should
make an effort to come to,

00:17:02.486 --> 00:17:05.292
when you visit Crete, no
matter where you are in Crete.

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:08.124
He's doing an exceptional
job, and again, he said,

00:17:08.124 --> 00:17:10.859
the owner says it's not a
restaurant, but it's a farm,

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:14.138
and he cooks traditional
Cretan food recipes,

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:16.221
he's an amazing guy, and,

00:17:17.408 --> 00:17:22.407
thank you very much, thank you,
thank you, you are awesome.

00:17:22.407 --> 00:17:24.886
- See you next time.
- And he is the man

00:17:24.886 --> 00:17:28.665
right here, he is the man,
I love this experience.

00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:30.645
Okay, so I wanna say a big thank you

00:17:30.645 --> 00:17:31.953

00:17:42.835 --> 00:17:45.927
The snails, he's cooking
the snails right now.

00:17:45.927 --> 00:17:47.796
But you can check out

and this is the place to come,

00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:55.449
this is definitely the place to come,

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.477
you've gotta come here.

00:17:56.477 --> 00:18:00.233
