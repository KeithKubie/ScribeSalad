00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.380
For Nearly Two Decades the Nuclear Launch
Code at all Minuteman Silos in the United

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.540
States Was 00000000

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.290
during the height of the Cold War, the US
military put such an emphasis on a rapid response

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.750
to an attack on American soil, that to minimize
any foreseeable delay in launching a nuclear

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.480
missile, for nearly two decades they intentionally
set the launch codes at every silo in the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.660
US to 8 zeroes.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.719
We guess the first thing we need to address
is how this even came to be in the first place.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.420
Well, in 1962 JFK signed the National Security
Action Memorandum 160, which was supposed

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.539
to ensure that every nuclear weapon the US
had be fitted with a Permissive Action Link

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.359
(PAL), basically a small device that ensured
that the missile could only be launched with

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.860
the right code and with the right authority.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.429
There was particularly a concern that the
nuclear missiles the United States had stationed

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.440
in other countries, some of which with somewhat
unstable leadership, could potentially be

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.540
seized by those governments and launched.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.870
With the PAL system, this became much less
of a problem.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.930
Beyond foreign seizure, there was also simply
the problem that many U.S. commanders had

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.240
the ability to launch nukes under their control
at any time.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.460
Just one commanding officer who wasn’t quite
right in the head and World War III begins.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.770
As U.S. General Horace M. Wade stated about
General Thomas Power:

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.670
I used to worry about General Power.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.390
I used to worry that General Power was not
stable.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.600
I used to worry about the fact that he had
control over so many weapons and weapon systems

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.510
and could, under certain conditions, launch
the force.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.930
Back in the days before we had real positive
control [i.e., PAL locks], SAC had the power

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.280
to do a lot of things, and it was in his hands,
and he knew it.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.100
To give you an idea of how secure the PAL
system was at this time, bypassing one was

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.120
once described as being “about as complex
as performing a tonsillectomy while entering

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.480
the patient from the wrong end.”

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.209
This system was supposed to be essentially
hot-wire proof, making sure only people with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.730
the correct codes could activate the nuclear
weapons and launch the missiles.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.969
However, though the devices were supposed
to be fitted on every nuclear missile after

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.319
JFK issued his memorandum, the military continually
dragged its heels on the matter.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.379
In fact, it was noted that a full 20 years
after JFK had order PALs be fitted to every

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.650
nuclear device, half of the missiles in Europe
were still protected by simple mechanical

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.790
locks.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.030
Most that did have the new system in place
weren’t even activated until 1977.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.999
Those in the U.S. that had been fitted with
the devices, such as ones in the Minuteman

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:54.099
Silos, were installed under the close scrutiny
of Robert McNamara, JFK’s Secretary of Defence.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.200
However, The Strategic Air Command greatly
resented McNamara’s presence and almost

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.489
as soon as he left, the code to launch the
missile’s, all 50 of them, was set to 00000000.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.450
Oh, and in case you actually did forget the
code, it was handily written down on a checklist

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.930
handed out to the soldiers.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.060
As Dr. Bruce G. Blair, who was once a Minuteman
launch officer, stated:

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.079
Our launch checklist in fact instructed us,
the firing crew, to double-check the locking

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.469
panel in our underground launch bunker to
ensure that no digits other than zero had

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.189
been inadvertently dialed into the panel.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.200
This ensured that there was no need to wait
for Presidential confirmation that would have

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.920
just wasted valuable Russian nuking time.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.859
To be fair, there was also the possibility
that command centers or communication lines

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.950
could be wiped out, so having a bunch of nuclear
missiles sitting around un-launchable because

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.799
nobody had the code was seen as a greater
risk by the military brass than a few soldiers

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.049
simply deciding to launch the missiles without
proper authorization.

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.639
Dr. Blair, whose resume to date is far too
long to write out here, is the one who broke

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.299
this “8 zeros” news to the world in his
2004 article “Keeping Presidents in the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.309
Nuclear Dark.”

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.969
He also outlined the significant disconnect
between the nation’s elected leaders and

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.590
the military when it came to nuclear weapons
during the Cold War.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.449
Dr. Blair had previously made waves in 1977
when he wrote another article entitled “The

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.840
Terrorist Threat to World Nuclear Programs“.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.770
He had first attempted to communicate the
serious security problems at the nuclear silos

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.400
to congressmen starting around 1973.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.020
When that information fell on mostly deaf
ears, he decided to outline it for the public

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.180
in this 1977 article where he described how
just four people acting in tandem could easily

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.780
activate a nuclear launch in the silos he
had worked in.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.860
Further, amongst other things, the PAL system
McNamara had touted was barely in operation

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.610
and thus launches could be authorised by anyone
without Presidential authority.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.140
He also noted how virtually anyone who asked
for permission to tour the launch facility

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.759
was granted it with little to no background
checks performed.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.270
It is, perhaps, not coincidence that the PAL
systems were all activated and the codes changed

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.300
the same year this article was published.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.180
So to recap, for around 20 years, the Strategic
Air Command went out of their way to make

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.090
launching a nuclear missile as easy, and quick,
as possible.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.419
To be fair, they had their reasons, such as
the fact that the soldiers in the silos in

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.190
the case of a real nuclear war may have needed
to be able to launch the missiles without

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.530
being able to contact anyone on the outside.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.940
That said, their actions were in direct violation
of the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, the

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.090
President of the United States, during a time
of extreme nuclear tension.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.379
Further, not activating this safeguard and
lax security ensured that with very little

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.949
planning, someone with three friends who had
a mind to, could have started World War III.

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.419
We don’t even think that could pass for
a bad conspiracy theory film plot, but history

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:12.650
is so often stranger than fiction!
