00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.000
Have you ever thought about
how naive it is to just use

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.120
the free Wi-Fi at cafes
and similar public places?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.849
You are trusting the store
owner to not do anything dodgy.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.429
And you're trusting that every
other person currently using

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.800
the Wi-Fi hotspot
is a good person.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600
Not only can they
listen to your traffic--

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.059
you are broadcasting over
radio waves, after all--

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.000
but they could also tamper
with the data you receive.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.701
This is a harmless change.

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:25.410
But what if you wanted
to check your bank

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.000
account on a public Wi-Fi?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.910
Think about every other person
being able to read or change

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.629
your data.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.600
We definitely don't want that.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.250
HTTPS is a way to protect
you and your users

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.710
from malicious cafe
owners and visitors.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.870
As a web developer,
HTTPS is even more

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:41.579
important since
all modern browsers

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.229
API's are only available if your
website is secured with HTTPS.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.000
To exploit the full
potential of the web,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.399
you need to start
using HTTPS, and not

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.399
just for the log-in page,
but every single page.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.530
Knowing a web page
is using HTTPS

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.149
will give your
users peace of mind

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.250
in these kinds of public places.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.229
How can you tell if a
website is using HTTPS,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.569
and how can you tell if
a website is using HTTPS

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.319
correctly, and how can you
use HTTPS on your own website?

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.889
That's what this
lesson is about.
