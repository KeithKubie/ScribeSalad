00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.150
Surveys show that most people want to die
“quickly, in their sleep, and without notice”

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.679
but the odds of that happening for you are
incredibly low. So, when the time comes, how

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.170
are you most likely to die?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.770
In 1901 the average life expectancy of humans
was 31 years old, and in just over 100 years

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.020
that average has gone up to 71. If you live
in a developed nation like France or Canada,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.720
you’ll likely liver closer to 82, while
developing or majority world countries like

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.580
Rwanda age to 64 on average.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.510
And many of these people die in weird ways,
including 27 people from selfie-related accidents

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.550
in 2015. One man died of heart failure and
exhaustion after playing Starcraft for 50

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.879
hours on end, and annually 100 people die
in Russia from falling icicles. Not to mention

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.629
about 70 children will choke to death on hot
dogs every year.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.300
But if we use the United States as an example
of the western world, we had over 318 million

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.890
people living in 2014, of which more than
2.6 million died. Almost half of these people

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.350
died of heart disease or cancer, which is
much different than 100 years ago when most

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.500
people died from tuberculosis and influenza.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Scientific advancements such as antibiotics
and vaccines have allowed us to die less often

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
of the flu or TB, and even decreased how often
we die of cancer. In the 1970’s the survival

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.360
rate from cancer was only 50% - today that
has increased to 68% with 15.5 million cancer

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590
survivors alive in the US today. Thanks SCIENCE!

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.539
Unfortunately both heart disease and cancer
aren’t ‘sudden killers’ and involve

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.869
mostly long, drawn out deaths. In fact, 60%
of deaths in hospital are attributed to one

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.611
of these, with 1 in 10 of those individuals
being in a hospital for a month or more. Of

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:53.579
course, sudden deaths do happen, with 136,053
people dying of unintentional injuries or

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.440
accidents in 2014, in the US.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.571
The media can also affect our fear and anxiety
of death from strange causes. After all, not

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:07.469
one person died of a shark attack in the US
during 2014, but 38 people were killed by

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.290
dogs that year. Many fear biking within a
city, but you’re more likely to die walking

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.570
as a pedestrian, with 6,200 pedestrians killed,
and only 900 killed in bike accidents. For

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.550
every 1 person that dies in a terrorist attack,
80 will die from alcoholism.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.209
In fact, a majority of terrorist activity
in the west is caused by lone wolf attackers,

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.849
of which 80% were not islamic fundamentalists,
but instead political extremists, nationalist,

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.959
racial and religious supremacists. On a worldwide
scale in 2015, 78% of all terrorists deaths

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.459
occurred in just five countries: Afghanistan,
Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.190
Where you live has a big impact on how you’re
likely to die too; in the 34 poorest countries

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.910
you’re mostly likely to die of respiratory
problems - not from cigarettes, but from ingesting

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.550
smoke while cooking. Females in Japan are
less likely to die of heart disease, and live

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.630
to 87 years old on average, compared to 80
years old for American females. This is often

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.360
attributed to the Japanese diet.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.120
In the future, we will likely not only live
longer, but potentially know exactly how and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.370
when we’ll die. In fact, a recent computer
software has been developed that has been

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.519
shown to estimate how and when you will die
with 96% accuracy, based on medical history,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.570
lifestyle and many other factors. The question
is - do you want to know how and when you’ll

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.659
die? Let us know in the comments below.
