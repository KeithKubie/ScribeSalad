00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.080
So then let's move to the next most complex version

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.790
of behavioral modeling called sequential systems. In sequential systems and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.398
concurrent systems that we'll get to, the main difference from common

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:19.250
[UNKNOWN] systems is that there's history or memory of what happened before.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.390
You were in a previous state and based upon that state and whatever events occur

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.510
you move to a new state. Systems like this are sometimes called finite state

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.210
systems because we're going to limit the number of states that they can have.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.350
To a finite number. Okay, and if you recall from your theory course we're going

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.945
to take advantage of finite state machines as a way of doing the modelling.
