I'm perspirin'' like a pig!

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.759
Do people even say that anymore?

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.759
JACKIE
*gagging* No.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:07.759
No they don't.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.080
TRACE
Salty.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.130
JACKIE
So gross.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.180
 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.580

Hey there sweaters, Trace and Jackie here

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.580
for DNews!

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.580
Welcome Jackie!

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.580
JACKIE
Thanks!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.400
Deodorant, the bane of the absent-minded person's
existence.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.540
How many times have you left the house and
forgotten to put on deodorant?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.590
All good?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.170
Gross.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.070
The antiperspirant-deodorant market topped
18 billion dollars last year.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.520
That's a lot of pits.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Including yours.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.500
But do you really know what you're slathering
on your skin?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.740
TRACE
The first deodorant was patented in 1888,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.970
with a goal to help uptight Victorians stop
worrying about their body odor.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.640
But the odor wasn't really their fault.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340
It was BACTERIA!.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.340
Lemme back up though.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
On your skin, you have between two and five
million sweat glands; they come in two flavors:

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.910
eccrine and apocrine.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.370
Sweat is mostly water, but not entirely.
JACKIE

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.180
The eccrine glands excrete primarily H2O,
but the apocrine glands (located on your scalp,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
in your crotch, and under your arms) put out
a thicker fluid with fatty acids, urea and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.430
ammonia (protein byproducts).

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.930
TRACE
Once the sweat is on your skin, bacteria go

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.370
to town on it, chomping and eating up all
those proteins and pooping out stinky chemicals

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.290
like trans-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid 
-- which is the main chemical that makes humans

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.570
stank.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.320
Most animal funk is used to tell other animals
different things.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.799
For example dogs can be trained to smell low
blood sugar in diabetics, people can tell

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.380
what you've eaten by your sweat, and chemosignals
can reveal emotions, like if you're stressed,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.380
or happy.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.431
JACKIE
But, at some point, we decided we wanted to

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.920
cover up the sweaty informational smell.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.380
Even before deodorants as we know them, people
would perfume or cologne up to cover their

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.380
distinctive odor!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.390
TRACE
The first deodorant, called Mum, is from the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.340
late 19th century and it allegedly used zinc
oxide -- a byproduct of zinc smelting to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.030
control bacterial growth.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.120
Fewer bacteria, less smell.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.860
JACKIE
Antiperspirants were also invented in the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.420
early 1900s and used alcohol and aluminum
chloride.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.840
The alcohol would evaporate leaving behind
Al-Cl-3, which, according to the American

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.810
Chemical Society, would stop up those eccrine
glands, cutting sweat production.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.079
TRACE
But remember, it's the apocrine glands that

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.179
excrete the stinky, bacteria-buffet.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.669
Which is why most products combine antiperspirant
and deodorant.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.999
JACKIE
They plug the eccrine and keep the bacteria

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:16.999
off the apocrine!

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.430
But, like anything, there are consequences
for messing with bacteria in our underarms.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.599
TRACE
Deodorants and antiperspirants control bacterial

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.749
populations.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.940
Some contain the now-enemy-of-the-FDA: triclosan;
an antibacterial agent that's helping cause

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.309
the rise of superbugs.

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.549
JACKIE
Others contain preservatives called parabens,

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.819
which, if they get into your bloodstream through
razor nicks or other open cuts, have possible

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.959
estrogen-like properties, and are connected
to breast cancer tumors.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.239
TRACE
All-natural deodorants cover the little buggers

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.870
with essential oils, salts, or alum, but whether
they work depends a more on the person, and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.870
their situation.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.120
JACKIE
But, before you say, YOU FORGOT.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
No.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.760
Antiperspirants themselves do not cause breast
cancer.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
No.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760
Nope.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760
No.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760
No.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760
TRACE
A study of nearly 1600 people in the Journal

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.139
of the National Cancer Institute, found no
evidence whatsoever of antiperspirant or deodorant

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.169
increasing the risk of breast cancer.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.400
JACKIE
What they can do is alter your microbiome

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.269
-- the bacteria that live on us all, sometimes
helping us live healthier lives.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.150
A study in PeerJ looked at the microbiome
of a small number of people who used deodorants

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.439
and antiperspirants, and found people who
used antiperspirants were altering their armpit

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.439
microbiome!

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.909
TRACE
Once people stopped using antiperspirant or

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.689
deodorant, the number of staphylococcal bacteria
skyrocketed!

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.859
JACKIE
… In comparison to those who didn't use

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.540
any Anti-Ps or Dee-odes, I'm still working
on that.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.559
TRACE
I don't know what to think about that.

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:35.900
What does that mean?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.900
No idea.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.669
The study was ridiculously tiny, but it does
show daily hygiene can mess with bacteria

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.779
in unknown ways.

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.629
JACKIE
The researchers said, quote "We have no idea

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.909
what effect, if any, this has on our skin
and on our health.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:49.909
Is it beneficial?

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.980
Is it detrimental?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.629
We really don’t know at this point."

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.749
As you all like to say, more research is needed.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.889
The thing is, you don't actually need deodorant.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.949
Some people don't produce the chemical that
bacteria eats to make smelly by-products!

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.409
And you'd never know if you're one of those
people, unless you stop deodorizing.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.139
TRACE
Or if you have dry earwax.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.139
JACKIE
What?

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.599
TRACE
Of the two percent of the human population

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.219
who don't have the gene for stinkiness, that
same gene gives people "wet" earwax.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.359
If you have dry, flaky earwax, you probably
don't need deodorant.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.030
JACKIE
I have to go find a cotton swab.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.259
 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.819
Look, everyone wants to smell awesome, but

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:25.819
what about pheromones…

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.000
These incredible chemicals allegedly tell
people all about you… through the power

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of smell.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.539
This is assuming humans can sense pheromones
at all.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.340
Have I incited enough excitement and doubt?

TRACE Are you one of those two percent that don't
need deodorant?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.150
JACKIE
Or do you just think you are?

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.400
