00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, how do we use F = ma? Well, let's think of Galileo.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He taught us how to describe motion mathematically.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He discovered that all objects one earth fall at a constant acceleration--10 m/sÂ².

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He knew that a free-falling object's distance covered is proportional to time squared.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He sort of answered the how of motion.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Newton, on the other hand, taught us that it's forces that cause motion,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and he represented that with an equation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He sort of answered the why of motion or at least began to answer the why.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, unfortunately, Galileo died shortly after Newton was born,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but Udacity has recently uncovered a series of time traveling text messages

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
between Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We were able to recover one screen shot from this incredibly historic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and terribly anachronistic text conversation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Newton starts by thanking Galileo for giving him some shoulders to stand on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
"No problem," says Galieleo. Wants to know why.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Newton, of course, is getting a little cocky.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Galileo is impressed. Newton tells him about F = ma.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Galileo, of course, immediately understands the consequences.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And then Newton--oh no, we got cut off there.

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I guess we'll have to extrapolate and figure the rest out ourselves.
