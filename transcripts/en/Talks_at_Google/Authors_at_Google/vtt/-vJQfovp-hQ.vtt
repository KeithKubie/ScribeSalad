00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.610
HAL VARIAN: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm Hal Varian.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.480
I'm the chief economist
here at Google.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.760
And we economists like
to stick together,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.690
so I brought you a
reinforcement today.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.270
Professor Ian Goldin
was a founding director

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.480
of the Oxford Martin
School from September 2006

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.490
to September 2016.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.470
He's currently the Oxford
University Professor

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.710
of Globalization and
Development and Director

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.620
of the Oxford Martin Program
on Technological and Economic

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.680
Change.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.550
And he's also a senior fellow
at the Oxford Martin school

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.910
and a professorial fellow
at the Balliol College,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.770
University of Oxford.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.660
From 2003 to 2006, he was Vice
President of the World Bank,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.047
and prior to that, the bank's
Director of Development Policy.

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:53.130
And he served in the bank's
senior management team

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.130
and led the bank's
collaboration with the United

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.340
Nations and other partners
as well as with key countries

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.482
as a Director of the
Development Project,

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.690
he played a pivotal role in
the research and strategy

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.010
to tend to the bank.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
There's much, much more, but
I'm going to stop at that point,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.090
because I know you are anxious
to hear what Ian has to say.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.480
And there will be questions
afterwards, a few questions

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.670
from me, a few
questions from the Dory,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.840
and of course,
people who are here.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.590
So Ian.

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.250
IAN GOLDIN: Thank you very much.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.560
It's a huge pleasure
to be at Google

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.400
and to be able to talk about my
new book, "Age of Discovery,"

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.970
in the context of the
tumultuous changes in the world

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.210
and try and make sense
of this incredible time

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.590
that we live in.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.500
It's a time-- can I have
the first video running--

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.320
it's a time of magic,
in many respects.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.230
And just spending the
last couple of hours here

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
and getting a sense
of some of the things.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.660
And I'm sure there's many,
many others that I'm not

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.280
aware of that are
happening here.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.700
One can't but feel that one
is in a period of discovery.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.260
An age of discovery which is
unprecedented in human history,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.680
which will lead to
changes for the better

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.890
for many, many people
around the world.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.450
The way I think
about this period

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.700
is not as the Fourth
Industrial Revolution,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.860
which I think diminishes, in an
extent, the way in which this

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.010
is transforming the world and
the pace and scale of what's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.760
happening.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.400
I think about it more
as a Renaissance moment.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.710
Because that was a
tumultuous moment.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.110
That was a period
that took Europe

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.050
from being one of the most
backward places in the world,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.040
in 1450, to by far the
most advanced place

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.580
within an 80-year period.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.170
A period that changed everything
in Europe permanently and then

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.980
around the world and
that was associated

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.740
with the most extraordinary
advances in science,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.100
in arts, in perspective that
the world had ever known.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.390
It was driven, like
our revolution,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.250
by an information revolution.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.080
Then it was the Gutenberg press.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.900
Before that, a very
small number of people,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.810
a very small share of
the European population

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.650
could read or write.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.330
Books were extremely expensive
handwritten manuscripts.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.580
And it was really the
clergy, the Catholic church,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.260
that had monopoly of knowledge.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
They told people what
to think, how to think,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.940
and of course, in
that environment,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.600
it was impossible to
really do science.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.840
What this revolution did was
allowed an exponential growth

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.050
in information flows,
rather similar to what we've

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.400
seen in the last 20 years.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.700
Over 25 million books were
printed in a 50-year period.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.370
Billions of political
pamphlets, advertisements,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.950
short treatises, and so on.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.070
And we celebrate,
today, 500 years later,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.090
the outcome of that
information revolution.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.650
Of course, the fundamental
transformation of art,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.790
of Botticelli's,
Michelangelo's, da Vinci's.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.860
They changed perspective
in remarkable ways

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.490
and symbolized people from being
objects whose fate was ordained

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.260
to creators of their own fate.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.700
And that was the dramatic
change that happened in the way

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.824
that philosophy and
art was understood.

00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:21.240
But it was also a
time, of course,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.550
of scientific invention
and revolution.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.360
Copernicus discovering that we
went around the sun, not being

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.830
the center of the universe.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.920
Fundamental challenges to what
the church and authority had

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.940
said, and of course, compass
and other designs which

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.840
allowed the voyages
of discovery,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.960
including the discovery
of the Americas

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.820
and total circumnavigation.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.100
Changing commerce and
creating globalization 1.0.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.200
[? Descent ?] and mediating,
in very rapid ways,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.940
the old flows in
places like Venice,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.720
which had been at the center
of them, finding their prices

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.620
dropped by 50% over a
two to three year period,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.840
as the new ways of getting
to the East were discovered.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.080
Our time is associated with
political and technical

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.450
transformation, which is much
more global, much more rapid,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.830
but is having, I think,
an echo of that effect.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.130
The Berlin Wall, for me,
symbolizes this coming down

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.760
of barriers.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.110
Physical barriers, political
and ideological barriers, and we

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.570
moved to a world which was
very fragmented in the '80s

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.460
to a world now which
is hyper-integrated.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.920
And this hyper-integration
brings very many

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.620
different possibilities
and is a really, I

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.050
believe, an engine
of change which

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.940
is more rapid than at
any period in history.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.390
And that's why today is
the slowest day we'll

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.670
know for the rest of our lives.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.590
The innovation machine has
been put on a higher level

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.680
than it ever has
been in history.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.650
I was living in Paris
when this wall came down.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.485
I'm a South African.

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:03.860
I didn't think I would ever
be able to go to South Africa

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.180
again in my lifetime.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.810
I was involved in the
anti-apartheid struggle.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.897
And I was working at
the OECD in Paris,

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:11.480
and I thought it was
an amazing thing,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.100
but I didn't
imagine for a minute

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.890
that it would
transform my own life.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.350
Of course, what we
know is that two months

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.860
later, as a result
of that process,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.990
Nelson Mandela was
released from prison.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.900
He came to Paris.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.900
He asked me to be
his economic advisor,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.760
to go back to South
Africa and run

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.370
the State Bank, which I did.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.700
And recognize in that
process, in retrospect,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.880
that things that seem totally
unconnected to our lives

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.200
in this new
hyper-integrated world

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.280
will touch them in
intimate new ways.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.150
And that's going to happen at
a global sphere to all of us.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.960
And so where globalization,
by which I mean integration,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.710
flows across national borders,
of goods, services, products,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.800
but most significantly
of ideas, means

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.670
that we move into a
different period in history.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.190
And this has been
accelerated greatly

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.380
by the parallel
development, of course,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.690
of the web at the same time
as the Berlin Wall came down.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.240
And scientific
discovery, exemplified

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.420
in the Hubble
spacecraft, which was

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.160
the beginning of a new era in
the same way as the Renaissance

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.860
was.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.880
We're now 27 years later in a
world of a total integration.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.920
A new nervous
system of the world,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.940
where we can experience and
empathize and see things

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.120
at the other end of
the world in real time,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.640
whether it's a birthday
party celebration,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.770
or whether it's understanding
the impact of a climate event,

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.250
or war.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.820
In this extraordinary
exponential growth,

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.800
we've lost our innocence.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.530
We know what is
happening everywhere

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.406
in dramatic new ways.

00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:01.821
And so it's no
accident that we've

00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.340
become aware of climate change.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.370
We've become aware
of things that

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.340
were simply unknown in their
depth and scale before.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.940
And with that comes
new responsibilities,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.270
new potential to unlock some
of the greatest challenges

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.810
humanity has ever faced,
but also new potential

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.120
to destabilize.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.600
We've become a complex, dynamic
system as a global community.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.580
And that means that attribution,
cause and effect, understanding

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.470
what is going to
shape our future

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.100
is more difficult than at
any moment in history because

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.200
of the number of
actors and participants

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.390
and the speed of evolution.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.070
Prediction is more
difficult than ever before.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.850
Part of the
excitement, of course,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.640
is how rapidly these
technologies have spread.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.940
And that's, again,
very different

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.120
to all previous
revolutions of technology

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.180
and very different to
the Renaissance as well.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.200
So we move from a world of
only about 200 million people

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.520
sharing the same data and
information in the '80s,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.710
to a world today of around
6 billion people sharing

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.930
information and data.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.940
We move from a world
where there were

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.450
only 2 billion people
literate, in the late '80s,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.810
to a world of 6 and 1/2
billion literate people today.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.990
And if you believe in that
literacy and education

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.545
capability as a
driver of change,

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:29.380
there are 4 and 1/2
billion more drivers

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.010
of change over this very
short period of time.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.630
I believe in the
random distribution

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.770
of exceptional talent.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.970
Call it genius if you want.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.510
There's a lot more Mozarts,
Shakespeares, and Einsteins

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.120
out there that will emerge
from the streets of Sao

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.210
Paolo, [INAUDIBLE],,
Mumbai, or Shanghai,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.060
as well as, of course,
this neighborhood, that

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.350
will change our lives.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.749
But it's not individuals
that bring change.

00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:55.290
It's people learning
from each other.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.310
It's sparks, it's
learning, which

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.650
is a cooking of lots
of different ideas,

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.340
and often ingredients
which are surprising,

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.200
that is happening in a
totally different way.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.700
Because people are
learning faster,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.326
there's also a lot more of us.

00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:13.200
Ideas have traveled,
which are leading people

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.850
to live longer, healthy ideas.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.200
Very simple ideas, like smoking
kills you, wearing a condom

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.860
protects you from
HIV, ideas like that.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.110
And very complex ideas,
like those embedded

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.510
in the vaccines,
cures for cancer,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.740
medicines going
around the world.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.310
With this we have this
extraordinary, most rapid

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.380
growth in population that
world has ever known.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.900
2 billion more people.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.280
And it's that as well
which shapes our future.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800
Because as people
escape poverty,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.500
and the most extraordinary thing
about this period of history

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.330
is that despite the increase
in the world's population of 2

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.700
billion, there are 300 million
less desperately poor people.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.890
That's never happened
historically before.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.840
This integration of
the world, the spread

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.560
of markets, this growth of jobs,
of opportunities and knowledge,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.340
fundamentally, has led to the
most rapid reduction in poverty

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.540
the world's ever known.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.550
And with that as well, the most
rapid urbanization process.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.590
When people come together,
they change their lives.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.460
They get the means
to change their lives

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.060
and their possibilities.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.630
Far from the world
becoming more flat,

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.010
it's becoming much
more mountainous,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.790
meaning place matters
more than ever.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.480
And you see that here
in Mountain View,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.270
and you see it in Mumbai,
you see it in London,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.660
you see it in other
dynamic cities.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.370
The ratio of incomes to house
prices is at record high.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.540
And that's because place
matters more than ever.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:55.020
In this process, we not only
find huge leaps in development

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.880
and possibility, but also
the spillovers of our actions

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.060
become more and more acute.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.930
And it's that
spillover effect that

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.720
is in tension with markets.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.910
It's the markets and
the opportunities which

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.160
have created these
possibilities,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.800
but now the questions are how
do we engage with markets?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.140
How do we tamper, if we
want, with the signals?

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.360
How do we hold back to
ensure that the externalities

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.730
or spillover effects
of development,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:35.050
the commons challenges,
don't destroy all the gains.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.750
The unexpected consequences
of globalization

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.500
is not a new thing.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.890
We know that the
voyages of discovery

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.110
that came to the Americas
led to the death of most

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.700
Native Americans.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.300
We know that the voyagers,
when they went back,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.460
brought syphilis and
other diseases that

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:00.640
killed many hundreds of
thousands of the Europeans.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.670
The idea that integration
and globalization

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.550
brings risk as
well as opportunity

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.610
is one that we
forget at our peril.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.920
And it's not simply that
it brings that risk,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.110
but it also brings
the risk of extremism,

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.440
and that's one of the key
lessons of the Renaissance.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.190
Although we celebrate it for
its amazingly rapid advance,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.590
in fact, it was
socially and politically

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.470
a disastrous period.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.830
It was associated
with rising extremism.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.920
And after this flourishing
of diversity and tolerance

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.640
in a city like Florence, we had
Savonarola, an extremist monk,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.960
deposing the Medicis
and basically creating

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.050
a religious republic
of extreme views.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.630
Hounding out diversity,
gays, Muslims, Jews,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.000
that had gone to the city
because it was the place

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.030
to be for anyone that
really wanted to be

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.460
at the forefront of creativity.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.900
And that creativity happened
because of the diversity.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.690
35% of the population of
Florence in its heyday

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.190
was foreign.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.980
This reaction was because of
the corruption of the church.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.100
You could buy your way to
heaven with indulgences.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.730
You could pay for people to
go on pilgrimages for you.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.790
As well as the fact that the
benefits of globalization

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.680
were not seen by most people.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.290
The gold that came
back from the New World

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.880
did not benefit
most people, nor did

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.700
the spices and other things.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.390
And of course, the scribes
were put out of work.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.040
What you had in
that process then

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.930
was a pushback, a
fracturing of the church.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.030
Inquisitions and religious wars
that were fought across Europe

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.610
and spilled over, indeed,
into the corridors

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.490
of my college, Baliol, at
Oxford, where people were

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.350
killed in these religious wars.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.210
One of the most terrifying
echoes of that period today

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.270
is the hounding of
science and intellectuals.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:12.850
The arrest, the denunciation
of expertise and of knowledge.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:17.800
And the recreation of ideology
and religion as being what's

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.870
needed to guide us.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.430
Now, fast forward, we
see the similar risks

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.400
emerging from globalization
2.0, our time.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.790
The interconnectedness
does not only

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.880
connect good things and the most
extraordinary opportunities,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.230
but also new risks.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.270
The swine flu that
starts in Mexico City

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.660
is in 160 countries in 30 days.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.180
And the Emerging Infections
group in the Oxford Martin

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.410
School, which I founded,
it's a group of 350 faculty

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.140
from across the whole
university, medicine, sciences,

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.220
social sciences, humanities,
coming out of their disciplines

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.450
to work on interdisciplinary
problem solving.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.660
So our group working
on emerging infections

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.770
finds the swine
flu spread exactly

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.860
replicates airline traffic.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.920
The super spreaders of
the goods of globalization

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.840
also the super spreaders
of the bads, in this case,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.160
airport hubs.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.810
Another key lesson of
that Renaissance period

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.650
which has a much
amplified echo today

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.150
is the role of individuals.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.200
And it was Savonarola
using the printing press

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.260
to spread ideas which
challenged authority.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.190
Small groups of individuals.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.370
And that's what
we've seen today.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.500
One area where this
has been exemplified,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.730
as always, finance is at the
frontiers of globalization,

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.380
is in the banking system.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.250
Barings Bank was
established in 1762,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.340
and it existed for
over 240 years,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.340
withstanding the most
extraordinary technological,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.040
economic, and political
transformations in the world,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.970
when one day, the management
woke up and discovered

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.400
that a kid using new
technology had bankrupted them.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.609
Nick Leeson.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.010
This potential that the
new technologies and this

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.150
interconnectedness gives
to new asymmetries,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.520
where small groups
or single individuals

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.369
can bring down very,
very complex systems.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.770
The one I worry most
about is biopathogens.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.829
For exponentially
declining prices,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.150
people can build measles,
smallpox, et cetera,

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.200
put it in a drone, and
fly it down our streets.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.720
This potential to
cause mass havoc

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.340
is one that is
spreading in many areas,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.340
not least in the
cyber sphere, which,

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.800
of course, as the nervous
system of our new world,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.600
is absolutely integral.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.680
But it's also being used by
extremist forces, as it was,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.820
in the Renaissance.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.010
ISIS has become the largest
recruiter of foreign fighters

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.310
since the Spanish Civil
War using social media.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.100
So how to manage the
freedoms and the integration

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.340
in a way that manages
the complexity and builds

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.240
a resilience is absolutely key.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.720
Finance, as always, at the
forefront of globalization.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.930
It has the resources to
invest in new technologies,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.510
and it's a
hyper-integrated system.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.560
What we learned from
the financial system,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.670
of course, is that the best
system in the world of expert

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.620
management, that's finance.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.660
Just think about our
national governments,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.520
the central banks, like
the Federal Reserve

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.440
or the treasury,
in all countries

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.430
are the most sophisticated,
best staffed, best paid

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.430
of our national institutions.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.000
And at the global level,
the IMF is similarly so

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.370
but is in a different
league to the UN

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.500
agencies and others in its
expertise, data, and power.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.760
And yet, this expert system,
with over 20,000 PhDs,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760
many of them coming from
institutions that Hal

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.470
and I would be proud
to have given students

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.510
to these institutions,
failed dismally.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.740
A very narrow mandate.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.540
Financial stability.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.770
So much brainpower.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.510
So much pay.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.710
No wonder people say, we
don't trust authority.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.240
We don't trust experts.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.970
When the most expert
of the global systems

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.290
failed so dismally.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.124
Would we have the
politics in the US today

00:19:22.124 --> 00:19:23.790
if there hadn't been
a financial crisis?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.050
Would we have Brexit?

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.460
Would we have rising
extremism as we've seen it?

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.810
I think not.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.570
I think, as much
as anything, what

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.750
we're seeing is a
failure of experts

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.420
to be able to anticipate
and understand

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.630
this complex dynamic
system, and it's operating

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.620
in many, many domains.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.610
Another key failure of
globalization of this period

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:52.250
has been, as in the
Renaissance, rising inequality.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.740
And the reason is that when
things change more rapidly,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.320
people get left
behind more quickly.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.990
When you look at the share
of the top 1% in income

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.620
distribution or wealth
across the OECD countries,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.250
there's a rising
trend everywhere.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.360
Most acute in the US,
but also significant

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.760
in many, many other countries.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.740
And so a key
question is how do we

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.240
have a more inclusive system?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.890
How do we ensure that people see
globalization as good for them,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.140
not as something that's
locking them out?

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.510
When you look at
the data that people

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.660
like Angus Deaton and Anne Case
have assembled, and others,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.350
you see that in towns in
the Midwest in the US,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.960
the life expectancy of people
is lower than their parents.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.030
Their job mobility is
lower than their parents.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.340
Their unemployment rates are
higher than their parents.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.800
No wonder people don't
believe that the system's

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.150
working for them.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.520
They want to go back
to something which

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.690
they think will help them.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.220
And this is a global trend,
where place and skill matters

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.350
more than ever.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.280
So how we create a society
which is more inclusive,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.050
and how we think about
these issues really

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.670
does matter, not
[INAUDIBLE] to the future.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.610
This will become
more and more acute--

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.610
it's been a pleasure to be able
to talk to Hal and the people

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.660
here about this--

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.270
as we move to a
world of automation.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.970
You might have seen work that
a group I created in the Oxford

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.870
Martin school has done,
suggesting that 47% of US jobs

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.660
are vulnerable to machine
intelligence over the next 20

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.980
years.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.540
And a higher share
of countries like

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.800
China, where there is more
routine and rural-based jobs.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.360
Now, these numbers
are contested,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.190
and there's a big
debate around them,

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.350
and of course, we don't
know about the new jobs.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.180
This is a vital discussion.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.496
But where the jobs
will be, how one

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.537
will have the skills, et
cetera, are significant.

00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:41.245
And one of the amazing
things that Google

00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:43.640
has done in recent
weeks is, of course,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.150
allocate a big, big
assignment of money

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.785
to building these
skills and capacities.

00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:53.160
For developing countries,
there's a particular challenge.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.170
Because our model
of development is

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:59.190
that countries go from basic
agriculture and raw materials

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.260
through a stage of
development which

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.300
involves semi-skilled work.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.550
Routine, rules-based
work, whether it's

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.760
in manufacturing of
textiles or other products,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.640
or whether it's in call
centers, or whether it's

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.070
in back offices.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.950
And the question
is, what happens

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.740
if the middle rungs of
a development ladder

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.330
are removed by
artificial intelligence?

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.230
We don't know the answers
to these questions,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.100
but they're questions
we have to explore.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.560
The sense that the
system is evolving

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.270
more rapidly, that there's
growing inequality and growing

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.100
risk is based on real concerns.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.560
These are not imagined.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.380
The politicians play
into these and are

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.790
able to raise fears and suggest,
I believe, totally falsely,

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.180
that a world of higher
protection, of keeping out

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.880
foreigners, will
be a better world,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.420
and that we can somehow return
to an imagined past that was

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.450
not better, but they say was.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.570
The reason this is
profoundly misguided

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.900
is because as we go forward,
we will more and more

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.720
have to manage
collectively, together,

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.780
these challenges, because
of the spillover effects.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.180
Whether it's examples
like the example

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.960
we'll be familiar with of
the North Atlantic cod,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.580
or whether it's the newer
things, like climate

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.670
change, which is a
dramatic global threat,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.930
coordination of an
integrated system

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.020
becomes more and
more significant.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:40.600
And working out collective
responses and responsibilities.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.880
Of course, nature
knows no price.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.681
The rhino don't reproduce more
when their horns are worth

00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:46.180
more.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.620
What economists call
inelastic supply.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.620
And how we allocate these scarce
resources in a world where

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.010
rising incomes gives
people the capabilities

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.130
to demand more and more.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.226
One answer that will
not be sustainable

00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:01.600
is that if you
have enough money,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.740
you can do what you want.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.390
Buy the rhino horn
or anything else.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.700
Of course, we also know
that ecological systems

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.200
have natural thresholds.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.800
It's fine if 200 million people
in the world take antibiotics,

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.410
but if 2 billion people
take them, none of them

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.060
are likely to be effective.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.610
And so how one
manages in a world

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.120
with increasing spillovers,
where our decisions, whatever

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.580
they are, affect others, and
others' decisions affect us,

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.480
because we're connected,
because we've escaped poverty,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.840
it becomes more and
more significant.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.300
So we're not simply
connected, we are entangled.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.276
There is no optionality
in this world.

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:40.650
There is no wall
high enough that

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.220
will keep out climate change,
that will keep out a pandemic.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:49.160
But what it will keep out is the
cooperative ability to manage,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.120
and of course, the
technologies and the people

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.210
that will help us manage.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.930
And so how we go forward with
this is going to be crucial.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.630
I'm optimistic because
we're moving into a world

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.090
where we can draw on
the global talent pool,

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.880
and this is different
to anything in history.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.590
The Renaissance
and the revolutions

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.780
in science and
technology of the past

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.140
were largely driven by white
males out of a very small

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.730
number of countries.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.530
We're now in a
world where we can

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.430
draw on the total capacity
of the human species,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.150
and that is its greatest source
of optimism if you believe,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.690
as I do, in the power
that this unlocks,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.390
and that's why innovation
is accelerating,

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.470
and problem solving, change
making, is accelerating.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.120
But it's a battle of ideas.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.970
It's a battle of
ideas which needs

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.180
to engage scientists,
technologists, and all

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.460
those that believe in progress.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.060
The Oxford Martin
Stem Cell Group

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.510
is amongst many, many in
the world who are doing

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.270
amazing things that
give me optimism.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.500
This is the lab technician's
skin turned into a heart cell.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.160
And the frontiers of
genetics and others

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.830
that can lead us all to believe
that we can live longer,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.000
healthier, and better lives.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.300
There's also massive disruption
happening in politics.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.330
Not only extremism is
growing, the capacity

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.630
of people to recreate, as Macron
did, from absolutely nothing,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:23.640
with no political party at all,
a different alternative view

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.100
is a sign of how easy it's
becoming to change and to be

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.780
a change maker.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.470
One doesn't need the old
authorities, as one didn't when

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.970
the printing press was
developed to create

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.880
a revolution in ideas.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.130
And what we've also seen
is encouraging signals

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.950
that science does matter
and get listened to,

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.440
not least in the
climate agreements.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.200
And of course, we need to
redouble our efforts to make

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.660
sure that they're implemented.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.480
Causes for optimism abound.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.810
There's no problem that one
cannot imagine a solution for.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.220
The question is whether we
as change makers, whether we

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.860
as developers of new capability
are able to amplify the goods

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.170
and dampen the bads to
ensure that as we go forward

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.460
on this extraordinary planet,
this will not be as Lord Martin

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.890
Rees has suggested,
possibly our final century,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.290
it will be the century
that we celebrate,

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.571
as we celebrate the
Renaissance in 500 years' time.

00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:31.070
Thank you.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.480
HAL VARIAN: Thank you very much
for that inspirational talk,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.180
I should say.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.380
But I have a question
about the book.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.140
I read your book, and it
has a very nice structure.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.610
I think people enjoy looking
at this with an exploiting

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.280
or describing the parallels
between the Renaissance

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.810
and today.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.080
And you did this with a
colleague, Chris Kutarna.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.720
Is that right?

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:02.930
IAN GOLDIN: Mhm.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:03.721
A doctoral student.

00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:09.364
HAL VARIAN: Who is a
historian of the Renaissance.

00:28:09.364 --> 00:28:11.030
IAN GOLDIN: No, he's
a political science

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.650
major focusing on China today.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.170
But I just distracted
him, and his supervisor

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.930
didn't like that.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.330
HAL VARIAN: Oh, I see.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.230
So you distracted
him into doing this.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.160
IAN GOLDIN: Yes,
he started as my RA

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.440
and ended up as a coauthor
because he's so brilliant

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.324
and did so much.

00:28:22.324 --> 00:28:24.740
HAL VARIAN: Well, what I was
interested in is your working

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.910
style.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:30.500
I've written coauthored
books, and everybody

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.940
develops their own
technique for doing this.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.330
I'm curious as to
how you did this.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.400
IAN GOLDIN: So Chris,
who quite remarkably

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.010
managed to get both a
book and his doctorate out

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:50.390
within a year of each other, was
doing his doctorate at Oxford.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:55.810
I asked around for not this
project, the previous project,

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.610
for some professors to
recommend their top students.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.860
We started working together, and
I was deeply impressed by him.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.110
I think the most significant
part of our collaboration

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.120
was that we just
sparked off each other.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.952
And this goes back to this
point of how innovation happens.

00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:13.410
And we had totally
different views.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.970
I'm an economist.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.290
He's an international
relations major.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.030
He worked on China, mainly.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.910
I knew about other places.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:27.620
Our areas of knowledge
do not overlap that much.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.410
But we challenged
each other, and I

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.040
think that was increasingly
useful, particularly as I began

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.870
to respect him more
and more, and he

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.470
became more effective at
challenging me in that.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:44.580
So it was a great process,
and it took a long time,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.154
and it a big worry
for me, because I

00:29:46.154 --> 00:29:48.320
was worried that he would
drop out of his doctorate,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.000
and I would be in deep
trouble if that happened.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.330
But he is smart enough
and well-managed enough

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.530
to really do both.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.470
And the book took a long time,
five years, and his doctorate

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.050
took a long time,
and that was probably

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.145
one expression of that.

00:30:04.145 --> 00:30:06.520
But his doctorate's actually
a very interesting doctorate

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.350
on the Chinese middle class.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.370
And he lived there for two
years while doing that.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.470
HAL VARIAN: Wow.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.279
Involved with the book as well?

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.570
IAN GOLDIN: He kept going back.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.760
He'd come back from
his primary research,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.280
but kept going back to Beijing.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.780
HAL VARIAN: Wow.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.180
So let's switch over to the
substance of the book now.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.930
And you alluded to
this in your talk,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.170
the issue of artificial
intelligence and jobs.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.150
Of course, you might
imagine, here at Google,

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.670
we're very focused
on this question.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.600
And I would say, from my reading
of the existing literature,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.610
there's no consensus.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.030
But what would it take
to create that consensus?

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.980
Or what kind of research
do you think is valuable?

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.570
How can we understand
more of what we

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.960
might encounter in the future?

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.880
IAN GOLDIN:
Remarkably, everything

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.030
is changing so rapidly.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.810
This is a new field of work.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:06.320
We were one of the first
movers in 2013, not long ago,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.760
in bringing out a paper on it.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.850
And there's been a lot
of papers since then,

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.200
but it's a very,
very recent area.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.580
One of the great
challenges, of course,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.420
is that we know a lot
about what's vulnerable,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.330
but we don't know that
the vulnerability will

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.210
lead to loss.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.240
You can have, for example,
supermarket checkout now

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.400
in any supermarket in
the world, but let's say

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.190
in the US, done by a machine.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.870
But you still have
over a million people

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.350
employed in supermarket
checkout because of preferences,

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.070
because of pace of adoption,
because of various other tasks

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.840
that these people do.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.910
And so saying that something
can be done by a machine

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.290
doesn't mean it will be.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.140
The second thing is we have zero
knowledge about the new jobs,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.120
or very close to.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.530
We're very-- even for the next
five years, let alone 10 or 20

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.400
years, and that makes
it very difficult

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.110
to come to a consensus.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.350
There's been very few new
jobs actually being created,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.330
but that could be accelerated.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.760
So I think what we need to do,
and it's one of the reasons

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.790
I'm here, and it's a
great pleasure to be here,

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.760
is we need, I think, to
be creating a community

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.520
of scholars and of others
that think about this issue.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.500
It's a global issue.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.450
Most of the work has
been done with the US,

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.900
because the data statistics
are the best here.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.180
But if we think it's a
big issue for the US,

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.840
it's a much bigger issue
for China or Mexico

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.260
or many other countries.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.970
And as we discussed, we've
got to put this together

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.370
with the demographics, with
the economic geography,

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.140
with the regulatory
environments,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:52.220
with all sorts of other factors
to try and make sense of it.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.540
So it's a long way
of saying we need

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.227
a lot of people working
collaboratively on this

00:32:58.227 --> 00:32:59.060
and coming together.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.650
Academics are
competitive, that's good,

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.847
but to be creatively
competitive, I think, together.

00:33:05.847 --> 00:33:07.930
HAL VARIAN: Over lunch,
we were talking about some

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.370
of these demographic issues.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.590
Of course, there's
this huge impact

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.520
of China's one child policy.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.640
We have a lot of population now.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.150
The workforce is going
to decline dramatically

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.012
in the next couple of decades.

00:33:21.012 --> 00:33:22.720
And one example you
mentioned in the book

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.740
which I think was very
important was the Black Death.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.690
Now, the Black Death
was a terrible event

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.240
that killed a third of
the people in Italy,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.150
but if you were lucky
enough to stay alive,

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.670
your wage went way up.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.150
Your living state went way up.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.110
Feudalism was under
pressure, simply

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.250
because you went from
a surplus of labor,

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.960
really to a dramatic
shortage of labor.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:53.450
And if you look at China, Japan,
South Korea, Germany, Italy,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.780
Spain, on and on and on,
the developed countries

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.880
are going to see declines
in the labor force.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.310
Outright declines.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.454
And maybe they'll have the
same beneficial characteristic

00:34:03.454 --> 00:34:04.120
that we thought.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.494
IAN GOLDIN: I
think that's right.

00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:07.940
And what the intersection of
these forces is going to be

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.315
is interesting.

00:34:09.315 --> 00:34:12.310
Interestingly enough,
China's neighbors,

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:17.830
South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
all that's maybe part of China,

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.870
have lower fertility
rates than it does,

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.080
with no one child policy.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.600
And Germany has an
even lower rate.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.389
So this is absolutely the case.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:32.199
I think real wages will double
in China over the next five

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.719
years or so, driven
by the intersection

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.790
of demographic and
economic forces.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.829
And then you're
going to have AI.

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:42.560
And a key question on the
demographics, of course,

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.500
is how long people will work.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.030
I think we'll end--

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.590
retirement will
stop, and then you

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.690
get in the discussion,
which is a big economics

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.850
discussion, about
where's pensions

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.429
and savings and retirement
money going to come from,

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.160
and what's it going to do to
transfer between the elderly

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.030
and the young.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:02.320
AI has a major role to
play in trying to resolve

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.460
some of these tensions.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.940
And the consequences
in China and the US,

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.900
depending on what you do with
immigration policy, Europe,

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.147
and Africa, will
be very different.

00:35:14.147 --> 00:35:15.730
And so I think this
needs, in the end,

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.910
to be something we look
at at a country level

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.382
and think through in
a much deeper way.

00:35:21.382 --> 00:35:22.340
HAL VARIAN: Absolutely.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.330
If you look at Nigeria,
for example, or India,

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.610
these countries are
actually growing younger

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.440
compared to the
developed world, which

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.210
is growing substantially older.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.450
And productivity.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.770
You alluded to that.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.940
Productivity is the key.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.300
If you have a
smaller labor force,

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.610
and you have a growing
population, which

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.920
is true of many countries,
the only solution

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.820
to maintain living standards
is improvement of productivity.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.550
But then we come to the
productivity puzzle.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.500
Even though we think
we're producing

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.040
all sorts of great technology
and wonderful gadgets

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.879
and services, the economic
statistics disagree.

00:36:02.879 --> 00:36:03.670
What's the problem?

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.120
IAN GOLDIN: [LAUGHS] Well,
I wish I knew the answer.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.460
Maybe I'll get a
Nobel Prize if I do.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.030
It's one of the toughest
economic questions.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.340
And Bob Gordon has posed
this, and many others,

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.060
saying that basically
we don't see--

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.340
we argue, I think you
feel as well, I certainly

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.310
feel, that innovation
is accelerating,

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.830
and yet productivity
is stagnating.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.310
What's going on here?

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.680
So this is a major question.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.100
I think there's a whole
series of reasons for this.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.350
One is measurement.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.050
My iPhone has destroyed the
camera industry, the music

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:44.260
industry, the GPS
industry, and a whole lot

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.630
of other manufacturing
industries.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.800
I feel better off for it.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.480
But the camera manufacturers,
the film manufacturers, the GPS

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.170
manufacturers, are losing out.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.750
So we get negative statistics
out of something like that.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.960
So one is measurement, which
is very, very imperfect

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.930
and doesn't cope with the
digital economy at all.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.810
The second issue
is is innovation

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.060
being concentrated in just
a small part of the economy.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.440
So where we think innovation
is great in genetics and AI

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.440
and everything else, most of
the country is actually dying.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.660
When things change
more rapidly, you

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.170
have to renew your stock of
infrastructure, of plant,

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.280
of everything more rapidly.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.570
And if you don't, it's
increasingly worthless.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.420
And I think that's happening
in a bigger and bigger share

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.710
of businesses.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:36.230
So actually, they are becoming
less productive more rapidly,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.350
because the pace of
change is so rapid.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.610
Another issue is inequality.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.440
Another issue is aging
and demographics,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.780
because these productivity
numbers are aggregates

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.970
for the whole economy.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:50.140
And this goes back to the
point I made about the Midwest.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.910
There are big parts
of the country

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.686
that are not the dynamic cities
where things are really moving.

00:37:55.686 --> 00:37:57.310
And I think what we
need is a much more

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:58.930
nuanced understanding,
and then you

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:00.596
get into the question
of, all right, how

00:38:00.596 --> 00:38:04.172
do you spread the benefits
of productivity more broadly.

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:05.880
HAL VARIAN: And just
to add to your list,

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.338
there are two other
features, which

00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:11.080
is the role of intangibles,
software and design,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.700
where all of the software
for the mobile phone and for,

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.240
in fact, all the--

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.270
it's made here in California.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.400
The hardware, for the
most part, is made abroad.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.610
And splitting those
two pieces out

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.200
with respect to productivity
is very, very tricky.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.140
And I think we
have views on this.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.140
The BLS does their best,
but it it's still a problem.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.140
And the related problem
is, of course, services.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.450
80% of GDP in the
US is services.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.710
Very hard to measure quality
improvements or productivity

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.840
improvements in that area.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:55.130
One proposal to deal
with this changing

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.460
world and the potential of
having unemployed labor--

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.250
I say potential because I
don't think either of us

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.630
believes that that's
a likely outcome.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.120
But one proposal has been
a universal basic income.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.180
That's become popular in
Silicon Valley circles.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.360
What's your view on the UBI?

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.920
IAN GOLDIN: Well, I do
think there will be people,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.070
by the way, unemployed
because of the pace of change.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.030
I think there really are.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.240
And to me, this is about
economic geography.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.050
It's about people being locked
out of the dynamic cities.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.300
You have very low
unemployment in some places

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.560
and very high unemployment
in other places,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.720
but you can't get from--

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.820
those people can't move
to where the jobs are,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.790
and that's a big issue.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.400
I think UBI is not a good idea.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.030
I have four main
objections to it.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:48.470
The first is that unless
it's at a level which

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:53.060
is so high that it becomes
fiscally irresponsible,

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.850
in other words, it blows the
budget of the government,

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.670
in particular, in austerity,
times like now, that's

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.920
difficult to imagine,
it leads to rising

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.240
poverty and inequality.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.130
And the OECD has done
great work on this.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.420
And the simple reason is that
you remove targeted transfers,

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.120
child benefit, housing
benefit, unemployment benefit,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.750
disability benefit, et
cetera, and you substitute

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.340
for that a cash transfer
or a mass transfer

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.090
that everyone in the
country is getting.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.180
It's called universal because
even the billionaires get it.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.160
And the numbers
just don't add up.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.820
The poor people and the people
that need transfers most

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.700
do worse off, and the
OECD is showing this.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.130
The second reason
I don't like it

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.530
is because all the
evidence I've seen

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.660
is that when people
are paid to stay home,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.630
they become very depressed.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.070
They become opioid addicts.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.050
They become alcoholics.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.230
They become socially
dysfunctional.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.600
And we do not want a society
where we're basically

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.590
paying a significant part of
our society to stay at home.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.410
Because people get
status, network, income,

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.030
and many other
things out of work

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.640
which is vital for their
own sense of self-worth

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.760
and community.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.730
The third reason
I don't like it is

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.740
because I think it
postpones a much more

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.580
fundamental conversation about
the future of work, which

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.910
is the value we give to
social work, to creative work,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:19.050
to caring, to volunteerism,
to mentoring, and all of that.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.020
And the fourth
reason I don't like

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.220
it is because I think the
people that are advocating it

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.970
are basically trying to
postpone a deeper debate.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.380
It's their way of
sort of ticking

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.110
a box in their consciousness
and their political agenda

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.390
and saying, don't worry
about all these issues.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.360
We'll look after you.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.740
And I think that's
both paternalistic and

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.710
counterproductive,
because we need something

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.760
else for our societies.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.275
We need a deeper
debate about it.

00:41:45.275 --> 00:41:47.150
And it goes back to the
measurement question

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:52.260
about well being, about status,
about inclusive globalization,

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.240
et cetera.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.070
It's not affordable in the US.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.300
It's even less affordable
in a developing country,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.780
like China or Mexico
or South Africa.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.950
HAL VARIAN: If we look at--

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:08.150
suppose we're right, that we
are seeing a lot of innovation

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:11.570
and more so in the
future, this innovation

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.860
that's created mostly in
the developed countries,

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.880
how will that fit in to
the kind of resources

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.501
available in the less developed
countries, the underdeveloped

00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:23.000
countries?

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.192
Is this going to be bad
news for India and Nigeria?

00:42:29.192 --> 00:42:29.900
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.860
I worry most about Africa.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.090
Rapid population growth.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.070
Very young population.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:41.130
I don't understand yet,
we need to work on it,

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.100
you know, I'd love to
collaborate with you,

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.480
what the development ladder is.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.220
What other possibilities are.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.630
The way that our
parents and grandparents

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.110
in previous generations
dealt with these challenges

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.700
was to move.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.850
A third of Europe migrated.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:55.630
A third of Sweden.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.800
A third of Ireland.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.310
A third of Italy moved
when they lost their jobs

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.270
or there was a famine or a
war or something like that.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.840
That's why the US is what it is
because people who came here,

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.940
particularly risk takers.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.440
That option is
being closed down.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.070
So people are locked
in their countries now.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.620
And if they're locked
in a country where

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.630
you don't see development--
now, some places

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.920
might be lucky and have tourism
or some other opportunity,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.980
but the generalizable
model, some commodities

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.980
might become valuable, but we
know there's a resource curse.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.020
I think this is a
really deep question

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.120
that we need to think about.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.640
India is so big and diverse,
and it's growing quickly,

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.354
it hopefully will get over its
hump before the major effect.

00:43:41.354 --> 00:43:42.770
But I think there
are some places,

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.090
like Africa, where it's
difficult for me today to see

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.500
how this will be beneficial.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.375
Of course, many things
are beneficially

00:43:50.375 --> 00:43:53.430
in AI, health,
banking, and all that,

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.866
but I'm talking about the
fundamental questions of jobs.

00:43:56.866 --> 00:43:57.990
IAN GOLDIN: So one of the--

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.330
I'm going to shift to
the Dory questions here.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:03.450
One of the popular prescriptions
for economic hardship

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.540
nowadays is to reverse progress.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.040
To stop globalization.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.700
To limit free trade,
bring jobs back home.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.590
Why haven't we
come up with a more

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.112
progressive competing
solution to that narrative?

00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.570
IAN GOLDIN: I think
we urgently do.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.840
I think there are.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.330
We haven't won the arguments.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.562
You know, Macron was interesting
in the French presidential

00:44:24.562 --> 00:44:26.020
election, because
as far as I know,

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.060
he's the only global, big
leader that has come up.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.330
He said, no, we want--

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.160
this is France.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.680
Globalization is
not a good word.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.360
But he said, I'm
pro-globalization.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.430
I'm pro-Brussels.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.770
I'm pro all these things
that everyone else was saying

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.210
were bads, and he
won by a landslide,

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.264
which was not predictable.

00:44:48.264 --> 00:44:50.430
Maybe with Google Analytics,
it was, but I certainly

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.600
didn't predict it.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.640
And so I think you can come up
with a compelling narrative,

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.060
but it's a narrative
that we hear, certainly,

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.100
from people like
Jeremy Corbyn in the UK

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.610
and many others which is
backward-looking in that.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.780
And I think, I hope, there's a
generation of younger leaders.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.920
This woman that's
just won the election

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.240
in New Zealand,
Jacinda, 37 years old.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.290
Just completely overwhelming
the old labor party there.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.686
Those are the signs
of real hope for me.

00:45:23.686 --> 00:45:26.060
HAL VARIAN: Well, it is amazing,
and particularly Macron.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.570
And not did he manage to
push the globalization

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.780
ideas forward, but the
labor liberalization, which

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:38.270
has stymied French leaders
for 20 years, 15 years.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.990
And every economist who looked
at the situation, France

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:45.200
or Italy or Spain, said you
have to liberalize your labor

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.160
markets, but it's
extremely difficult to do.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.000
He's managed to make
progress in that area.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
IAN GOLDIN: So I think
it does point to the fact

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.400
that with these
information technologies,

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.820
you can reach people directly.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.560
You don't need big
parties and big machines.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.322
It's different, I
think, in the US,

00:46:02.322 --> 00:46:04.280
because of the Congressional
and Senate system,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.155
you need the machine.

00:46:05.155 --> 00:46:07.220
And in the UK, we have
constituency politics.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.520
The great thing going in France
is proportional representation,

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.740
which allows a much
more direct relationship

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.262
between the
candidate and people.

00:46:16.262 --> 00:46:16.970
HAL VARIAN: Yeah.

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:20.930
The difficulty in the
US electoral system

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.869
is it lasts so long.

00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:24.410
I mean, it's going
on and on, and now

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.870
people are already doing 2018
and 2020, and money, money,

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.460
money, money.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.668
IAN GOLDIN: And money is big.

00:46:29.668 --> 00:46:30.560
You need billions.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:30.900
HAL VARIAN: Yes.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.441
And actually, this
next question, you

00:46:32.441 --> 00:46:35.339
mentioned the flow of goods,
services, products, and ideas,

00:46:35.339 --> 00:46:37.130
but you did not mention
the flow of people.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.190
I think you did.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.536
You said the [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:39.536 --> 00:46:40.994
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:46:40.994 --> 00:46:43.509
If the people who
check me out will

00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:45.800
see that I wrote a book called
"Exceptional People, How

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.050
Migration Shaped our World and
Will Define our Future," which

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:54.950
Princeton University Press
published, absolutely--

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.000
people are absolutely
central to this.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.810
And one of the great
asymmetries in globalization

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:03.020
now is that that fundamental
flow has been locked down.

00:47:05.294 --> 00:47:05.960
HAL VARIAN: Yes.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.630
Let me ask a question
about climate change.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:12.600
That's also come up.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.266
I know you did mention
that in the book.

00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:17.960
There is some discussion of
it and in your talk here.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.600
Do we have time to
avert a catastrophe,

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.190
or do we have to
start planning ahead?

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:26.090
One suggestion I've
heard is really good

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.270
to invest in companies
that build dikes.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.460
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.070
Being near the sea.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.870
A lot of dynamic
cities on the coast.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.380
I think the answer is both.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.960
There already are catastrophes.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.920
Al Gore spoke at
Zeitgeist yesterday,

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.480
and as always, he was absolutely
convincing and passionate

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.470
about it.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:50.840
And he linked the
Houston hurricane

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.400
and a lot of recent
events, what's

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.760
been happening not far from
here in Northern California.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.880
The evidence is mounting
that these things are really

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.740
the result of climate change.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.270
And just the heat that I
experienced in Palo Alto today,

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.100
every day you have a new record.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:08.990
So it's happening.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.430
It dramatically impacts
particularly on poor people.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.370
Being in Phoenix
yesterday at Zeitgeist,

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.665
that's sort of a desert.

00:48:17.665 --> 00:48:19.040
But if you're
wealthy enough, you

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.470
pump water from far enough,
you turn the air con enough,

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.730
you can live in the desert.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:26.220
But for most people on the
planet, that is not an option.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.900
And so it will
exacerbate inequality.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.680
It will be particularly
devastating for coastal cities.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.710
And a lot of the most dynamic
places in emerging markets

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:40.100
are coastal, of
course here, too.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.325
And we need to
act more urgently.

00:48:42.325 --> 00:48:43.520
So both.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.470
We need to make our societies
much more resilient.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.520
We need to focus
on what we can do

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.510
in all dimensions, particularly
in agriculture, energy, et

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.960
cetera, but we have to
stop carbon emission.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.010
We basically have
to go to zero carbon

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.960
within the next 20 years.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.650
That's dramatic.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.820
It's a revolution.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.940
We've never achieved this sort
of thing economically before.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.680
It's a total revolution.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.100
It won't happen through
market signals alone.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.290
It will be helped by the energy
and technology revolutions

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.370
that we're seeing.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.700
But it's going to
require decisive action.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.430
A lot of assets, a lot of
companies have to be revalued.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.530
Stranded assets is a real thing.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.050
You don't want to be an
investor pricing assets

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.880
in the Arctic, et cetera.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.650
So I think we need
to do much more,

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.812
and I find it a tragedy in
the US what's been happening

00:49:33.812 --> 00:49:34.770
in terms of withdrawal.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.030
Two pieces of good news.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.000
One is that actually,
the withdrawal period

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.700
is after the next presidential
election in the US.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.990
And secondly, what states,
businesses like your own,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.300
are doing, will really
account for much

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:54.290
of the movement in the US,
despite the federal government

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:56.200
not being as committed
as it was to this.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.780
So I don't think one should
give up in the US at all.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.626
HAL VARIAN: Is there
a question back there?

00:50:02.626 --> 00:50:04.120
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your talk.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.200
I would like to hear your
thoughts on income inequality

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.920
and drawing parallels
from the Renaissance age.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.740
Was there the same problem
at that time, and how was it

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.675
addressed?

00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:18.770
Thank you.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:20.990
IAN GOLDIN: The data is,
I think, pretty clear.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.620
It's not just income inequality,
but health inequality,

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.570
inequality generally is rising.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.880
And I think I gave the reasons
for that in general terms.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.900
It's very important to think
about why we care about it.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.450
Why does it matter.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.740
Now, do we care about how
many Ferraris we see on

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.380
our street, or do we care
about how many beggars

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.540
we see on our streets,
or people starving,

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.560
and is there a connection, is
the key question in my mind.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.230
China has experienced very
rapidly rising inequality

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:51.880
from a very flat base.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.860
And I don't think it's
a problem for China,

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.200
because very few people
are going backwards.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.260
And even the poorest people are
experiencing significant rises

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.050
in income and in the quality
of their lives and health care

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.610
and life expectancy and so on.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:09.460
Where it becomes an issue
is when some part of society

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.742
is benefiting hugely, and
others are falling back.

00:51:12.742 --> 00:51:14.950
And that's what's happening
to people in some Midwest

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:18.310
towns in the US and in parts
of the North of England, parts

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.720
of the countryside in
France, and in other places,

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.780
and that explains
rising extremism.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.030
The Renaissance
echo is this tension

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:28.660
between relative and
absolute, and also

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.097
whether it's seen that it's
ill-gotten gains or not.

00:51:33.097 --> 00:51:34.930
Do the people that are
becoming very wealthy

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:36.760
deserve what they've got?

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.660
And what people resented deeply
and what the whole extremeness

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.000
movement in the
Renaissance played on

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.440
was that it was unfair.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.170
These people captured
the benefits of it

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.700
and didn't share them.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.490
And this concept of fairness
and the ethics of it

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:56.210
and whether people are being
seen to pay tax and give back

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:57.670
becomes important.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.710
Medici was tolerated
because he was such a patron

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:01.670
and supported people.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:04.490
But then when
extremism became great,

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.750
and when he was seen as
increasingly corrupt,

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:11.412
he was not tolerated
anymore, and that shifted.

00:52:11.412 --> 00:52:13.120
And of course, it was
the information age

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.400
that allowed people to
observe, as the transparency

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.920
it has now, what was happening.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.080
That information was locked
down before that by the church

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:25.300
and by the princes, then it
suddenly became available.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.420
So information, knowing about
inequality and the reason

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.862
for it becomes fundamental.

00:52:29.862 --> 00:52:31.070
HAL VARIAN: Absolutely right.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.030
And I think when you look at
attitudes towards inequality,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.210
you survey people,
they don't mind

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:41.670
that athletes make so much or
celebrities or entrepreneurs.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.840
Bankers, on the
other hand, that's

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.000
a different story completely.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.720
I think we'll make
this the last question.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to speak to us today.

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.400
I had a question
about divestment.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.729
Divestment in South Africa is
generally seen as successful,

00:52:58.729 --> 00:53:00.520
whereas the divestment
around fossil fuels,

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.600
there's been a lot
of conversation about

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.610
whether it actually
is something that's

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.880
going to help us move forward
to zero carbon emissions or not.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.920
And here at Google,
there has been

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.970
talk about whether we should
be moving forward and divesting

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.030
from fossil fuels within the
things that we invest in.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.820
How do you see this
parallel with divestment

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.252
in South Africa in comparison
to divestment in fossil fuels?

00:53:22.252 --> 00:53:22.960
IAN GOLDIN: Yeah.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.980
Very good question.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.310
I was absolutely
committed to disinvestment

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:28.240
from South Africa.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.270
I thought it was a good thing.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.978
And I think that,
together with sanctions

00:53:30.978 --> 00:53:33.424
and many other things, did
accelerate the transformation

00:53:33.424 --> 00:53:34.090
of South Africa.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:38.050
I have no doubt in my mind that
it made the transition better

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:41.560
and quicker because of that.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:45.460
I also believe that this should
be very carefully thought

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.380
through, divestment
from fossil fuels.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.427
There should be an understanding
that investors are taking risk

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.010
when they invest in
strata and assets.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.670
So it's an investment
decision, particularly

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.269
for pension funds and
long-term investors,

00:53:57.269 --> 00:53:58.810
about whether these
assets are really

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:01.510
what they think they are.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.560
But its a broader one.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.730
It's about political signaling.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.630
So I don't believe, for
example, my own personal view

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.030
is that there are
some oil majors who

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:14.310
are the biggest investors in
renewable energy in the world.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:18.210
I think we should not be
discouraging them from that.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.980
We should be in the
shareholder meetings,

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.980
encouraging them to make a
more rapid transformation,

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.222
but we should be in there.

00:54:24.222 --> 00:54:25.680
On the other hand,
there are people

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.440
who are mainly doing things
that are not transforming,

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.010
and we should be
discouraging them.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.200
So in a way, it's about
how you incentivize people

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:38.070
to do the right thing
and absolutely penalize

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.070
those that are not doing
enough of the right thing.

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.660
So it's a gradation.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.640
And of course, that's
difficult politically.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.310
It's difficult to
campaign and say,

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.832
don't invest in this
company, invest in that one.

00:54:49.832 --> 00:54:51.040
But that's what we should do.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.550
We should also understand
that this is global,

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:55.860
and consumers have
increasing powers.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.410
We don't want to simply
divest from a democratically

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.970
accountable company to have
that asset mined or produced

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:08.430
by a company run out of
Russia or some other country.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.620
Just buy the assets cheaply
and do the same thing.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:13.380
So consumers need
to talk through it.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.430
We should be targeting
through divestment also

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:18.840
the companies that
are not making

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.620
the transformation, for
example, to electric vehicles.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.880
Who are lying about the
content of their products.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.440
And also thinking
deeply about some

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.065
of the things which
are very difficult,

00:55:30.065 --> 00:55:33.330
like steel and cement, which
have a very, very high carbon

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.120
footprint.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.354
So cradle to grave analysis.

00:55:35.354 --> 00:55:37.770
And this is where data analytics
and a company like Google

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.090
can help so much.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.410
These things really matter.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.810
Consumer awareness and
then action around it.

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:46.890
But I'm very proud
that Oxford's divested.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.520
It was a hard
discussion in Oxford.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.930
I'm also absolutely convinced
that we will not lose

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.910
any returns as a result of it.

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:55.680
Just like people used
to make the argument

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.780
around tobacco, et cetera.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.145
I've looked at the data deeply.

00:55:59.145 --> 00:56:01.020
I'm on the investment
committee of my college

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.380
and other investment committees,
and there's no premium

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.940
that you have to pay by
doing the right thing.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.276
And so we need to
do the right thing.

00:56:09.276 --> 00:56:09.900
HAL VARIAN: OK.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.510
On that note, thank
you again for coming.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:15.660
IAN GOLDIN: Thank
you for having me.
