00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.060
So the germ cells that make up the sex

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.850
cells have to go through this DNA doubling process too.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Even germ cells, if they

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.150
want to divide, have to double their DNA first.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.940
&gt;&gt; But if they go through mitosis, to make and the egg and the sperm,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.470
and when the egg and the sperm fuse

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.680
together, then how many chromosomes would they have?
