00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.830
What do you think is the right
answer for this one, David?

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.620
So, I observe two things
are going on between A and B.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.280
The dot in the top right
is disappearing and

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.640
the diamond is moving out and growing.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.690
So I said that the dot would still
disappear even though it's on the other

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.560
side of the frame and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.160
the circle that was inside
the triangle will move out and grow.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.080
So I said the answer was 2.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.800
Here I've drawn a connection between the
circle and the triangle, the diamond and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.065
the circle, and the dot and
its analogous dot.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.990
&gt;&gt; 2 seems to be the right answer David.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.130
Notice that the circle in 2 is
on the left of the triangle

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.540
even though the diamond in B,
was on the right of the circle.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.120
That is okay because the diamond
is replacing the dot here.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.610
And similarly,
the circle is replacing the dot here.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.520
So if the dot was in
the left of triangle here,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840
it makes sense to put it in
the circle and left of the triangle.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.080
Notice the drawing and
connection between the diamond here, and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
the circle here was very easy for
us to do.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.070
But designing an agent that make
that kind of connection is much more

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.770
difficult.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.030
So we'll deal with lots of methods,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.810
to help agents make what are very
natural conclusions for us.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.900
&gt;&gt; This of course raises another issue.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.430
How do we do it?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.170
How do you solve the problem?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.070
Why was it so easy for you?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.653
Why is it so hard for A.I.?

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:18.330
Yet another question, when David was
trying to solve this problem, he looked

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.880
at the relationship between A and B and
then mapped it to C and some image here.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.700
But one could have gone
about it the other way.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.260
One could have picked any one of
these images, put it in the D and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.930
asked whether this would be a good fit.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.970
So in one case, one can start from
the problem and propose a solution.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.460
In another case, one can take one
of these solutions at a time,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.860
put it here and see whether it matches.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.610
Two different strategies.
