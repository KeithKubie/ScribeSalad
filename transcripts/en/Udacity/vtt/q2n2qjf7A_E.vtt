00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
Have you ever felt like the world of
math seems confusing or irrelevant? It can

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:07.169
certainly feel that way sometimes,
especially if it is explained without any

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:10.510
sort of real world context. But math is
not simply a set of rules. It's an

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.577
intricate and fascinating language that
we've developed to understand and describe

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.570
the world around us. &gt;&gt; In this course we
will approach college algebra using three

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:22.775
real world scenarios. First, we'll have a
new startup company, with a very creative

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:26.415
product, figure out how to handle it's
finances. &gt;&gt; Next, we'll look at how

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:30.235
architects use mathematics to design
concert halls. &gt;&gt; At the end of the

00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:33.690
course, we'll talk about how to model the
population change of endangered species

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:37.505
and invasive species. &gt;&gt; These scenarios
will help you develop a deep understanding

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:41.055
of algebra and teach you how to solve
problems more effectively. &gt;&gt; So join us

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:43.785
to learn how intuitive, relevant, and
compelling algebra can be.
