00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.750
A records map names to IP addresses as we

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.270
have seen. We have also seen what's called an NS

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.180
or a namesever record which maps a domain name

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.470
to the authoritative nameserver for that domain. So we saw

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.500
a bunch of NS records in the form of

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.670
referrals, whereby, if we ask the route for a mapping

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.750
of GaTech.edu to an IP address, it doesn't specifically know

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.670
the answer, but it can issue a nameserver reply or

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.360
an NS record referring the resolver to a

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.680
different nameserver that could be responsible for that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.470
part of the domain name space. This allows

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.580
the domain name system to be implemented as

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.960
a hierarchy. Another important DNS record type is

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.130
an MX record, which shows the mail server

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.320
for a particular domain. Occasionally, one name actually

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.335
is just an alias for another name. For example,

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:57.020
www.gatech.edu actually has a slightly different real name. The

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.550
CNAME is basically a pointer from an alias to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760
another domain name that needs to be looked up.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.849
The PT R is another record that we'll look at,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.190
and this maps IP addresses to domain names. For

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.020
example if you wanted to know the name for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.098
a particular IP address, you need to issue a

00:01:12.098 --> 00:01:15.520
PT R query. This is sometimes called a reverse lookup.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.890
Finally, a AAAA record maps a domain name to an IPV6 address. Let's take a look

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.230
at a couple of different examples of domain

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.390
name lookups using a command line utility called dig.
