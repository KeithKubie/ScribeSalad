TIMOTHY JORDAN: Good
day, I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.100
And this week I'm speaking to
you from Sydney, Australia.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.290
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.650
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.390
TensorFlow Serving is a
high-performance serving system

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.980
for machine learning
models designed

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.510
for production environments.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.240
And version 1.0
is now available.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.880
Also included in this
release is a pre-built binary

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.290
available through apt-get
install, which is really cool.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.230
For more info on the release
and on using TensorFlow Serving,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.780
Google is proud to
be a platinum sponsor

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.900
of the 34th International
Conference on Machine Learning,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.260
taking place this week
right here in Sydney.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
There's over 130 Googlers
attending the conference

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.660
to present publications
and host workshops.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.690
But as usual, don't worry
if you didn't attend.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.610
Just head on over to
the post for links

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.090
to the papers and
workshops we're presenting.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.180
Version 2.0 of the
Nearby Connections API

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.630
is now available, providing a
high bandwidth, low latency,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.750
encrypted data transfers
between nearby devices

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
in a fully offline
peer-to-peer manner.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.570
Release details, as well as
links to the docs and code,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.830
are on the post.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.190
Chrome 61 now
exposes an estimate

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.560
of how much storage
a web app is using

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.510
and how much is available.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.820
For some code and a discussion
on how to use this in your app,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.850
take a look at the post.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.560
Conditional REST
requests are now

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.360
available for the Firebase
Realtime Database.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.200
You can use them to safely
perform atomic operations,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.750
and you can get
started with the post.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.080

gathered in Denver to discuss
the plan for the future

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.830
of the Go project.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.020
The discussions covered
compiler and runtime,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.750
dependency management, the
standard library, and much,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.770
much more.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.420
