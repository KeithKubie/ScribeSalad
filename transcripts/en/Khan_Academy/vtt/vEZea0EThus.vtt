00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:01.456
Let's see if we can apply

00:00:01.456 --> 00:00:04.532
what we know about negative numbers,

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:06.031
and what we know about exponents

00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.879
to apply exponents to negative numbers.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.197
So let's first think about –

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:13.723
Let's say we have -3.

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.123
Let's first think about what it means

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:18.057
to raise it to the 1st power.

00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:22.085
Well that literally means just taking a -3.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:23.994
And there's nothing left to multiply it with.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:27.642
So this is just going to be equal to -3.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.069
Now what happens if you were take a -3,

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.144
and we were to raise it to the 2nd power?

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:37.660
Well that's equivalent to taking 2 -3's,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.661
so a -3 and a -3, and then multiplying them together.

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:46.457
What's that going to be?

00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:48.930
Well a negative times a negative is a positive.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.670
So that is going to be positive 9.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.918
Let me write this. It's going to be positive 9.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:56.798
Well, let's keep going.

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:59.054
Let's see if there is some type of pattern here.

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:04.798
Let's take -3 and raise it to the 3rd power.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.921
What is this going to be equal to?

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:12.659
Well, we're going to take 3 -3's, [WRITING] –

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.629
and we're going to multiply them together.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.582
So we're going to multiply them together.

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:20.195
-3 × -3, we already figured out is positive 9.

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:26.806
But positive 9 × -3, well that's that's -27.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.720
And so you might notice a pattern here.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.057
Whenever we raised raised a negative base

00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:41.188
to an exponent, if we raise it to an odd exponent,

00:01:41.188 --> 00:01:47.910
we are going to get a negative value.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.402
And that's because when you multiply

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:50.853
negative numbers an even number of times,

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:52.122
a negative number times

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.006
a negative number is a positive.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:54.521
But then you have one more negative number

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.696
to multiply the result by – which makes it negative.

00:01:56.696 --> 00:01:59.594
And if you take a negative base,

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:04.471
and you raise it to an even power,

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.327
that's because if you multiply a negative

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.726
times a negative, you're going to get a positive.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:12.055
And so when you do it an even number of times,

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.133
doing it a multiple-of-two number of times.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.736
So the negatives and the negatives all cancel out,

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:17.529
I guess you could say.

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.735
Or when you take the product of the two negatives,

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:21.267
you keep getting positives.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.867
So this right over here is

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.660
going to give you a positive value.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.497
So there's really nothing new about

00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:32.489
taking powers of negative numbers.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.659
It's really the same idea.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.409
And you just really have to remember that

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.136
a negative times a negative is a positive.

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:41.663
And a negative times a positive is a negative,

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:43.297
which we already learned from

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:45.545
multiplying negative numbers.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.072
Now there's one other thing that I want to clarify –

00:02:48.072 --> 00:02:50.549
because sometimes there might be ambiguity

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.227
if someone writes this.

00:02:54.227 --> 00:02:55.895
Let's say someone writes that.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:58.328
And I encourage you to actually pause the video

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:01.472
and think about with this right over here

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.332
would evaluate to.

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:05.963
And, if you given a go at that, think about whether

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:11.793
this should mean something different then that.

00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:14.664
Well this one can be a little bit and big ambiguous

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.031
and if people are strict about order of operations,

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:19.469
you should really be thinking about the exponent

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.786
before you multiply by this -1.

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:25.895
You could this is implicitly saying -1 × 2^3.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.003
So many times, this will usually be interpreted

00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.060
as negative 2 to the third power,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.501
which is equal to -8,

00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:36.382
while this is going to be interpreted

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.388
as -2 to the third power.

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:40.525
Now that also is equal to -8.

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:43.461
You might say well what's what's the big deal here?

00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:46.929
Well what if this was what if these were even exponents.

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.486
So what if someone had give myself some more space here.

00:03:51.486 --> 00:04:00.614
What if someone had these to express its -4 or a -4 squared or -4 squared.

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:04.558
This one clearly evaluates to 16 – positive 16.

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:07.189
It's a negative 4 times a *4.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.073
This one could be interpreted as is.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.003
Especially if you look at order of operations,

00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:12.564
and you do your exponent first,

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:15.766
this would be interpreted as -4 times 4,

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:18.077
which would be -16.

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:20.964
So it's really important to think about this properly.

00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:23.438
And if you want to write the number negative

00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:25.474
if you want the base to be negative 4,

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.000
put parentheses around it and then write the exponent.
