00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.870
One of the strangest ideas bequeathed to us
by religion is the notion that it might be

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.050
wise and socially beneficial to think of ourselves
as being, every one of us, sinners. This seems,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.339
at first glance, both patently untrue – and
deeply unhelpful. The vast majority of us

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.249
have committed no particularly egregious crime
and might feel understandably targeted and

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:37.670
shamed to have to carry such a dark and archaic
title. Furthermore, a burden of non-specific

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.809
guilt seems like a sure route to damaged morale
and a hounded personality. But the counter-argument

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.250
runs like this. Simply stated: the only people
who can count as good are those who are modestly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.929
and openly prepared to acknowledge their potential,
and active tendencies, to be less than perfect.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.570
And the truly bad and dangerous among us are
those who have never suspected they might

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.080
such things. It is, in other words, a sense
of innocence and purity that renders people

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.960
properly unpleasant and dangerous, for it
removes their capacity for introspection,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.300
moderation, guilt and atonement, the ingredients
upon which true goodness is founded. Nice

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.960
people aren’t without flaws; they’re just
unusually aware of them, and unusually committed

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.080
to overcoming them. Only with an ongoing degree
of self-doubt and self-reflection can we check

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.998
our myriad tendencies to native arrogance
and cruelty.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.830
We need to accept with grace that
we’re geniuses at fixating on the wrongs

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.390
of others and at eliding evidence of our own
less than ideal natures. We can see the lies

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.890
of others so clearly; our own mendacity is
frankly always a very real surprise. The aggression,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.470
stupidity and sheer evil exhibited by them
– the target group of our anger – renders

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.159
us immediately incensed and impassioned. But
that we have been less than perfect in another

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.420
area, this remains truly puzzling and unfamiliar
news. The cardinal sin here is a feeling of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.489
righteousness. Being right and being righteous
are painfully different concepts. When we

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.170
are right, we are so within a specific context,
on one occasion, but we have no guarantee

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.609
of being so again. The moment of rightness
has to be earned, never assumed. However,

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:44.030
when we are righteous, we feel ourselves to
be right not only on this occasion – but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.120
on all others too. We trust ourselves to be
above being evil – and therefore become

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.291
so with particular insidiousness. A sense
of purity is a particular error of the adolescent

00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:04.020
(and the adolescentally-minded) because they
are as yet more likely not to have sinned

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.790
yet – or only in ways that are hidden, incipient
and tentative. They look only at the evidence

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.890
of the sins of their elders and superiors.
How normal to conclude then, that they must

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.769
be good in and of themselves – and that
it is the rest of the world that will always

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.010
be corrupt and wicked. It is no coincidence
that in revolutionary armies, it has traditionally

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.209
been the youngest soldiers, that is, the soldiers
most convinced of their own purity, who have

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.950
shown the greatest ruthlessness to the enemy.
A good community isn’t one where there is

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.209
a feeling that everyone can one day be pure,
but rather one with a sense of how close everyone

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.010
is to being bad, which breeds a group commitment
to increasing the amount of self-observation,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:03.950
confession, productive guilt, tolerance, understanding,
and kindness in circulation. Good people know

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.810
never to allow the rightness of a specific
cause they’re involved with to function

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.231
as an excuse to abandon manners, tolerance
and modesty. People who think they are good

00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:22.350
are no so such thing: they just lack imagination
and self-knowledge. The evidence would be

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.680
there if there eyes were open enough to see
it. Far from demeaning us, the idea that we

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.720
are all sinners is the surest guarantee of
virtue.
