00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through a possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have to name my procedure with t_.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That tells the interpreter that I'm defining a token.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now I give the name of the token, LANGLESLASH.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That was given as part of the problem.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
All of our tokens are actually functions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've been eliding that bit. We're still going to skip over it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Next I have to have a regular expression for the string that matches the token,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and here again there's only 1 string that matches,

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and I'm going to return the token unchanged.
