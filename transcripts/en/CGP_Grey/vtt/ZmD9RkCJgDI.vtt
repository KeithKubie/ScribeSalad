00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Well that doesn't look good.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.240
ðŸŽµ Intro musicðŸŽµ

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.820
Hello, Lucy Liu.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.700
I am in North Carolina.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.320
It is the start of what is going to be five long weeks of business travel and business meetings.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.540
I'm trying to get better at business meetings.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.420
Also while I'm here I'm setting for myself the goal of escaping from America not fatter than I arrived

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.740
because I've fallen of the health bandwagon a bit lately and I really don't want to make things worse

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.260
but that might be impossible given that in America the streets are paved with donuts.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.380
But I'm gonna try and right now that's future Grey's problem.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.140
Current Grey is on the porch with a dog visiting family so no more vloging. And let's skip to

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.060
Denver, Colorado. Just stopping off to get some coffee and use the restroom and tornado shelter

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360
and eat bad food strangely.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.640
More details later, on to San Jose, California just south of San Francisco.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.320
Work travel is never fun but it's extra not fun when you arrive at the hotel to find out that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.380
they don't have your room that you booked months ago.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.480
The reservation they have. But not the room.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.360
suspiciously, it seems many people who booked the hotel rooms at a super cheap price before the hotels realised that WWDC

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.420
had changed location to a new city.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.100
Those people don't have rooms

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.140
The rooms had been re-rented at a higher price

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.120
So what happened to the people who do have a reservation?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.980
Why conveniently they put you in a hotel on the other side of the city!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.520
A hotel with the douchiest privacy please sign I have ever seen.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.600
But I didn't fly across an ocean and a continent to be 45 minutes away from

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.400
all of the reasons that I'm here.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.040
So I was rather ... 'firm' ... with the hotel

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.360
and suddenly like magic they did have a free upgrade to a better room.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.640
But not for tonight.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.940
So I still have to be at this place and I can't set up any of my work

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.540
and it won't be 'till I drive back tomorrow morning

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.700
that I can actually get started on the reasons that I'm here

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.280
In fairness the apology suite is quite nice and it comes with an apology letter and apology chocolates

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360
that I can't eat because I must escape from America not fatter

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.180
Travel protip: you could have stuff delivered to the hotel so you don't have to pack it.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.740
::box opening sounds::

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:44.060
::more box opening sounds::

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.680
This is only half the boxes I have to unpack and I didn't unpack all of the boxes in the boxes but,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.820
as I switched hotels this morning I'm running out of time before WWDC begins so I need to get outta here.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280
WWDC is a conference where Apple brings developers from the wide world to announce new features

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000
of their software so programmers can implement them

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.160
Announcer: Welcome to WWDC

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.680
Grey: A ticket inside is a front row to the future

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.960
I don't have a ticket, I've got a hotel room,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.180
and a wishlist, which is far more funny for crowd reactions anyway.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.800
Many: Ohhh! Woooww! Oh!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.620
Shots fired! God!

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.580
::chuckling::

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.660
And fooling around on Twitter during the boring parts.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.260
TV: HomePod   Many: ::surprised laughs::

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.280
What? Hah. Wow.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.500
Keynote's over, now it's time to set up my mobile office,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.760
ðŸŽµ Musical notes ðŸŽµ

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.200
Watch some technical talks,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.840
Speaker: ... customizing your cheeseburger is way easier when someone

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.160
steps you through the process, one decision at a time.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.400
Grey: Attend tech podcasts to discuss the tech,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.980
sometimes with singalongs.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.480
ðŸŽµ Podcast singalong ðŸŽµ

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.640
Which brings us too...

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.720
Why am I here?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.940
At the end of WWDC, it's to record a podcast *about* WWDC.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.000
The podcast is called "Cortex", on a network called "Relay",

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.660
and that's another reason that I'm here, 'cuz there's a big Relay listener meetup that I'm going too.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.000
 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.400
Past Grey didn't film anything at the event,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.100
but, to be fair to him, he was running on low power mode at that point.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.740
I really find jet lag so frustrating,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.380
on this trip I'm *trying* to acclimatize to west coast time.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.800
I was out last night at the Relay podcast meetup

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.220
I was just talking to people and then, POW

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.980
I was hit with that "I am going to fall asleep immediately' feeling.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.320
So I come back to the hotel, to get a good night's sleep

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.260
but no, of course here I am, it's 4 in the morning

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.140
and I know I'm just gonna be awake for a while

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.100
like a zombie. ::sigh::

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.200
 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.400
Thanks jet lag.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.460
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.060
I was on my way to go find some coffee,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.600
I think this is uhh,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.260
this is what I need to do today.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.340
This is Goal #1

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.260
But later, coffee first.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.020
All right, time to do this.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.860
 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.620
I tried to do some fancy camera work, but then this happened,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.480
so, forget that, no more recording in gyms while I'm doing weight stuff,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.820
it feels super weird to vlog then anyway

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.320
 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.500
America is a place where you can really double down on your eating mistakes.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.520
I really want to avoid that, so my plan while I'm here

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720
is just to cut out as many carbohydrates as I can from my diet.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.740
This means no pancakes, no bread,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.140
no pastas, no pizza, no crackers,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.860
normally the kind of stuff I would eat an

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.500
enormous amount of when I'm under a lot of pressure

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.820
and doing a lot of work.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.220
And since I'm also travelling at the same time it's kind of doubly hard,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.760
but it is possible to do if you can eat the eggs, but not the muffin.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.020
So I'm going to the supermarket to load up on all the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.260
kinds of things that I'm going to be eating lots of.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.000
Meat and cheese and eggs and emergency almonds and emergency jerky

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.560
It's not fun, and it's not what I want to do,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.760
but this is the most simple and effective thing that I have found in the past for

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.820
dropping or maintaining weight and,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.540
if there's one thing I could use this summer, it's a bit of simple.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.280
Thank you Check Out Robot, you don't ask any questions, and I really appreciate you for that.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.000
Check Out Robot: $5.99

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.320
Grey: Conferencing is mentally taxing but I find it

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.680
helps to map the outlines of the day and try to specify what

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.140
objectives for time well spent are, what I need to do,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.940
who I need to see, what sessions I should go to,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.320
and as a personal development point, I'm trying to get better at

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.140
meeting with interesting people while I'm business travelling and,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.980
these conferences can be a crazy overlapping puzzle of everyone's schedules.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.640
Right now I am on my way to a meeting with someone,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.420
the only time we could find for both of us that overlapped

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.040
is while he's packing his bags to go. *Laughs*

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.620
So that's where I'm headed.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.260
 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.240
Alright, packing meeting over,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.700
on to more stuff.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.000
 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.740
The no carbohydrates health plan is going pretty well so far

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.800
but now during business meetings I'm the weirdo who's not eating the burger bun and has to explain why.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.640
 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.420
Do I recognize the model of truck?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.100
I do not.  ::Car mates laugh::

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.520
I've been lucky enough to be invited to see some interesting headquarters in the past

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.060
including Dropbox, and Facebook.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.800
This time it's Google, with their

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.400
"Why is there a dinosaur over there?"

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.020
and

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.860
"This is a sad dystopian graveyard of androids past."

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.680
 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.400
and office interior they really you rather didn't film.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.700
Then on to the computer history museum with

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.160
"So many buttons."

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.800
"I want to press them all"

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.820
and remembered fun things long forgotten,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.740
and traumatic things long forgotten,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.660
ðŸŽµ Hamster Dance Music ðŸŽµ

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.980
 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.660
and got totally distracted by seeing my first Tesla charger in real life.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.500
 

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.780
Oh god,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.480
 

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.800
Tesla's, Tesla's as far as the eye can see.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.680
 

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.840
Oh this is the X!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.840
 

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.560
I am pretty tired and I really don't wanna,

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.360
it's been a long day,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.940
but I'm going into the gym.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.680
Man, everywhere you go in America,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.180
Screens, screens, screens.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.780
But you know what?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.260
 

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.760
Thank you, but no thank you.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.960
 

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.860
Alright, I'm doing this.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.560
 

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.500
Pretty pleased about that.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.720
I had just,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.820
I really didn't wanna do it,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.420
but I'd only just barely started a streak of exercising

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.660
so I wasn't gonna quit on the third day.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.980
::Shower noises::

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.380
 

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.860
But yeah,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.160
 

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.680
not a thing that I wanted to do.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.820
but I'm very glad It's done,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.240
and now

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.720
 

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.040
it's shower time.

ðŸŽµ Lovely Cello Music ðŸŽµ

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.120
I've yet to be at a conference that doesn't feel like it's just

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.380
one day too long,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.500
and this is the last day.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.580
The big responsibility today is to record Cortex,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.460
but before that happens I want to try to fit in just a little bit of exercise.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.900
I'm gonna get my bicycling in while I prepare for Cortex.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.340
 

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.560
So I've got the bike, it looks like, on the map there's a park along the Guadalupe river,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.960
so I'm taking the bike there,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.880
I'm gonna go for a little bit of a ride.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.720
 

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.120
Now I've gotten into the habit,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.840
-Oh there we go; Guadalupe river park-

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.560
Uhh, I've gotten into the habit of

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.180
not listening to music while I do aerobic exercise.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.700
It makes exercising a good time to think,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.020
and like today I'm going to be combining

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.820
the exercise with preparing for Cortex.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.160
So I've taken a look at the show notes, I've loaded them up in my head,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.400
I'm gonna go for a little bike ride and think about

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.160
what i'm gonna talk about on Cortex today.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.780
Just as soon as I can figure out how to get

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.520
down into the park.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.220
 

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.680
Now it's time to attach the GoPro.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.880
 

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880
Perfect.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.860
 

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.560
Feels like Terminator!

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:51.040
ðŸŽµ Terminator style music ðŸŽµ

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.060
Thanks little buddy,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.120
that was way better than cycling indoors.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.640
Time for shower, and podcast.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.560
 

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.820
(oh no)

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.540
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.020
(this is the worst)

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.680
 

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.900
(I have to hide now for a little while)

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.620
 

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.600
(I'm gonna be late to the podcast)

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.920
 

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.920
Can't do a podcast unless you have enough coffee to get though a podcast.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.620
I'm bringing the coffee.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.120
Myke Hurley: I finally did it...

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.240
Grey: What'd you do?

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.380
Myke: We're in the same place,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.300
Grey: Yeah...   Myke: We're working on something together in the same place.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.800
 

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.520
ðŸŽµ Cortex Theme ðŸŽµ

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.840
Mike: We're at WWDC again.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.960
Grey: We are.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.960
Myke: But last year you made me record in a hotel room

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.520
Grey: I did.   Myke: and you were in your hotel room

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.520
and we used Skype.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.320
Grey: Yes. That's true.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.660
Myke: But this year,    Grey: mmmhmmm

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.980
Myke: you suggested "Why don't we record in person?"

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.760
Grey: ::sigh:: I didn't suggest it,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.820
Myke: I feel like you did.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.480
Grey: you suggested it,   Myke: OK

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.380
Grey: and I agreed

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.760
because I have a lot of audio equipment

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.140
in my room right now that I really didn't want to unbox. ::chuckles::

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.080
Myke: Ahhhhh, that makes sense.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.080
Ok. Put the burden on me.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.940
 

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.760
Grey: Everyone is gone.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.160
I'm still here because I need an extra day to prepare.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.760
There's a place I need to get to by a certain time and it's a bit--

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.080
It's going to end up being a bit involved.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.160
So I'm guessing this log, which I originally though was just gonna be a short thing

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.560
at some conferences is going to end up being,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.480
ah, a much longer thing, like two or three parts?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.260
I don't know, that's Future Grey's editing problem.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.660
Now Grey's problem is packing.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.640
For suitcases and stuff the rule is:

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.740
"Only bags go inside of suitcases, not things."

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.880
Bags, in suitcases.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.100
Things can go in the bags, not in the suitcase.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.280
Alright, I got the packing done way faster than expected

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.700
because, of course I realized:

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.320
I don't need to pack it "well", I just need to get it all boxed up so I--

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.700
::censor beep::

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.760
--right now.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:14:11.500
 

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.080
Sure it looks that way on the camera, but holy hell--

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.380
 

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:23.600
ðŸŽµ Slow String Intro ðŸŽµ

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.740
ðŸŽµ Cascading Horns ðŸŽµ

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.580
 

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.720
I'm here the day before VidCon starts,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.100
the pre-conference feeling is nice.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.520
I always like being in places before the action happens,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.760
as it's being setup.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.520
It's the feeling of "potential".

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.860
All that potential of what could be

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.080
before what actually happens

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.060
empties you to the core.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.480
And this conference, this VidCon,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.180
is particularly draining because

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.840
the longer you spend time near LA,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.360
the more desaturated your life becomes.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.380
LA is a dementor in city form.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.340
But right now I'm still fresh, I like exploring,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.880
I like the feeling of solitude in places that should be full.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.160
It's peaceful. And it wont stay that way for long.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:27.320
::loud conference noises::

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.080
Grey: It has begun.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.200
::quiet::

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.160
::LOUD::

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.760
::quiet::

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.320
::LOUD::

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.420
::quiet::

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.840
::LOUD::

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.700
::very quiet::

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.180
::VERY LOUD::

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.380
Ohh, stay close coffee. I need you now more than ever.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.380
::more loud noises::

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:06.520
I'm so exhausted and these cookies are everywhere, depleting my willpower, in all of the lounges.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.700
Everywhere there aren't crowds, there are cookies.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.180
A cookie would feel so good right now. But I must resist

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.920
In case you're wondering, I stayed off of carbs during part two.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.720
It's been about three weeks so far without carbs and this is the final hard stretch

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:30.940
as VidCon is such an assault on the mind and to cope with it, I've chosen poorly in years past

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.340
Someone: What?   Grey: You overestimate the power of this

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.340
I don't understand why you even thing this is interesting.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.340
Someone: Brady's gonna wanna see the snap from you.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.340
Grey: OK?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.260
Someone: ::laughs::

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.760
I'm making better choices this time.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.980
But America really doesn't help when there's a pizza button on the phone and a sign for the pizza button

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.660
I think they really want me to eat pizza but I'm going to stay strong.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.100
Only two weeks left to escape from America not fatter.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.320
I feel like this place is the opposite of me.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:30.860
::Screaming::

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.120
So much screaming and filming

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.980
Casey: OK, so the question was:

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.140
You guys with your cameras, everyone behind you can't see me

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.880
Amazing

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.060
There's people everywhere

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.020
Well, almost everywhere

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.080
Panelist: ...what the internet really killed is the mass media business model.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.960
We tried to take that scarcity based model into this abundance based world,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:20.140
prices go down, desperation goes up, we end up with cats and kardashians,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.760
you see, as the ultimate clickbait. And it worked! Right?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.480
So... How do we rethink the business model of News?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.260
Heh... Good luck with that

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.000
Future Grey taking over here

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.500
As, at this point, Past Grey was really pushed beyond his social limits

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.740
Suddenly there is no more talking to the camera

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.000
There is just simply no more talking.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
This first summer of Grey was exhausting beyond my ability to explain

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.160
But it was also a great and hugely successful trip.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.340
I wanted to try to have more meetings with people

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.000
And boy did I ever...

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
But it was time to go.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.500
I needed a break, and there was a place I wanted to go

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.400
Where I could just be quiet

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.000
And not have to see people

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And not have to do anything

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.500
And just recharge for a while.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.000
So that's where I went.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.500
And there is perhaps nothing more uplifting to the human soul

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.500
Than taking a flight out of LA to a place where you actually want to be.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.500
So I recharged for a while,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.000
I went back to North Carolina to see my family again,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.660
And then I returned home to London.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And thus ended the Summer of Grey.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.500
Oh right! I also came back not fatter.
