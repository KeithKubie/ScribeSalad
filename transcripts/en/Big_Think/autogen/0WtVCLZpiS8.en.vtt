it was done in the movie 2001 the moon

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
it was done in the movie 2001 the moon
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.109
it was done in the movie 2001 the moon
base on the moon in that movie was

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119
base on the moon in that movie was
 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.780

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.350
underground providing a natural barrier
to radiation and then once you have the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360
to radiation and then once you have the
 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.209
to radiation and then once you have the
base set up you have to begin the

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219
base set up you have to begin the
 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.490
base set up you have to begin the
process of creating a self-sustaining

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500

agriculture there I mean what are you

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
agriculture there I mean what are you
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.200

gonna eat on Mars you can't order a

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210
gonna eat on Mars you can't order a
 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.120
gonna eat on Mars you can't order a
hamburger because everything has to be

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130
hamburger because everything has to be
 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.700
hamburger because everything has to be
shipped from the planet Earth you want

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
shipped from the planet Earth you want
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.560
shipped from the planet Earth you want
to create an agriculture and this means

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570
to create an agriculture and this means
 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.859
to create an agriculture and this means
genetic engineering this means creating

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
genetic engineering this means creating
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.410
genetic engineering this means creating
genetically modified algae and plants

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420

that can consume the rich carbon dioxide
 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570
that can consume the rich carbon dioxide
atmosphere live in a very cold

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580
atmosphere live in a very cold
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.420
atmosphere live in a very cold
environment and thrive then we have to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
environment and thrive then we have to
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.240
environment and thrive then we have to
create mining operations we have to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
create mining operations we have to
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.540
create mining operations we have to
the ice ice can provide oxygen for

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
the ice ice can provide oxygen for
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.120
the ice ice can provide oxygen for
breathing water for drinking and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130
breathing water for drinking and
 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.270
breathing water for drinking and
hydrogen for rocket fuel and so we have

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
hydrogen for rocket fuel and so we have
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.730
hydrogen for rocket fuel and so we have
to begin a mining operation so that we

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740
to begin a mining operation so that we
 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.490
to begin a mining operation so that we
have the materials to build cities

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
have the materials to build cities
 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.770
have the materials to build cities
materials to build bases oxygen to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
materials to build bases oxygen to
 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.770
materials to build bases oxygen to
breathe water to drink and hydrogen for

breathe water to drink and hydrogen for
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.949
breathe water to drink and hydrogen for
a rocket fuel then the last step in the

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959
a rocket fuel then the last step in the
 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.990
a rocket fuel then the last step in the
process and this will take maybe another

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
process and this will take maybe another
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.949

sending payloads into outer space

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
sending payloads into outer space
 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.410
sending payloads into outer space
dramatically and so people are once

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
dramatically and so people are once
 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.740

again dusting off these old plans to

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
again dusting off these old plans to
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.010
again dusting off these old plans to
create satellites around the earth

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020
create satellites around the earth
 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.960

energy and begin the process of melting

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
energy and begin the process of melting
 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.810
energy and begin the process of melting
the ice caps now once you raise the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820
the ice caps now once you raise the
 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.199
the ice caps now once you raise the
temperature of Mars by about six degrees

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209
temperature of Mars by about six degrees
 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.850
temperature of Mars by about six degrees
once the temperature of Mars rises six

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860
once the temperature of Mars rises six
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.190
once the temperature of Mars rises six
degrees it becomes autocatalytic

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200
degrees it becomes autocatalytic
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.479
degrees it becomes autocatalytic
it takes off it becomes self-feeding

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489
it takes off it becomes self-feeding
 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.400
it takes off it becomes self-feeding
because the more heat you have on Mars

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
because the more heat you have on Mars
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.479
because the more heat you have on Mars
the more carbon dioxide you loft into

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
the more carbon dioxide you loft into
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.310
the more carbon dioxide you loft into
the atmosphere which creates more

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320
the atmosphere which creates more
 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.530
the atmosphere which creates more
greenhouse effect which allows you to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540
greenhouse effect which allows you to
 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.479
greenhouse effect which allows you to
melt even more ice to raise a

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489
melt even more ice to raise a
 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.699
melt even more ice to raise a
temperature even more so you have a

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
temperature even more so you have a
 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.699
temperature even more so you have a
positive feedback loop the question is

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709
positive feedback loop the question is
 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.640
positive feedback loop the question is
can we reach six degrees that's the key

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650
can we reach six degrees that's the key
 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.949
can we reach six degrees that's the key
point if we can raise the surface

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
point if we can raise the surface
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.229
point if we can raise the surface
temperature of Mars by six degrees we

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239
temperature of Mars by six degrees we
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.160
temperature of Mars by six degrees we
can create this artificial spiral by

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
can create this artificial spiral by
 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.650
can create this artificial spiral by
which it feeds on itself and we can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660
which it feeds on itself and we can
 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.750
which it feeds on itself and we can
begin the process of terraforming Mars

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
begin the process of terraforming Mars
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.090
begin the process of terraforming Mars
and so remember robots don't need

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100
and so remember robots don't need
 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.150
and so remember robots don't need
terraforming humans do and so to make

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
terraforming humans do and so to make
 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.910
terraforming humans do and so to make
more suitable for humans that's going to

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920
more suitable for humans that's going to
 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.390
