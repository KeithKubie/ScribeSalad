also many costs so the benefits can fall
 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.470
also many costs so the benefits can fall
into two broad categories the first

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
into two broad categories the first
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.100

so when we express outrage about some
kind of wrongdoing that teaches others

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350
kind of wrongdoing that teaches others
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.560
kind of wrongdoing that teaches others
that that kind of behavior is not going

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
that that kind of behavior is not going
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.840
that that kind of behavior is not going
to be tolerated and it can motivate

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850
to be tolerated and it can motivate
 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.869
to be tolerated and it can motivate
other people to behave morally so that

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879
other people to behave morally so that
 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.549
other people to behave morally so that
they can avoid getting shamed or

Portland so it can be risky to express

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
Portland so it can be risky to express
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.530
Portland so it can be risky to express
outrage it can be uncomfortable

stressful telling somebody to their face
 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.790

that they've done something wrong is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800
that they've done something wrong is
 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.949
that they've done something wrong is
just awkward sometimes so when we are

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959
just awkward sometimes so when we are
 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.630
just awkward sometimes so when we are
expressing outrage we really have to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640
expressing outrage we really have to
 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.729
expressing outrage we really have to
weigh these costs against the benefits

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739
weigh these costs against the benefits
 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.830
weigh these costs against the benefits
and evolution has equipped us

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
and evolution has equipped us
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.520
and evolution has equipped us
a really fine-tuned calculus for making

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
a really fine-tuned calculus for making
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.550
a really fine-tuned calculus for making
these kinds of decisions in

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560
these kinds of decisions in
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.180
these kinds of decisions in
interpersonal and face-to-face

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190

the internet is like gasoline so when we

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650
the internet is like gasoline so when we
 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.910
the internet is like gasoline so when we
think about the costs and benefits of

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
think about the costs and benefits of
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.680
think about the costs and benefits of
expressing outrage what social media

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
expressing outrage what social media
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.640
expressing outrage what social media
does is it turns down all the costs and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650
does is it turns down all the costs and
 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.449
does is it turns down all the costs and
dials up the benefits so expressing

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
dials up the benefits so expressing
 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370
dials up the benefits so expressing
outrage on social media is way easier

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
outrage on social media is way easier
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.850
outrage on social media is way easier
than expressing it offline it's less

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
than expressing it offline it's less
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.449
than expressing it offline it's less
costly you can do it with the click of a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
costly you can do it with the click of a
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.930
costly you can do it with the click of a
button you can join a large crowd so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
button you can join a large crowd so
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.900
button you can join a large crowd so
hiding amongst a lot of other people

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
hiding amongst a lot of other people
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.110
hiding amongst a lot of other people
really takes down the riskiness of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
really takes down the riskiness of
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.150
really takes down the riskiness of
expressing outrage towards a person

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
expressing outrage towards a person
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.000
expressing outrage towards a person
who's who's broken some norm and of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
who's who's broken some norm and of
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.680
who's who's broken some norm and of
course it it dials up the benefits

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
course it it dials up the benefits
 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.600
course it it dials up the benefits
you're getting social feedback likes

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610
you're getting social feedback likes
 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.979
you're getting social feedback likes
from your friends retweets shares and

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989
from your friends retweets shares and
 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.229
from your friends retweets shares and
the audience of course is so much bigger

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
the audience of course is so much bigger
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.170
the audience of course is so much bigger
on social media than it is offline so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
on social media than it is offline so
 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.740
on social media than it is offline so
the reputational benefits of expressing

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
the reputational benefits of expressing
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.590
the reputational benefits of expressing
outrage are massively bigger when you

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600
outrage are massively bigger when you
 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.940
outrage are massively bigger when you
take it online

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
take it online
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.750
take it online
so moral outrage is really interesting

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
so moral outrage is really interesting
 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.599
so moral outrage is really interesting
because of its reputational benefits and

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609
because of its reputational benefits and
 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.380
because of its reputational benefits and
it can be contrasted with cyberbullying

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
it can be contrasted with cyberbullying
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.900
it can be contrasted with cyberbullying
for example both are aggressive kinds of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
for example both are aggressive kinds of
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.110
for example both are aggressive kinds of
behaviors but the one expresses that you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
behaviors but the one expresses that you
 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.520
behaviors but the one expresses that you
are a morally good person and the other

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
are a morally good person and the other
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.280
are a morally good person and the other
has rather the opposite effect so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
has rather the opposite effect so
 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.470
has rather the opposite effect so
research on cyberbullying seems to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480
research on cyberbullying seems to
 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.349
research on cyberbullying seems to
suggest that anonymity that's often

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359
suggest that anonymity that's often
 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.599
suggest that anonymity that's often
found online increases cyberbullying but

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609
found online increases cyberbullying but
 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.890
found online increases cyberbullying but
there are fewer studies on this but it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
there are fewer studies on this but it
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.259
there are fewer studies on this but it
seems like the opposite occurs in the

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269
seems like the opposite occurs in the
 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.000
seems like the opposite occurs in the
case of moral outrage expression online

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
case of moral outrage expression online
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.340
case of moral outrage expression online
so there is one recent study that looked

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350
so there is one recent study that looked
 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.129
so there is one recent study that looked
at expressions of outrage in an online

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139
at expressions of outrage in an online
 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.460
at expressions of outrage in an online
political forum in Germany and in this

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470
political forum in Germany and in this
 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.310
political forum in Germany and in this
study they they looked at the effects of

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
study they they looked at the effects of
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.420
study they they looked at the effects of
being anonymous versus identified on how

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430
being anonymous versus identified on how
 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.610
being anonymous versus identified on how
aggressive the language was in these

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
aggressive the language was in these
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.339
aggressive the language was in these
posts that had to do with social

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349
posts that had to do with social
 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.490
posts that had to do with social
policies

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500
policies
 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.850
