00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:05.718
but the last two would have been abnormal.

00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:08.161
And the reason is when you work out the Delta T

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.946
in percent, you find that this one over here is a

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:14.006
0.104% change, but it’s just too much for a single

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.444
trade. And this one is an amazing 2.3% change

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:20.735
within a single trade. And those clearly trigger

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:24.735
