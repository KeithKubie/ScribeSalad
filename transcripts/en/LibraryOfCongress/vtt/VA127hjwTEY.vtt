00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.830
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Our
next panel will be speaking

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.220
about accessibility, the
panels' accessibility matters,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.380
reaching readers
with disabilities.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
And the moderator of our
panel is Laura Bailet--

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.770
Bailet, excuse me.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.190
She is a Library of
Congress Literacy Awards,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.300
Advisory Board Member, and she
is the Chief Academic Officer

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.630
of Kaplan Early Learning
Company.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.730
Please welcome Laura
Bailet [applause].

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Thank you.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.990
Thank you everyone.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.710
Good afternoon.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.570
The focus of our panel today is
on the millions of Americans,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.520
both children and adults,
who struggle with reading.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.760
The Washington Post ran an
article on November 1st,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.930
2016 that was entitled
"Hiding in plain sight:

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.420
The adult literacy crisis."

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.130
Trouble with reading truly
is a hidden disability.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.810
The majority of people in this
category have no outward signs

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.700
of a problem, and they're
typically quite intelligent.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450
They're also highly
motivated to keep others

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.460
from knowing that
they can't read.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.320
Somebody on an earlier panel
mentioned the same associated

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.030
with being a struggling reader
and that's a huge issue,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.000
the shame and embarrassment.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.160
So this is not something that
they share freely with friends,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.260
with co-workers, with educators,
with their health providers,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.590
and their own family may not
even recognize the extent

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.260
of the problem.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.180
So many people in the public
at large simply aren't aware

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.470
that a problem this big exists.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670
Our panel today is going to
share some insights on Americans

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.750
who struggle with reading
for a variety of reasons

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.640
and also talk-- will talk
about the types of programs

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.760
and technology that can
help them gain access

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.130
to printed materials.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.400
So I have a couple of slides
just with some basic statistics

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.760
on the scope and impact of
reading struggles for children

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.010
and for adults in
the United States.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.400
The first two slides
are an infographic

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000
from the National Center
on Learning Disabilities.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.210
We're not going to go
through all the statistics,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.040
but basically one in five
American children struggles

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.810
with a significant learning
or attention challenge,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.110
and the vast majority of them
do struggle with reading.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.940
Learning to read is a
challenging task for the brain.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.890
So we shouldn't really
be surprise

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.250
that so many people
struggle with it,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.860
but nonetheless this
is a problem which--

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.160
with which nationally,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.510
we're really honestly not
making very good progress.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.870
And it's important to understand
that the majority of children

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.850
who struggle with reading
unfortunately today grow

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.900
into adults who are still
struggling with reading.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.290
And let's see.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.950
This is-- this slide
is from ProLiteracy,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.790
the adult literacy
education organization.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.620
They do fantastic work.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.920
Proliteracy.org is
their website.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.410
And you can see here
about 36 million adults

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.400
in the United States cannot
read at a third grade level.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.640
But it's estimated that
up to 50% of adults

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.790
in the United States cannot read
and comprehend a book written

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130
at the eight grade level.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.580
Fifty percent, I mean
that's a lot of people.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.260
And we know that
children of parents

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.340
who are poor readers
have a higher probability

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.090
of being a poor reader
themselves.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.830
There's the genetic component.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.570
Dyslexia for example is
very strongly inherited.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.370
If an adult has dyslexia, each
of their children has a 30

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.160
to 50% chance of
having dyslexia.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.780
But then if you're
an adult poor reader,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.690
you're probably not going to
surround yourself with books

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.080
and other printed
materials in your home.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.160
You're probably not going to
model reading for pleasure

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.300
or information for
your children.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.600
And you're probably not going

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.760
to read very many books
with your children.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.600
And so, this is a major
intergenerational challenge.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.670
So now, I'm going to turn
things over to Kristen Fernekes,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.440
and she's going to talk about
people with reading challenges

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.890
as a result of physical
disabilities and the services

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.440
that the Library of
Congress offers to them.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.210
So Kristen.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.510
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes:
Should I come up there--

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.230
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: If you
want you can stay seated

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.530
or you can go up
there and stand.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.830
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes: I think
I'm just going to stay here.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.910
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet:
All right, do it.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.210
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.680
I really, really appreciate it.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.260
The group with whom I
work here at the Library

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.740
of Congress is the National
Library Service for the Blind

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.920
and Physically Handicapped.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.050
We refer to it as NLS because
we have quite a long name.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.170
NLS began in 1931 to
serve specifically adult

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.470
who were blind.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.020
Over a period of time, over,
you know, the more than 85 years

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.710
that we've been around,
we've evolved our services

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.720
over a period of time
to reach a larger

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.890
and larger group of people.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:20.790
So we serve people who are both
blind and visually impaired,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.760
people who have physical
disabilities that prevent them

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.610
from being able to hold a book.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.790
And to a lesser extent, we serve
individuals who have dyslexia

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.160
and other issues that may
prevent having accessibility

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.540
to regular print materials.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.000
NLS serves people through
absolute spectacular network

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.300
of libraries around the country,
every state, Guam, Puerto Rico,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.640
who-- to whom we serve by
providing them with materials.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.580
So the types of materials
that we provide are braille,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.150
e-braille, audio books, and then

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.540
of course we do have a download
service which is of course

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.090
in keeping with-- how a lot

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.210
of people are accessing
materials right now.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.370
In addition to books, which of
course there's a lot of ways

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.800
that you can get audio books,
but we also provide magazines,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.100
guides, things that you
wouldn't necessarily think

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.270
of for individuals who have
trouble reading print materials,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.280
things like tax guides,
nutrition guides,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.580
and so on and so forth.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.910
So that puts us in a position
of being somewhat unique.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.940
We're very proud
of our collection,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.840
which at this point is hundreds

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.280
of thousands, over
200,000 pieces.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.750
We also provide music scores and
music instructional materials

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.050
and so on and so forth.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:17.900
So we're trying to fill-- think
of void where we want to take

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.740
into consideration that
there's a lot of people

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.350
that just have trouble
with what's available

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.810
from a print perspective, and
so we're constantly looking

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.830
at where does need exists and
then trying to address them.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.990
Increasingly, the
individuals that we're serving

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.960
with aging [inaudible] and
so on and so forth are people

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.850
who may not have been
blind their entire life

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.480
but have decreasing
capacity seeing.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.790
So we know that that
number is going up.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.820
And recently we have been--

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.660
we've launched a pretty
extensive outreach campaign

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.220
to make sure that people
are aware of these services

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.870
because they are provided free.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:11.340
And we want to make sure
that people can read.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.700
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Great,
thank you so much.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.190
So I'm really intrigued
about e-braille.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.380
So we'll have to come
back and you have

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.120
to tell me how that works.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.420
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes: Yes.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.950
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: And now Dr.
Elsa Cardenas-Hagan is going

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.710
to talk a little bit more about
individuals with dyslexia,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.600
and she also has
a lot of expertise

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.240
on dual language learners

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.400
and the multiple challenges
they face with learning to read

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.360
and becoming lifelong readers.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.660
So Elsa.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.960
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Yes, thank you.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.260
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: And
there are your slides.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.560
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
What do you--

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.860
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Yes,
that's the remote,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.160
so the green will advance.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.460
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Thank you.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.250
Good afternoon and thank you for
sticking with us this afternoon.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.510
I'm Elsa Cardenas-Hagan and
I am an English learner.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.150
So I understand the
experience of an English learner

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.990
and during my time was when
there was no such thing

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.680
as bilingual education
and where we were punished

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.810
if we used our native
language in the school ground

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.630
and in the lunch room.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.710
And so, you know, as a
young girl, being terrified

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.600
to speak your home language
and then not realizing

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.990
that your home language is
such a beautiful language

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.790
and such a beautiful
thing and I didn't realize

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.720
that until middle school
because in middle school,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.680
that is when you take
foreign language.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.520
And all of a sudden, I
could shine as they look

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.560
at what I know and look
at my culture and look

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.860
at the things that I know.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.580
But it was like, OK, hide
who you in these early years

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.920
but now no, we will
not hide who we are.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.300
And so a beautiful thing is
that we now have available

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.310
to children-- you
know, when I heard

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.020
that somebody is saying
I'm an ESL specialist,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.290
English as a second language
specialist, and that's great

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.460
because there's less than 3% of
them in our whole United States,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.150
less than 3% and yet we're
the fastest growing population

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.110
in our schools.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.260
And so, you know,
we talk about--

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.810
you know, we want
to be prepared.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.950
We want to reach these students.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.110
We want to reach, you know, all
our African-American population.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.970
We want to know about the
culture and the language

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.930
so that they will want
to be responsive to us,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.200
so that they will
want to be engaged

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.620
and enthusiastic about learning.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.010
And I hope Benita is still
here because I have my little--

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.400
there she is, my own
dedication to Barbara Bush.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.660
And unfortunately
Benita accepted this

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.570
but I was giving a speech in
Houston and talking about all

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.730
of our reading reform efforts
and about how, you know,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.920
I lived in one of the
poorest communities

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.000
of the whole United States
for a middle size city.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.680
And despite that, through
our efforts, you know,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.700
we've been able to-- and
we know it's a 100% frame

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.000
reduced length.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.300
We feed them breakfast
and lunch and we have

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.260
after school programs that,
you know, also give dinner.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.410
But we keep them there, you
know, to do the extra things,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.060
you know, the arts and the
music and the books and reading.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.660
But one of the things when I
gave a speech, I had so wanted

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.050
to meet Mrs. Barbara Bush.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.280
And I was in Houston and
I didn't get to meet her

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.130
because there was like a
thousand people that day

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.330
and she was there
in the audience.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.130
And so I went back to my own
community and I thought oh,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.840
I missed the chance
to, you know,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.860
at least great a
former first lady.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.510
How cool would that be?

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.620
Well, I get a phone call
at my office and says,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.990
it's Mrs. Barbara
Bush on the line.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.340
And I was like, hello,
is that you Juanito,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.900
playing a joke on me, you know.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.080
Because I talked
about how I didn't get

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.140
to meet the first lady.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.530
They go, no, for real,
this is Mrs. Bush.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:55.600
And then she says, you go girl,
you blew me away and I'm going

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.420
to have you come to my
celebration of reading

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.440
in Houston, and you're going to
tell about the works that you do

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.700
and you're going
to write a speech.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.400
And I'm like, Mrs. Bush,
I don't write speeches.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.220
I just-- I'm a storyteller
and I tell the story of what--

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.520
you know, the work that we do.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.300
She was, no, you're going
to write your speech.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.180
So I'm like, yes, ma'am.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.680
So I wrote that speech.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.800
I'm like, who are the
other speakers by the way?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.550
She goes, oh, you know,
H. W. and George W.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.750
and [inaudible] all
this, Mrs. Baker.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.230
And I was like, oh my God.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.410
So I write the speech
and I send it to her.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.280
And she calls me back
and she goes, well,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.130
let's talk a little bit
more about your speech.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.430
I'm like, yes ma'am.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.110
And she goes, you know,
you mentioned George W.,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.890
don't mention him, you know.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.310
And she goes, this is
nothing about the Bush's.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.040
It's about what you did in your
local community and nothing

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.010
about the governor of our
state and how he helped you.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.490
And I'm like, yes ma'am.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.660
And I said, well, while
I got you on the line,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.820
I need a little bit more
money and I know you're going

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.710
to raise millions of dollars
that evening, so do you mind

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.610
if I talk about children
also with dyslexia

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.420
and I would have a dream that in
one of the poorest communities

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.870
that we would have an expert on
every campus in our city to work

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.310
with these children who are
English learners, who, you know,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.370
have these disabilities, you
know, these hidden disabilities

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.660
that no one knows and
we just weave around.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.420
And she goes, well, how
much are you needing, right?

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.850
And so I tell her the
amount and she says,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.850
you may put that
in there, you know.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.150
And I'm like, OK.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.450
So that evening, I get there

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.770
and Benita knows
exactly what happened.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.950
So I get there and I gave my
speech and I kind of weave

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.170
in there that we're
still working.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.850
And at the end of my speech,
Mrs. Barbara Bush comes up

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.240
and she goes, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.180
I have a huge surprise
for Dr. Cardenas-Hagan,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.160
here's your check,
no questions asked.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.840
I about fainted.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.000
Actually I screamed
and jumped, but anyway.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.030
And she says, I trust
you to do the job.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.000
And so two years later-- and I
wanted to follow up with you,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.790
I was able to report
back to her and said,

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.190
I have some very good news.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.880
Mrs. Bush, I have
good news to share.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.120
We have a dyslexia
therapist in every campus

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.780
of our city in every school.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.020
And I'm here today to tell
you [applause]-- so between--

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.250
that was between the years
of 2011 and 2013 and I'm here

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.620
to tell you in 2018,
we still have that.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.920
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Wow,
that great, that's great.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.220
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
We keep sustainability.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.520
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet:
Sustainability, that's huge.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.980
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: And
so, through this work --

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.530
and I say, you know, Mrs. Bush
cared very much about, you know,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.810
all people that they
would be literacy--

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.500
and that they would achieve
literacy because she had

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.810
such a love of literacy.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.070
And also I had personal
experience with, you know,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.720
a child who had difficulty
in these--

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.430
those early years with literacy.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.960
And so I'm here today to talk
to you about these children,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.030
about what Laura
here is telling you

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.730
about that hidden
disability, that being dyslexia

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.350
and what goes around, and
I am the Vice President

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.320
of the International
Dyslexia Association.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.240
And so, we are on a mission to
really promote what we want,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.820
a term to be used today
called structured literacy.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.410
And that's a term that
we want to really promote

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.560
as here we have these
students who were so bright,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.310
so intelligent, nothing
to do with intelligence

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.220
but they struggle
with these, you know,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.840
skills of how do you read,
how does reading work.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.250
And as we look at this and as
we see in this, Laura mentioned

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.140
to you the majority of children

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.550
in special education
services are there

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.010
because of a reading disability,
and we will tell you 15 to 20%

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.380
of those kids have dyslexia.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.370
And as we look at this, we see,
what are the issues with them?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.360
So, one of the primary issues
is that they have trouble just

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.470
with the simple things of being
able to process those sounds.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.450
And, you know, I'm a Spanish
speaker so we don't have

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.600
as many sounds in our language
as you do in yours, you know.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.990
Some will say 44 to
46 sounds and we have

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.580
about half of that many sounds.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.550
And so, just that ability
to process those sounds.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.550
And, you know, a lot of research
into exactly where that is

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.090
in the brain, Heschl's gyrus,
the left angular gyrus.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.510
And if you don't have that,
then how are you going

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.580
to put those letters
and sounds together

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.640
for those early literacy skills.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.010
Most kids can read and they
don't need these foundational

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.450
skills but dyslexic children
will not be able to do it

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.790
without learning how
does reading work.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.020
And they try to trick you
because they're so smart

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.630
and they depend upon
their visual memory.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.090
And finally, you know,
things fall apart

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.760
by the time all this reading
to learn or when the text gets

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.740
so complex, they can't
handle that, right?

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.330
And so, as we look at that,
the other things, so they have

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.170
that trouble with the
phonological component

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.910
of the language, taking in those
sounds, putting those sounds

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.370
to those symbols, but also, you
know, their spelling will be

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.350
where you'll really,
really see it.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.560
Spanish speakers, you know,
the language is transparent

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.470
and so you'll see that,
you know what, they're able

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.530
to come along, it seems
like their decoding is OK,

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.080
and where you'll find it is they
won't be very fluent readers

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.350
and their spelling will
very clearly suffer.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.740
And so, what are the
secondary things that we see?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.730
Well, if I don't have access to
be able and the ability to be--

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.020
you know, I need access
that you talk about.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.980
But now I can't read what's
in front of me and I want

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.990
so desperately to be able
to do this and I'm smarter

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.090
than this other kid that can
do it right next to me, right?

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.290
And so what do we see
as secondary problems?

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.340
Well, then you don't read.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.450
And because you don't
read, what will suffer?

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.450
Your vocabulary will
suffer, you know.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.780
Your reading, you're
not going to read--

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.770
if you can't read
accurately or fluently,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.030
eventually your reading
and comprehension is going

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.910
to suffer, and then certainly
your written language.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.030
But the other thing is,
what are some early signs?

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.260
And so-- I'm a speech and
language pathologist and so

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.920
as I look at children,
when we see these children

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.050
with these speech disorders
called phonological processing

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.600
disorders, and we're trying to
really do the studies right now

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.400
to really predict which ones

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.490
of these phonological processing
disorders will have dyslexia

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.790
and which ones won't.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.090
So that means these children--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.640
have you ever seen children
that when they speak to you,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.620
they're really little
toddlers, go-go-ga-ga.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.020
You don't understand
anything that they're saying.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.540
Well, we figure out in their
speech and language world

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.460
that they have a phonological
processing disorder and we can,

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.290
you know, really remediate that.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.280
We work with them intensely.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.780
But we follow those children
very carefully because many

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.560
of them may also
have this disability

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.130
that we know of as dyslexia.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.980
And the other thing is, you
know, dyslexia, this is a myth

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.690
that it's a visual disorder.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.390
People think it's seeing things
backwards or mirror reading.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.570
In fact, you know, why
would they do that?

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.350
Well, it's about disability
to sequence and the ability

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.870
for directionality, knowing,
you know, that you do this first

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.280
and next and left, my
right side, my left side.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.760
Some of us-- Actually
they've seen

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.470
that some us women have
trouble with that too, right?

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.340
But I know to ask
for directions.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.440
And the other thing is the
early things of just, you know,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.050
when we play with language,
you know, you all talk

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.520
about Dr. Seuss books.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.580
You know, rhyming,
rhyming is so important.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.430
And these are things
that we've not only found

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.170
out about the English
language, the Spanish language,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.860
alphabetic languages,
but we've also seen it

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.600
in non-alphabetic languages
that how important this is.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.140
So this center-- this reading
center of the brain that we see

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.160
in this left temporal lobe
is also your language center.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.260
And so I heard earlier
today mentioned about--

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.190
you mentioned about listening
and speaking and reading

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.460
and writing and being
a storyteller.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.860
But, you know, literacy
really, you know, we have--

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.930
we must have these
opportunities for language

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.750
to have ultimate
goal of literacy,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.890
and that ultimate goal is that
deep understanding of text

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.940
and the enjoyment and
the ability to be engaged

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.000
and motivated about it.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.640
And so, because of these issues,
we start to feel really bad

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.120
about ourselves if you
have these disabilities.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.360
And what will end up
happening for these students,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.220
if they don't have an expert
teacher that can help them

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.750
and work through
these, what will end

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.970
up happening is we
see high levels--

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.580
you know, the National
Institute of Child Health

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.720
and Human Development
sponsors our research.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.870
And they sponsor it because we
want to prevent these issues

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.050
of reading disabilities but
also mental health disabilities.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.860
Because these individuals become
very anxious and depressed

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.700
about there inability to
read, and when they know,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.350
I am just as smart as any-- this
person and anybody in this room.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.050
And so, we see these issues,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.980
issues also related
to attention.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.190
About 40% of our dyslexic
students will also have issues

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.730
with attention, and so we
want to really get this early

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.580
and remediate it early.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.650
And so, our mission now is--
and I've had the opportunity to,

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.560
you know, really
understand about this.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.750
And through the National
Institute of Child Health

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.410
and Human Development
grants and the Institute

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.480
of Education Sciences at the
Department of Ed, we've been--

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.960
you know, our research has
been funded and we've been able

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.800
to look at these English
learners and we've been able

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.920
to look at these children
with issues such as dyslexia,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.430
and we've been able to
look across languages

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.970
and see what's going
on across languages.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.000
And finally, understanding
how beautiful it is

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.910
to be biliterate, to be--

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.910
you know, to be able to
read across languages.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.490
But to know that
having that ability

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.010
in one language will help
you in that second language.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:06.610
And so, we are looking now at
making sure that all children--

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.850
so, our initiatives
now are to look

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.020
in the general education
classrooms in these early years

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.900
to make sure that children have
access to beautiful language,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.490
to understanding
how languages work,

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.800
to understanding those
sound system, the phonology,

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.160
understanding the morphology,
those words and word parts.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.880
Sixty percent of the English
language comes from Latin.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.670
And these, you know,
Latin and Greek roots

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.350
which we call morphemes,
those are so important for us,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.040
for learning the vocabulary,
the second language.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.310
But also understanding
how it works and puts--

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.990
how we put language
together for sentences,

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.440
how sentences make paragraphs,
and how we're able to read.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.490
And so, just really looking at
that ability to get to what?

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.790
What is our goal?

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.990
To have a wonderful
comprehension

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.930
and comprehension skills, but
first we have to make sure

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.690
that they also have those
early literacy skills

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.920
of being able to read.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.220
So, the--

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.520
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Elsa.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.820
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.120
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: You know,
I'm going to be mindful

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.420
of time then maybe give
Lydia a chance to--

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.720
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yes.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.020
So, here's my-- yeah.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.320
Just here is my last slide.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.620
So the last slide here just
shows, we want deep levels

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.400
of comprehension and expression

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.990
and lifelong reading
and writing habits.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.810
And we can start early and
we can work with our teachers

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.100
in the general education
classrooms to really achieve

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.350
and we won't stop until
everyone can read.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.650
Thank you [applause].

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.980
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: It
will circle back to you.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.770
And now, we have Dr. Lydia
Carlis and she's going

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.750
to talk a little bit more
about the literacy challenges

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.800
of persons with-- of color.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.690
And you can sit or you can stand
however you want to do that.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.240
And then, we're going to
talk a little bit more

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.800
about some solutions
and technology.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.710
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: So,
I'm-- I am Lydia Carlis.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:58.870
And I am going to not talk
generally about people of color

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.660
but specifically
about black children.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:08.030
And just say that a lot of
the same issues and concerns

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:13.230
that Elsa just shared are
also issues and concerns

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.160
for African-American
children learning English,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.330
learning this-- the language
of instruction and the language

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.600
of business in schools.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.930
So, if African-American children
speak African-American English

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.370
at home and they do not
learn how to code-switch,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.930
then they will be-- have
trouble reading later,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:42.480
they will have trouble
learning to read early.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.750
One of the statistics that I
read in my doctoral program

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.120
that really solidified it for
me that I was going to work

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.140
in early childhood was that
67% of children, who struggle

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.990
to read in kindergarten,
continue to struggle

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.800
to read in third grade.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.780
And so, while we have a country

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.770
that does not have
universal preschool,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.200
that often does not
have mandatory

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.370
or full-day kindergarten, we
know that there are so much

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.330
that we can be doing
for children

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.480
who struggle the most early,
and we should be doing that.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.950
And that is especially
important for children who need

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:29.130
to learn both the language
of instruction and continue

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.050
to value the language
that they speak at home,

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.190
the dialect that
they speak at home.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.210
So, a lot-- there's
research coming out now

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:42.790
that bidialectism is just as
been official as bilingualism.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.800
So, for your brain--
children who can do

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.750
that code-switching
do have efficiency

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.750
in both languages
is very important.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.260
So, this is something
to value and celebrate

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.350
with African-American
children and not to talk

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.230
about proper English
versus improper English,

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.160
but talk about language of
school, language of instruction

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.210
and your home language,
your home--

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.240
like what you speak at
home is just as valuable.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.200
But we want to give
you opportunities

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.120
and that's the same way that
we look at it with children

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.090
who come to us speaking Spanish.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.800
But we don't always tell
African-American parents,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.140
please talk to your child
in your home dialect.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.690
I've never heard
teachers say that.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.570
But we will now, we
know what to say.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.610
Please read to your child
now in your home language

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.290
or whichever language is
most comfortable for you.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.110
So those are the kinds of
things that we should be saying

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.850
to families of African-American
children as well.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.940
And I think I'll stop there.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.820
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Yeah, I
think I've read some research

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.820
where that code-switching
either between a dialect

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.070
and a more formal version
of a language or between two

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.960
or more actual different
languages really fosters working

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.090
memory and it also
improves executive function

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.180
because you're having
to really attend

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.790
to multiple cues simultaneously
and instantaneously decide,

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.950
I need to speak in this
language right now.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.560
I remember when I was working
in the clinic years ago,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.430
I ran a neurocognitive
assessment program

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.730
in the neurology division--

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.370
Child Neurology Division
in a clinic in Florida

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.360
and I had a little four-year-old
who was referred to me

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.710
for question of language
disorder.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:38.250
He came from a Spanish-speaking
home and his English was behind.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.950
But I had an intern
working with me who was

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.380
from Colombia, South America.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.820
And she only spoke to him
in English but clearly

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.470
with a Spanish accent.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.010
I obviously don't
have a Spanish accent.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.560
And this child instantaneously
would speak Spanish to my intern

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.320
and speak English to me and I
said, OK, we're going to find

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.260
out what your child's
strengths are

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.680
and if there are any weaknesses,

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.260
but he doesn't have
a language disorder

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.350
because he is sorting it
out very, very quickly.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.380
And that's that code-switching
that is really great

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.740
for executive function
and frontal lobe function.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.390
And now there's research
actually showing

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.720
that being bilingual or
trilingual is protective

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.200
of Alzheimer's in later life.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.670
So bad for those of us who
are monolingual but, you know,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.440
we'll have to do
the best we can.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.590
So I would love for each
of you to share things

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:36.030
that you're doing in your
program or other programs

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.880
that you're aware of
that are solutions.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.700
Elsa, I know you were--
you're getting right--

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.690
you were getting right to
talk more before I kind

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.600
of cut you off to give Lydia
a chance but to talk about--

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.090
we do know how to teach
struggling readers to read.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.680
I mean, it's not necessarily
easy for all of them,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.630
but we know what to do and
there are many examples

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.630
where this is working.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.910
And it's interesting today there
hasn't been much discussion

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.100
about the use of technology

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.480
for struggling readers
even though many of us--

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.920
even though we're good readers,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.340
also avail ourselves
of audio books.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.020
So I want to also spend some
time talking about technology.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.250
So I don't know who wants
to go first, I can't choose.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.090
It's like choosing
my favorite child,

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.390
you know, I can't do that.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.690
So one of you jump in
there to share an example

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.620
of something you know that's
working well or some technology.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.920
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Well, one of the things we--

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.560
I mean, there's so
much available now

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.590
and a lot of it is for free.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.700
And so for children with
disabilities, I mean, we--

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.930
you know, some of them have, you
know, they don't want to write,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.230
they don't want to read.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.860
So some of the things
we do as we get them

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.490
into that reading is, you know,
we would use your services

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.050
that you have for
the audio books.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.930
We use Learning Ally.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.870
But the other thing is like
just to get them even to want

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.880
to also tell their stories
and write, we use things

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.740
like Dragon Speak,
which is, you know,

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.230
something that they
can just, you know,

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.530
download and get for free.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.290
They can just, you know,
download and get for free.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.890
And then they love that.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.340
They see-- seen what they've
said in print and that gets them

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.950
to be more encouraged
about that.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.740
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes: You had
asked a question about e-braille

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.730
and I did want to just
follow up about that.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.750
E-braille is amazing to me.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.370
It's-- So, again, we have
printed braille materials

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.710
available to our patrons.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:35.670
We also distribute our books
and what is-- it's a format BRF.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.710
So, these files can be
downloaded and then imported

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.210
to a digital braille reader,
which is a amazing machine

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:50.450
that basically just sort of--
to I've described as a ticker.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.400
The pins come up to
represent the braille words,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.280
which is something
that we're moving--

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.890
not only are we moving toward
more books in e-braille,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.150
we are also working to try

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:09.150
and produce a more
affordable e-braille machine.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.880
So, they're wonderful machines.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.180
They're little bit fragile

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.610
because you can imagine
you've got pins were popping

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.640
up all the time.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.800
And they're also
non-inexpensive.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.040
So, it's such a quick way to
be able to distribute books

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.380
and other materials to
people, so it's something

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.590
that NLS is really pursuing.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.200
And my director just
went to a huge conference

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.610
out in California, where
people coming from all

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:39.720
over the world looking for
ways to create this technology

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.830
in a way that is really going
to be more accessible to people.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:48.240
Because, you know, if you--
there's something very--

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.750
in speaking to my colleagues
who use braille all the time,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.640
I think there's something
about taking that information

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.490
in that way that
it's very familiar

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.460
and it's something that-- for
anybody who feels, you know,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.980
this deep love of reading
books, there's also this type

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.280
of component of it to it.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.580
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Right.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.880
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes: So
we do want to mention

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.180
that we can achieve
that and make it

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.480
as successful as possible.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.160
It's amazing technology.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.460
We're hoping to get it out--

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.760
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Wow.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.060
&gt;&gt; Kristen Fernekes:
-- to more people.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.690
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: And I was
just on a plane this morning,

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:24.250
I wasn't supposed to be
but I was, and before I got

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.250
on the plane from the hotel
to the airport there was a mom

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.850
from a small town in
Alabama and she's talking

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.510
about her first grade reader
who was struggling with reading

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.660
and not getting all the help
she wanted from the teacher.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:45.710
So one of-- Two resources that I
gave her were, one was Raz-Kids,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:51.170
reading A to Z. But the Raz-Kids
portion of it is online,

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:56.200
allows the children to
read but also to read

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.760
into the book and it records it.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.500
So, when I was a teacher a long
time ago, that was very helpful

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.800
for me because I
could go back later

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.590
and actually analyze
the children's reading,

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.710
whereas I wouldn't have time
to do that with every child

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.060
in the room right
at that moment.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.680
So I gave her that resource

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.880
and then the kids were also just
more motivated because it was

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.880
on a computer and it
was pretty and animated.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.730
And then a newer resource is
called Beanstack and it is

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.110
like a Fitbit for books.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:37.570
And so, you know, I'm around
babies now and toddlers

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:42.480
and preschoolers, and babies
know how to swipe, right?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.460
They are using technology
more and more early

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.910
in their-- early in life.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:53.880
And so, the ability for
them to get badges and see

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.600
where they're following
is motivating for kids.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.560
So, that's another resource.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.230
They could-- It's
really used now a lot

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.950
in summer reading programs.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.290
So that's a cool thing
that you can suggest

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.760
to families and teachers.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.600
And I want to say
one more thing.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.010
Oh, and the other thing
is ensuring that you have

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.430
as many culturally
relevant books as possible

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.160
from the earliest age.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.460
So-- And not just--
There are a lot of books

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.940
for African-American students
children now, or not a lot,

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.900
but there are some books
there but many of them focus

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:39.230
on I love my hair or
things that are important,

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.510
but are not getting
into academics

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.270
and I can be a chemist,
I can be--

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:52.330
you know, I have an ability to
see myself as an academic, as--

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.490
whatever it is that
they want to do.

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:58.820
And that is super
important that we continue

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.710
to create more culturally
relevant books

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:09.150
that reflect the children doing
things that are aspirational.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.870
So just trying to make
sure that you find those

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.880
for kids as young as possible.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.490
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: And Lydia,
I think you mentioned to me

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:21.730
that you've worked with
First Book on that topic

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.550
and First Book was one
of the award winner--

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.750
Rubenstein Award
winners for the Library

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.420
of Congress Literacy Awards
Program a couple of years ago.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.720
So, can you--

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.020
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: Sure.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.320
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: -- comment
a little bit on that?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.620
This is a topic that the
Literacy Awards Board has

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.870
discussed fairly regularly,
is the issue of diversity in--

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.170
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: Yes.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.470
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: -- books
for children and adults.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.940
And I know all the
publishers are focusing on that

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.240
but I'd love to hear more

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.670
about what you're
doing with First Book.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.460
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: So, I
am a fan of First Book.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.810
I have not have actually
worked with First Book.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.150
But First Book, what I loved
about what they're doing is

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:03.410
that they have a whole-- I
won't even say as a section,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:09.480
they have an initiative ensure
that books that are written

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.860
by people with color, that
reflect people of color,

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.080
are prominently shared with
schools, with organizations

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.150
that needs to get books.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.250
And so that is super
exciting for me because I want

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:28.430
to see the kids represented in
the books that they are reading.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.980
And when I was at
AppleTree Institute,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.880
one of our initiatives
was to write books.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.370
We wrote over a 120
books while I was there.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:43.020
Sixty-six percent of them
feature children of color.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.420
And the reason that-- or
people of color, and the reason

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.410
that we did that was because
when we went and spent weeks,

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.710
I sent the writers and
had them spend weeks

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.330
in the library areas, we
could not find many books

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.220
that we're talking about physics
and astronomy or archeology

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.510
and paleontology, or earth
science that had people

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.250
of color dominate in
what was happening,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:16.540
but our schools were 97, you
know, 95% African-American

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.780
and there was no one that was--

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.890
that looked like
them represented.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.930
So, we were able to do that work

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.350
for the curriculum
that we were writing.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.480
And so now when I see more
organizations that are doing

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.560
that more broadly and then
trying to curate and make sure

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.310
that everyone has access
to books like that,

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.020
it just does my heart good.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.820
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: So for those
of you who are mindful of time,

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.210
God gave me permission
to go a little bit longer

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.680
so I'm going to take it.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.590
So, we have a few more minutes.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.540
And I did want to point out to
you the last couple of slides

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.630
that we-- that my panel
collectively created.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.530
This is not an exhaustive
list of technology resources

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:04.520
but it's a good sampling of
some of the technology resources

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.270
that are available
or websites that talk

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.340
about resources that
are available.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.780
So, Reading Rockets is on there.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.590
So I have two slides because
there are so many things now.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.510
Audible.com is the
Amazon one writes.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.810
So that one you have to pay for.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.150
I was on that website very
briefly this past week

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.090
in preparation for the panel
and they actually had a quote

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.680
on there, it said,
"Listening is the new reading."

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.980
So, remember that because
I want to circle back.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.920
I want to canvass this
group and see what you think

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.700
about that, but it's
interesting.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.730
And then Lydia mentioned
Beanstack, Bookshare,

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:50.330
Colorin Colorado, Dyslexia
Yale, IDA's new website,

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.180
and I'm coming back
to you, Elsa.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.480
I have a question for you.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.500
Headstrong Nation is a
really interesting website

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.290
that was created by Ben Foss,

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.630
who's an absolutely brilliant
guy with very severe dyslexia

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.770
and ADHD by his own admission.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:10.760
And he-- on his website
teaches struggling readers how

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.310
to access audible text.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.440
And so I was on his
website and I hate to admit

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.330
that I did not know this.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:24.650
But on every Microsoft computer
now that is reasonably recent

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.560
and on every reasonably
recent Apple computer,

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.170
it is already built it.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.470
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.770
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: You can get--

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.790
You can get audible on
everything that's on there.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:37.280
Everything-- Whatever page
you're on, you just right click

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.100
and then it says read aloud, and
it just reads it aloud to you.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.400
It's amazing.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.090
So, there's incredible resources
for people who either struggle

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.130
to read or for whatever
reason, they prefer to listen

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.990
to something because
they're driving

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.910
or because it's just easier for
them to process information.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:02.820
So that's already available
on tablets and on computers.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:08.800
And then there are-- I put the--
your website, the loc.gov/nls.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.170
Learningally.org has-- I can't
remember how many hundreds

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.820
of thousands of book titles.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.790
You do have to pay
for that service.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.120
A lot of school systems
purchased that service

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.430
so that the child or the
family doesn't have to pay,

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:29.360
but you can order any book
and it is actually read

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.200
by human being which
is very, very nice.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.960
The computer-generated speech
is getting much, much better

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.670
but it's still
computer-generated.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.040
But these are actually
read by live people

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.450
so you get the vocal inflection
and that kind of thing.

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:51.390
And so, anyway, this is some
representative websites.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:56.830
But I would love to ask Elsa and
hear from others on my panel,

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.330
what is the International
Dyslexia Association approach

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.160
right now with people with
dyslexia specially children?

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.830
How early should we introduce
audio books and, you know,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.290
make these tools available to
them versus continuing to try

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.260
and help them and prioritize
them actually becoming readers?

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.990
I think that's a
really huge issue.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.680
I'd love to hear your
perspective on that.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.980
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: So yeah.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.280
So, well, the huge initiative
we have right now is making sure

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.230
our teachers are well-equipped

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.470
to teach all kids
including children

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.800
with disabilities
such as dyslexia.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.020
And we can prevent many
of them ever getting

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.020
to special education when we
do that before the third grade.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.810
I mean, we know that.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.910
And then when we don't identify
them before the third grade

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.170
and we look at them at ninth
grade, we look at them at--

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.890
there's-- they still remain--

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:55.090
67% of them will remain
well below, you know,

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.530
that expected reading level.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.850
So we're really focused
on, you know, more--

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.590
you know, working
on the prevention

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.570
as well as the intervention.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.870
But you-- [inaudible].

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.170
What was that?

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.850
So-- And by third, when we
look at them in third grade

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:10.990
and we look at them
and we look--

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:14.440
if we identify them in third
grade then we follow them

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.550
to ninth grade, then
we're still seeing

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.580
that they're still below
their average reading level

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.880
in the ninth grade.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.180
&gt;&gt; They're below grade level.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.480
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Yes, below grade level.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.430
&gt;&gt; And 50% of kids are
below grade level anyway.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:26.730
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.610
Yeah. You know, we
need to do a better--

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.440
yeah, we have children
that aren't-- that's right.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.750
And especially when we look at
the English learners and we look

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.600
at our African-American
population,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.070
if you look at the
NAEP scores, yes.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.310
But what we want to look at
in regards to that, you know,

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.610
there's always the question

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.700
about when do we introduce all
these extra accommodations,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.000
right?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.300
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Right.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.600
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Because then--

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.900
you know, then you're like, oh
well, why should I have to read

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.270
when I have all this
ability to gain the access.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.190
And then you're right
about young children.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.980
They're already, you know,
and as infants already--

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.160
you see them already doing-- and
they have no fear of technology

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.390
like us old people do.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:12.090
And so, you know, so,
number one, we always want

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.260
to teach them to read but we do
also want them to have access

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.740
and why can't you, you know,
do the both at the same time.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.470
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: And I just say
for all kids, but especially

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:28.760
for kids who are struggling
to read or to learn in school,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.060
teaching them

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.740
about metacognition is super
important from preschool.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.530
So teaching them to understand
how they learn best is

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.150
really important.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.450
Yeah.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.850
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: So I'd like
to open it up now to questions

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:46.330
or comments from everyone in
the audience and also questions

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:50.420
for the panel that went ahead
of us, creating, developing

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.780
and sustaining lifelong readers.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.640
So, what do you guys think or
what questions do you have?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.230
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: None.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.490
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis:
We answered it all.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.350
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
Can we ask a question?

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:09.350
&gt;&gt; So I just have-- I'm just
kind of curious about folks

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:14.530
that have dyslexia in
different orthographic system.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.060
So how does that play out?

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.360
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
That's right.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.270
So, when we look across
languages, even languages

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:26.010
that are non-alphabetic,
as I mentioned we do see

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.580
that they still will have
difficulty in this issue,

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.180
the phonological
component of the language.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.460
When we look at languages that
are more transparent such as

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.450
like Italian and Spanish,
we see that, oh, you know,

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.890
because of that transparency
and the regularity,

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.320
they seem to be able to get

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.570
at that decoding
OK, not so, so bad.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.040
But what they won't
have is the fluency

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.870
and then the orthography,
the spelling and writing.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.470
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: There has been
a crosslinguistic research quite

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.270
a bit and dyslexia has been
found in virtually every--

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.850
in every written language, so.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:07.280
But the exact format and the
brain processing patterns

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.640
associated with it will differ
according to the structure,

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.720
the linguistic structure
of the language.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.090
So it's really fascinating.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.100
I mean, the-- You know, the
short answer is, as I said,

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.280
learning to read is a
challenging task for the brain.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.760
I've heard one where a
scientist say, you know,

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.180
dyslexia wasn't a problem

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.090
until Gutenberg invented the
printing press in the 1400s

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.160
and the masses were suddenly
expected to become readers.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.520
I mean, before then, you
know, it was a select few

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.960
who were readers and writers--

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.260
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.560
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: --
and everybody else,

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.860
you know, was all oral.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.160
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.460
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: So all of a
sudden, we created a new class

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.760
of disability with
the printing press.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.090
It's a very challenging
late-emerging skill

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.930
in the course of
human development.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:52.750
So it is challenging that
having said that we do know how

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.630
to teach most, if not
all children to read.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.500
And it is never too late
to teach someone to read,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.630
but you get far better outcomes

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:05.010
if you take an earlier
preventive approach.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.680
So, was there a question--

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.260
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: So
I just have something more--

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.560
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: OK.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.860
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan:
-- to mention about that.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.260
So in our-- our studies
are mainly

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.890
with Spanish-speaking English
learners that have disabilities

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.350
and then looking at those
components and looking

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:21.450
across languages and
across linguistic features.

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:25.580
And we find that, for example,
if they have those capabilities

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.750
in their language, then
they're going to be

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.760
on a great journey
towards literacy

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.660
in their second language.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.820
And that if they didn't
have those abilities,

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.240
then certainly it affects
their first language,

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.910
it's going to certainly
affect their second language.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:44.110
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: Benita,
do you have a question?

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.410
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield: A lot

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.830
of materials [inaudible]
disabilities.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.320
I mean, as you know,
as we've all said,

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.610
the content of what people
read has a tremendous effect

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.430
on motivation and
everything else.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.650
And as you mentioned, the
psychological damage to somebody

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.810
with the child has
reading difficulties,

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:06.870
learning difficulties only
increases as you go older.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:10.100
I've seen people say,
well, it's the same skills

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.400
so we give them children's
materials--

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.700
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Right.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.000
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
That flies in the face

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.440
of everything else that we know.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.300
Is there anything that
you would recommend

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.260
that you've seen that's
specifically designed

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.560
for adults?

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.860
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: To
teach them reading

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.400
but that's developmentally
appropriate teaching materials.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.700
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
Exactly, exactly.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.000
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: I think
that is a huge problem.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.410
And as much as there
are similarities

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.130
in how children learn to read
and adults learn to read,

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.500
they're very, very different.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.970
I really know what dyslexia
is, first and foremost,

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:45.020
because I had to teach a
37-year-old dyslexic man

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.320
to read.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.130
And I had previously been
trying to teach kindergarten

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.110
through eight graders to read.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.710
And they-- But they weren't able

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.710
to tell me what they
were getting

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.080
and what they weren't getting.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.540
He was a really bright guy

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.770
who had great self-awareness
and insight.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.600
He could tell me exactly
what parts made sense to him

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.060
and exactly what didn't
make sense to him.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.790
And I feel like with
adult learners,

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.830
we often don't take advantage
of the learning capabilities

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.950
that they have that you
simply don't have at age six.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.510
But I don't know if you can
comment on specific programs.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:25.940
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.240
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Oh absolutely.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.430
&gt;&gt; Benita Somerfield:
Employees and everybody else.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:36.260
So their mental skills
extremely strong, quite bright.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.880
So not drawing on--
that's the major piece,

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.620
not drawing on their
background information,

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.640
not drawing on the
skills they've developed.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.910
They're pretending they are
the same as children by going

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:52.360
through a skills-based approach
I think is, from my experience,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.770
is just a major mistake.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.250
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: This is not
specific to adult with dyslexia

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.280
but one of the amazing
interventions I saw

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:08.880
at a Heard Start program
is that their approach

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.580
to family literacy and how they
are teaching adult literacy is

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.200
by using the child's
report card,

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.090
by using the things they
go home, the newsletters

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.290
so that they are
doing-- using something,

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.290
materials that are important
to the parent and meaningful

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:32.800
and they are going about that
in a way that it's systematic

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.400
and supportive and helps
them get throughout the year

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.700
and understanding they have

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.330
to be great advocates
for their kids.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.000
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet:
That gets back to,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.610
in a couple of the
earlier panels,

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:45.390
the theme of relevance has kept
coming up, that the materials--

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.070
you don't have to
have everything.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.480
It doesn't have to be
completely comprehensive.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.600
But whether you do have, it'd
better be relevant and it needs

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.940
to be relevant like right
now because now they're going

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.890
to read that report
card or that newsletter

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.190
and they need to
respond right now.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.490
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: Yeah.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:02.790
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Two weeks

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.090
from now they've
missed that opportunity.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:05.390
&gt;&gt; Lydia Carlis: Yeah.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.690
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: So
that just in time kind

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.990
of relevance is important.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:09.290
Elsa, were you or--

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.590
&gt;&gt; Elsa Cardenas-Hagan: Yeah.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.590
And I just think that that's
exactly what I was going to say.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.320
So you have to-- So when
you work with the adults,

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.600
it has to be the things
that they want to read,

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.510
what's relevant to them and
let's help you to figure out,

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:25.270
you know, how to get through
that and understand it well.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.010
And so that's-- yeah,
you don't treat them

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.380
like you would a little kid.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.680
Absolutely not.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.280
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: I can
share another quick story

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.370
of my adult with dyslexia.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.910
So two things brought
him in to our clinic

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.960
at Northwestern University.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.870
One was he want to be able
to read to his children,

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.610
which he'd never done before.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.610
And number two, he
was so capable

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.590
in his job at Glidden Paints.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:53.360
He was running all of their
very complicated equipment

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.590
and machinery and he was
so good at it and this was

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:01.110
in the late '70s, early '80s
when the EPA said, you know,

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:04.060
we've got to stop, our
paint manufacturers have

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.430
to stop polluting.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.230
And so, all the paint
manufacturers were going to have

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.670
to spend millions and million
and millions of dollars

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.970
on really expensive
anti-pollution equipment.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.450
So his boss had given him these
huge detailed manuals and said,

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.710
Mel, I need you to read
this and tell us which piece

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.540
of equipment we should buy.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.620
Well, you can imagine
his terror at that.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.050
He would take everything
home and his wife,

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.600
who spoke like eight languages,
would read it aloud to him

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.960
and he would memorize it,
that memory capability,

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.340
so that he could go back
the next day and fake

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.460
that he was reading it and
spelling off what it said.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.440
So those were the things
that brought him in,

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.990
but what he really wanted to
do was open his own heating

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.950
and refrigeration company.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.360
So I had to get him
through an 895-page textbook

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.380
on heating and refrigeration.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.150
So that was quite a scene as
you can imagine for two years.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:04.040
I could never get him to see and
hear pattens and rhyming words

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.610
like hat, mat, fat, cat, sat.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.290
But one day, one Tuesday night,
he brought the book into me

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.660
and he was so excited to show me
he had highlighted all the words

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.100
in this heating and
refrigeration book that ended

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:23.000
in U-R-E, pressure,
moisture, temperature.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.470
And for the first time,
the concept of patterns

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.180
in words made sense to him.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.800
What I have ever thought
to show those words to him

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.730
when he couldn't read, no,
but that's what I'm saying.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.350
They will tell you
what they need

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:39.180
and what will work for them.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:42.600
You have to partner with them
and you have to ask them,

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.890
what are you motivated
to read about?

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:48.930
So he got his heating and
refrigeration program.

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:50.230
Yup.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:56.550
&gt;&gt; I was going to say what
Ms. Benita was saying.

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.280
It goes back to what
Joshua and Lois spoke

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.750
about earlier as far as empathy.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.190
And those people who are
teaching adult literacy have

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.800
to maintain empathy
and non-judgments

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.920
when they are teaching
them so that they do have--

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.050
they do feel more
liberated to choose,

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:19.080
and also feel more liberated to
choose what is relevant to them

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.800
in order to learn to read and
knock out adult illiteracy.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.070
In that way, you can better
knock out childhood illiteracy.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.370
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Absolutely.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.670
Thank you so much.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:30.970

Thank you again

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:46.030
for another great discussion
and we'll break until 3 o'clock

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.600
and then we'll have
our last panel.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.750
Thanks. OK.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.840
Thanks again for staying
around for our last program

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.620
and I think it's going
to be well worthwhile

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.810
because it's a topic that really
has woven itself throughout all

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.480
the discussions today.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.900
And that's the important
topic of diversity in books,

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.110
the current state
and the future.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:09.340
And we could not have a better
moderator for this panel

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.320
than Ellen Oh, who is the--
an author and she is a CEO

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.650
and President of "We
Need Diverse Books."

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:17.510

Hi everyone.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:32.930
I am so thrilled to be here
because I'm on panel with two

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.230
of my favorite people.

And we know each other
because we all work with--

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.710
for We Need Diverse
Books together.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:44.950
And it's been four years,
four momentous years,

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.350
lots of change has happened.

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.850
Let me show a little bio first

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.460
because I actually took
the time to do these.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.940
First, we'll start
with Meg Medina.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.000
Meg, talk a little
bit about yourself.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.300

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.730
So I'm Meg and those
are some of my title.

I am very proud to
be a founding member

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.970
of We Need Diverse
Books with Ellen.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.940
I'm also very proud to do
a lot of program in here

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.240
at the Library of Congress, and
as it happens a lot of research

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.750
on my books here at the
Library of Congress.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:23.010
For "Burn Baby Burn," I was here
for hours and hours and hours.

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.280
And I spent the morning
doing the same thing today.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.120
So I'm very happy
to be here today.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.850
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: And Meg's books
are amazing and I'm sure all

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.610
of you have read
all of them, right?

her wonderful books is,

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.910
like I have to say
"Eight-Grade Superzero."

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.860
I love this book.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.230
The "Burn Baby Burn,"
I love this--

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.650
these are like two of my
favorite books in the world.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.830
So imagine how I
feel sitting here,

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:58.590
sitting with my two favorite
authors of great books.

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.630
So please tell a little
bit about yourself.

Rhuday-Perkovich: Well,

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.230

that needs to be said.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.010
So I'm Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.520
and I'm the author of
"Eight-Grade Superzero"

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.110
and the co-author
of "Two Naomis"

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:15.590
and forthcoming "Naomis Too."

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:19.050
And then also this
fall, "Someday Is Now,"

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:22.000
the story Clara Luper
and the 1958 sit-ins.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.730
And "Above and Beyond:
NASA's Journey to Tomorrow"

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:30.020
which was a lot of fun to work
on in a rush because it was just

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.300
so different and it was an
opportunity for me to find a lot

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:38.130
of hidden his stories and her
stories that were involved

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.430
in NASA's work over the year.

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:40.730
So that was incredible.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.760
Before I was an author
for a very long time,

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.550
starting as a college
freshman, I worked in literacy,

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:51.260
family literacy and
youth development

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.580
and that informs a lot
of the work I do now with

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.130
"We Need Diverse Books."

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.570
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh,
we have to go back

00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:00.020
for one little second
because, Meg,

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.160
what is the new book
coming up this year?

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.350
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh it's
"Merci Suarez Changes Gears"

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:08.360
which comes out in 2018
and began as a short story

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.390
in our anthology, which I
think cycles back to your work.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:13.970
Ellen, now you're
in the hot seat.

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:15.270
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yes.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.570
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.410
So, I'm Ellen Oh.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.120
And the book she's talking about
is "Flying Lessons" which is

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.500
on the slide which is
the short story anthology

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.870
that WNDB put together.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:29.240
And it has been a remarkable
experience being able to take

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.320
that book all over the
country to students and kind

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.930
of let them know that there--

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.800
this is a book of
stories for everybody.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.260
But let me talk also about
WNDB, because I think

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.060
that since 2014,
a lot has changed.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.460
What do you think guys?

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:52.350
Yeah. And I think my-- some
of my proudest moments I think

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.650
for all of us, some

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:56.580
of our proudest moments
is seeing the actual work

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.880
become reality.

00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.180
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.480
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: So, Bem, if
you don't mind, can you talk

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.780
about the internship program?

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.080
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Sure.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.590
The Internship Grant Award
Program, we award grants

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:12.140
of usually $2500 to applicants

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.730
from underrepresented
backgrounds to get internships

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.120
in the public-- children's
publishing industry.

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.960
So they could be with
publishing companies,

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:25.020
with literary agencies, and they
may not always be editorial.

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:28.940
We've had some interns who
were in marketing and publicity

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.760
and art direction which
is great to sort of have

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.170
that diversity in
their experiences.

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:39.780
And in addition to the grant,
we-- throughout the summer,

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.580
we offer them opportunities
to meet

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.250
with publishing professionals.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.780
And to me, with-- like I
took them on a trip to,

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.850
I'm like intern mom
in the summer,

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:53.820
so to meet with book sellers,
to meet with people who work

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.360
in lots of different
areas of the industry

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.300
so that they can see not
just where they work but some

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.220
of the different opportunities
that they can have.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:07.390
And we've had out
of 25 WNDB interns,

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.670
I think 14 have already gone
on to get full-time jobs

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.510
in children's publishing
or in publishing.

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.470
And a lot of the rest
are still in school

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:20.030
because you can be either a
student or recent graduate.

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:21.990
So we've just been
really proud of them.

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.370
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I get to highlight
the fact that my editors,

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:29.470
assistant is actually
WNDB intern.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:32.420
So that's been an amazing
feeling to be working

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.100
with somebody who
started off as an intern.

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.820
The other thing I
wanted to mention is

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.490
that the reason why the
internship program is

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.450
so important is because
statistically,

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:46.470
publishing has been 90% white.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:52.160
And what that translates into
is less books about, you know,

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.740
people of color and other
marginalized communities,

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.300
and also a lack of understanding

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.110
of what these communities
are going through

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:04.120
and what a book would look like
if it's going to be authentic.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.420
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: And one thing

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.720
that was important to
us with the giving--

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.020
with giving a grant was

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.180
that when people get
these internships,

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:14.220
even if they are paid,
they're not paid very much.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.920
And to live in New--
to live and work

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.520
in New York City is expensive.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.440
So, that was a big
barrier to a lot of people

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.950
from marginalized backgrounds

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.210
to just being a part
of the industry.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.510
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:28.700
So now, we'll also get to talk
about grants and mentorships

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.560
and the Walter Award and
WNDB in the classroom.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.030
And, you know, we
have a lot of programs

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.590
and they're doing great.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.410
We have these wonderful success
stories that we can point to.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:43.730
For example, Angie Thomas was
our inaugural WNDB grant winner.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.480
And look what-- like
she is on fire.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.170
So, we have all these
programs and the idea is

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.790
to really give opportunities
to writers

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:56.920
who just have not had them
before, and also to promote

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.000
and market books in ways that
they have not received before,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.920
because how can you know
about or see or read a book

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.300
if you've never heard about it,
right, which kind of takes me

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.940
to next issue which
is the changing face

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.750
of the New York Times
bestseller list.

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:16.850
So, what do you think Meg?

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.270
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So, I
think a couple things.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:22.600
The first thing that comes
to mind as I'm listening

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:28.460
to our sort of detail what's
been happening on our end

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:31.550
over the past few years, a
couple of things to know.

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.910
First is that if you
look around this room,

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.800
everybody in here is pretty
much like minded in terms

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:44.040
of feeling the importance of
books that represent all kids,

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.630
windows, mirrors, that
entire conversation.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.750
But we are well past
that conversation now.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:54.350
We don't want to-- You know,
we're all in agreement.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.710
Yes, yes, and now what?

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.590
So, this is sort of
like 2.0 at this point.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.870
What is the next series of
thing that we need to look at?

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:05.130
And what I'm so proud of that
We Need Diverse Books has done

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.690
with the-- with its partners

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:11.110
and with a very small
volunteer group of people,

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:19.040
is create action that
really has the greatest cope

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.940
of changing who's at the
table making decisions,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:29.470
making conversation around
the books we're choosing,

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:30.970
and how we market them.

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:34.680
So when I look at this list
also, I can't help but think

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.390
of what the list looked like
four, five years earlier, right?

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.690
So, this is the New York
Times bestseller list

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:43.100
from April, is it not?

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.400
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.700
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.000
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.300
And so, do we have a
graphic of the one from 2012

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.600
or we were not able to--

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.900
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: We were unable to.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.820
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: At that one,
there was one author who I'm

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.920
so proud to say is a good friend
of mine, but Wonder was still

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.770
on the New York Times
bestseller list six years ago.

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.580
People, that's a long run.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.430
And Raquel-- R. J.
Palacio is Colombian.

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:07.630
So, we had that.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:11.300
But everybody else was a
white author on that list.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.600
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.900
And mostly male.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.200
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And mostly male.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.200
And so, it's amazing
to see the change.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.430
And it's not only
WNDB, obviously.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.610
There are many, many
warriors on the ground,

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.710
who are pushing this
ball forward.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:30.190
But that's the thing
that makes my heart sing.

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:33.860
And so-- And addresses--
I don't know how you felt

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.160
when you started.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.120
But when I first started,
like this myth or this worry

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.060
that we were going
to be niche authors,

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.410
that we were only
speaking to our-- a small--

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:48.930
like I could only be speaking
to let you know, like readers,

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:52.920
right, and that our books
wouldn't sell widely.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.280
Goodbye to that idea.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.880
We're destroying myths.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.370
You know, this myth-- this
idea that publishing had

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:03.280
such a long time that
black books didn't sell,

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.560
that books about Latinos or
Asians that they didn't sell.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.950
And we have destroyed that myth

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:12.870
because of all those red
circles on that list.

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.240
So, it's an amazing
feeling to see that change.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.220
And what we have to do
is to keep that going.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.080
And like Meg said,
it's not just WNDB.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.790
It's all-- It's everybody.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.090
It's all of you.

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.910
It's the librarians and the
teachers and the parents

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:28.970
and booksellers and
everybody who cares.

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:32.910
And that brings me to
the role of gatekeepers

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.580
in children's literature,
because in general,

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.800
we are talking about us as
gatekeepers who kind of all

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.200
on the same page, right?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.140
That's what makes it-- If we're
here, we're probably all here.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.640
But we have to kind of take
this message more globally

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.520
and make all people realize
how important it is to talk

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.960
about like teaching empathy
to children from a young age,

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.930
which I think if we take
the next slide-- no.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:04.600
OK. I'm skipping slides, sorry.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.570
I wanted to go to this slide.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.870
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: OK.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.790
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Because
this was 2012, right?

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:14.580
If we're talking about a
New York Times book list

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.680
from that time period,
this is what the statistics

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.980
for the books looked like.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.810
Out of 3600 books
published in that year,

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:26.620
7% were about a child of color.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.690
And if we don't talk
to gatekeepers

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:33.290
about why diversity is so
important, we're never going

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.930
to change what's happening.

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:37.400
We're always only
going to be talking

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.060
to the same like-minded
people, right?

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.710
We've got to kind of
get thee on that base

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.210
so that we don't
have to go back.

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.510
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:46.560
And I think it has
a lot to do with--

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.450
for ourselves, we should
start asking that question,

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:53.110
as a writing assignment that's
given a lot, where I'm from

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.030
or asking where am I from.

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:59.030
So as gatekeepers asking
ourselves, even asking people

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.320
who already feel like
we're doing pretty well

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.660
or like we got this, where am
I from and what does that mean

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.200
about the books that
I recommend,

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.590
about how I share literature,
how I talk about literature,

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:16.660
how I see the population
that I serve,

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.430
am I sort of using
a deficit model.

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:24.970
You can unconsciously-- What
are the implicit biases I have

01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:28.930
and asking ourselves those
hard questions and figuring

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:33.190
out what we're going to do about
them on a very personal level.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.490
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.790
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well, I'll tell
you one thing that changed

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:38.070
for me in this whole process.

01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:40.970
So, I was a teacher
before I was an author.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:42.600
It was a job I loved.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.110
And of course, I loved--
the role of children's books

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.250
in my classroom was
really, really large.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:51.840
As a teacher, I remember doing
this and certainly as an author.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.910
You know, and I was just talking
about this a few minutes ago

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:57.620
because I have this book
coming out in September

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.260
and you're waiting for
the reviews, right?

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.530
And so, what are the
reviews you're thinking of?

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:04.440
You're thinking of Kirkus, ah,
right, that's the scariest one

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.070
of all, right, Kirkus review.

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:10.230
And then SLJ and like all of
the major reviewing places.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:14.420
So the interesting thing
is that I have started

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:19.900
to ask myself harder questions
about that relationship also

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.610
because the truth is that those
reviewing agencies are also

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:27.400
struggling with biases that
they're just now uncovering,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.550
and a lack of-- not a lack of,
but a very few number of people

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.510
of color writing the reviews.

01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:37.930
And so, you don't know
what you don't know, right?

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:46.430
You fall into these mistakes
or statements or lack of tuning

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.600
into something really
important in the book

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.870
because it's not part
of your experience.

01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:55.060
So, one thing that's really
changed for me is that sure,

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:59.150
I go to Kirkus and SLJ
and so on and I'm picking

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.860
out what they say
about my book and books

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:07.370
that I'm interested in, but I
also make a stop at the blogs

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:10.740
and so on of librarians
of color, of academics

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:16.060
and I am trying to listen
to what the conversation is

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:18.620
and to pick up on my own biases.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.460
And we were talking about
this at lunch that, you know,

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.250
even with authors
of color and people

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.790
from diverse backgrounds,
we have biases too.

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:28.090
And it's so-- Like you have

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:31.730
to just ask yourself
hard questions,

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:34.080
which is I think
what we were talking

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.020
about in terms of
this work at 2.0.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.950
It's now getting to the
really uncomfortable parts

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:46.570
where you have to look
at things you used to do,

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:49.190
opinions you've had,
and how you've changed

01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.720
and really owning them.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.020
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.170
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I think it's also
important that we also talk

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.100
about do we change, how we talk
about books in a way that like

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.700
for example, for
me, I was always

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.310
like representation is
important, you know,

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:06.010
representation is
empowering, that's all great.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.290
And yes, absolutely,
very important.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:10.730
But empathy is really important.

01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:13.750
And part of that process is
making sure white kids read

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.190
about black kids, black
kids read about Latino kids,

01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:19.320
Latino kids read
about Asian kids,

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.620
Asian kids read about disabled.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.920
You see the circle?

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.990
We have to actually be
completely open and learn

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:29.030
from each other,
become empathetic.

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.210
Empathy is not, you know,
something we're born with.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.970
Empathy is what we learn.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:37.480
If you don't know that
somebody from your--

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.030
you know, from a different
community or background

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:44.150
because you've never had any
experience with that, you know,

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.340
community, where are
you going to turn to?

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.640
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.290
And I think that comes in I
think of how sometimes even

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:54.410
when we mean well and mean to be
inclusive, we end up otherizing.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:59.070
And it reminds me one experience
I had as a middle schooler.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:03.100
After having been a kid
who moved around a lot

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.720
to all these different
schools and different countries

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.910
and being this new kid
like over and over,

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:11.220
I came to this one school
in suburban New York

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:14.300
where the teacher
meant to be welcoming.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.770
And my first day, when I
really just wanted to like stay

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:22.780
under the radar, kind of
get the feel of the place

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.970
and then be cool and fit in and
like, I don't know, be president

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.210
or whatever I had in my head.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:33.310
I had just moved
from Lagos, Nigeria.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.810
We had lived in Lagos,
Nigeria for a year

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.110
and then come to New York.

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.260
So, the teacher was like, oh,

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.290
we have a new student who's
just come to us from Africa.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:45.840
Come up to the front of the room
and tell us all about Africa.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.800
So, that was a problem for
a lot of different reasons.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:55.820
But the one thing that she did
was, in trying to, I think,

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.060
include me and welcome me,
she really otherized me.

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:02.950
And in middle school,
that's really like not cool.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:04.810
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: It's
where are you from?

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:08.090
No, no, no, where
are you really from?

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:12.370
And I now say my mother's
uterus, because like

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.690
that is actually where
we're really from, you know.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.370
No, but seriously, the whole
point is that like this idea

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:21.670
of like making feel--

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:24.730
making people feel like they're
not real Americans is what comes

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:26.030
from that question.

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:30.270
So if we don't actually have
empathy and like from the start,

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:33.660
making assumption that there's
no difference between us

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.790
and that we can't
consider people

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:40.620
from different backgrounds
as like, oh, I can't relate--

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.620
which actually takes me to
another story by the way.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.130
I have to jump around.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.580
I tell the story a lot
because it's kind of important.

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.280
I was once at the bookstore

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.750
and there was a little
white girl reading

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.140
"The Mighty Miss Malone"--

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.440
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Oh, yeah.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.740
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: -- which
is a great book

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.380
and has a little beautiful
little black girl on the cover.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.670
And this girl was like in--
She's reading this book.

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:02.060
I mean, she's like
several chapters

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.970
and she has broken the binding.

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:05.900
I mean, I'm sitting
there thinking they need

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.070
to buy this book, right?

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:10.450
But then, her mother comes
over and takes the book

01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:13.080
out of her hand and says, no
honey, that book is not for you.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.380
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.680
That happens a lot.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.980
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: It happens a lot.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.280
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.580
I've had that so many times.

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.880
Yeah.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.180
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.480
So, what is the message
that that child took away?

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.780
I'm not-- I don't
think that-- Sorry.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.610
I don't think that
the mom is racist,

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:27.960
but I think her actions were.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.450
I think it was unintentional.

01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:31.750
And I think that's
what we have to talk

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:35.660
about is systemic
racism, systemic bias

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.630
that we've kind of-- the
biases that we've internalized

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:41.180
without even knowing about it.

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.740
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think
about that with the titles

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.430
of my books sometimes.

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.300
You know, I have Spanish
in the title a lot,

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.910
"Tia Isa Wants a Car,"
"Mango, Abuela, and Me."

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:50.960
So it's very identifiable,
right?

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.390
You can pretty much
piece it together.

01:12:53.390 --> 01:13:01.970
And I have in my more insecure
moments wondered about someone

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:05.040
like that standing in front of
the book and making a decision

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.400
about who gets to
read this book.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.970
So-- And I think that
that's a real question.

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:13.710
I mean, I've certainly met
librarians who will say,

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:17.050
sometimes, we don't have very
many Latinos in my school

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:19.830
so we don't really buy that
many books about Latinos.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:22.260
I've had, you know,

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.170
conversations that
run like that.

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:26.470
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: They
don't have any dragons

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:27.770
in their neighborhood either.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.070
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right,
right, right.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:30.370
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: They
don't have any hobbits.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:31.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right.

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:32.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: They don't
have any talking gorillas.

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:34.270
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: They don't.

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:35.570
They don't.

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:36.870
But, you know, my feeling
is that if you don't,

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:38.910
that's why you need my books
more than anybody else.

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.210
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:43.920
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: But I
do feel like that plays

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.280
into just what you're saying.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.960
So, that's just an--
that's an example of--

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.270
you know, like a simple bias

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:52.330
that has really wide-reaching
repercussions.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:53.630
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:54.930
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.300
Or even in publishing, I've
had conversations with editors

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.300
and agents who will
say, I really--

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.810
I care about diverse literature.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:06.170
I want diverse authors
or diverse books,

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:10.010
but they don't come across
my desk, or they don't come

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:13.320
to me is basically the message.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.890
And the idea that, OK, maybe
you need to go out and look

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:23.150
or do some extra work is
really difficult for a lot

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:24.450
of people to understand.

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:25.750
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.810
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Which takes me to
the next question, which I have

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:31.720
to go back, right here.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.000
OK. So first of all, this
quote "We live in a world

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.410
where the forces that seek
to divide us are strong.

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:40.010
To overcome them, we must do
more than simply stand next

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:41.680
to one another in silence."

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.290
I love this quote
because it talks--

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.430
to me, it takes us to
the point that right now,

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:51.580
you're seeing the rise
of the author activist.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.340
So, I know why it's
important for me.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:57.630
I'd love Meg for you
to talk about it too.

01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:58.930
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well,
what I would say is

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:04.130
that I don't have the luxury of
stepping out of who I am, right?

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:10.040
So, a Latina woman, this is
the experience I have, and so,

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:15.150
I don't feel like I can
turn my back on that.

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:20.800
And I also feel like I just
can't see a way to do this work,

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.780
publishing right now in this
time with this opportunity

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.660
that is available to us

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.610
to really reshape how we're
thinking about these books

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:35.580
without doing some
heavy lifting.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.010
So, I have this thing
that I've been talking

01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:42.700
about called radical
abundance, right?

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.600
Abundance is such a pretty word.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.200
It just sounds nice, right?

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.760
And radical sort
of speaks to me.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.130
So, radical abundance
is my desire

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:57.550
to certainly promote my own work
and my own creative development.

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.140
That's great.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:04.690
But also, to make room at the
table for new authors who come.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:07.600
And the story that I often
use is my mother-in-law used

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.430
to always say-- she had
this really ugly little--

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.890
really ugly little
dining room table.

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:16.900
It's a little round
thing, 42 inches.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.220
But the strangest thing
about this table is

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.400
that if four people were sitting
there eating, we all fit.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.800
If six people were
eating, we still fit.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.630
If eight people were
eating, we were all there,

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:31.210
cutting small, but
we were there.

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.290
So, it's amazing, right?

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:36.010
And she used to say, in Spanish,

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:38.760
esta mesa se estira
como un chicle,

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.560
meaning this table
stretches like a piece of gum.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.860
And I love that.

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.540
And so, I feel like
it's important for us

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.930
to stretch the table
like a piece of gum.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:54.900
So-- And it's easy,
it's fairly easy to do.

01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.790
So like when I'm invited to
NCTE to do a roundtable talk,

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:05.650
my response is now, not
just, sure, I'd love to.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:10.450
My response is, I'd love to, do
you mind if I also bring Juana,

01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:14.070
so and so whose new book
is blah, blah, blah?

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:17.610
If somebody is asking me to
blur books, I don't blur books,

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:22.220
but I say I do other things,
can we do a shared thing

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.210
on my blog or an event?

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:28.430
So, that I'm introducing
somebody else.

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:31.690
And I ask librarians and
teachers all the time

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:36.500
to take a risk on new
authors coming to the table.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.070
You can invite the
six big Latino authors

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:40.370
over and over again.

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:41.850
We'd love to come.

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:44.600
But there's more of us, right?

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.680
So, pair us maybe, somebody
well-known with somebody new.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.550
And that's the radical
abundance.

01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:54.000
Now, the pushback that
I've gotten on it is this.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.020
From a very well-known author
who I respect immensely,

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.240
she said to me, we're
at a conference,

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.990
she said, but is that fair?

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:07.550
She said, I have been at this
for 25 years and I was told,

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.150
I'm sorry, I can't take
your book onto my list

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:13.070
because we already
have an author

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:15.920
of this background, et cetera.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.620
And, you know, she's
very accomplished now

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:22.100
and she just feels like, is it
really fair to ask me after all

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.150
of that work that I did to do--

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:26.680
to keep doing this
now for you too?

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.770
And I said it is not fair.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:33.020
But, you know, as my mother
always said, what ifs, right?

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:38.280
And so, nothing is fair,
but that's the job, man.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.090
And so, that's what I say.

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:46.610
So, I am encouraging you to
embrace radical abundance

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:49.390
and to certainly don't
forget about my books.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:51.970
I really do want to come
to your schools and so on,

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:55.180
but to take risks on new voices,

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.490
and if I'm promoting a new
voice, to bother to pick

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:02.380
up their book and see
what that's about.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.890
Because in the end,
like nobody is forever.

01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:06.190
You're not forever.

01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:07.490
You're not forever.

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:08.790
I'm not forever.

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.420
I'm going to have my day in the
sun and I'm thrilled for it,

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.650
and it may be this day, right?

01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:14.690
But it's not forever.

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.380
And it's important
to stretch the table.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.680
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.590
What makes that uncomfortable?

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.210
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: No, you can't just
say what Megs that [laughter].

01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:23.510
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:24.810
What makes that--

01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:26.110
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: How do
you stretch the table?

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.410
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: I mean,

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.100
I think it's stretching the
table and also all of us,

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.610
like it doesn't have to just
be authors as activists,

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:34.120
librarians as activists,
teachers as activists.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.460
Like all of us figuring out
in our space what we can do.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:42.350
And that really leads me to
talking about how sometimes

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:47.270
that also leads to moments
or seasons of discomfort.

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.570
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Ah, wait, wait.

01:19:48.570 --> 01:19:50.390
Hold on. We have a
good one for this.

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.920
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: I do?

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.820
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes [laughter].

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.780
I am uncomfortable.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.080
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.280
It does look terrible
[laughter], poor dog.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.660
But we-- I feel like we--

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:09.060
so I mean, I do avoid
feeling uncomfortable

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.800
and avoid discomfort.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:16.340
And as a-- When I first
started out as a literacy,

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.430
whatever I was supposed to
be a literacy instructor,

01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:24.180
as a college freshman, I had
this experience of our job being

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.070
to basically walk around these
neighborhoods in New York City

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:32.500
and knock on people's door, it's
cold, and sort of be like, hey,

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.970
I'm Olugbemisola and
I'm here to talk to you

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:37.270
about nutrition and literacy.

01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:40.480
And it was this family
literacy program where we talked

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.530
about recipes and
grocery shopping as a way

01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.270
to engage parents in
literacy activities

01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:48.620
and then we read to children.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:51.380
So, I had no idea
what I was doing.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:56.530
And I don't even know how we
got that job, like that day.

01:20:56.530 --> 01:21:01.070
But-- And we had a lot of
uncomfortable experiences

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.740
and I had to work through them.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:08.420
I had an experience on my
very last day when I told one

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.360
of the students in the
family that I would take her

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.560
to the museum because she
had never been to the Museum

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.860
of Natural History in New York.

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:17.230
And so I was like, oh, I'll
take you to the museum.

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:19.160
And her mom says that it was OK.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.400
I came to pick her up
on that day, I'm 18,

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.040
and there were 17
other kids [laughter]

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.390
who would come for
this museum trip.

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.950
They had like called everybody.

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:32.250
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Field
trip [laughter].

01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:33.550
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yes.

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:34.850
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh god.

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.150
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:37.450
I'm freaking out [laughter].

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:38.750
What am I going to do?

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.050
And so like we went to
the museum and luckily,

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:42.100
the Natural History has
suggested admissions.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:44.210
So, I think I paid like
a dime for everybody.

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:47.360
And then I had said we
would go to pizza afterward.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.140
And we went to this one place
that I didn't realize was

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.150
like kind of high-end pizza.

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.500
So, we went in and sat
down and drank our water.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.960
And then when I saw the menu, I
was like, guys, we have to get

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.370
up and go because I
didn't have enough money.

01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:07.050
So, I say all this to
say that was discomfort.

01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:11.580
And sometimes when we don't
want to stretch ourselves

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.340
or have these conversations,
we're thinking more

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:19.020
about our own discomfort than
about our readers, our students,

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.560
our-- the-- our communities
and our populations.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.700
And we're thinking
about not knowing--

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.320
being afraid of being in
a position of not knowing

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:32.770
or of losing authority
or of losing control.

01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.180
And I think we have
to understand

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.270
that sometimes we're not going
to know and we're going to have

01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:41.130
to be in a position to tell
students or tell people,

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.390
you know, I really don't know.

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:46.620
Or think about doing
things a different way.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.680
I worked with a school that
had a book club for a long time

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.260
that was a Newbery, sort
of Mock Newbery book club.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.730
Then one year, I did the
book club, but it was--

01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:01.760
we called it a Social
Justice Book Club.

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.690
And what we did with
fifth graders was say, OK,

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:06.170
you guys have a mission.

01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:07.820
There are a lot of
books in this library

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:10.100
that nobody ever checks out.

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.460
Let's go through and
analyze the shelves.

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.780
First, let's think about
what we have in this library

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.890
and why we think it's here.

01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:21.490
Is it because the adults love
these books when they were kids

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:23.340
and just keep putting the
same books in the library?

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.620
So, there was that issue that we
talked about with the students.

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:31.220
And then, we pulled books
and said, OK, your mission is

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:34.340
to read and share these
books with your peers.

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.250
These are books that you
might think are great

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.000
after you read them, but
nobody is reading them.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.900
So, how can we share these
books and get them circulating?

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.300
So, the kids felt like
they had a mission

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.990
and that they were
doing something

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.710
to promote diverse books
in their community.

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.630
And sometimes, we pulled books--

01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:54.990
the librarians and I pulled
books that all the kids

01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:57.890
in the club were like,
yeah, we don't like this.

01:23:57.890 --> 01:24:01.600
And we-- So, they
had space to say,

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.100
we don't like this,
and here's why.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.450
You guys can try reading it.

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:08.210
Good luck with that, but
this isn't our thing.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.180
And we just left that
space open to do that.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.480
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think
the discomfort thing

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.350
from the adult perspective
is this.

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:19.550
I just had this talk at the
North Texas Teen Book Festival

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:22.550
and that's that-- you're going
to-- you're in this room,

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:26.610
we're all locked in this like
little suite bubble, right?

01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:29.100
This is not where the
heavy lifting happens.

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.820
The heavy lifting happens
when you are at a meeting

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.710
with someone who you admire
very much and you have to point

01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:41.580
out that a book on the shelf
is hurtful for x, y or z reason

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.320
or you have to disagree about
the selection of the book

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.600
or you have to point
out some bias.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.460
Like that's where
the heavy lifting is.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.340
Isn't it Neville who says
this in Harry Potter,

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.920
he gets that award for
standing up to his friends

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.880
in the first book
of Harry Potter?

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.680
Like that's the award you
need to get people, right,

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.620
because that's where the
heavy lifting is, right?

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:07.160
That's where the discomfort is.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.610
The discomfort also comes for me

01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:14.110
when I'm asking myself harder
questions as I'm writing.

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:15.410
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.150
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So just
"Merci Suarez Changes Gears,"

01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:20.720
we were like in the late
stages, right, of pages.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.870
And, you know, I talk about
diversity all the time.

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.460
Of course, I'm sensitive.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:31.430
Of course, I'm above making
any kind of mistake, blah.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:33.020
So, here's what happens, right?

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:36.870
I'm reading through my pages,
looking for commas and so on,

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.320
and I see this line
that Merci says.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.500
She's talking to her brother
and he's ignoring her.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.970
And she says, so Roli
plays death and what--

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.320
you know, blah, blah,
blah, and it goes on.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.130
And I thought about that.

01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:53.900
I said, huh, well,
there's no problem saying

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:57.050
that unless you are a
person who's hard of hearing

01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:58.500
or has hearing trouble.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.120
And then, it feels really lousy

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.890
to have somebody
saying playing death.

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:09.460
So, I struck it out and
I wrote something else.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:14.010
And I felt icky for being
a person who had made

01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:17.380
such a gross error, I guess.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:25.200
But I took the time to pause
and I ask myself hard questions.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.140
And the frustration
I have sometime is

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.170
when authors don't take
that pause, and they assume

01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:35.080
that they have the
right tell any story

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:41.190
and they don't necessarily
have the respect or the nuance

01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:43.860
or the understanding to tell it.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.160
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Right.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And then, they
hurt people and then you're

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.270
in a position of
trying to explain why.

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:52.950
That I find exhausting.

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:54.250
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.550
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Do you
find it exhausting?

01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:56.850
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.150
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh yeah.

01:26:58.150 --> 01:26:59.450
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:00.750
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: We have
to be comfortable

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:02.050
with being uncomfortable.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.350
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:04.650
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Right?

01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:05.950
And I know that's hard.

01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:07.250
Nobody likes being
uncomfortable, right?

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.550
It's like having a
perpetual wedgie.

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:09.850
It's not comfortable [laughter].

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.150
But--

01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:12.450
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Like spanks.

01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:13.750
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Emotional spanks.

01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:16.350
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:17.650
You just--

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:18.950
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Not that
we know [laughter].

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.250
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: That's a
constipated look, Meg.

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:21.550
Sorry.

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:22.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:24.150
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Anyway.

01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:25.450
But for me, I think the
conversations are so important.

01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:26.750
And I'll just give
you an example.

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.690
I was at an event and
somebody came to me

01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:33.950
and had taken screenshots of
my Facebook page at a time

01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:37.090
when I was very upset
about certain things

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:39.340
that had politically
happened in the world

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:41.490
and might have used
some language

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:45.010
that might have been
very problematic.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:50.840
And so, they shared with me
my screenshots and told me

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.540
that I was anti-white,

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:58.870
that I was promoting white
genocide because, you know,

01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:00.170
talking about diversity

01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:02.940
in children's literature
promotes white genocide.

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.530
I don't actually get
that connection myself.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:09.060
But this is the idealogy
that was coming at me.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.280
And if I had been 20 years
later, we would had a, you know,

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.750
a showdown in the
parking lot, right?

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:17.640
But age has mellowed me.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.130
And I was able to say
to her, you're right,

01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:22.030
I actually made a mistake.

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.760
I shouldn't have used
such incendiary language.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.060
I wouldn't do it again.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.780
And then, I hope she
would actually sit

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:32.010
down because she'd accused me
of having an LGBT agenda also.

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:34.300
And I said, I hope she would
sit down and actually listen

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.950
to my presentation and
talk to me about it.

01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:39.370
And she did.

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:42.690
And this woman, who was so
angry and thought all these

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:45.400
like horrible things about
diversity, actually came

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.200
up to me after the presentation
and said, you're right,

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:50.360
I see your point,
we do need diversity

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.000
in children's literature.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.300
And she gave me a hug.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.070
So like, this was
a conversation.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:58.200
Of course, I was actually the
only one talking during the

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.710
presentation, but she listened.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.010
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:03.090
And that happened I think
because you were willing

01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:04.800
to say you're right,
I made a mistake.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.100
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.400
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.320
And it was so hard for us to say
I made a mistake or I'm sorry.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.140
And so just accept that
and acknowledge it rather

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:18.340
than figure out ways to get
around it and justify it.

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.640
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.380
Yeah. I would also
like to get to a point

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:24.640
where racism isn't a dirty word
and that people don't react

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.360
to being called a racist
with that, you know,

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.190
that like jerk reaction of
how dare you call me a racist.

01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:33.440
Like it's some kind of
fighting words kind of thing.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.170
And instead, why don't we
treat it like it's an illness?

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:39.300
Why don't we treat it like
it is a disease that we,

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.620
as a community, as a society,
have to work together to come

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:46.810
up with a solution
and resolve it

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:49.920
because it's systemic,
it's on everything.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.110
And if we don't actually work
together to address that issue,

01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:56.560
it's just going to continue.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.800
All we'll do is kind of
band-aid over the problem.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.330
What were you saying,
people will just try

01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:01.630
to game the system, you know?

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:02.930
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.230
Game the system.

01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.530
So, change the system.

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:06.830
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Exactly.

01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:08.130
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.430
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:10.730
So, uncomfortable
conversations, like with--

01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:12.030
sometimes with family
too, right?

01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:14.200
So-- But what is next for us?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.800
Like what--

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.020
I-- You know, what would
3.0 look like, right?

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:24.800
So, 2.0 looks like
to me advocacy

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.850
and staying with the discomfort.

01:30:26.850 --> 01:30:31.060
And, you know, I have this
really superficial connection,

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.030
which is I'm trying
to grow out my hair.

01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:34.650
OK. Let's just go to this.

01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:38.170
And my hairdresser, I sat
in the chair three days ago

01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:39.470
and I said, cut it all out.

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:42.460
I wanted to cut again because
I can't stand this anymore.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.740
And she said to me as a good
hairdresser will, no, no.

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.820
She said, I'm going to walk you
through this plateau [laughter].

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.650
And I said, all right.

01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:56.030
And some of you are like,
we're talking about hair,

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:58.400
how did we say like, you
know, but stay with me people.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.630
OK. So she said, no, no, we
will walk through this plateau.

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:05.830
She said, I know it doesn't
feel like what you want to--

01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:07.380
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.680
And this is just hair.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.980
It's the most superficial thing.

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.280
But we're like in the plateau.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.620
So, we have to stay
together and walk

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.120
through this uncomfortable
plateau, this ugly phase

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.700
of being uncomfortable,

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.750
of learning to have
delicate conversations

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:26.970
and not deferring
always to being--

01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:29.400
no, I don't want to say
deferring to be polite

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.350
because I do believe
in politeness.

01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:34.900
I do believe in offering
each other grace.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:38.550
I do believe in offering each
other respect always even

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:41.210
when we're having
hard conversations.

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:46.140
But don't defer to silence.

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.440
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.740
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Just standing
next to each other silently--

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.040
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Don't
be the bystander.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.250
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: -- and
thinking things without saying.

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:54.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I think the
bystander effect is something

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.680
that we all have to
continue to recognize.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:02.380
Even I do it sometimes, right,
where you just feel too awkward

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.860
and too uncomfortable
to confront a situation

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.020
that you know is problematic.

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.650
Sometimes, it's because it's
dangerous and you're scared,

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:14.990
which actually self-preservation
is always first, of course.

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:18.700
But if it's-- if there
is safety, I think it's--

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.090
you know, we can't
be bystanders.

01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:22.030
We have to have the
conversation.

01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:26.130
We have to tell that racist
uncle that they're being racist,

01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:27.430
or you're mocker or something.

01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:28.730
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:30.030
But even approaching--

01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:31.330
As a parent, sometimes
approaching schools

01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:33.980
about their book list
or their curricula.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.020
And one thing that I guess
3.0ish that we've seen is

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.880
that schools have been
approaching WNDB and saying,

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.310
we want to review-- do
a curriculum review.

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:47.820
And there are books that we know
that our community holds dear

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:53.120
that there are likely other
books that could replace them

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.990
or be added to the curricula,
but we need to figure out how

01:32:56.990 --> 01:33:00.180
to have this conversation
with our community,

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.780
but we're willing
to figure that out.

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:04.390
We're willing to have
these conversations.

01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:05.690
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:06.990
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: We have--

01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:08.290
There's a book that
a lot of people love,

01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:11.170
that when I was a kid and read
it, I did not like at all,

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.780
"To Kill a Mockingbird."

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.550
And it was a book that I
had heard so much about

01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:18.070
and just was supposed
to be so great.

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:19.890
And so when I read
it, I was furious

01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:21.930
because I did not
like it at all.

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.650
And it's a lot of
peoples' favorites

01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:25.950
and on a lot of curricula.

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.510
And for my daughter, when
it was on her curricula

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:31.720
in the middle school, and when
she first got it, I was like,

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.030
oh yeah, I hate that book.

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:36.100
And we talked a little
bit about why,

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.880
but I didn't really
talk too much about it

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.110
because she was going
to read it herself.

01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:44.230
So, I wanted her to-- so she
came up feeling some type of way

01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:48.720
after she read it, and--
but was able to articulate

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.650
that to her teacher
and in her classroom.

01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:56.070
And then, I guess, you know,
the school is kind of like

01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:58.890
where that come from, or
we're progressive school,

01:33:58.890 --> 01:34:02.710
we're already doing all
these wonderful things and--

01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:06.500
but was able to sort of
have this conversation

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.230
within the discussion of
the book of who has power

01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:12.430
in the story, who has
agency in the story,

01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:14.180
what is-- what does this mean.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.080
So while the book as far
as I know is still part

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.180
of that curriculum, at
least there's a willingness

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.760
to discuss it and discuss
why and think about everyone

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.940
in the community and how
these stories affect everyone,

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.600
not just the people who
are like, this is classic

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.280
and it's been here
and I love it.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.640
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: The Washington
Post just had a fantastic piece

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.520
on "Challenging the Canon."

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.110
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:45.830
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So, I
encourage you to look that up.

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:48.820
It was within a week
or two, I think.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.120
It was really wonderful.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.420
So the 3.0 thing I'd like to--

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.720
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.020
So schools are doing it.

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.320
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.620
The other 3.0 thing is
I'm always interested

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.920
in who's still missing a table.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.130
And so within Latino
literature, I will tell,

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:03.220
I would like to see more
authors from Honduras,

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.460
from El Salvador,
from other countries.

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.800
If you want to understand
this situation

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.900
that we're facing right now with
immigration, with our borders

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:17.250
and so on, you have to know that
history to see how we got here.

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:21.760
We need more Afro-Latino
authors at the table.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.400
So, those are two areas that
I think within Latino kidlet,

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.690
I'd like to see more
of in there.

01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:32.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: We definitely
need more native First Nations

01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:35.650
writers, indigenous writers
writing about their own cultures

01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:37.370
because their voice is missing.

01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:38.670
I mean, we have a few.

01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:39.970
We need more, right?

01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:41.270
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:42.570
People with disabilities too.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:43.870
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:45.170
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:46.470
The story of the people with
disabilities that are not--

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:48.240
well, and all these cases
that are not problem stories,

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:51.920
but stories about
people living rich

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.220
and full lives in their own way.

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.850
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I mean, I
have two kids that suffer

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.820
from crippling depression.

01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.930
And they are always looking
for the books that isn't

01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:02.360
about suicide or that
glamorizes suicide.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.020
What is with that, right?

01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:07.710
We need the books that show
them that it's OK, you can--

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:10.170
you know, you can live

01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:14.300
and be successful even
with mental disease.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.010
We also need-- Like for me,

01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:20.500
Asian-American Pacific
Islander is this great big

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.430
like amalgam, right?

01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:25.360
Let's talk about
how big that is.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.470
And we tend to focus on
East Asian writing the most,

01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:32.900
East and Southeast
Asian writers.

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.290
We don't have enough
Pacific Islander, right,

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:36.740
authors being published.

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.650
We're not hearing their voice.

01:36:38.650 --> 01:36:39.950
So, I do think there's a lot

01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:41.900
of holes there that
we need to fill.

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:45.460
But I think now, we
have time for questions

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.130
because I see people
wanting to ask.

01:36:48.130 --> 01:36:50.720
So, can we now have questions?

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.570
Yes? Would you like to ask?

01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:59.460
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to know
because you talked bout the way

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:02.330
[inaudible] and someone spoke
to you about your Facebook post

01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:06.470
and then you spoke about
your daughter being able

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:10.770
to articulate and have these
types of conversations,

01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:13.590
and I'm wondering how
do you teach people not

01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:17.760
to be bystanders and voice
their concerns articulately

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.140
without being incendiary.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:27.690
And then also, how do you
speak so that people want

01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:31.620
to have understanding and
compassionate conversations

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:34.750
because people do get on
the defense when you bring

01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:37.540
up racism or bias or bigotry.

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.620
So, how do you have
compassionate,

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.900
understanding conversations?

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.530
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: So, you know
how like you have a--

01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:47.470
if you get an email and you
get really, really angry,

01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:50.140
you're at work, you got
an email, it makes you mad

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.280
and it's probably your
boss and you get really mad

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.320
and you start typing
a really angry email,

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.560
but you don't hit send
because, self-preservation.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.110
You don't want to
get fired, right?

01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:03.240
That-- You know,
that split second

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:08.140
where you recognize what you're
going to say is going to be bad,

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:11.690
that's what saved me in
so many conversations,

01:38:11.690 --> 01:38:15.930
that I've had the ability
to stop, to bite my tongue,

01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:19.130
to push back the defensiveness
by the way, which usually

01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:24.470
that comes up, or the anger,
and then try to engage them

01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:27.820
in a conversation and
deflate their anger.

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.120
So when-- like for example,

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.740
when somebody is called a
racist, they get mad, right?

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.590
How do you then address
the issue without getting

01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:40.060
that first gut reaction?

01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:43.920
For me, it's always been to
kind of like be the calmer one,

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.800
but in kind and gentle and say,

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.150
I understand why you're
upset by hearing this.

01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:54.510
Let's talk about those feelings.

01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:56.670
And I think that that's-- you
have to come with compassion

01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:58.450
because if you're just too
confident, they get mad

01:38:58.450 --> 01:38:59.750
because they're like, oh,

01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:01.050
you think you're
better than me, right?

01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:04.350
So, it's kind of like that,
you know, being compassionate

01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:07.960
and empathetic while trying to
have a difficult conversation.

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.260
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich:

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.560
And I think one thing--
like for my daughter,

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.610
one thing that was--

01:39:12.610 --> 01:39:16.450
she's fortunate with is that
she has always had school

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:21.990
experiences from the very
beginning where they--

01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:23.480
that kind of social-emotional
learning

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.600
and those effective
communication lessons were

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.080
always a part from kindergarten.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.560
And so, a resource that I
would recommend is the--

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.750
I love the Morningside Center

01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:38.070
for teaching social
responsibility.

01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:39.500
And I use those.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.170
So the things that-- when I
used to work with first graders

01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:44.490
and second graders and
fifth graders on how

01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:47.750
to have these hard conversations
and talk in circles,

01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:49.570
or the things that sometimes
when my daughter was little

01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:52.410
and would come home and I would
kind of roll my eyes, like yeah,

01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:57.280
yeah, yeah, nobody really
talks like this, like OK, OK.

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.460
But I see how they work and
I see how when children have

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:05.660
that as part of their
education at school and--

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:08.070
I mean, I'm fortunate that
I can reinforce it at home.

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:11.940
But using those kind of lessons,
I use them all the time.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.520
When I-- Like the lessons
for elementary schoolers,

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.190
I can go back and look at these
when I know that I'm going to be

01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:19.500
in a situation where
I might have

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:22.560
to have a challenging
conversation.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.750
Literally go back and look at
those lessons for teachers or--

01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:30.160
of any age and think
about how I can apply them

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.790
in the conversations
I'm going to have.

01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:34.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I--
I'm going to just butt

01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:37.600
in because I'm remembering
Tim Tingle.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.090
We did one of our
first conferences here

01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:42.810
at the Library of Congress.

01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:46.350
It was talking about family
through the multicultural lens,

01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:51.390
like various people, how do
we see and write about family.

01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.420
And Ellen was on that panel,

01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.370
but so as Tim Tingle
who's a Choctaw author.

01:40:56.370 --> 01:41:00.950
And he said to a very
similar question,

01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:04.680
I remember that I am
meeting them on the bridge

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.290
that they are crossing.

01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:07.610
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, yeah.

01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:08.910
That's right.

01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:13.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And I
never forgot those words

01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:16.070
because when I'm
talking with someone

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:20.620
who has a very deeply different
point of view or a point of view

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.190
that I find hurtful or
just small in some way.

01:41:25.190 --> 01:41:30.660
I try to remember that
they're on a journey, right?

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:35.380
And I'm going to try to be there
and help them cross that bridge.

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:39.530
They won't all, and that's sad.

01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:41.240
But you know what,
it's also true,

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.600
I'm on a journey crossing
a bridge for somebody else.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.310
There are going to be
moments that I make a mistake

01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:51.870
or I am not the most
empathetic and I hope

01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:54.220
that I'm greeted with grace.

01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:59.740
And I get a lot of stuff for
that, like for being too soft

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:05.710
on people sometimes,
and I understand.

01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:10.960
But I think that if we allow the
conversation to just spiral up

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.950
and get really terse,
we stop listening.

01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:18.290
It's like when my husband
and I fight, right?

01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:19.610
Like who's listening, right?

01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:20.910
So, like we got to calm.

01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:22.520
We got to go to the
ice cream parlor

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.260
and share a hot fudge sundae or
something and then we can get

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.560
to the bottom of things,

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.820
which tells you how our
family runs [laughter].

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.650
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I also think
sometimes that you might feel

01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:36.090
like the conversation
is not going anywhere,

01:42:36.090 --> 01:42:37.390
but you never know.

01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:38.690
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

01:42:38.690 --> 01:42:40.500
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: You plant
those seeds wherever you can

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.800
so that you're not
the bystander,

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.740
that you have those
moments where you just kind

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.780
of provide somebody with
a different perspective.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.970
And that maybe, that will become
a growing lesson for them.

01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:53.520
You won't see it, but maybe
somebody else will 10 years

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.820
from now.

01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:56.120
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.420
That happens a lot.

01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.720
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Right, yeah.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.020
Any other questions?

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.970
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think that
it's close to their drain time.

01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:05.270
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I know, right?

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:06.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: They're all
like, I've got to get to eat.

01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:08.770
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Yeah, yeah.

01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:10.560
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Well, if
there's no questions,

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.860
should we just wrap it up?

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.160
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Thank you
so much for having us.

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.460
&gt;&gt; Olugbemisola
Rhuday-Perkovich: Thank you.

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:16.260
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:22.510
[ Applause ]

01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:24.870
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
Thanks so much

01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:27.380
to the panelists here
today, to all our panelists.

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.260
You provided us with
so many great topics

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.120
for future conversations
and things to think about.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.500
So, could we have
a round of applause

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.140
for all the panelists
[applause].

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:42.530
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
