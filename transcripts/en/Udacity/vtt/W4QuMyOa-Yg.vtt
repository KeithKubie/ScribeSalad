00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.960
Let us think through this
a little bit more deeply.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.100
Does the nutritional label make all
the information explicit, David?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.810
&gt;&gt; So it seems like it does, for
each given nutrient in the food,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.310
it lists the explicit amount of that,
that is present in the food.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.059
So it seems like it makes all
the information explicit.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.100
&gt;&gt; Would you say then, it enables me
to draw the right kind of inferences?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.440
Well, it certainly seems like it does.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.520
So, if I'm worried about my diet and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.270
I'm worried about how many
calories I'm consuming,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.470
it tells me right there on the label
exactly how many calories it has.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.320
So, I can infer the right
amount of food to eat per day.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.840
If you're concerned with something
different in your diet, though,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.200
it actually gives you the information
to make a different kind of inference.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.050
&gt;&gt; What about extraneous information,
information that I may not need?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.970
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good point, actually.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.650
Because it gives the information that
anyone might need and, as a result,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.800
it's going to give information
that's extraneous to somebody.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.560
So, for example,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.970
in my diet, I might not care about
the number of carbohydrates I consume.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.540
So, for me,
that's extraneous information.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.750
But, for somebody else,
that's very important.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.500
So it doesn't avoid
extraneous information, but

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.990
it would be really hard for it to do so.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.790
&gt;&gt; What about relationships?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.880
Does it make all the concepts
of all the relationships

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.390
between them really explicit?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.000
&gt;&gt; So actually, now that you mention it,
Ashoke, it really doesn't.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.370
So for example, the number of calories
from fat in a particular food is based,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.500
in large part,
on the amount of fat that's in it.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.100
It gives the number of calories from fat
and the amount of fat in it right there

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.270
on the label, but it doesn't tell me
that there's a relationship there.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.910
So I really can't make any inferences
based on that relationship.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.980
I don't even know that
relationship exists.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.270
&gt;&gt; So note how this connects with
the ability to make inferences.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.675
Nutritional labels capture some
information that allows us to make

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.300
good inferences,
do not capture all the information.
