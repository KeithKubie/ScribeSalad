00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.750
Let's get started.
Settle down. The weekend has not

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:42.933
quite started.
Let's look at what happened on

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:37.250
Wednesday. There are the scores.
Class average about 67, standard

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:54.900
deviation about 17,
so that means it is a bell curve

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:48.750
sitting right on the 50.
A lot of people improved.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:07.600
There were a lot of rags to riches
stories, but there are still a fair

00:00:34.500 --> 00:01:00.250
number of people down here.
And so my suggestion to you is that

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:17.033
if you are down here
and you want to --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.500
Too much talking,
people. If you want to start your

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
weekend soon, I will help you by
inviting you to leave.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.500
You don't have to stay here if you
don't want to,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.000
but if you do choose to stay,
please sit in silence. This is 3.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500
91. If you are down here, get in
and see us. Please talk to your

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
recitation instructor,
come on in and see me, and we will

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
talk about strategies for studying,
strategies for success. I want you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.000
to pass this class,
but just doing the same thing over --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:46.300
This is, I think,
Einstein's definition of insanity,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.610
doing the same thing over and over
again expecting a different outcome.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.920
If what you have been doing up to
now is not working,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.230
let's try something else.
And we can help you. The model

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.530
solutions are up and,
if there are changes that need to be

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.840
made, please get in to see me.
Why don't we agree not to do it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.330
until Monday.
I would like you to first talk to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.990
your recitation instructor and make
sure that there is something worth

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.660
exploring. The final exam is on the
15th of December.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.330
The final exam is going to
essentially represent the equivalent

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.990
of a double monthly test.
You will have three hours.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.660
But I give about double the amount
of work, so it should give you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.330
enough time to finish.
But the final exam will consist of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:03:00.060
a mix of what is covered since Test
3. It is like a Test 4 monthly.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:50.380
And also some material going all the
way back to the beginning of the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.760
semester. It is both cumulative and
focused, so it has breadth and depth.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.150
And it is really good to pass the
final. If people pass the final,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.530
it tilts things in favor of passing
the class. If you crash and burn on

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.920
the final, it raises a lot of
questions as to whether you have

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.300
been working all along,
you gave up around Veteran's Day and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.930
so on. I urge you to keep at it.
And don't leave everything to the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.810
last minute. If you take a look at
your final exam schedule,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.680
this is the third day of the final
exam period. Some of you may have

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.550
exams Monday and Tuesday.
If you think you are going to cram

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.430
it all in on Tuesday night,
it is not going to work. You are

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.310
going to be very tired by the middle
of that week. You need to have a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.180
plan. You have to work
incrementally so that things sink in.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.060
You cannot just do high-speed
Fick's second law and expect it is

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.930
all just going to go zooming in.
It won't. It will look like first

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.790
law. It will go in this side and
out the other side.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.660
Keep at it. Well, let's get on
with the lesson.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.530
Today is going to be a chance to
apply the organic chemistry that we

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.390
learned on Monday.
I said we learned enough organic

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.260
chemistry to set the stage for
polymers, so today we are going to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.130
talk about polymers.
Monday we will come back and finish

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:36.060
up polymers, and then that will lead
us into biochemistry.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:24.260
This is all part of applied organic
chemistry. To date,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.530
what are the types of solids that we
have seen in 3.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.790
91? We saw solids that are
consisting of single atoms stacked.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.060
Then we saw compounds stacked.
Last day we started looking at

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.330
chains. And we have even seen
networks, some of them amorphous,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.590
some of them crystalline. Today
what we are going to look at is a

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.860
new form of solid where the building
block is a long chain, long

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.070
in quotation marks.
And this is a polymer.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.210
Polymers are pervasive in our
society. We see them in everything

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.350
from your CDs,
the CD cases. You see them in trash

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.490
bags. You see them in clothing,
microfibers. Some of these new

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.640
fibers have an incredible mix of
properties in terms of comfort and

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.780
security. Auto parts.
All over the map. And,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.920
when it comes to soft matter,
we, as human beings are solid state

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.900
devices.
Mother Nature is a polymer chemist.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.720
It is all macromolecular chemistry.
If we want to introduce polymers

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.540
today, let's have an operating
definition. A polymer is a long

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.360
chain molecule with a repeating
chemical structure.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.180
And let me give you an example.
I will give you one that builds on

00:05:47.180 --> 00:06:05.560
something we saw the other day.
We have seen ethylene or ethene.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
This is C2H4, and it has the
chemical structure.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What we can do is turn this into a
long chain molecule with a repeating

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
chemical structure in the following
manner. We can react it with

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
something that will catalyze the
destruction of this double bond.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And once this double bond is broken
we can flip it over to the other

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
side of the carbon giving us the
opportunity to continue to link.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.500
This is done with a radical,
so we can denote the radical R.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.000
And I am going to put this,
remember, the unpaired electron.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.500
This is a radical with its unpaired
electron which we term an initiator.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.000
And so this initiator, when it
meets something with a double bond,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.500
reacts. The double bond is
something that could be turned into

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.000
two single bonds. Let's
go to maximize bonds.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:56.220
This one has no bond,
broken. This one has a double bond.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.440
We could react the two and result
in the following,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.660
and now this goes over to here.
Now the initiator has attacked this

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.880
double bond, built the bridge,
and now the radical is at the end

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.220
here.
Well, ethylene is a gas.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.660
If this is sitting in a reactor,
gas molecules are colliding with

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.110
this, so now we can attack another
ethylene and so on.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.550
You get the picture.
Eventually this thing is thousands

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:52.166
and thousands of atoms long.
Let's do one more.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And now we will have the bond here,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:52.720
one, two, three, four, like so.
And so now you see a repeat unit.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.180
Here is a repeat unit. And this
repeat unit can go n times where n

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.630
is very, very large.
N can be on the order of ten

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.080
thousand or so giving us molecules
that have atomic masses of a million

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.540
grams per mole.
These are huge.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:32.080
We call this n. I am using n now
in a new way.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
N is called the polymerization index
and it represents the number of

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
repeats of the mer unit.
The mer is the repeat unit.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And what is the length of this
thing? Let's get a sense of this.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Suppose we had something that was,
say, ten thousand units long. Let's

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
say n is ten thousand,
that might give me something on the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
order of about a million
grams per mole.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Let me do the calculation a
different way.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Suppose I had something that had an
atomic mass of a hundred thousand

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
grams per mole.
This is the atomic mass of the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
polymer. And divide that by the
atomic mass of ethylene.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Ethylene is 28 grams per mole.
This is the mass of C2H4 and this

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is the mass of the polyethylene,
one molecule.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:26.660
That would give us then a
polymerization index of 3,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:33.330
71, about 3,600. And, if we
estimate a carbon-carbon bond

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:39.990
distance, about one and a half
angstroms for carbon-carbon bond

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:46.660
distance, that gives us something
that is on the order of about a half

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.720
a micron in length for one molecule.
And to give you a sense of what that

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.180
really means, I want to show you a
demo here. What I have is a pull

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.630
chain that you use downstairs in
grandma's house to turn on the

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.080
lights. This is a whole bunch of
these brass balls that are held

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.540
together by metal.
Let's have each of these represent

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:33.746
carbon. And this one is about three
thousand units long, about 40 feet.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There are about three thousand of
these units here.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Let's get a sense of how big this
is.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is one molecule.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.400
Imagine what happens when this,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:11:03.190
in the melt state, is flowing. What
happens when the melt decreases in

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.990
temperature and this attempts to
solidify? What are the chances that

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.790
this is going to come out in one of
the 14 Bravais lattices?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.590
It is vanishingly small.
I feel like I just came back from

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:23.330
New Orleans.
I didn't even have to lift my shirt.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:29.990
Look at all this stuff I have.
This is terrific.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:36.660
That is one molecule.
And, if we imagine what happens,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.330
let's say that it is pretty clear
that, let's call this macromolecule,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:59.460
solid macromolecules favor being
amorphous.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:57.080
Favor the amorphous state.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.240
This is a notion of pure
crystallization.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.410
And we can imagine,
for example, all of the rules that

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.580
we learned for the inorganic glasses,
the silicates apply to organic

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.740
glasses. Let's look at,
say, volume versus temperature for

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.910
something like polyethylene.
I am just going to call this PE,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:37.253
polyethylene for short.
We can imagine we are up here in the

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.500
melt state, we cool down,
we go through a normal melting point

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.500
and then we reach a solidification
at some glass transition temperature.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.500
Let's say this is at a slow cooling
rate, so this is Tg slow.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.500
And maybe on another occasion we
cool at a fast rate,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.500
and so we will have a different
glass transition temperature and it

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:52.720
will be higher.
And let's say this over here is room

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.180
temperature. What do I find?
I have two different volumes.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.630
You have seen this before. If I
have for constant mass equal masses.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:09.080
The one with the higher volume has
the lower density.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.540
This should be low-density.
Let me just put the fast cooling

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:31.346
rate. Fast cool.
This is slow cool.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:24.610
This will be low-density
polyethylene formed here and this

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.220
will be high-density polyethylene
simply by the different rates of

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.840
cooling. Constant mass means then
that you have density is mass over

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.450
volume, so the one with the higher
volume gives us the lower mass.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.070
We can see how by different
processing we have the ability to

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.690
change between high-density and
low-density polyethylene as a

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.110
function of the cooling rate.
Now, other things can happen.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.350
If we go at a low rate of cooling,
we can get even down here at very,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.580
very low cooling rates.
We might even get some degree of

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.820
crystallization.
Could we switch over to the

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.050
document camera feed,
please? Let's see what happens when

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.290
this thing attempts to crystallize.
Here we are. What can happen is if

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.520
we cool at a slow enough rate,
this cannot form a single crystal

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.760
but what it can do is fold back on
itself and, thereby,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:40.320
put these atoms into a regular
arrangement.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.200
This is now forming a zone of

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.600
crystallinity.
And why is it doing this?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.000
It is doing this to maximize Van
der Waals bonding here.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:47.400
The tighter it packs, the greater
the intensity of bond formation.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:15:06.400
We see this happening in the
formation of such zones

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:56.160
of crystallinity.
And when this happens we have a

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.490
change in properties.
Let's consider low-density

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.830
polyethylene. Well,
we know that this thing is going to

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.160
be mechanically flexible.
It is going to be flexible because

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.490
what are the only bonds operative
here? They are just weak Van der

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.830
Waals bonds, mechanically flexible.
It is high band-gap material and it

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.750
is amorphous.
There are no grains,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:28.250
there are no grain boundaries so it
is transparent because of the high

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.750
band-gap and it is clear.
We can see through it because there

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.250
are no internal surfaces.
That is low-density polyethylene.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:44.750
High-density polyethylene, well, it
has some zones of this.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.250
The high-density polyethylene has
these near crystalline zones,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:55.070
and then it is broadly amorphous.
The difference here is small.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.210
The density here is about 0.92
grams per centimeter cubed,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.350
and this is about 0.96 grams per
centimeter cubed.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.490
There is a little bit of tighter
packing here. But what happens when

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.640
we get into these zones of
regularity, because there is a

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.780
higher atom density,
this turns out to have a higher

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.920
reactivity with light.
Therefore, I am using n here not to

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.540
mean index of polymerization.
This is index of refraction.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.630
The index of refraction in the near
crystalline zones is not equal to

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.720
the index of refraction in the
amorphous zones.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.810
Now we have zones that are near
crystalline in zones that are

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.900
amorphous. And so we have the
effect of internal interface.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:17:03.600
And, as a result, the high-density
polyethylene is opaque.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.300
These zones here add rigidity.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:17:04.890
There is a stiffness here. This
one is rigid. What do we have?

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:11.490
We have low-density polyethylene.
This is what you see in use in food

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:18.090
wrap. Whereas,
this is what you see in the milk

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:24.690
jugs, the milk jugs that are
somewhat hardened and

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.440
do not admit light.
They are both the same material,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.330
but what has happened is just a
slight change in the strength of the

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.220
material through a change in
processing, a change in cooling rate.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.100
Let's look at how we can take this
idea of tailoring properties and

00:17:45.100 --> 00:18:04.133
extend it more broadly and maybe put
it on a firmer footing.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:55.800
Let's look at the various items in
our toolbox. We want to tailor the

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.600
properties. The first thing we can
do is control composition.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.400
Control of composition - that is
purity. We can start with pure

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:25.800
polymers and polymers that are made
of combinations of different

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.000
polymers. Let's start
with the pure polymer.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:24.630
The pure polymer,
because it comes from a different

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:30.270
heritage, have their own terminology.
Pure polymers or polymers

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.900
consisting of a single mer are
called homopolymers.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.540
They consist of a single mer,
one mer type, and it is repeated.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:47.180
For example, polyethylene.
Ethylene is the repeat unit.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:53.270
And that is all you see.
Polyethylene from end to end.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:59.810
Then if we want to mix different
mers, we get what is to a polymer

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:06.360
what we would call an alloy in a
metal system. And this is called a

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:12.900
copolymer. It has more than one
type. Greater than one mer type.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.450
And so, for example, we could make
a copolymer of,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:35.966
say, polyethylene with,
say, polyvinylchloride.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:30.590
Polyethylene and polyvinylchloride.
And, this notation, this lower case

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.190
c with the hyphens on either side
indicate that we are talking about a

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.790
copolymer of these two units.
You know what the parent unit is of

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.390
ethylene, I have shown you that.
And we saw last day that if we took

00:19:44.390 --> 00:20:03.713
ethylene, dropped a hydrogen,
this became the vinyl radical.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:52.850
And then, if we put a chlorine here,
this is vinyl chloride. It has a

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.710
double bond here.
We can use the same polymerization

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.560
technique, propagate this by
converting it to a single bond.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.420
And now, instead of vinyl chloride,
we will have the polymer

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.280
polyvinylchloride.
And, if we had both vinyl chloride

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.140
in the reactor and ethylene in the
reactor, we would be grabbing

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:31.080
molecules of both types
and attaching them.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So, as you move down the chain,
you might have ethylene unit, vinyl

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
chloride unit,
ethylene unit and so on.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And, if we could go to the computer
feed, I can show some examples of

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
different ways in which we can put
these on the chain.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
The first one, this is taken right
from your reading,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
is called the random copolymer where
A and B represent different mer

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
units. A could be ethylene and B
could be vinyl chloride.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And here they are just random.
You get some unit of vinyl chloride

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and then several units and so on.
And some people want this for

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
particular mechanical properties,
so let's document these different

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
types. If we have random
arrangement of the mer groups,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
random arrangement of mer types,
we have what is called the random

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
copolymer. Let's just
use this same example.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:23.920
This could be polyethylene lower
case r-PVC. That tells you it is a

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.840
random copolymer.
The next one shows what they are

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.760
calling a regular copolymer where
you have alternating.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.690
It is strict alternating
arrangement of mer-type.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.610
It moves from one to the other in
alternating sequence.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.530
And this is known as the
alternating copolymer

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:53.530
to distinguish it.
You cannot call it regular because

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.610
"r" is already taken for the random
copolymer. The third one is shown

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.690
up here where we take and cluster
the different mer types.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:08.760
Instead of having alternating one
to the other, we take a run of one

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.840
type of mer and then a run of
another type of mer.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.920
This is a clustered arrangement of
mer types into what we call these

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:37.240
clusters, are called blocks of the
same type of mer.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:28.610
And such a material is called a
block copolymer,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.220
which is shown up here where you see
there are four units of A and then

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.840
four units of B and then two units
of A, four units of B.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.460
This is a little bit unrealistic.
Typically, commercial block

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.070
copolymers are usually diblocks or
triblocks. If it were a diblock of

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.690
polyethylene, it would be one run of
polyethylene and one run of

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.540
polyvinylchloride and that is it.
You don't do this sort of thing but

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:04.630
the artist got carried away and
somebody didn't proofread.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:11.720
And the last thing you can do is
the one on the bottom which is

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:18.810
called the graft.
The graft is sort of a type of

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:25.900
block copolymer where what you have
is graft of one mer type in the form

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:42.400
of a side chain onto another mer
type for the backbone.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:37.250
You cluster them but you cluster
them very deliberately in this

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:57.400
manner, and that is shown in the
bottom one. The backbone is all As

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:45.750
and the side chain is all Bs.
And here is one. Some of you are

00:23:45.750 --> 00:24:05.966
going to be doing some traveling so
I have put up a very common one.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:54.830
This is ABS,
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:59.660
You have seen butadiene. We say
that last day,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.490
styrene. What this is,
the backbone is all butadiene,

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.330
and then the side chains are
alternately acrylonitrile and

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:14.160
styrene. And this is what is used
for hard sided luggage and also this.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:33.120
All these old telephones are made
of this graft copolymer.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:24.160
And, by playing with the nature of
these side chains,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.330
we can obviously make this so that
it is somewhat flexible,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.490
or we could make it so that it is
rather rigid. Again,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.660
examples of architecture at the
local level dictating properties.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.830
We have these examples of how we
can tailor the properties.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:25:03.460
The second thing is the
configurations of the side groups.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:53.850
Side group configuration.
These are all options that we have.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.710
And we exercise them in the
synthesis, by playing with the

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.560
synthesis conditions and also the
catalysts that are present.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.420
And that is shown here. There are
basically three ways you can put the

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.280
side groups on.
The upper one shows the methyl

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.140
group randomly going.
Sometimes it is above,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:32.946
sometimes it is below, and there
seems to be no pattern.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:20.880
This whole notion of side group
configuration is referred to as

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.760
tacticity. It means the placement
of the side groups.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.640
There are only three choices here.
Either you put them all on the same

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.520
side of the chain,
that is the bottom one,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.410
isotactic, or you put them on
alternate. One sits on one side of

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.290
the chain then it is on the other
side of the chain.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:44.170
You alternate back and forth with
regularity. That is syndiotactic.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.050
And then the third case is, come
what may, there is no seeming plan,

00:25:48.050 --> 00:26:06.966
and that is the atactic.
Those are the three types that you

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
need to be aware of,
isotactic, syndiotactic and atactic.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And you can figure those out. Iso
obviously means they are all on the

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
same side of the chain.
Atactic is as amoral, apolitical,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
so this is random. And then by
elimination this must

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:22.140
be alternating.
And I think on the next one I did a

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.420
little doodling for you.
Just to bring home what is going on,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.710
the first one at the top is atactic
polypropylene.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.990
So you see there is propylene.
And what has happened is this

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.280
double bond has been broken and now
it can propagate.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.570
And this methyl group in some cases
is above and in some cases below the

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.850
chain. Here is polystyrene.
This is vinyl benzene or

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.770
phenylethene or styrene.
And this double bond is broken and

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:58.330
you have these phenyl groups hanging
off the side. And this is just

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:03.880
vinyl chloride which we saw over
here. Again, seeing the synthesis.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.440
Then the last thing we can look at
is backbone architecture or chain

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:27.346
architecture. Chain here referring
to the main chain.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:22.580
And this falls under the general

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:27.740
term of conformality.
And we are going to revisit this

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:32.910
when we talk about proteins.
It is very important in biological

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:38.080
systems. And it is a direct result
of this, which I showed you last day,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.240
that this bond is free to rotate.
And, if it rotates in certain ways

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.410
so that all the side groups line up
perfectly, you end up with this

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.680
so-called eclipsed version.
If you look at the chain on the very

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.060
end you would see one dot that
represents the backbone.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.430
Actually, it is zigzagging.
You would see the edge of the

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.800
zigzag. And then all of the pendant
groups will be lined up in front of

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.180
one another and you would see
nothing except the very first one.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.550
That is the eclipse and that is the
most regular, straight line.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.930
And this is staggered where it
rotates where it wishes.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.310
And I showed you this one where
this is hardly something with the

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.900
polymerization index of 3600.
But it starts giving you the sense

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:26.720
of some are more nearly straight and
some are very heavily coiled.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.540
Both of these are still called
straight chains,

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:38.360
but there are some things that we
can look at. First we have the

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.180
linear one, the linear chain
molecule. And so that is one.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:29:02.293
Furthermore, if you look here,
there is some fine structure.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:55.270
You may even see that at some point
along here there is even some

00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:00.540
attempt at crystallization.
But, even so, the system moves in

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.810
one direction from one end to
another. The alternative is

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:11.080
branched chain.
It is a different type of

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.360
architecture. In that case,
you actually have something that -

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.380
This is not graft.
This is actually the main component

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.150
of the backbone continuing to grow
but growing in a plurality of paths.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.920
You can imagine that one of these
is going to pack much better than

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.690
the other. One is going to have a
greater chance of forming such zones

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.460
of crystallinity.
Clearly, it is going to be the

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.230
linear chain. These branches stick
out and they prevent tight packing.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:30:03.326
The branched chain is harder to
crystallize.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And, when it forms its amorphous
structures, it has more free volume.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:30:02.440
And also you can think about the

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.330
glass transition temperature,
Tg, how is that going to work and so

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.220
on. By looking at the branching you
end up with such structures.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:17.100
There is one other one, and that is
shown here. That is to take several

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:35.066
chains, whether they are
linear or branched.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I am just going to draw several
straight chains here.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And it is possible to link chains
by joining them with some covalent

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
bridges. This is a covalent bridge,
this is a covalent bridge, and it

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:51.640
actually links one chain to another.
And imagine the mechanical

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.920
properties of this material.
Otherwise, there would be weak Van

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.210
der Waals bonds.
And, if we apply a shear stress,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.490
we can cause the material to
plastically deform.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.780
But these are strong covalent bonds.
What will happen is I can move this

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.070
material, shear it up to a point,
but then I would encounter the

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.350
resistance of these bonds.
And, as soon as I let go of the

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:15.640
applied force, it springs back.
By cross-linking,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.920
this is a cross-linked architecture,
I impart some elasticity. And this

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.210
is, in fact, the structure of rubber.
And we call such polymers

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:31.490
elastomers because they will spring
back to shape.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.780
And what would have to happen here
in order to allow for the

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:42.070
cross-links? We have to be able to
form covalent bonds.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:47.350
If we are going to form covalent
bonds, we have to break some bonds

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:52.410
that are present in the backbone.
If I have bonds such as this in the

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:57.230
backbone, and then I come up with
this R group that wants to somehow

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.050
attach, it is pretty clear that if I
break one of these bonds in order to

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.880
make the attachment,
I cut the chain. It is axiomatic

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.700
then, if I am going to form
cross-links, I need to find a

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.520
position along the backbone that has
a double bond.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.350
Thereby, I can break the double
bond, convert it to a single bond,

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:26.170
link up with the cross-linking
bridge and keep the integrity of the

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:44.940
backbone while forming a new bond to
an adjacent chain.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
This is the condition for which we
form elastomers and this is the

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
basis for rubber.
And I think this next cartoon shows

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
that - here is polyisoprene.
And you can see there is a double

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
bond in the backbone.
And by presenting sulfur,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
sulfur is capable, as is oxygen,
of forming bridges. We saw in the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
silicates, in the borates how the
oxygen forms covalent bonds on

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
either side, thereby linking
silicate units.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Well, sulfur is below oxygen.
If we believe Mendeleev, it should

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
have similar properties.
And so sulfur is forming bridging

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
structures breaking these double
bonds and now linking the one orange

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
backbone with the adjacent
orange backbone.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:26.300
Sulfur enables cross-linking.
And this, in fact, is discovered

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.610
here in Boston.
It was Nathaniel Hawthorne

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.920
**Nathaniel Hayward** who was
working in Roxbury and was trying to

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.230
stabilize rubber.
Natural rubber is very sticky,

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.530
and so he found that by adding
sulfur he could cause the rubber to

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.840
lose its stickiness and thereby
develop a synthetic rubber that had

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.380
superior properties.
And then it was Charles Goodyear who

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.150
came to Boston,
saw this, took the invention and

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.920
licensed it. It was Goodyear who
accidently spilled some of this

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.690
cross-linked rubber onto a hot stove.
And the thermal treatment gave a

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:11.460
far superior rubber which gave birth
to vulcanization.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.230
And then from there it is all
history of automobile tires and

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:35.193
whatnot. This is advantageous from
a property standpoint.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:25.830
But it is very disadvantageous from
the standpoint of recycling.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.660
How could one possibly recycle this
material? Let's compare these two.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:35.490
Let's compare the case of
polyethylene. Polyethylene consists

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:40.330
of many chains and they will
interpenetrate and entangle.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:45.160
What are the bonds between these
chains? The bonds between these

00:34:45.160 --> 00:35:03.986
chains are Van der Waals.
This is a Van der Waals solid.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:54.160
These are Van der Waals bonds.
And we know Van der Waals bonds are

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.330
operative at low temperatures but
not operative at high temperatures.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.490
If we take polyethylene and heat it,
these bonds will weaken and this

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.660
will turn liquid.
And we can reprocess this.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.830
By going to high temperature it can
reprocess because we are only

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:29.260
breaking these weak Van
der Waals bonds.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:19.250
Now, if we take this cross-linked
polyisoprene, I will show it in this

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:37.800
manner, how are we going to
reprocess this?

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:27.750
If we begin to heat this,
we are going to have to go to an

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:47.900
extremely high temperature because
we have to break covalent bonds.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:36.250
If we go to a temperature high
enough to break these bonds,

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:55.933
if we go to a temperature high
enough to break the backbone,

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:44.750
we go to thermal destruction of the
entire material.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:36:03.833
So such materials cannot be
reprocessed by heating.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:53.760
These are called thermoset.
And thermoset are very difficult to

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.530
process, difficult to recycle.
You might say, well, you don't have

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.300
to just do it by thermally
reprocessing. Why don't you use

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.070
some kind of a chemistry?
Go in there with chemistry that

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.840
will attack these bonds.
These are strong covalent bonds.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.610
What kind of a solvent is going to
be strong enough to

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:36.686
snip those bonds?
It is going to be a very aggressive

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
solvent. And what are the health
effects of the use of that solvent?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Do you want to bet the company on
the use of that and find out later

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
that you have class action lawsuits
using such chemicals?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
This is the issue when you drive
down the highway and see these

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
mountains of spent automobile tires,
how to recycle them. This is the

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
issue. Whereas,
over here, you heat this up and you

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
can redo it. Such materials are
called thermoplastic.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
They can be reprocessed or rendered
plastic by a temperature rise.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
They are environmentally much,
much easier to process. Afew more

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
things here with the polyethylene.
This shows what I was just doing on

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
the document camera.
This is the partially crystallized

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
polyethylene and this is what it
looks like in these zones.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:24.280
You do not have all of the chains
lining up, but if you look at the

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.570
atoms on end you will see there is
the C2H4 unit.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:32.850
And the C2H4 units are lined up.
And, sure enough, what is the basis

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.140
unit here? It looks orthorhombic,
as you would expect. The molecule

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.420
that has the aspect ratio of 2:1 you
expect is going to come out in one

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.710
of the Bravais lattices that also
has some anisotropy associated with

00:37:45.710 --> 00:38:04.286
it. And here is some x-ray
diffraction data.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:53.860
This is the diffraction of a fully
crystalline polymer.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.730
If we took a short length
polyethylene and cooled it very

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.590
slowly or took it out of a solvent,
we would end up with something that

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:05.460
is totally crystalline.
And we see we have discrete peaks.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.330
Here it is the same material
amorphous. And,

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.190
if it is a little bit painful to
look at this because it is

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.060
reminiscent of a question on the
recent test, this is

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.460
what the data show.
By looking at this mixed spectrum,

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:26.380
you can get a measure of the extent
of crystallization,

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:31.300
by looking at the relative intensity
of the peaks versus this broad

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.220
single peak which is associated with
the first nearest neighbors,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.150
because in ethylene we know that
carbon has hydrogens as its nearest

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:46.070
neighbors and so on.
This works just as well as the free

00:38:46.070 --> 00:39:05.740
volume as a measure of the degree of
crystallization. So, we see this.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:59.280
The last thing I want to touch upon
is the polymer synthesis,

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:07.570
just to put that into a formal
setting. I have already shown you

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:15.850
addition polymerization,
which involves the use of a radical

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:28.100
or catalyst-assisted.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:29.720
And it is characterized by three
stages where I showed you the

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.450
initiation in which we generate the
radical. Then there is the growth

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:39.170
of the polymer until we get to the
length of chain that we want.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.900
Then, finally, the extinguishing of
the reaction called termination.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.630
What is really going on here is in
the initiation stage we

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:54.620
create the radical.
Here the growth is simply the

00:39:54.620 --> 00:40:01.870
polymerization.
Polymerize, or if you like

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:09.120
attachment. And then over here is
to quench the radical.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.370
And those are the stages that are
involved. All we are really looking

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:29.740
at here is monomer attachment.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:30.550
And, in this case,
the composition of the polymer is

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:36.100
equal to the composition of the mer
unit. The composition of the

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.660
polymer is simply identical to the
composition of the mer unit.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:47.220
We simply use the radical to
catalyze, and that is

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:53.660
the only effect.
But there is one other way to form,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:41:00.990
and this is called a condensation
polymerization.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:08.330
And it works a little bit
differently. It involves more than

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:15.660
one mer type. I am going to show
this as mer type number one,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:31.520
which has associated with it a
terminal hydrogen.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:28.600
And mer number two that has
associated with it a terminal

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:34.200
hydroxyl. And condensation
polymerization works to attach the

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.800
hydroxyl to the terminal hydrogen to
form a covalent bond between the

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.400
residual R1 and R2 and expels water
vapor. These reactions are

00:41:45.400 --> 00:42:04.000
conducted at temperatures above 100
degrees C. This is expelled.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:56.800
And ultimately is captured as a
condensate. Oddly enough,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:02.590
condensation polymerization,
which involves the stepwise building

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:08.390
of the polymer by reaction between
two different mer types and

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:14.190
expulsion of water vapor condensate
is named not for what it is but for

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:33.113
the byproduct that is not part of it.
This is the prototypical reaction.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Clearly here you keep losing water.
In this case, the composition

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000
differs and the final mass of
polymer is not equal to the

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
composition of the mer groups.
And the mass is less than the sum

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000
of the masses of all of the mer
groups because we keep losing water.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I think here we have some examples
of the various materials.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
This, again, is taken from your
reading. Here is a suite of

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
addition polymers,
many of these you encounter in

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
everyday life.
I have been talking about

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
polyethylene. If we replace the
hydrogens with fluorines,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
we get PTFE which you know by the
trade name Teflon.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Polypropylene. Polystyrene which
you have seen in these clamshells.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:25.270
Not so much today in coffee cups for
their insulating capability.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:30.540
Polyacrylonitrile is a fabric Orlon.
PVC is that white tubing that you

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.810
see used in plumbing facilities.
Polymethylmethacrylate, many of you

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:41.080
are wearing eyeglasses that are made
of this material.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.360
This is Plexiglas or Lucite.
And so on. And down here even some

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.380
of the rubbers.
On the other hand,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:56.150
here are the condensation polymers.
And notably are the nylons, which

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.920
are made by condensation
polymerization.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.690
And I have put a little bit of fine
structure on here.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:10.450
You can look at this on the website.
The bond that will link the R1 to

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:15.220
R2 is called the amide bond.
This is the amide bond. And so

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:33.240
nylons are known generically
as polyamides.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
And, furthermore,
there is on end that has the

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
carboxylic acid end,
and then the other end which has the

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
amino end. And,
as you go down, you see Kevlar is

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
here, which you know is used as a
substitute for steel belting in

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
tires, also used as the fiber in
bulletproof vests.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Some fabrics here,
Dacron and Mylar, various polyesters.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
The polycarbonates.
This rigid phenyl group here is

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
what gives the polycarbonates
their high strength.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:57.330
This is Lexan which is used in jet
engine windshields and is also used

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.660
in sports goggles to give you the
resistance against impact and so on.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.990
These are made by this process, and
we are going to see this process

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:13.330
again when we talk about protein
synthesis because Mother Nature

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:18.660
works by condensation polymerization.
There are many similarities between

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:36.720
the nylons and the proteins that
make up our bodies.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:28.610
What I would like to do in the last
five minutes is talk about an

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:33.220
example of the use of block
copolymers in energy.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.840
And some research that has been
going on here at MIT for about ten

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.460
years now looking at new materials
to make superior batteries,

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:47.070
batteries for the wireless age.
And these are the kinds of

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:51.690
batteries that exist today in terms
of the amount of energy

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.850
they store per charge.
And you see lead acid,

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:59.570
which is abundant and cheap,
is actually quite low in terms of

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.280
how much energy it stores.
And what is in your cell phone and

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.990
your laptop is the lithium ion
battery which is 150 watt hours per

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.710
kilogram by this metric.
And, in fact, it was the advent of

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.420
the nickel metal hydride battery
that enabled the laptop computer.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.140
All of the components were in place
in the 1980s, but sodium sulfur is a

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.860
molten salt batter.
It operates at 300 degrees C so that

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.590
was not very popular for laptop use.
The only thing that was available

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:29.330
was down here NiCd.
And people were not going to

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:33.060
release laptops that had a runtime
of about one hour.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.790
But with the advent of nickel metal
hydride it all of a sudden became

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:40.530
sensible to put out such devices.
And now we have a lithium ion. And,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.260
ironically, as the capacity of the
battery has risen,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:47:03.653
the appliances that go on the laptop
have risen.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:51.730
And so the runtime does not change
because each next generation has a

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:55.460
more intense power hog of a CPU.
You want a DVD, you want a fancy

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.190
screen and so on.
All of that is consuming energy.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.930
But if you knew how to power it
down and run it minimally,

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:06.660
you would find that you could get
run times of six,

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.390
seven hours. The approach that we
used here was to use block

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:14.130
copolymers. And we used block
copolymers such that we

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.820
wanted to get a solid.
You see, people think of batteries

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.460
as these cylindrical devices that
are very heavy,

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.110
but we had a different image.
We thought that this should be the

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.760
battery. The battery should remind
us of something like this,

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.400
and this is called dreaming.
This is a potato chip bag. You

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.050
think it is just nothing by a lowly
potato chip bag.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:39.700
Open it up sometime.
What do you find? You see it is a

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.350
multilayer laminate of polymer and
metal, because the potato chip is

00:47:43.350 --> 00:48:02.966
precious. You have to protect it
against spoilage.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:50.660
It can spoil by becoming soggy from
humidity or it can become rancid

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:54.330
from oxidation.
You need the polymer to protect it

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.990
from one and the metal to protect it
from the other.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.660
But this tells me that you can make
a multilayer thin film laminate very

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.330
cheaply. If this polymer could be
made into a lithium ion conductor,

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.990
we would have a solid state battery.
Instead of aluminum, we would put

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.660
lithium. Instead of this polymer,
we would put something that could

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.330
conduct lithium ions.
And then we would put the cathode

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:37.193
on here. Now we have something that
is solid state. It is very light.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:24.530
And it has a property that no other
battery has. You can reshape it.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:29.060
You can wear it. You can put it in
the body of a car.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:33.590
You could change the watch band to
change the battery.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:38.130
If you can think conceptually,
you can do different things. That

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:42.660
is how it began.
And with my colleague Professor

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:47.190
Anne Mayes who started a program to
look at a class of materials,

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:51.730
block copolymers that were chosen in
such a way to give lithium ion

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.850
conduction at room temperature.
Solids are very poor ionic

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.570
conductors. Most solids that you
know that conduct ions only operate

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:03.280
at high temperatures.
The oxygen sensor in your car does

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.990
not work for about the first 15
minutes. When the car is cold,

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.710
the oxygen sensor is getting garbage
for a signal. It has to heat up.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:14.420
But we don't want a battery that
runs at 300 degrees C.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.140
At least I don't. There are
selection rules here

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.250
that went into play.
And, ultimately,

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:26.750
we built something that looked like
this, that has a methacrylate

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:31.250
backbone and different side groups
that could solvate lithium ions,

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.750
and we made the materials and
ultimately made first generation

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:40.250
batteries that are thin film,
mechanically flexible. And the

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:44.750
choice of electrode materials
provided its lithium-based chemistry

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:48.940
and so on allow us to go forward.
And it was by using the principles

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.820
shown here on these boards that we
were able to engineer a polymer that

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.700
could have the mechanical properties
of something like Saran wrap but

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.580
have the electrical properties of
sulfuric acid in your lead acid

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.460
battery. That was the paradox,
how to engineer those seemingly

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.350
irreconcilable properties.
Right there, control of local

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.230
structure. And I have all this
stuff up here that we don't have

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:16.110
time to go through,
but let me show you where you can go

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:35.020
when you get something
that is really nice.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:24.140
Look at this. This is flexible
solar cell. This is silicon on a

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.280
polymer substrate,
so it is collecting photons and

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.420
converting them into electrons.
And then you take something like

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.560
this and put it on the back of a
flexible solar cell.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.710
And then you put on the front of
this the LEDs.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.850
You put this up in the roof,
you collect the photons, and then

00:50:44.850 --> 00:51:04.366
afterwards you get the photons back.
Now that is change.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.733
Learn your chemistry.
Have a nice weekend.
