00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our last question was about cookies.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This person had an interesting point about whether or not storing the session info

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the database was actually better or not.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the general case, the answer is no.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you're storing sessions in the database, that probably means you're hitting

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the database on every page request.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because sessions kind of by definition only last the session.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If it's not permanent data, if it's just are you logged in,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
obviously you have to store are you logged in in a a cookie,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because that's how you are logged in.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Things like user preferences--my feeling is if the user is anonymous

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and you allow anonymous users to have preferences and a little bit of state,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
trying to store it in the cookie first.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Because you don't want anonymous users to hit your database.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Say your website gets popular and they write about it in the New York times or something,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and you get thousands and thousands of users before you were prepared.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If all of a sudden you've got a thousand people--I shouldn't say a thousand--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
thousands and thousands of people writing temporary stuff into your databast,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that's going to hurt.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, maybe registered users, of course, you store them in the database,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but I still try to store as much temporary stuff in cookies as possible,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
because that's the key to is stateless, getting the database out of the request,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
hiding your database reads behind a cache,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
hiding your database writes behind a queue,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is something we really only talked about in unit 7.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That's the key to scaling, storing temporary data in cookies, which are designed for that purpose,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
is a very important part of that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay, I think that's about it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yes, I know we said good bye a couple of times. Now this one is for real.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
First, Shawn, I'd like to thank you. This course wouldn't have happened without you.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Thank you, and thank you. You did an excellent job.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I know you kept apologizing that this is your first time teaching,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but I think all of our students will agree you did a great job doing it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Thank you. It's been a lot of fun and a really cool experience.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm still hanging out in the IRC. There's still a group of people who do that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Come join us if you want to talk about web apps or whatever.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Shawn I think is TAing a bunch of stuff.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The forums for 253 will still be around for ever, basically.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There are a lot of great students, your co-students, in the forums still helping out.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and a lot of people have posted a lot of great projects that they've done

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in addition or just a completely different projects after what they learned in this course.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So congratulations to you guys.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Good luck out there and drop me a note, drop Shawn a note if you have any trouble

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or want to share what you're working on. That'd be really cool.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Thanks, Shawn. Thank you guys. We'll see you around. &gt;&gt;Yeah. See ya.
