00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me now change the action model into a different model.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have 3 actions. Here is the first. I can go just forward.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The second one is I can turn left and then go forward.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The third one is I can turn right and then go forward.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In all of these actions, I take a step forward.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In the left one, I don't turn at all.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The center one over here I turn left and go forward.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This one over here I turn right and go forward.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's say for the time being the cost of each of those is 1.

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What is now the total cost of the optimal path to the goal?
