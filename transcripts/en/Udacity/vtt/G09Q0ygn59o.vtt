Thanks Greg. Our emotion involves changes in the brain as well as the body.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.432
There are particular brain regions that are involved in the experience and

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:13.284
expression of emotion. More than any other brain structure, the amygdala is

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:19.045
active in controlling emotional experience, especially fear. It's been shown

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:23.115
that people who have damage to the amygdala, don't actually show fear.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.068
Relatedly, psychopaths, people who are cold and remorseless individuals, who

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.549
deceive and lie their way through life, often have an abnormally small

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:36.365
malfunctioning amygdala. In addition, some violent criminals have been show to

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:40.897
have tumors on their amygdala. The Amygdala is also involved in recognizing

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:44.319
fear in other people, based on their facial expressions, but not other

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:49.854
emotions. In addition, it's important to note, the left prefrontal cortex is

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:55.790
most active when experiencing positive emotions, such as joy or happiness.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.758
However on the other hand, the right prefrontal cortex is most active when we

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:05.229
experience negative emotions, such as fear or sadness. And when we experience

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.744
pleasure, the hypothalamus is active.
