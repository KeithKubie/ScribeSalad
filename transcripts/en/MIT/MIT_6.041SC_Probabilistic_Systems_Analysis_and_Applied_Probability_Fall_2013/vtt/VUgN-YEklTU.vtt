00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
 

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.059
In this problem, we're going
to look at random incidence

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.910
under Erlang arrivals.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.230
First, let's parse
what that means.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.500
In a Poisson process, remember,
the time between

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.680
arrivals, or the inter-arrival
time, is distributed as an

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.710
exponential random variable.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.240
And random incidence for a
Poisson process refers to the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.690
somewhat surprising result
that when you consider a

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.700
specific time, say, T-star,
then the length of the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.650
inter-arrival interval that
contains that time T-star is

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.500
not distributed as an
exponential random variable.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.510
It's actually distributed as an
Erlang random variable of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
order 2 or it's distributed as
a sum of two exponential

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.530
random variables.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.670
And the reason for
that is that it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.080
comprises of two parts.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.180
One is the time since the last
arrival until T-star, which is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.590
exponentially distributed, and
the time from T-star until the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.170
next arrival, which is also
exponentially distributed.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.990
So that brings us to a review
of what Erlang random

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.190
variables are.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.550
An Erlang random variable of
order k is just the sum of k

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.170
independent and identically
distributed

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.760
exponential random variables.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.840
So to be more specific, if Ti
is an exponential random

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.630
variable with parameter lambda,
then if you take kiid

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.140
copies of Ti and add them up,
and call that Yk, then Yk is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.330
an Erlang random variable
of order k.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.620
And one other fact is that the
mean of Yk, the mean of an

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.940
Erlang random variable of order
k, is just k, the order,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.880
over lambda, which is the rate
of the underlying exponential

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.960
random variables.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.395
So as a consequence, if you have
an Erlang random variable

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.980
of order two and that random
variable also has a mean of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.530
two over lambda, we can
interpret that random variable

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.620
as just being the sum of two
exponential random variables.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.750
2 iid exponential random
variables, T1 and T2, where

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.300
each one takes exponential
with the rate in lambda.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.920
OK, so in this problem now,
we're dealing with the random

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.170
incidence not under Poisson
processes, but under something

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.570
else, which we call here an
Erlang process with Erlang

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.180
arrival times.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.730
So to be more specific, what
we're saying is that, instead

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.520
of inter-arrival time being
exponentially distributed, in

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.260
this process, and inter-arrival
time is actually

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.880
distributed as an Erlang random
variable of order 2

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.800
with mean 2 over lambda.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.740
So to be explicit, this is no
longer a Poisson process.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.590
It's some other process because
the inter-arrival

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.620
times are not exponential.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.730
So let's make use of this fact
that we talked about earlier

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.770
because now we know that the
inter-arrival times of this

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.220
Erlang process are
Erlang order 2

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.450
with mean 2 over lambda.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.540
But we know that that can just
be re-interpreted as a sum of

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.320
two simple exponentials, each
with parameter lambda.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.860
So let's just draw another
picture and imagine that for

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.470
each of these arrivals, so say
we have three sample arrivals

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.470
in this Erlang process, we can
fill in, kind of, the gaps

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.060
between these with additional
arrivals.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:48.980
And then think of each one of
these times as all being

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.050
exponential with parameter
lambda.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.040
So this is a valid
interpretation because when we

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:08.440
connect these, these
inter-arrival times correspond

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.590
to the combination of two
inter-arrival times, which we

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.490
know we can split that into
just two exponentials.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.060
So each one of these is an
exponential random variable.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.980
And when you combine them, you
get an Erlang order of 2.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.300
But the nice thing about this
is that if we look at this

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.060
diagram, it actually is just
exactly a Poisson process with

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.240
a rate lambda because
now, what we're

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.690
dealing with are exactly--

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.930
the inter-arrival times
are now exactly

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.460
exponential random variables.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.770
And so this is in fact, now,
just a simple Poisson process.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.770
And we can also just think of
it as we take the Poisson

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.400
process, and take every other
arrival, say, all the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.650
even-numbered arrivals, and make
those corresponds to be

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.440
arrivals in the Erlang
process.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.810
OK, so now let's think about
some specific time T-star.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:29.340
We want to know what is the
distribution of the length of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.760
this to be specific
inter-arrival interval that

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.910
T-star is in.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.290
Well, what we can do is take it
down to the level of this

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.500
Poisson process and look
at it from there.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.860
Well, we do that because, for
a Poisson process, we know

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.910
about random incidence for
Poisson processes.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.190
And we know how to deal with
Poisson processes.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.660
So let's think about this now.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.890
Well, T-star is here.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.580
And what we know from random
incidence for a Poisson

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.380
processes is that the length of
this inter-arrival interval

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.160
for the Poisson process,
we know that this is an

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.180
exponential plus
an exponential.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.780
So combined, this is
Erlang order 2.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.100
 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.070
But that only covers
from here to here.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.580
And what we want is actually
from here to there.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.730
Well now, we tack on an extra
exponential because we know

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.930
that the inter-arrival times--

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.580
the time between this arrival
and that arrival in the

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.670
Poisson process is just
another exponential.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.720
And now all of these are in
[INAUDIBLE] time intervals.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.100
And they're all independent.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.010
And so the time of this
inter-arrival interval in the

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.200
Erlang process is just going
to be the sum of three

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.690
independent exponentials
within the

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.670
underlying Poisson process.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.140
And so to answer here is
actually, it's going to be an

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.790
Erlang of order 3.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.960
 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.040
Now this is one possible
scenario for

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.610
how this might occur.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.830
Another scenario is actually
that T-star is somewhere else.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.760
So let's draw this again.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.300
 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:45.880
And suppose now, in this case,
T-star landed between an even

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.160
numbered arrival in the Poisson
process and an odd

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.880
numbered arrival.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.750
Now it could also arrive between
an odd numbered and an

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.560
even numbered arrival.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.170
So it could be that T-star
is actually here.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.690
Well, but in this case, it's
actually more or less the same

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:11.110
thing because now what we want
is the length of this entire

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.100
inter-arrival interval, which,
in the Poisson world, we can

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.490
break it down into random
incidence within this

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.150
interval, this inter-arrival
interval, which is two

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:30.070
exponentials, or an Erlang of
2, plus this interval, which

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.020
is just a standard inter-arrival
time, which is

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.360
another exponential.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.970
So in this case as well, we
have the sum of three

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.900
independent exponential
random variables.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.820
And so, in either case, we have
that the inter-arrival

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.250
time in the Erlang process
is an Erlang of order 3.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.080
And so the final answer is, in
fact, that the inter-arrival

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.600
for random incidence under these
Erlang-type arrivals is

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.030
an Erlang of order 3.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.040
OK, so in this problem we looked
at the random incidence

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.290
under a different type of an
arrival process, not Poisson,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.270
but with Erlang random
variables.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.600
But we used the insight that
Erlang really can be

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.110
re-interpreted as the sum of
independent and identically

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.155
distributed exponential
random variables.

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:25.110
And exponential random variables
can be viewed as one

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.990
way of interpreting and viewing
a Poisson process.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.460
And so by going through those
steps, we were able to use

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.330
what we know about random
incidence under Poisson

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.300
processes to help us solve
this problem of random

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.030
incidence its Erlang arrivals.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.510
So I hope that was helpful.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.760
And I'll see you next time.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.334
