yeah the user is a victim but I think it
works well and it shows how fragile they

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000
works well and it shows how fragile they
 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.760

are and other superheroes but they're

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:33.770
are and other superheroes but they're
 

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.380

don't think there's any badness to it

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960
don't think there's any badness to it
 

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.630
