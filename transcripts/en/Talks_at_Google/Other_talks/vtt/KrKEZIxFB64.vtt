ANGIE PRIMAVERA:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.160
I'm Angie Primavera, and I am a
project manager here at Google.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.950
And I am very happy
today to welcome

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.970
Rob Peladeau from NexGenK9.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.820
For almost 20 years, Rob
has been training dogs

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.550
and specializing in
behaviorist modification

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.610
for aggressive
and/or reactive dogs,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.960
as well as some
unwanted behaviors.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.050
He also works with our
local law enforcement,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.310
training their canine
units, as well as

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.290
some local clients
such as myself.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.509
I met Rob about a year
ago, and he helped me out

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.100
with my dog, Dakota.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.330
And I can attest to his skills,
not only with dogs, but also

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.212
with their sometimes
stubborn human companions.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:44.170
So everybody, I'd like
to welcome Rob Peladeau.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.170
ROB PELADEAU: All right.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.760
Well, let me start
off a little bit more

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.551
about how I got into
the dog training world

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.284
and why there is so much
confusion out there.

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:01.200
I got into it about 20
years ago, as was said.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.700
Started off-- I was an
auto shop repair guy.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.894
Had a shop in Concord.

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:07.310
It had a big yard
that was getting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.670
broken into a lot of
times by the people who

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.560
would hang around the front.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.580
So I thought, oh, I'll get
me some really mean dogs,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.410
and they'll protect this area.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.760
Well, my really mean
dogs, I thought,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.910
get the biggest vicious
dog you could find, right?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.540
At least as far as breed.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.580
Well, people were
stealing my dogs too.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.390
So I quickly learned it's not
just a breed-specific thing.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.420
There are things about dogs
that I didn't understand.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.180
And with my personality
being what it is,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.270
I had to learn everything
and anything that I could.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.760
So I started in learning
about perimeter dog training

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.182
and how to train a
dog to guard an area.

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:46.140
And it went from there.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.230
Went into sport, and then that
sport world kind of overlapped

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.120
with law enforcement.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.161
Got into law enforcement,
became a police officer

00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:53.720
myself few years ago.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.110
And here I am today.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.270
What I want to talk about
today is how dogs learn.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.180
The way dogs learn is
through repetition.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.274
They learn certain
behaviors get them a reward.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:10.690
They want to repeat
that behavior.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.030
Certain behaviors get them
an unpleasant response,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.790
they want to stop that behavior.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.900
They're not, as we would many
times try to make them, well,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.720
in a human term, intelligent.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.540
Their intelligence
comes from the ability

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.200
to pick up patterns,
ability to pick up routines.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.520
They are all about patterns,
are all about routines.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.480
And many times in our
dog-human relationship, dogs

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.310
who aren't picking up certain
behaviors we want them to,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.920
we want to tell each other
that they're stubborn,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.520
they're disobedient,
they're willful, et cetera.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.920
But I can tell you there's
not a dog on Earth that really

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.800
has a rebellious
streak as we think

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.090
of it in like a
teenager's terms.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.835
Dogs either understand what
you're doing or they don't.

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:03.560
Or there's a higher
motivation somewhere else

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.110
than what you're offering.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.070
You might have a piece
of food in your hand,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.880
but it's not near as cool
as chasing that squirrel.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.970
You might have something
exciting in your hand,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.110
but you are the most
boring person on Earth

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.420
to come back to because
you just stand there

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.070
and expect your dog
to do something.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.280
Dogs operate, again,
off of routine.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.680
They operate off of drives.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.080
And if those drives can
be satisfied on their own,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.380
they do not need you
to satisfy that drive.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.335
There's two ways
that we train dogs.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:41.080
And it's through classical
and operant conditioning.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.500
How many of you heard of Pavlov,
the Pavlov's Dogs experiments?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.540
How many of you took
psych in college

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.950
and learned really how
far that experiment went?

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.750
It wasn't just
ringing a dinner bell

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.370
and then watching
the dogs drool.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.200
There was a lot of other
experiments as well.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.930
And it goes into the
realms of antecedents,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.010
that which happens before
their reward comes.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.540
And what he learned was that
if he rang the dinner bell

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
and dropped the food
at the same time,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.430
eventually taking the
food back out of it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.980
and ringing the
dinner bell, there

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.760
was no response to the dog.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
So again, by conditioning--
classical conditioning--

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.570
we have to create a space
in time between the time

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.180
that we use a command-- the time
that we use a marker-- and then

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.700
that time which the
reinforcer comes.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.750
So why I talk about this
is because what we're

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.900
going to move into
is marker training.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.540
So if I'm giving my
dog a treat every time

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.310
I say yes, my verbal command,
my verbal marker, means nothing.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.550
And if you're using a
clicker, it's the same thing.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.870
Clickers are nothing
more than you saying yes

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.790
if you teach them a primary
reinforcer behind the click.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.730
If you say yes,
treat-- yes, treat--

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.100
that's how we build
that conditioning.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.770
That's classical conditioning.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.930
The other thing that we often
fail in in training our dogs

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.780
is that same kind of thing
when teaching behaviors.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.630
We want a dog to sit.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.940
How many of you tell your dog
to sit, and you go sit, sit?

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.500
And you're moving into
it every time, right?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.010
And then when you say sit,
your dog goes, no habla.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.560
Because he really doesn't
understand what you're saying.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.800
Because we haven't done enough
classical conditioning for him

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.890
to understand the
verbal response.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.360
Our antecedent is
always together

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360
with the physical motion.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.890
Dogs are body language masters.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.010
Most of what I do with
aggressive dog behavior

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.240
rehabilitation is
based upon my ability

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.410
to read your dog at
the impure thought.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.440
As soon as they begin to
even think about a behavior

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.370
that they're going to
exhibit, I already know it.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.550
One is because I've
seen it a million times.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.040
The other one is they are
body language creatures.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.920
They don't communicate verbally.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.630
And it's the same thing
when they're watching us.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.030
So if we're going sit, really
all they can hear is this.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.630
There's a famous trainer,
who I learned a lot from,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.580
who was talking about the first
time he was teaching Malinois,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.580
which is what Samson is.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.470
I'll bring him out
in a little bit.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.890
Very high drive,
very trainable dogs,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.740
but oh dear god-- do
not get one as a pet.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.970
He was talking about being able
to do verbal commands to change

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.222
positions from a distance.

00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:39.680
And I forget what
the distance was.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.690
Let's call it 50 feet.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.030
So the dog is 50 feet away.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.200
He's telling him, hey,
buddy, watch this.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.866
I can change my dog's
position verbally.

00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:50.944
And he goes watch--
sit, down, stand.

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:52.360
And his buddy says,
no, your dog's

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.951
not changing positions verbally.

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:55.200
He says, yeah, he just did it.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.500
He goes, no.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.510
This time when you
tell your dog to sit,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.330
I want you to hold your
head perfectly still.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.740
50 feet away, guy says sit.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.912
Dog changes no behavior.

00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:10.140
He goes.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.660
Dog sits.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.110
Therein lies a lot
of the problems

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.910
that we find when
we're trying to get

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.720
our dog to that 100% level.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.730
As I heard somebody
in here talking about,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.410
their dog is at X%, and they
want to get them to that 100%.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.720
A lot of it is based upon our
timing and understanding of how

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.060
dogs verbally learn
and physically learn.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.850
So if we want our dogs to learn
a verbal command-- and let's

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.080
put this all together, our
classical conditioning-- we

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.680
teach them, sit.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.000
We use a verbal
marker, then we teach

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.630
them physically--
then the reward.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.730
So here, sit.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.470
Yes.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.044
And again, that
one second-- kind

00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:57.960
of half a second to
one-second window that you

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.840
can use to respond.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.120
If you do this every
time you say yes, this

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.580
becomes the marker, and
they don't hear a word out

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.980
of your mouth.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.530
Make sense so far?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.970
So through classical
conditioning,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.100
we create our markers.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.367
Then what we do is we move
into operant conditioning.

00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:16.450
If you've taken those same
classes that taught you

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.140
about Pavlov's dog and
classical conditioning,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.654
then you moved into
operant conditioning.

00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:23.320
The difference from
operant conditioning

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.360
is the mouse finding his way
through a maze to get to food.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.240
Right?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.450
It's the dog where you
hold a piece of food out,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.340
and you say nothing.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.150
And the dog starts
looking and going,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.679
how do I get that piece
of food out of your hand?

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.990
And they wiggle, and they
put their butt on the ground.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.810
You go, yes-- bang--
and you pay them.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.570
That's operant.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.070
That's them offering a
behavior to get that reward out

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.770
of your hand.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.130
Two kind of dogs.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.880
Those that are
non-operant-- those dogs

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.259
have to be taught everything
through rote by giving them

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.050
some kind of physical
movement or something

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.175
to help them to understand.

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:08.120
And those dogs that are operant,
that offer behaviors to get

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.815
the reward out of your hand.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.690
You take your hand, you
put it on the ground.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.310
The dog goes, hmm, how
do I get down there?

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.435
How do I get that food out?

00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:16.050
And they paw at your hand.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.760
They lay down, as soon as
their elbows touch the ground--

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.710
payday.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.650
Dog goes, oh, when you
do this, I go down.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.640
Then we add.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.760
Now we back up our
classical conditioning

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.310
to our operant conditioning.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.620
So food comes out, his
butt hits the ground.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.320
Yes, treat.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.770
Now we go, sit.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.470
We use our operant
conditioning, and we

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.240
wait for the
behavior-- associate,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.110
name it, and reward it.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.950
So he'll offer you a behavior.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.760
You will then name it.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.260
You want your dog to do
something over and over,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.730
you have to name it.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.640
So let's get into one
of the biggest things

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.820
that people run
into with recall.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.340
And I know that's
probably a huge percentage

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.180
of what I get calls for.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.320
My dog just won't
come back to me.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.720
Why won't my dog
come back to me?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.490
How do I teach my dog a recall?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.130
And I've seen a
million different ways,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.772
and there is no one way.

00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:19.230
I don't know if you've dealt
with many dog trainers before,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.210
but the only thing that two
dog trainers can agree on

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.130
is that the third one doesn't
know what they're doing.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.430
They're all very
valid, different ways.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.870
And just like raising
children, no two are alike.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.880
If you've had
multiple children, you

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.100
will know that what works
for one child doesn't

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.900
work for the other.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.140
What works for one dog
doesn't work for the other.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.410
And it's up to you
or your trainer

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.069
to figure out which method
works best for your dog.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:48.360
But I can tell you this, right?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.776
From the time your
dog is a puppy,

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:52.920
you can teach a
puppy how to recall

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.960
and be very consistent in it.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.930
Just by having--
every time the dog

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.650
comes to you, as soon as
he starts to turn to you,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.250
name it, here.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.140
He's coming, yes.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.286
Good boy, good girl, good dog.

00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:08.410
You start building that up.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.900
And one of the things for our
dogs that are very drivey--

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.380
the dogs that will go chase
a toy, and puppies all

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.197
will chase a toy--
you start with a place

00:11:17.197 --> 00:11:18.780
that you know he
goes to all the time.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.613
Everybody's dog has a
little favorite place.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.530
Don't they?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.310
Your dog just runs and goes, OK,
I'm going to go rest over here.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.480
Whether it's under a
table or on his pillow,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.160
he's got this favorite place.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.010
So we teach our dog
to retrieve and let

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.510
him carry that toy to
his favorite place.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.220
Retrieve.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.080
Throw something, he takes his
toy to his favorite place.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.350
Then I go sit in
his favorite place.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.200
Throw the toy out.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.890
Where is he going to go?

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.210
Back to his favorite place.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.840
Name it, then reward it.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.940
He comes back.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.090
So throw it out.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.759
He goes out and grabs it-- here.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:56.300
And he has no idea
what "here" means,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.680
but he's coming back to
you, and you're rewarded it.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.900
Now he associates--
"here" is come back to me.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.340
You do that for just a
few days and then start

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.330
moving it into different
places, and you've

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.960
got a dog that will
have a solid recall.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.460
You do it in a low
distraction area,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.060
you do it with great reward,
and you will find them.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.970
So let me give you a few of
the ideas about marker training

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.780
and why there's so
much controversy

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.050
around positive reinforcement
versus aversive method,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.120
et cetera.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.950
Everybody's heard reward-based
or positive reinforcement

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.880
training.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.570
Positive reinforcement
training is

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.320
what every dog trainer is doing.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:42.000
Positive reinforcement only is--
I'm going to put it out there.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.460
I think it's causing
a lot of problems.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.630
It's causing a lot
of failures in dogs.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.910
It's like the child who never
learns limits, the child who

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.880
never is told no-- the child who
never learns through experience

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.295
that there is a
consequence to behavior.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.980
So the dog who has a problem
with chasing another dog, who

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.815
you can't give enough food to.

00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:11.990
Go, my dog would-- just
keeps chasing other dogs.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.360
Well, yeah, because every time
you're feeding your dog-- you

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360
walk down the street, and
your trainer told you,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.530
just go behind this car and
then shove food in his face.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.490
There's no behavior change.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.570
And for a person who isn't
a professional dog trainer,

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.090
it's hard to know where
that dog's head is

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.300
at at that moment.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.860
Are we rewarding a
heightened state of mind

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.160
when another dog comes around?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.310
So another dog comes around,
or a dog gets excited,

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.920
we pull him behind a
car and go, good boy.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.190
So the dog kept going,
I'm being rewarded

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.530
for this behavior-- I
must be doing it right.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.040
And I've seen some dogs spiral
seriously out of control

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.010
based upon that method alone.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.410
For some dogs it works.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.130
Like I said, there's
no one right method

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.880
for every single dog.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.510
The reason why
aversive methods have

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.730
come under so much scrutiny
is because, yeah, it's

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.832
uncomfortable.

00:14:02.832 --> 00:14:04.790
And these are our little
four-legged creatures.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.470
But none of us would
raise our child

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.712
without some form of
adversity-- would we--

00:14:11.712 --> 00:14:13.420
to let them learn on
their own that there

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.457
is a consequence to behavior.

00:14:15.457 --> 00:14:17.290
And believe it or not,
anybody who tells you

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.450
they are reward-based only, or
positive reinforcement only,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:26.050
lies because a punisher is
as simple as removing food.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.690
That's punishment.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.900
It's called negative punishment.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.260
If we give a correction
with a collar

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.330
or some other kind of
physical correction,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.620
that's called a
positive punisher.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.510
We're adding something
to the environment,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.230
whether it's-- again, most
of the time it's something

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.730
physical.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.750
A little pop, a little
flick, little aat-- something

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.980
that adds to the environment.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.374
When we take away-- we go
"sit," and he goes, ah,

00:14:48.374 --> 00:14:50.040
I think I'd rather
go look at squirrels.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.400
We remove the food, and
he goes, wait a minute.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.590
That's a negative punisher.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.090
So anybody who tells you they're
positive reinforcement only

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.610
has lied in their
own little right.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.685
Now that I've put that
out there, we'll move on.

00:15:01.685 --> 00:15:03.110
All right.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.680
So how does marker trainer work?

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.350
We just talked about
clicker training.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.770
A lot of the clicker
training came

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.690
from a Dr. Skinner who found
with training marine mammals

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.972
when that animal
is away from them,

00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:20.180
they could not get through
water and everything else.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.395
They learned clickers
travel through water.

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:25.900
Now you know why clicker
training is so popular.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.944
Again, a lot of people
took it the wrong way.

00:15:28.944 --> 00:15:30.610
A lot of trainers
took it the wrong way.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.510
Because he says, look, we don't
have to correct an animal--

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.110
a 3,000-pound animal or bigger.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.400
Why do we have to correct a dog?

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.520
Well, if I put my dog in a tank
with no other dogs around him,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.410
with no other squirrels
to run by him,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.690
and the only source of food he
ever got came out of my hand,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.820
I could use positive
reinforcement only.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.540
Because the negative consequence
is he doesn't get fed.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.230
So is that positive
reinforcement only?

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.480
So again, that's where the
clicker training came from.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.060
And that's where a lot of
the positive reinforcement

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:02.770
came from.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.810
But it cannot be the only way
we work when we live in a very

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.220
rich environment for
distractions for dogs and other

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.150
animals.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.027
And then we put all our
anthropomorphisms on there.

00:16:14.027 --> 00:16:15.610
Oh, well, they're
just being stubborn,

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.570
they're just being willful,
without understanding,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:24.190
no, there is a disconnect
in our thinking process.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.570
So the type of
reinforcement that we use,

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:34.020
we want our dogs to understand
the behavior changes

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.770
based upon them.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.290
They get to decide
how that behavior gets

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.560
them their reward.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.965
And again, we mark
it with the yes.

00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:47.460
And that yes becomes
the same as the food.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.250
The same thing happens
on the other end.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.880
I want you to walk with me.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.580
The dog says, hmm, squirrel, let
me go to the end of the leash.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.430
We can give a little,
leave it, a verbal command,

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.800
and then a correction--
pop the collar.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.290
They go, what?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.579
We can praise.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.430
Where we get in
trouble is when we

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.589
allow emotions to get
into our dog training.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.510
Dogs don't understand
anger the same way we do.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.496
Dogs understand markers.

00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:19.869
When we create a marker,
we want it to be steady.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.319
Yes, treat.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.500
Good, sit.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.430
Everything's the
same all the time.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.460
We use our volume not to
indicate our displeasure,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.650
but to break
through distraction.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.990
So what I mean by that is
the guy who's got his dog

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.940
and he says, sit.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.560
And the dog says, squirrel.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.121
And he says, no-- sit.

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:48.830
Hmm. [SNIFFING] Sit!

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.205
And now he's yelled it, and
the dog goes, oh bloody hell.

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:53.860
And he sits down.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.370
Which noise does
the owner now have

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.370
to make the next time
to get his dog to sit?

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.640
The third one.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.440
Exactly.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.540
Because that's the one
where the dog goes OK,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.600
pressure comes off, and OK, good
boy-- if he gets a "good boy."

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.800
You let anger get in there.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.660
We use volume to
break distraction.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.790
My dog goes into
full squirrel mode,

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:23.860
then it's a much louder command
to break through his fixation.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.550
Make sense so far?

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.000
Raise your hand if you
want me to stop at any time

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.624
because I'm not making
sense, because I

00:18:29.624 --> 00:18:31.980
will talk on and on and on.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.880
So when we give a
command, even if we

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.550
are ignored the first time, we
make the same command again.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.770
Sit.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.090
Squirrel?

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.380
Sit.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.000
Pop the leash.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.210
Sit.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.117
Bigger pull, or luring,
or whatever this dog

00:18:51.117 --> 00:18:53.280
is going to operate best off of.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.470
But the command
always comes the same.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.840
What usually happens
when we end up

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.900
destroying our
relationships with our dogs

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.120
or making training
not fun for them

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.030
is when we do allow those
emotions to get in there.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.120
Because a dog doesn't
understand why you're mad.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.392
He doesn't know anger.

00:19:11.392 --> 00:19:12.600
He doesn't know those things.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.090
He doesn't know right and wrong.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.070
He knows that
there was something

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.600
that made him do what
he should or should not

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:27.560
know based upon that antecedent,
that loud correcting.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.415
Same thing happens with recall.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.290
I had a client not
too long ago-- got

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.990
a dog who had a
human bite issue.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.060
He had actually bitten
a person in their house.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.129
So a couple of things
we teach to start

00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:44.170
changing their behaviors.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.590
The first one is we
teach him to leave it.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.465
And the second one is
we got to teach recall.

00:19:47.465 --> 00:19:49.235
If you've got a solid
recall on your dog,

00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:50.610
he's not going to bite.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.160
If I can call my dog at any
time, from any situation,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.580
am I going to have a
dog who's going to bite?

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.335
No.

00:19:57.335 --> 00:19:59.460
So I tell the guy, we got
to teach your dog recall.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.690
He says, my dog knows recall.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.190
I say, your dog
doesn't know recall.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.430
He says, my dog knows recall.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.720
No, your dog
doesn't know recall.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.761
We go back and forth for
this for a little while.

00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:07.422
All right.

00:20:07.422 --> 00:20:09.630
I'm going to sit here, and
I'm going to pet your dog.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.330
You go into another room
in the house, use his name

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.700
and his recall word.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.691
And we'll see if your dog
knows his recall command.

00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:22.377
He goes, yes, I'm
going to show you.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:22.960
I'll show you.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.640
He knows it.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.860
I don't know why he
wants to argue, but OK.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:31.110
Goes to the room, calls his
dog's name-- Fido, here.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:36.620
And Fido just looks at me
going, keep petting me, please.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.930
Fido.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.680
Here.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.500
Come on boy, let's go.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.900
Come on.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.182
And the dog is going, oh,
my master is somewhere else.

00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:46.140
And he goes off to him.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.400
Does he know recall?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.787
No.

00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.370
So you got this whole
string of words.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.570
How many of you go to dog parks?

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.260
Yeah.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.150
How many of you are either
that person, or you've

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.010
seen that person, when
your dog is out there

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.830
and you're giving this
47-word-long command

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.540
to come back?

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.949
Promising them the world,
promising to end their world.

00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:12.990
Come on buddy, I've got
a nice big treat for you.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.960
Or, come on, buddy, I'm
leaving without you.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.780
All these things, and we
think they understand us.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.970
How many of you
know Charlie Brown?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.500
You know his teacher?

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.770
You ever heard her talk?

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.470
That's all we sound like to our
dog, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.342
They don't understand a
word coming out of our face.

00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:33.510
So we've got these
47-word commands,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.220
and finally the dog turns and
goes, are you talking to me?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.890
And then he sees our physical.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.620
Come on.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.836
And we go, see our
dog knows recall.

00:21:42.836 --> 00:21:46.070
The dog doesn't know
recall, because you've never

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.780
made it consistent.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.640
You've never done that
thing over and over again.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.830
But yet we expect
our dog to know.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.880
So when we recall, then when
they finally come back to us,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.600
some people, not all, are
a little bit hot-headed.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.570
And they get angry.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.340
They say, I told you not to!

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.200
Oh my god, if I
have to call you!

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.260
And they get angry
with their dog.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.790
So let me back that
up for a minute.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.260
Dogs live in a one-
to three-second world.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.290
And that's the golden
rule of dog training.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.570
It may or may not be true,
but that's what we go by.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.940
One- to three-second world.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.990
My dog goes out, and then
he finally comes back.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:34.400
And on his way back, I'm chewing
his butt-- that was a bad dog.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.478
So my dog's coming to me, and
I'm telling him he's a bad dog.

00:22:39.478 --> 00:22:41.907
He goes, why do I want
to come back to you?

00:22:41.907 --> 00:22:44.490
Or you see the dog who does come
back, but watch what he does.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.970
Maybe your dog's this dog.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.886
You call your dog, and
you're, come on, buddy.

00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:48.440
Come on.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.920
And he goes, all
right, I'm coming,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.350
but I'm going to sit
over here because you're

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.080
going to yell at me.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.420
Because there's something wrong.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.260
You're not happy about
me coming to you.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.670
My own dogs have once in a
while gotten away from me.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.790
And I go out, and
I go to get them.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.670
And when I get to them, I have
to cover up all my displeasure

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.210
and all my, oh my god,
I'd like to throttle you.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.970
And if they come back to me--
they can run for two hours.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.360
They come back, that last
minute, that last second-- they

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.400
turn around and they go, Dad?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.760
Good boy.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.900
I'd like to kill you.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.430
Good boy.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.060
Right?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.610
So every time he comes to me,
it's a positive experience

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.330
because he cannot understand
that for two hours you just

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.660
chased him.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.210
All he's going to
remember is what

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.580
happened just before
he came to you.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.512
That's it.

00:23:46.512 --> 00:23:48.075
That's your dog's world.

00:23:48.075 --> 00:23:50.450
So when you wonder why your
dog doesn't want to come back

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:57.180
to you, ask yourself, did
I reprimand his return?

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.350
Did I do something
that caused him

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.790
to think that there is going to
be an issue when he got to me?

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.317
Again, go back to your
basic recall stuff.

00:24:09.317 --> 00:24:10.900
If you're having
problems with recall,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.770
you build it to where
the dog is always

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:18.360
excited about coming to you
and that the reward matches

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.510
the behavior so that that dog
can understand that coming back

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.150
to you is the best
place on Earth.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.682
When I bring out my dog
here in a little bit,

00:24:26.682 --> 00:24:28.640
even though there's other
dogs here-- of course

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.473
he'll probably make me
a liar because that's

00:24:30.473 --> 00:24:33.360
what dogs do-- they cheat
and they make you liars.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.840
He'll pay no attention
to people or dogs,

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.950
because the best place on
Earth, the best things that ever

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.680
happened have been right
here at this position.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.266
And you'll watch how fast
he wants to get there,

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:46.640
because that's
where happinesss--

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.970
that's where the magic happens.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.470
That's where
everything great that's

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.580
ever happened to him in
his life has been right

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.310
in this position.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.420
And he can't wait to get there.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.320
That's how you build that.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.302
You never come down on him
for wanting to be with you.

00:25:00.302 --> 00:25:02.260
Even if he comes to me
and I don't want him to,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.390
and he knocks me halfway
across the Earth,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.084
because he bounces into me.

00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:09.586
[SIGH] Good boy.

00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:12.650
I hope that came
through convincing.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.710
Right?

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.677
Happy, happy.

00:25:14.677 --> 00:25:16.010
This is the best place on Earth.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.265
This is good.

00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:19.640
So when other dogs
are out there,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.250
and I go, here, and he goes,
oh, it's better next to Dad

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.450
than it is out there.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.455
Because this is where
the best stuff happens.

00:25:27.455 --> 00:25:31.530
But that relies upon us
being active participants

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.260
in their play.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.370
All right, any questions so far?

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.800
Yeah, the question is when
I have food in my hand

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.850
or in my pouch, when I have
food on me, my dog is golden.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.272
I'll just paraphrase it.

00:25:44.272 --> 00:25:45.980
He'll listen, he'll
do everything I want.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.890
But as soon as the food's gone,
then the higher distraction

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.680
wins.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.210
That's where we back
up our training.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.470
And we go, where
did I fail in this?

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.240
Did I only do this training
with the food in my hand?

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.950
Did I have my food-- and
one of the ways of training

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.170
is luring, right?

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.110
We always bring the
dog in with food.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.270
So yes, that becomes a command.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:13.420
Did we ever break that training
down to where we incrementally

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.070
removed the food?

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.925
The same way with incrementally
removing the physical command

00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:20.100
out of a sit.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.940
So if I say "sit" and I
show him-- sit, sit, sit--

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.180
and he doesn't, I give
him a little help,

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.080
then eventually just sit.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.580
Right?

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.180
Incrementally.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.864
We want our dogs to
learn just based off

00:26:33.864 --> 00:26:36.280
of what we're telling them,
but that's not how dogs learn.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.430
They learn incrementally.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.970
So the dog who comes back only
for food, we're bribing them.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.960
We're saying, get on over here,
and I got this nice juicy steak

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.460
for you.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.310
Come on over.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.380
I might even have some
bacon, food of the gods.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.250
So the dog comes back, says, OK.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.910
Now, when we haven't
conditioned the dog

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.700
to understand that our verbal
marker is the same as that food

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.910
training, yes, they're only
going to work for that food.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.790
So you back up,
and when your dog

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.950
is undistracted in
your living room,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.830
someplace else-- you're
doing your training

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.690
in an undistracted environment.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.254
He's nice and rested,
everything is good.

00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:17.670
And you do everything with a
leash or something like that,

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.970
for recall especially, so
you can never have failure

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.230
to where you go here,
and he goes upstairs.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.900
And you're like, OK, whatever.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.710
And the dog then
goes, oh, "here"

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.810
means go upstairs
and lay on your bed.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.680
We have to teach
them what we want.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.140
So back up your training,
have your food reward

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.500
after your marker.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.450
You go, here.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.740
And he goes, no habla.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.950
A little tug on the leash,
pull him in, he goes, oh.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.760
And then, we back up.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.390
Yes, then the treat
comes out-- bingo.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.600
So he can always have that.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.210
Then we variable that.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.350
After we do a few, every
time he comes back,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.650
he gets in that position.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.444
Yes, treat.

00:27:56.444 --> 00:27:58.110
He comes back, he
gets in that position.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.000
Good boy.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.690
No treat.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.630
Next time, treat.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.470
Then three times the
recall, then a treat.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.970
Four times the
recall, then a treat.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.150
Then recall, recall--
treat, treat, treat, treat.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.890
Break it out to where the
dog goes, in his mind,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.060
there's always a possibility
of there's something

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.870
great coming from you.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.580
So that can help.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.280
Let me back it way
up here, on creating

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.909
that marker in the first place.

00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:28.200
When you want to create a
marker, you pick your marker.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.130
I don't care what it is--
good boy, yes, whatever.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.750
You have that marker, that yes.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.330
You need to teach
him what it means.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.580
And if you're going to use
food as your reinforcer--

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.610
your primary
reinforcer-- then you

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.580
want to just sit on
the couch sometime

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.450
with him sitting in front
of you and go, yes, treat.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.740
Yes, treat.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.020
Yes, treat.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.920
Yes, treat.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.310
You are now the dinner bell
in Pavlov's experiment.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.020
Right?

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.353
So every time you say, yes,
he goes, [HAPPY DOG SOUNDS].

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.110
That's what you want to create.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.250
That's how you create
that positive reinforcer

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.990
so you don't have to have
that food every single time.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.020
Yes.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.607
He goes, oh my gosh.

00:29:10.607 --> 00:29:13.190
And all the endorphin release,
all the same chemical response,

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.920
all that that comes from
classical conditioning

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.700
is present.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.150
So make sure your
dog understands

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.675
his positive marker.

00:29:22.675 --> 00:29:24.050
And like I said,
backing this up.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.440
So along with our
positive marker

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.760
that says yes, you've
finished your job,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.204
you also want to have
a marker that says,

00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:33.620
yes, that's what
I want you to do,

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.860
and I want you to
keep on doing it.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.760
A continuation marker, right?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.950
Because otherwise, your
dog comes in, and he sits.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.825
And you go, yes, and
then as soon as you say,

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:44.510
yes, he jumps up and
goes, OK, I'm done.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.332
Right?

00:29:46.332 --> 00:29:47.540
Now I want my dog to come in.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.745
I want him to sit, and I
want him to stay sitting.

00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:52.190
He comes up, yes.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.750
My intonation drops
off, I drop energy.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.700
I don't get all crazy
and goofy to cause

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.045
him to get all excited.

00:29:58.045 --> 00:29:59.430
So he comes in, he sits.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.500
Yes.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.510
Treat.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.600
And we're going to
sustain the behavior.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.920
Walk away.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.450
Good.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.300
Treat.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.730
You see how we stay in there?

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.590
He's still going,
now I'm sitting here,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.010
and I'm getting my treat.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.680
And then when I'm all done, yes.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.490
And he goes, OK.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.531
That's your release word.

00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.730
Some people use "OK"
as a release word.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.710
Whatever you want
to use, they're

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.659
just noises for the dog.

00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:25.200
Every one of my dogs
has been trained

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.421
in a different language.

00:30:26.421 --> 00:30:28.170
Eventually, some of
them become bilingual,

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.890
but that's not my
fault, my problem.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.962
And people go, wow, you speak
that language to your dog.

00:30:35.962 --> 00:30:36.670
It's just noises.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.628
I don't even know if I'm
making the word right.

00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:41.510
I'm sure somebody, if my dog
is trained in Czech-- somebody

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.030
comes from the Czech
Republic, and they go, no,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.490
that's not how we
pronounce that word.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.670
You think my dog cares?

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.370
I could make noise like
brrr and have the dog sit.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.850
It really doesn't matter.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.410
It's the noise, the antecedent,
that comes before the behavior.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.950
Right?

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.490
So your commands,
your thing, you

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.210
could train them in
anything you want.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.110
It doesn't matter.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.798
There's no proper
word for anything.

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:07.670
Got it?

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.550
So make sure you have
your positive marker--

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.780
yes, treat, yes, treat.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.220
And he doesn't have to
do anything for that.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.428
He just understands that
whenever that word comes out

00:31:14.428 --> 00:31:17.410
of your face, you
become a Pez dispenser.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.490
Here comes the food.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.210
So eventually when you're
walking down the street,

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.970
and he's seeing that other
dog, and he looks up at you.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.636
And you go, yes.

00:31:22.636 --> 00:31:26.550
And he goes, oh, I did something
good that's worthy of a reward.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.190
So break down your training.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:32.300
Whenever you see that kind of
a failure where the dog is only

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.690
responding to a
reward, make sure

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.560
that you just back up,
remove the reward from it.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.990
Work in a undistracted
area, and rebuild.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:51.440
The beauty of dogs is that they
can be retrained at any time,

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.460
because they are very
much creatures of habit.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.590
I have rehabilitated dogs
that are 11 and 12 years old,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.920
some dogs that were very
aggressive, et cetera.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.350
Dogs who have done things in
their world all their lives,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.830
but they can change.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:10.020
It's just a matter of recreating
a new set of guidelines.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.150
That's not to talk
about-- in case

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.220
some of my professional peers
are out there watching this--

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.450
that's not to say that
imprinting is the same thing.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.575
There are some things that
get imprinted that, yes,

00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:21.690
we cannot get around.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.580
And we build different
kind of parameters

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.697
to help the dog live
within that imprinting.

00:32:26.697 --> 00:32:28.780
If you want to know more
about that, ask me later.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.530
We can go way deep
into what imprinting is

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.720
and what it does to dogs and
how we use it positively,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.450
like we do for searching
for [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.510
or how sometimes it's
inadvertently done, even

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.820
at the breeder level.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.320
Does that answer
your question, sir?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.195
ROB PELADEAU: All right.

00:32:46.195 --> 00:32:50.370
A couple of dog training myths
I wanted to cover real quick.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.090
I've heard people tell me that
you can't start training a dog

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.560
until they're six months old.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.040
Well, that is false.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.130
Dog's brains are the same from
the beginning to the end--

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.110
not much different than ours.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.935
And most of you, I hope, still
have a good enough memory

00:33:06.935 --> 00:33:09.120
to remember when you
were 13 years old.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.060
Everybody here
remember that far back?

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.809
I know I do, and it's
a lot farther for me

00:33:12.809 --> 00:33:14.500
than most of you.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.150
And do you feel like you are
any different of a person?

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.320
I mean, do you feel like
you're X number age?

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.010
Does something
change in your mind?

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.582
Or do you still feel
like that same person?

00:33:26.582 --> 00:33:28.040
You still have your
basic thoughts.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.750
You still have all
these basic premises

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.820
that make you who you
are, your personality.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.630
And they stay with you
throughout your life.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.780
Right?

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.200
It's the same thing for dogs.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.510
They might be young and
might be very distractable.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.500
They might be trying to figure
out the world and everything.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.760
But they still
learn the same way.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:53.360
It's still by process
of conditioning.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.590
The difference between
training a six-week-old puppy

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.490
and a six-year-old adult dog
is the same as it is for kids.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.900
That attention span
is very, very short.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.775
So you do it in short bursts.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.112
I've got one out with me
now, he's 16 weeks old.

00:34:12.112 --> 00:34:13.820
And he's already got
recall, he's already

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.679
got sit, he's got how to
drop his toy, et cetera,

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.100
just because that's
what we do every day.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.340
Whatever you do daily is
what they're going to do.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.380
Whatever you do by rote is
what they are going to do.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:31.670
And if you change anything,
they'll let you know.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.034
How many of your dogs pull
you as you get to your house?

00:34:34.034 --> 00:34:35.825
You went for a walk,
came around the block,

00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:38.283
and all of a sudden they're
like, hey, there's our doorway.

00:34:38.283 --> 00:34:41.889
Try walking by your
doorway tonight

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.880
when you take your dog
for his evening walk.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.338
I know all of you are taking
your dogs for walks every day,

00:34:46.338 --> 00:34:46.920
right?

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.679
So try it.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.310
Just walk by.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.170
Don't go towards your house,
and watch your dog go, foop,

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.027
towards the house.

00:34:53.027 --> 00:34:55.360
And the first thing that's
going to come out of our mind

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.044
or through our thought
process is, oh, my dog really

00:35:00.044 --> 00:35:00.960
just wants to go home.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.420
He wants to lay down.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.750
Well, no.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.920
He's done this for whatever his
age is, for X number of days

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.527
based on those years.

00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:12.110
Therefore, when you
walk by the house,

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.940
the dog goes,
that's where we go.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.930
That's the pattern.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.620
That's the habit.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.046
Has nothing to do
with him wanting

00:35:19.046 --> 00:35:21.170
to go in and lay down and
stretch, hey, we're done,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.137
Mom, Dad-- whatever.

00:35:22.137 --> 00:35:23.720
Because I guarantee
you, if you walked

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.250
by your house for six days
without going into your house--

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.084
just do it six days.

00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:29.041
Just do it a few times.

00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:30.970
Walk up and down the
street without going back

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:31.540
into your house.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.789
Within six days, your dog,
when you get to your house,

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:36.730
he will not pull to
go into your house.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.270
Because it's a new pattern.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.760
We don't just walk in here.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.110
We don't just do that.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.491
Dogs are all about patterns.

00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:44.990
All right.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.450
So yes, you can.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.230
And matter of fact for
puppies imprinting,

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.010
the best time starts
in that 6-week age--

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.290
starting to show him what
behaviors you want and what

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:57.900
behaviors you don't.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.730
And again, we'll take
that to the human world.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.520
The best time to learn languages
is at your youngest age, right?

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.522
All the pathways for all the
neurological things that go on

00:36:07.522 --> 00:36:09.230
in your brain-- I'm
not a neuroscientist,

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.760
so please don't quote me--
but those pathways stay

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.700
open as a child.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.754
And you can learn language and
things that later on in life

00:36:15.754 --> 00:36:17.170
are either difficult
or impossible

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.080
because those paths
are no longer open.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.660
So taking that younger puppy
at his most eager to learn

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.130
and eager to please time is
the primary and the best way

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.960
to insure that your dog's going
to understand what you want

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.380
and create a better
relationship with them.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.780
The old, old dogs can't learn
new tricks-- definitely false.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.892
Like I said a minute ago, we can
take a dog, as long as it's not

00:36:42.892 --> 00:36:45.100
something that's been an
imprinted problem, something

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.880
that came from
their early years,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.560
or there's a neurological
or psychological issue

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.300
with the dog.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.360
But basic behaviors we can
change because they still

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.420
learn the same way.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.990
The question already
came out I was

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.656
going to touch-- if
you train with food,

00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:03.620
you could never
wean away from it.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.750
Once your dog has
learned an exercise,

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.570
you wean them off of the food.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.360
So training with food is
an absolutely valid way

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.440
to train a dog to
learn a behavior.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.900
It's our failure to break it
up and become a variable reward

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.080
that causes them not
to get away from it.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.840
We haven't made them
go to the next step.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.120
One of my favorite things that
I love to beat people up on

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.900
is when they tell me, my dog
knows when they've done wrong.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.507
How many of you guys say that?

00:37:35.507 --> 00:37:36.590
Go ahead, raise your hand.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.490
Otherwise, you're lying.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.760
You walk into the house,
and the place is destroyed.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.794
And your dog goes--
I guarantee you,

00:37:45.794 --> 00:37:47.710
the first time that you
walked into your house

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.791
and your house was
destroyed, he didn't do that.

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:56.110
About the third or fourth
time, yeah, he does that.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:00.480
Where does our feeling of
guilt come from as humans?

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.430
Morality, right?

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.440
We've got this thing in our
human psyche called morality.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.930
We know right and wrong.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.190
Does a dog have morality?

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.640
Because if he does, somebody
needs to talk to my dog.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.605
Because man, that guy--
it's like a prison yard

00:38:14.605 --> 00:38:15.646
in my backyard sometimes.

00:38:15.646 --> 00:38:18.330
It's terrible.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.240
So if the dog
doesn't have morals,

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.520
if he doesn't know right
and wrong, if it wasn't beat

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.990
into his head like we
humans do to imprint

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.380
a moral code into our
being as children--

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.630
if he doesn't have a moral
code, how can he be guilty?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.700
He can't.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.840
But what he learns
is appeasement,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.950
how to turn pressure off.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.350
Escape avoidance is
the process of training

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.760
that takes pressure and
turns it off by a behavior.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.025
So you walk in, he's torn
up your favorite shoes,

00:38:54.025 --> 00:38:56.400
and they're laying there in
the middle of the floor where

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.233
he was sitting there
chewing them for hours.

00:38:58.233 --> 00:38:59.970
And you walk in, Fido!

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.512
And he goes, what?

00:39:02.512 --> 00:39:03.400
Bad dog!

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.460
And he goes, ugh, OK, I'm sorry.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.252
Right?

00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:09.210
That's not really what
they think, but they go,

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.700
OK, make the pressure stop.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.490
Oh my god, there's a
lot of stress here.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:17.310
And they turn off, and then you
go, all right, buddy, it's OK.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.785
The next time we
come home, Fido!

00:39:18.785 --> 00:39:20.830
They go, oh yeah,
this turns it off.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.580
You stop yelling as
soon as I do that.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.830
Pretty soon, I walk in and
there's a shoe that's torn up

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.222
and them, and they go-- I know
something's going to happen.

00:39:33.222 --> 00:39:34.180
Classical conditioning.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.970
We are training our dogs
without even knowing it.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.960
Right?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.265
It's like why
potty training goes

00:39:42.265 --> 00:39:44.430
so wrong for so many people.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:49.670
Your dog does not know it's
wrong to soil in the house.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.170
Period.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.253
He doesn't know it's wrong
because it's not wrong.

00:39:52.253 --> 00:39:54.030
There's no moral
code that says, don't

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.377
potty on the hardwood floor.

00:39:56.377 --> 00:39:58.460
So you walk in, and your
dog's potty on the floor.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.152
Ah!

00:39:59.152 --> 00:40:00.051
And you freak out.

00:40:00.051 --> 00:40:00.800
You grab your dog.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.750
You throw him outside.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.680
What does your dog
do the next time

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.559
he needs to pee in the house?

00:40:07.559 --> 00:40:09.600
Well, they don't want me
peeing in front of them.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.880
Let me find this corner.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.480
And so they find a
corner to go pee in.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.120
Because you go, hey, I peed.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.180
I didn't get yelled at.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.830
Pee in the corner.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.770
So just throw this
out there real quick,

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.720
cause we're running
out of time quickly.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.120
Throw this out there real
quick, you got to-- see,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.590
if the dog is doing it
in the house, that's

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.850
where that whole discipline
comes from where you've

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.660
got to override your
emotions and go,

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.300
OK, all right, buddy, let's go.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.340
You pick him up, you take him
outside, you put him outside.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.540
And if you're having problems
with the house breaking issue,

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.010
you need to turn the finger
around and point it at yourself

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.460
and go, what am I doing wrong?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.480
How do I change this?

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.840
What kind of pattern
do I need to create

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.400
so my dog knows that
he goes outside?

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.390
Either you're not breaking
them often enough,

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.250
you're not letting them
take a long enough time

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.820
to break outside.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.920
Because we go outside,
and we go, OK, buddy.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.940
And he goes, oh jump
around, jump around.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.100
And we go, OK, he
doesn't want to go potty.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.630
We bring him back in, and
then he goes in the house.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.920
That's happened
to nobody, has it?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.850
Right?

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:16.520
So you break that
down a little bit.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.760
Take him outside.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.570
Let him do it.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.170
You ignore him, no
play, no nothing.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:22.820
You just walk around,
and he's going

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.760
to be biting at your shoes, and
biting at-- just walk around.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.940
Then he goes, oh, this
is getting boring.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.746
And he goes and finds,
and he goes, OK.

00:41:30.746 --> 00:41:32.120
And his bladder
relaxes, and he's

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.690
able to do his job outside.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.030
Good boy.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.980
Treat.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.600
We don't win the Super
Bowl on this, people.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:47.720
There is a level of rewards that
are appropriate for behaviors.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:53.430
My kid brings home an A in PE,
we're not going to Disneyland.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.120
Bring home an A in
physics, yeah, we're

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.840
going to talk about it.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.080
Right?

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:58.690
Same thing.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.350
OK, so he pottied outside.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.080
We want to mark the
behavior as being positive,

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.805
but we're not going
to get all amped up

00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:06.930
and everything else because
what's going to happen?

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.510
Then he goes, OK, every time
I pee, I need to get excited,

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.169
and I need to get this.

00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:13.960
And I forget to do the
rest, and my bladder

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.001
might not be completely
empty, because God knows,

00:42:16.001 --> 00:42:19.170
dogs empty their bladders
every time they pee, right?

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.570
No.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:21.710
They always have some more.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.430
So, good boy.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.370
Treat.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.140
Positive.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.270
Continue to let them
work through it.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.350
And that's just a bonus.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:30.530
I won't charge
you anything extra

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.040
for that little
dog training trick.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.255
All right, big one here.

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:39.656
And please stop me if
you have any questions,

00:42:39.656 --> 00:42:41.280
and I'll try to get
as much information

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.050
out there as possible.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:48.590
When my dog is nervous,
I want to pet him, right?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.170
I want to soothe him
and tell him it's OK.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.460
How many of you have
the little yappy dogs?

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.750
Go ahead, admit it now.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.920
I won't hit you.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.340
So you've got a
little yappy dog.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.632
Friends come over, and the
dog goes Cujo style on them.

00:43:01.632 --> 00:43:03.256
And because they're
little, you go, oh,

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:04.650
so cute when they're young.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.530
But later on, it's
just getting obnoxious.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.800
Now we're three years
into it, and oh dear god.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.650
So the people come over, and
we go it's OK, buddy, it's OK.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.350
You don't have to
be afraid of them.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.380
OK, remember what they hear?

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.493
What do they here?

00:43:17.493 --> 00:43:19.760
Wah, ma wah, wah, wah.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.390
And you're going, it's OK,
buddy, it's OK, and nice dog.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.768
What does that sound like?

00:43:26.768 --> 00:43:27.980
Good boy!

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.845
That's OK, good boy.

00:43:28.845 --> 00:43:30.220
And what do we do
to praise them?

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.270
Oh, we touch them.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.700
We let them know, hey, good boy.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.540
So when we're praising our
dogs for being nervous,

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.710
guess what we're going to have.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:39.750
A nervous dog.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.150
He's going, I must
be doing it right.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.635
OK, I keep doing it.

00:43:45.635 --> 00:43:48.710
My children, my primates, they
understand things a little bit

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.966
differently than the canines.

00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:51.590
The primate, my kid
comes out and says,

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.680
Daddy, there's a
boogeyman under my bed.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.340
Hey, come here.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.405
It's OK, buddy.

00:43:56.405 --> 00:43:57.280
There's no boogeyman.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.905
Daddy will take care
of it if there is.

00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:00.745
And yeah, that works
great with our kids.

00:44:00.745 --> 00:44:03.350
We do that with our dogs, and
the dog's going, I knew it.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.800
I knew there was a boogeyman.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.840
It's all bad, because
even Dad said so

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.740
when he told me good boy.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.969
So remember, we don't
pet nervous dogs.

00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:15.260
We really got to take on more
of a tough love approach.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.627
Suck it up, buttercup.

00:44:16.627 --> 00:44:18.210
We're not going to
have that behavior.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.840
And if we're going to change
their behavior with food

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.798
and stuff like that, it's
got to be giving them

00:44:21.798 --> 00:44:22.670
something new to do.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.840
This is called
counter conditioning.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.060
Your dog runs up, jumps
on you when you get home.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.190
And you go, oh, it's
a good boy, but I

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.820
don't want you to
jump on people.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.690
How fair are we now?

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.150
Don't jump up, but
hey, it's a good boy.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.460
Or they jump up,
and we go, stop.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.840
Does the dog know the difference
between good boy, and no,

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.840
don't jump on me?

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.560
Because what is he looking for?

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.680
Physical contact.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.180
Right?

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.270
He's looking for
engagement with you.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.920
So counter conditioning is he
comes up, runs and jumps up,

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.600
and you go, sit.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.810
And he sits, and you go,
oh, now we can good boy.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.634
Now we touch.

00:45:01.634 --> 00:45:03.300
And then you get the
dog who eventually,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.800
if you're doing this right,
he comes up when you get home.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.330
He goes, I'm sitting down.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.684
Pet me now.

00:45:08.684 --> 00:45:09.490
Right?

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.430
Counter conditioning.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.650
Keep that in mind.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.804
If you keep just these
few principles out there,

00:45:13.804 --> 00:45:15.970
you're going to be able to
get through these things.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.070
All right.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.150
Any questions?

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:23.408
Where is the flaw
in your thinking?

00:45:23.408 --> 00:45:25.902
AUDIENCE: There's probably one.

00:45:25.902 --> 00:45:27.860
ROB PELADEAU: The flaw--
and that's what we do.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.620
So if nobody else
caught it, I catch it

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.930
because it's what I do
all day every day-- is

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.620
we put an
anthropomorphism in there.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.730
She wants our attention.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.890
How do we know she
wants our attention?

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:38.822
We don't.

00:45:38.822 --> 00:45:40.470
We assume.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.510
So first thing we do is take
all anthropomorphisms out.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:44.270
Right?

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.000
And we deal with her
like she's a dog,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.935
and we counter condition.

00:45:48.935 --> 00:45:52.030
So that's where you
build the markers.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.788
So one of the ways to
counter condition a dog

00:45:54.788 --> 00:45:56.790
is to teach them
to bark on command.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:57.950
Speak, yes.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:58.870
Speak, yes.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.090
Then speak them, no, quiet.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:04.580
And when they don't
speak, quiet-- that treat.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.360
So you start building
a quiet command

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.010
through positive reinforcement.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.595
So you teach them
to bark on command,

00:46:09.595 --> 00:46:12.030
and then teach them shh!

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.880
Yes, good.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.700
So really, yes, they are trying
to affect their environment.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.510
Dogs bark and cry in crates
to get the pack to come back.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.010
That's what howling
is about and all

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.440
these different
things that wolves do,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.270
coyotes, and every other
canine kind of creature.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:33.060
Yeah, especially those loud,
high-pitched, oh my god,

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.850
makes your-- it's
like a fingernails

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.270
on the chalkboard kind of thing.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.510
Yeah, that's the dog
going, get back over here.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.750
Get back over here.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.920
So we never open the
crate or a pen for them

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.530
when they're in that mode.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.900
We get them to go
quiet, after we've

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.140
taught them what quiet means.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.720
There is a two-minute period
of disassociation for dogs.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.464
So although they might be
quiet, if you go and open

00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:01.880
that door within
that two minutes,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.930
they go, my barking
got you here.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.540
My barking got me the
reward I'm looking for.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.207
So quiet, and you
work that two minutes,

00:47:08.207 --> 00:47:10.290
until eventually you get
through that two minutes,

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.020
and he's quiet.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.380
And then you go, all right.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.520
And he goes, oh, quiet
gets me out the door.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.620
Quiet gets this open.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.470
So that would be one
way I would look at.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:21.386
How old is he now?

00:47:21.386 --> 00:47:22.260
AUDIENCE: Six months.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.650
ROB PELADEAU: Six months, yeah.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.510
And puppies bark.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.559
That's what they do.

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:27.350
They are obnoxious.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.000
They bark, and they
bark, and they bark.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.520
Yeah.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.490
I would recommend,
though, on a social level,

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.720
to make sure you
tell your neighbors,

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.210
be open with your neighbors.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.200
Say, hey, I've got a
puppy that's in training.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.010
And if he's barking,
I'm so sorry.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.737
And I promise you I'm
working through it.

00:47:47.737 --> 00:47:49.570
That has done more for
people than anything.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.653
Because that's one of the
biggest problems we have

00:47:51.653 --> 00:47:55.290
and why we push our dog training
into areas that they probably

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.650
usually wouldn't work is
because of social pressure.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.630
I want my dog to act a certain
way so other people will

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.100
respond the way I want them to.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:09.109
But if we are much more
open and more-- well,

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:11.400
in more communication with
the people around us, going,

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.970
hey, this is what my
dog does, and I'm sorry,

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:17.460
you're less likely to get a
complaint to your landlord,

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.390
and your neighbors are going
to not hate you as much, if you

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.500
are up front and introduce
the puppy to them.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.180
And then they go,
they love the puppy.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.420
And then, they'll walk
by and go, quiet, puppy,

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.290
and help you with your training.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.010
And bring them in.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.980
I always encourage
my clients who've

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.660
had dogs that were a
nuisance in the neighborhood

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.360
to involve the neighbors,
who will get re-involved

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.110
with the dog, to come
into the training.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.100
Because then there's more
of that community approach,

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.100
and everybody is a little
more patient with you.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.141
It may not work every
time, but you're definitely

00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:51.685
increasing your odds that you
will have a community that's

00:48:51.685 --> 00:48:53.810
willing to work with you,
because we are definitely

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.200
in a dog world now.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.700
It's just remarkable how many
people have so many dogs.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.770
So yeah, talk to those
neighbors and work that way,

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.960
and expect your dogs
to exhibit behaviors.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.220
Because otherwise, that's
what shuts dogs down

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.300
is when we try to take
away behaviors completely

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.250
that are completely
innate in them.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:16.750
And they cannot understand, and
they won't overcome and will

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.510
have failure leaders in training
because we will not do what it

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.160
takes to get them there.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.290
ANGIE PRIMAVERA: "When I'm
home with my dog, who's

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.956
10 months old, he
feels very comfortable

00:49:24.956 --> 00:49:26.650
and will often play by himself.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.167
When I'm away, I feel like he
doesn't actually play as much

00:49:29.167 --> 00:49:30.750
and he just waits
for me to come back.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.780
How do I make this time
away more enjoyable?"

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.990
ROB PELADEAU: All right.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.490
So where's the flaw
in the thinking?

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.273
Anybody?

00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:41.814
AUDIENCE: The
assumption that the dog

00:49:41.814 --> 00:49:43.052
isn't having fun when he's gone.

00:49:43.052 --> 00:49:43.843
ROB PELADEAU: Yeah.

00:49:43.843 --> 00:49:46.100
The anthropomorphisms.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.870
When the pack's away, the
lone dog or the other dogs

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.800
lay around and do nothing.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.190
This is what dogs do.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.240
This is why crate training
and other things that

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.030
give your dog a nice
confined area so they

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.280
can feel like they're denning
is very good for nervous dogs

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.900
so they can feel
protected, and they

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.357
don't have to worry about the
boogeyman coming to get them.

00:50:08.357 --> 00:50:09.440
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.700
If that dog is not
being destructive

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.450
in their behavior while
you're gone, rejoice.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.100
Be happy.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.200
If you're concerned
that they will

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.755
get into destructive behavior,
give them something to do.

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:28.390
You know, these KONGs that
have peanut butter in them,

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.530
frozen overnight, things
that make their brains work

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.390
or something they
got to gnaw on.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.280
That's fine.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.780
But don't worry
about your dog being

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:36.946
bored while you're not home.

00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.570
That's the nature of the beast.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.950
They are social creatures.

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:45.740
I mean, what do you do
when everybody's gone?

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.017
You're not up there entertaining
yourselves, most of the time.

00:50:50.017 --> 00:50:51.725
You need quiet time,
and so does the dog.

00:50:51.725 --> 00:50:52.990
He's not bored.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:54.850
It's a very well
adjusted dog who

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.750
can lay around and wait
for you to come home.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.590
Another thing, while
we're on that topic,

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.405
is to think that just
because when we get home,

00:51:03.405 --> 00:51:05.780
our dog's excited, then the
dog must be that way all day.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.280
So we must leave them outside
so they have this big old yard

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.920
to run in and exercise and
do agility while we're gone.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.580
Yeah.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.038
The dog is excited
because he heard

00:51:14.038 --> 00:51:16.190
you coming from 2 miles away.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.370
And when you get home,
he's, hey, buddy, what's up?

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:20.703
And he's like, OK, when you're
coming from 2 miles away,

00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:22.220
I can expect this, my reward.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.170
Right?

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:24.700
Yeah, but before that?

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.706
And they've done
research on this

00:51:26.706 --> 00:51:28.580
and had hidden cameras
and stuff in the house

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.770
and watched the dogs
who just lay there

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.240
while the owner is gone.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.190
And from over a
mile away, the dogs

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.180
are picking up the sound
of their owner's car.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.680
And the neat part
of that experiment

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.200
was they would take
a vehicle, let's

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.560
call it a '96 Grand Cherokee.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.310
And they'd put it out
there, drive it up--

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:43.580
it's the owner's car.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.080
Every day.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.680
So they tried to take an
identical car, identical tires

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.130
and everything, and
drive that car up.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.140
The dogs would not respond.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.500
They just laid there.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.670
They're that good.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:58.300
These dogs are phenomenal.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.390
Dogs are such awesome
creatures when we really

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:03.140
look at what they
can and can't do.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:06.220
Remember, these dogs now
are sniffing cancer cells.

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:07.450
They're that cool.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.340
From a block away.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:08.840
Very good.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.923
Thank you for adding that.

00:52:09.923 --> 00:52:11.666
Because, very important.

00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.040
She says that from
a block away--

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.373
she's got the drop cam in there.

00:52:14.373 --> 00:52:17.470
And she can see her dog
start to respond already

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.260
from a block away.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.660
So I'll take Samson out,
and we'll do a little bit.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.430
Samson is actually my
working patrol dog,

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:29.110

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:39.310
All right, so this is why
they're not great pets.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:40.810

for Cocoa Puffs.

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:23.196
and we're sitting there
texting and everything else.

00:56:23.196 --> 00:56:26.320
The dogs are learning that
their excitement, their reward--

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.130
everything else--
comes from other dogs.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.480
And god forbid there's an
unbalanced dog in the dog

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.460
park-- because we
never see that, right?

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.320
I mean, attached to
their unbalanced owner.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.180
And their dog's exhibiting
aggressive behaviors,

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:39.880
et cetera.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.220
And then our dog has to
correct that other dog,

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.240
and now we get our
dog learning that he

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.770
is in charge of
correcting other animals.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.760
And we create dog-aggressive,
over-reactive, over-interested

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.860
dogs.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.340
The way you get
dogs like this who

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.040
care about nothing
in the world is

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.820
by bringing them out
and training them

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.900
in these situations.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.150
Engagement is with you.

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.310
If you take nothing away
from this lecture except

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.100
for this one word, "engagement."

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.142
It's all about you.

00:57:05.142 --> 00:57:07.350
Like I said about five
minutes into the lecture, most

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:11.270
of the time we're just
boring people to our dogs.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.060
Because we tell our
dogs, go fulfill your day

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.830
with other dogs
and other people.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:20.110
They don't need to-- please, you
see my dog walking up, please

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:22.410
don't say, hey, buddy,
say hi to your dog.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.440
You don't know my dog.

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.350
You don't know me.

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:24.740
You don't know.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.930
I walk through San Francisco.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.596
We were in South of
Market area one day,

00:57:27.596 --> 00:57:30.290
and he's in full police
get up, because we just

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.120
left a demonstration
or something.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.800
And there's a big
old sign on the side

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.960
of his neck, police canine.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.980
And this guy walks up with
a stupid flexi-lead and this

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.375
stupid guy, huh-huh-huh-huh.

00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:43.720
I'm like, hey, buddy,
not a good idea.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.561
Huh-huh-huh-huh.

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:46.685
And the dog is going further
out on the flexi-lead.

00:57:46.685 --> 00:57:47.881
Hey, dude.

00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:49.630
My dog doesn't need
to say hi to your dog.

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.580
Oh, why are you such a jerk?

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:55.480
I'll take that over
my dog getting bit

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.720
by his unbalanced dog,
his over-interested dog.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.024
Because my dog is
very confident,

00:58:01.024 --> 00:58:02.190
but he's also very dominant.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:03.340
So the first thing
he's going to try to do

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.715
is put his head
over the haunches

00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:06.580
and going to start a fight.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.360
And the other dog, if he's not
confident, is going to fight.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.940
Who was our biggest
fighters in high school?

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.970
Was it the guys who
were the most confident

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:16.320
or the guys who were
the most afraid?

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.020
Right?

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.130
That's the dogs that
are acting aggressively,

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:21.790
the dogs that are very
fearful, very afraid.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.070
Teach your dog that
the best place on Earth

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.600
is right next to you.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.380
And that way, he
can go out, and he

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.090
will go play with other dogs.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.130
And I can call him
right out of it.

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:33.540
So once you teach your
dog engagement with you,

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:37.130
where you go by dogs-- sit,
down, all of our little tricks

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:38.120
we learned at home.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.750
Then the dog goes,
ah, great things

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.090
happen when other
dogs are around,

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.760
without me engaging
with other dogs.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.770
That's how we create dogs
who are not dog-aggressive.

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:50.050
That's how we create dogs
who are interested in us,

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.230
and that's how we create
dogs who will recall even

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.950
when they're out there with
other dogs, or squirrels,

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.230
or fish, or whatever
your dog's into.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.530
It's by showing them that
the best place on Earth--

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.870
Disneyland happens at my side.

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:03.745
Make sense?

00:59:03.745 --> 00:59:04.820
All right.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:05.320
We good?

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:05.630
ANGIE PRIMAVERA:
We're done, yes.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:06.550
ROB PELADEAU: Well,
I want to thank you

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.040
guys all for sharing
your lunchtime with me.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.530
Thank you for bringing that
food in because now I'm

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:14.530
super hungry, all that.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.400
But thanks again.
