00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.163
Now you've seen IP addresses before
like 50.116.54.191 or 8.8.8.8.

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:12.000
An IP address is used to designate a
particular destination on the Internet,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.190
typically a particular machine.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.040
And every message that travels
over the Internet, a web request,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.330
an email, a ping, or what have you.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.377
Is split into packets, and every one
of these packets has the IP address of

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.134
the machine it came from and
where it's going to.

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:29.504
Now a point about terminology, in this
lesson in the rest of the course,

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:31.830
you'll hear me talk about hosts a lot.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.610
A host is just a machine
on the Internet,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.854
particularly one that
might host services.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:39.220
You'll also hear me talk about
the endpoints of a connection,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.960
those are just the two machines or

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.950
programs that are communicating
over that connection.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.880
Okay, let's get started.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.510
First off,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.370
let's take another look at something
you've definitely seen before, Ping.
