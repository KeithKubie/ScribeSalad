DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.740
Really excited to be in LA and
bringing you this amazing panel

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.570
this afternoon.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.660
I'll start by introducing them,
before we get into the really

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.190
rich conversation.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.830
Immediately to my right, I
have Dr. Rhonda Gonzalez,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.430
Associate Professor of African
and African Diaspora History

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.700
and Associate Vice Provost
for Strategic Initiatives

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.800
and Director of
Pivot for Academic

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
Success at the University
of Texas at San Antonio.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.360
Next to Dr. Gonzalez
is Andrew Herrera,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.810
founder of Remezcla.com, one
of the most influential media

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.870
companies focused on
Latino millennials.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.660
And to his right is JC Polanco--

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.420
Juan-Carlos, but
we'll call him JC,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.510
is a former Bronx Commissioner
and President of New York City

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.360
Board of Elections he is
attorney for Polanco Law

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.210
and teaches Latino Studies at
Borough of Manhattan Community

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.310
College in New York City.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.450
And next to JC is America
Ferrera, an amazing actress,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.850
who we love for her work on
"Ugly Betty," "Sisterhood

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.190
of Traveling Pants"
and so much more.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.092
She's now starring on NBC's
hit show, "Superstore,"

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:15.050
which I mentioned to her
that my eight-year-old

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.610
daughter watches.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880
Because we love having strong
Latino figures to watch.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.190
And she and her
husband, Ryan Piers,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.070
recently launched an org called
Harness, bringing artists

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.840
together to create change.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.620
Please join me in welcoming
our panelists this afternoon.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.710
This series aims to have open
and constructive conversations

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.340
on race and capturing the full
breadth of being Hispanic,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.740
or Latinx, in
America, incorporates

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.940
notions of race, ethnicity,
culture, language, emotive

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.180
attachments and
affiliations, for starters.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.474
Defining the Hispanic
Latino identity is complex.

00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:56.890
With all of that
in mind, I'd like

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.230
to start by asking
our panelists,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.830
what does it mean to be
Hispanic, Latinx in the US,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.020
and what is a responsible way
to grapple with that complexity?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.070
AMERICA FERRERA: I
guess I'll start.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.770
I just learned
that I'm a Latinx.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.000
I just learned that term.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.520
I didn't really know what it
meant until someone told me.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.710
And, you know, I mean,
I can really only

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.530
speak for my own personal
experience and the sort

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.460
of anecdotal experiences
and conversations

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.640
I've had with other
Latino Americans.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.670
It is-- for me, it's
been one of the biggest

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.660
questions of my life.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.840
I was born in Los Angeles,
raised in the San Fernando

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.690
Valley to immigrant parents.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.370
And I grew up mainly
surrounded by Jewish people.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.860
So a big, big part of me
feels Jewish, culturally.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.360
Never went to a
single quinceanera--

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.690
tons of bar and bat mitzvahs.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.880
And I remember going
to school, and most

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.590
of the Latinos I would encounter
were bused in from downtown.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.580
And I had been sort of--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.400
through family, through
culture, through just observing

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.110
the world around me--

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.490
kind of conditioned to
think of myself as outside

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.151
of that Latino.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:23.650
You know?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.820
I wanted to be
academically successful.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.950
I wanted to be top of my class.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.030
I wanted to succeed.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.200
I had big ambitions.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.230
And everything and everyone
around me, you know,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.999
reminded me that I couldn't
be that kind of Latino

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.540
if I wanted to be
and do the things I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.623
wanted to do in the world.

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:47.020
And so a lot of my
young Latino identity

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.160
really had a lot to do
with neglecting and denying

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.230
my Latino identity.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.840
And that was a really,
really complicated thing.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.830
To find success as an actress,
be immediately labeled

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.650
and deemed a Latina
actress, held up

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.800
as a representative of
the Latino community,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.380
when my dirty, dirty secret
on the inside was like,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.940
I don't know what it means,
to me, to be a Latina.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.370
And so I had to go on
that journey for myself

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.970
to figure that out and
give myself the permission

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.750
to claim my Latino identity
and to define it for myself.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.380
And while every young Latino
or Latinx's experiences

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.050
is quite different, what I
think is the common thread, when

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.850
you're a Latin American,
is that you're sort of--

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.790
you're charged with this
question of are you an American

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.820
or are you a Latina?

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.340
And what is the line?

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.630
And how much of you is this?

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.340
And how much of you is that?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.460
And what I can say is
that, you can't be a Latinx

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.120
without having to ask yourself
those questions almost

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.990
on a daily basis.

00:04:57.793 --> 00:04:59.668
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
Thanks for sharing that.

00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:01.251
[INAUDIBLE] would
you like to go next?

00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:03.460
I'm sorry, I saw you
go to your microphone.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.092
RHONDA GONZALEZ: You go first.

00:05:05.092 --> 00:05:07.300
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: That's
a very interesting story.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.770
Thanks for sharing that.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.960
I think that to be Latino is
something so exciting today.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.650
It really is.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.870
It's an exciting
time to be Latino.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.090
I feel it in my soul.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.670
I mean, every time I
pick up a newspaper,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.970
every time I go online,
every time I turn the TV on,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.110
there is something happening.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.460
There is a discussion
as to, how can we

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.560
bring this incredible group
of people into the fold?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.290
How can we
communicate with them?

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.670
How can we connect them?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.310
How can we get them
to vote for us?

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.350
Which is where I'm coming from.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.606
We really need that vote!

00:05:42.606 --> 00:05:44.230
I mean, you look at
the numbers of what

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.224
it means to be Hispanic, nearly
25% of all babies born today

00:05:47.224 --> 00:05:49.390
have some sort of Latin
American background to them.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.837
So it's an exciting
time to be Hispanic.

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:53.170
It's an exciting group to cover.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.706
I teach the history of
the Dominican Republic

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:57.580
at the Borough of
Manhattan Community College

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.220
as well as the Latino
experience in the United States.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.220
And my classes are
filled to capacity.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.114
People of all different races
and ethnicities and backgrounds

00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:07.780
are coming in because
they want to learn

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.530
more of what this dynamic
group of people are all about.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.300
One thing that many
of them don't know

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.630
is that it's very complicated
to answer, even as a professor

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.730
standing before them.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.730
What is a Latino?

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.590
What is a Latino supposed to be?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.100
What does a Latino look like?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.940
What kind of a racial
background does a Latino claim?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.920
And it is something that
is very complicated,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.220
and it's something that I
think needs to be understood.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.345
It needs to be appreciated.

00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:33.460
It needs to be read about.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.430
And you need to
somehow delve yourself

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.520
in the history of Latin American
United States relations.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.140
I think that it's
important for people

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.254
like President Trump,
and people in the House

00:06:43.254 --> 00:06:45.670
of Representatives, as we
talked earlier, people in the US

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.710
Senate, to stop for a
minute to really study

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.557
the history of what it
is to be a Latin American

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:53.140
and understand the United States
involvement in Latin America.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.390
To understand how we
came to be, and to see

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.750
the complicated issues
that exist today

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.190
are not just about
talking points.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.190
They really affect people, and
they're historical in nature.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.230
So to be Hispanic, to be
Latino, is to have the burden--

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.380
once you're cognizant of
our history and cognizant

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.980
of what we are-- it's to
have the burden of knowing

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.620
that your ancestors
were rapists,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.610
and murderers, people that
enslaved millions of people.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.920
It is also to feel
the tragedy of knowing

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.979
that your ancestors were
the enslaved ones-- were

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.770
the people that were
raped, were the people

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.680
that were brought
here in shackles.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.590
It is having the anger to know
that your people's lands were

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.580
taken.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.560
It is to feel the
resentment inside your soul.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.870
To know that your
ancestors, at one point,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.519
experienced genocide.

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.060
And it's having all
of that combined.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.280
That once you really
appreciate what

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.030
it is to be Hispanic--
once you get closer

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.150
and closer to
understanding, you begin

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.210
to see how you can
become bipolar.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.940
You can have this
resentment within yourself

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.230
and appreciation of yourself.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.270
And the reason I'm so
excited is because we

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.790
have some panelists here
that have been focused

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.364
a great deal on
this issue, bringing

00:07:59.364 --> 00:08:00.530
this issue to the forefront.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.280
I'm excited to hear
what they have to say.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.550
I'm really excited to be
part of the group here today.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.460
Because we have so many--

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.650
so much diversity.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.650
We have blacks, we have
whites, we have Chinese,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.570
we have mulattoes, like me.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.280
We have hair of every texture.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.530
We have transgender, we
have gay, we have lesbian,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.545
we have straight.

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.420
We have those that don't
identify or conform.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.910
So it's an exciting
time, and that's

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.020
why I'm so happy to
be here, and hope

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.255
we get to talk more about it.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:23.630
So thank you again
for having me.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.190
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.830
ANDREW HERRERA: Awesome.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.540
Well, you know, I think it's--

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.570
probably, like everyone said,
it's a very complex question.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.659
And I don't think
there's one answer.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.919
I think there's several answers.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.750
You know, the term
Latinx is something

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.570
that has become kind
of in vogue in terms

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.450
of how to describe this
community over the last year,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.210
year and a half.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.210
I think, in the political
environment, actually,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.860
even become even a more common
way to describe this community.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.850
I think first we've got to
look back at why that is.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.250
I think, you know,
we've been trying to--

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.390
first, you know, I think I
grew up in the '90s, and a lot

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.780
of times it was about kind
of people calling you--

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.400
you know, identifying
you as Spanish,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.840
but you're not Spanish.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.270
You know, I'm not from Spain.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.350
I'm an Ecuadorian
kid from Queens.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.050
Then, as you get
older, it's about,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.540
are you Latino or Hispanic,
and what does that mean?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.634
And then today, now when
we talk about Latinx,

00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:27.800
I don't think it's
about necessarily trying

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.230
to define this
group, but actually

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.400
embrace this complexity.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.850
Because it is evolving.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.330
I think, you know, I heard a
lot about kind of the history.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.600
And I think history is
something we should understand,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.630
but we shouldn't
have it be what I

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.170
guess narrows our thinking
about what, you know, Latinidad,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.130
or what being Latino is today.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.590
It's something that is
continually evolving,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.590
the same way being
American 100 years ago

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.620
feels different than it
is to be American today.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.650
I think that's how we look
at Latinos, or our Latinx

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.580
community.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.650
We're going to be
continually evolving.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.010
RHONDA GONZALEZ: That's great.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.300
So I think America and
JC and Andrew, what

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.660
I hear in their conversation
is this real threat

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.470
of both the individual journey
and also a national journey.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.750
And then I hear a racial
journey, as well, right?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.560
So all those kind of identities.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.890
And I think that that
really does underscore,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.550
in part, the complexity of it.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.350
And then much of it-- at
least in the way I see it,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.800
and to just back up a little
bit and give a little bio.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.540
I grew up just down
the street from here,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.490
in Long Beach, California.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.170
And I grew up in a predominantly
African-American community,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.740
for the most part, and
in my earliest years

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.110
felt at least an affinity.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.940
You know, when you
grow up around friends.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.890
But, you know,
along that journey,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.660
I too encountered the reality
that people sort of create

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.320
paradigms that we
enter into, or we

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.800
get read through these lenses
that we didn't necessarily

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.400
construct.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.110
And so we're constantly aware
of negotiating all of that.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.780
And also, I think
in some ways wanting

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.390
to play a role in
making sure that we

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.070
are constructing the ongoing--

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.290
to use your term--
evolving history.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.940
So we become part of the people
who construct what that means.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.710
So I think the largest
still in our nation,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.596
like thinking about
the demographic shifts

00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:29.970
in the nation and
knowing that we

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.160
are becoming more and more
Latinx, Latino, Hispanic.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
And there's a conversation
in there, by the way,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.730
to have as well.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.280
Chicana.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.450
I think we should
put that out there.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.180
Is that the changing
demographics demand, really,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.310
and really require us to
think about the real binary we

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.170
work in within the nation.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.239
So that I think--

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:51.780
I'd love to hear
the other panelists,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.130
but I think that a lot of
us in the center, brown folk

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.090
really do work within
the black white binary.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.530
We live within it, and we see
that very dominant conversation

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.701
happening.

00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:07.950
And then we enter it and
we're kind of like, you know,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.790
we're here!

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.030
We're not quite maybe what you
think of as black identified

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.720
or white identified, but there's
a whole spectrum that we cover.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.630
And I think in part of moving
forward with the nation,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.540
we really do have to reckon
with that conversation

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.940
and conscientiously realize that
the binaries we live within,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.900
whether they are gender--

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.740
which we're really thinking
about today more than ever.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.310
We all have to think about race
and what the role of colorism

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.460
has meant in not just
Latino communities,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.592
but across communities.

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:42.300
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you so much.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.120
There's so much to
uncover from everything

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.370
that you've all shared.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.910
I want to touch several
points that you just

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.480
made, Rhonda, but I want
to touch on the labels

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.276
and how we identify ourselves.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.900
America, you started
by saying you just

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.780
found out you're Latinx.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.040
I grew up in the
Dominican Republic,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.451
and I became Hispanic when
I moved to the States.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:04.950
You know?

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.260
So a lot of us are grappling
with identities that are

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.600
evolving and shifting often.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:16.140
So Latinx, Hispanic, Chicana,
Latino, Latin American.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.260
What is the term, if
there is only one?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.000
And when you speak of it,
what are the terms that you

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.130
recommend to others?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.410
How do you identify
yourself, and how do you

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.992
speak to others about what
these terms and labels mean?

00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:31.700
ANDREW HERRERA: We'll
go to you, America.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.360
AMERICA FERRERA: I
have to start again?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.420
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Let's start over here now.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.461
AMERICA FERRERA: Let's
start with the professors.

00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.339
ANDREW HERRERA: Sure.

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:43.380
You know, I don't think--

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.940
I don't know if
that's fair, right?

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.450
I think it means something
different to each individual.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.200
I think, you know, I
started a publication that

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.160
was focused on breaking
stereotypes around culture

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.440
and showing the evolution
and the emerging

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.870
side of Latin culture.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.560
And as this has
grown over time, we

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.550
see that people are coming up
with new references in terms

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.310
of how they view their
generation in this community.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.720
So I think it means different
things to different people.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.400
And, for example,
editorially, you know, I--

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.910
we don't call everything
Latinx, right?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.850
We look at how people
identify themselves.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.920
And this is an
argument that I think

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.440
we see when we write articles.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.310
And I think, you know, the
same way America talked about--

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.247
she just learned about Latinx--

00:14:36.247 --> 00:14:37.830
there is a little
bit of a frustration

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.140
with a certain
generation of not wanting

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.580
to be identified as Latinx.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.020
Because they don't
understand it.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.850
And so I think it's not
fair to kind of force people

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.380
to take on a term
about who they are,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.410
whether they were
Hispanic for one decade,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.370
and then Latinos for another,
and Latinx in this era.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.640
So I think we need to allow
it to continue to evolve.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.970
And, you know, there's--

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.510
I run a company with
people that come

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.290
to work because they are looking
to find a place where they're

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.590
not trying to be defined.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.680
But their complexity
is part of kind

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.570
of the mission of the company.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.680
So whether you're--

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.790
I think, in the past, we
would look at last names

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.010
as a way to identify whether
someone was Hispanic.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.840
But now you have
people that, you know,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.350
you could be Amanda Jones,
but you could actually

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.500
be a Colombian or a Mexican.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.040
And so I think we
need to break away

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.840
from trying to kind
of, I think, answer

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.190
questions in this way, that try
to define a group in one way.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.135
So, you know, I think allowing
people to create terms.

00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:49.260
I think it's not about one.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.468
I think it's about probably
having an infinite amount

00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:54.570
of terms that allow
people to communicate

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.850
their individualism.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.900
And that's what we--

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.880
I think as a
community, we almost

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.280
need to get out of
having these labels.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.560
Because I think it is a
certain form of conditioning.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.170
Whether it be a census
form, or whether it

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.490
be identifying whether you are
part of a race or ethnicity,

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.360
I think it's something that is
not in the hands of, you know,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:15.960
someone else.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.712
It's something that
comes from within.

00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:19.170
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Centering on

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.376
your own individual identity.

00:16:20.376 --> 00:16:20.762
ANDREW HERRERA: Yeah.

00:16:20.762 --> 00:16:21.150
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.089
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I think--

00:16:23.089 --> 00:16:23.880
that's interesting.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.500
I think labels are important.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.560
I think we use the term
labels, and somehow we

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.950
want to take away
from how important

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.000
what you identify as is.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.220
It's not just a word that
you just throw around.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.480
When you claim a word and you
identify as what you believe

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.840
that word to be, it matters.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.790
It means something.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.150
There's a lot of
meaning behind it.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.119
So I'm very concerned.

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:48.660
Because I think that
these labels are

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.020
so important that when
you introduce new labels,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.570
you tend to create
new identities,

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.320
or you create an environment
where the issues that

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.560
are affecting the people that
are grouped in that identity

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.980
have a situation where the
real issues that impact

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.960
them are diluted.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.540
Today, we have
focused a great deal

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.920
on changing what we identify as.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.730
So today-- there was a time
when you were Hispanic.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.230
And you mentioned something
interesting about growing up

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.313
in the Dominican Republic.

00:17:17.313 --> 00:17:18.910
I'm a Dominican
kid from the Bronx.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.270
I thought I was Puerto Rican
till I was in fourth grade.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.680
True story.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.771
True story.

00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:25.770
If somebody asked me, I'm
Boricua, I don't know.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.186
Then somebody said,
wait a minute,

00:17:27.186 --> 00:17:29.280
your parents are from
the Dominican Republic.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.660
And then it gets even
funnier, because then

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.690
what do you identify as?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.390
I'm a black and white Dominican.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.980
And then as you become more
and more aware, you say,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.610
I'm a mulatto!

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.960
And then some people
don't like that term,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.280
but I'm a biracial Dominican.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.860
And it's a really exciting
time, as I mentioned earlier.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.410
But what's interesting
about the names

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.250
or how you identify yourself
as is that it matters.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.740
So when I say to
you, I'm Latino,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.070
and I pride myself on that.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.580
And I say to myself, I'm
going to study what this means

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.280
and how these people
differ from others,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.529
and what are the contributions
that we've made to this

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:00.210
country, and how are American
of Latino descent-- like I am--

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.380
how are we interesting?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.542
What do we contribute
to our society?

00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:05.250
It's important that
people have something

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.375
that they can rally around.

00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:10.110
So I know that I'm in the
minority up here when I say--

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.030
and I hope I don't get
kicked off the panel--

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.340
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: We
want diverse voices here, JP.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.890
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: When I say
I don't subscribe to Latinx,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.120
I don't.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.830
I don't subscribe to it.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.980
I think that it dilutes the real
matters that we're focusing on.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.870
| think Latinx is a cover for
the Hispanics in our community

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.060
who have a hard time
accepting the transgender

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.880
community or the non-gender
conforming community.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.970
I think we have to address the
heart and soul of the matter.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.010
You have to embrace
these people.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.929
These people have been
hiding for centuries.

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:41.970
You have to embrace them.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.800
These people are part
of us, and you're not

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.420
to discriminate
against these people.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.040
Simply creating
an entire new term

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.610
and throwing "x" at the end--

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.880
which is, by the way,
an Americanized thing.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.150
Throwing it in and now making it
part of Latinx to somehow force

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.300
people to recognize that not
everybody's gender conforming

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.980
I think is disingenuous.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.629
I really do.

00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:01.170
I think we have to
understand that we

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.795
have to change hearts
and minds and not

00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:04.200
the letters in the word.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.930
And Latinx, although
means well, I

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.000
think creates
divisions between us--

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.610
Latin Americans in
the United States--

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.700
and our counterparts that
are not in the United States.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.150
And another issue I think
that is important about labels

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.010
is that there is
strength in numbers.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.200
Today, we have millions
and millions of Latinos

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.930
that are of every race, and
every color, and every gender,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.887
and every gender identity.

00:19:26.887 --> 00:19:28.470
That it's important
that you recognize

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.428
why we do that politically,
as it is important.

00:19:30.428 --> 00:19:33.487
Because if all of a sudden
tomorrow Hispanic leaders,

00:19:33.487 --> 00:19:35.070
like many of the
people on this panel,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.050
decide that we're going
to now call ourselves

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.509
by a specific ethnicity,
there won't be that strength.

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.800
There are only a million or
so Dominicans in the United

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.640
States, but there are millions
and millions and millions

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.514
of Latinos in the United States.

00:19:46.514 --> 00:19:48.930
So creating further divisions
among a group that's already

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.340
divided on ethnic lines,
racial lines, religious lines,

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.050
at times, adds to the
issues that we face.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.700
And including this as a
topic of conversation,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.970
or making this a focal point,
truly dilutes of the fact

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.910
that 33% of the people in
federal prisons look like me

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.500
and have names like mine.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.560
It dilutes the fact that 22%
of the people in our country

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.740
are in poverty, and almost
all of them look like me

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.610
and have last names like mine.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.615
So let's focus on
those issues, instead

00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:21.440
of fancying around the letter x,
which is an Americanized thing,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.150
to the realities of
the issues that we're

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.820
facing in our community.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.790
AMERICA FERRERA: I'm not sure
I understood all of that.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.880
I need to take your
class, so that I can.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.900
But what-- you
know, I think it's--

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.680
the thing that makes
us all uncomfortable,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.860
which is contradiction
and dichotomy.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.417
And how, yes,
labeling separates us.

00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:45.500
But at the same time, if
you can't name something,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.370
you can't face it.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.210
You can't claim it,
you can't deal with it.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.210
And this is
something that I feel

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.910
like I've been sitting with
and thinking about just

00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.200
in the last couple of months
since the election is, how do I

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.310
claim my Latina-ness,
which is not

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.870
separate from my American-ness?

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:11.240
So as an American, I feel OK
using things that are American,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.950
like adding x to
the end of a word.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.817
Because I am fully American.

00:21:14.817 --> 00:21:16.400
I was born and raised
in this country.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.230
I consider myself an American.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.790
And that was an
identity that I felt

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.510
stronger connected to way before
I understood my own Latino

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.150
identity.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.330
So I don't think of
my Latino identity

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.850
as having to be purified
from my American identity

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.980
or separate from.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.920
But I also-- what
I've been sitting with

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.480
is, how do I claim, and
protect, and make space

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.350
for my Latino identity, but
not let it keep me from all

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.970
my other experiences?

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.180
And I'm most concerned,
in this moment,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.040
about how we start
widening the circles of how

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.660
we relate to one another.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.580
You know, is my skin black?

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.850
No, but I relate to
the black experience.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.610
Am I gay?

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.860
No, but I relate to the gay.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.620
Am I trans?

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.915
No, but I relate to that.

00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:06.290
I will stand for
that experience.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.970
I will stand with those people.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:13.730
And my heart is a part of
that battle, that struggle,

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.050
that fight, as well.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:24.980
And so it is, to me, a real
uncomfortable conversation

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.070
to have about labels.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.790
Because, on one hand, until
I could say to myself,

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.720
I'm a Latina, I am--

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.100
and that's going to mean to me
what I decide it means to me.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.360
And I don't have to go around,
in my particular industry,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.160
hiding the fact
that I'm Latina so I

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.590
can get this job, that
job, and this job.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.130
Like being able to say that--
walk into a room, claim that,

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.070
be proud of that, know
that that's what I am,

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.070
and know that it shouldn't
stop me from the opportunity

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.100
and access that I so desire--

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.340
mattered to me.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.290
And so I do think labels matter.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.390
And I do think
identifying yourself

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:12.120
as certain things changes
how you are in the world.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.870
And I think that there's
the contradiction of,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.410
yes, there are ways and times
in which it separates us

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.230
from one another.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.960
So I think it's--

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.950
I think it's more complicated
than just sort of dismissing

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.765
labels as a bad thing.

00:23:27.765 --> 00:23:29.140
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.900
Dr. Gonzales?

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.260
RHONDA GONZALEZ: OK.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.884
So maybe I'm going
to take a little bit

00:23:31.884 --> 00:23:34.260
of a different approach to it.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.430
So I think-- over time, or
over the course of one's life,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.287
I think in the United
States, because people

00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:41.120
think about their journey
growing up-- there

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.030
is a tendency, maybe,
say, around youth?

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.370
Maybe from youth to start,
pushing back against labels

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.490
that they grew up with.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.090
Categories they grew up with.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.960
And I think that's
probably a rite of passage.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.450
People embrace adolescence,
early adulthood.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.260
And then they start to see their
worlds become more complicated

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.990
by other identities that are
already [INAUDIBLE] and in use.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.300
But I think that--

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.820
I have a little bit of a
problem talking about labels.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.680
Because what I really
think we're missing

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.510
here is the fact
that we're talking

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:21.150
about people who are trying
to name their position

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.030
of marginalization in society.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.470
They're trying to draw attention
to the fact that, in some way,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.470
their communities are
aggrieved, and that they

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.760
haven't had their foremost
concerns thought about.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.290
And so whether or not somebody
embraces or pushes back

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.750
against a label I think
comes down to the individual.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.930
And while I believe everybody's
individuality is important,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.440
and that's part of an
American kind of sensibility,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.180
I also think
collectively as a nation

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.180
we need to be thinking
about how these names are

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.010
about a collective ideology.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.670
The way we are going
to reject, embrace

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.840
our thinking, our
inclusively, our empathy

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.210
for groups that really have
felt that they were on the outs.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.910
And so-- and I don't think,
as maybe some on this panel

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.000
would argue-- that it's
about just coddling.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.375
Because this is
serious business,

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:17.875
you know, the history
of the nation.

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:19.410
And so if we're
not really thinking

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.060
about how we are proactively
engaging with one another

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.237
and saying, OK,
maybe it's Latinx,

00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:29.070
but what are we really
getting at with that?

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.780
What is undergirding
all of the emotion,

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.300
the structural barriers
and challenges,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.530
or institutional barriers,
that come with that?

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.115
Right?

00:25:44.115 --> 00:25:45.950
Or that inspire that.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.830
So I think labels matter.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.000
But more than that,
I think words matter.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.090
And so there is a
very real reason

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.240
that words come to
be born for another--

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.800
you know, to use a metaphor.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.810
There's a very reason.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.550
And so I think that's what we
really need to think about.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.966
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Absolutely.

00:26:03.966 --> 00:26:05.630
And thank you so much.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.170
This is a dialogue
that could go on

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.470
for-- so I'm not going
to completely over invest

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.970
on the labels on the words.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.850
But I do agree with you,
fundamentally, words do matter.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.480
And the choice by which we
define ourselves and define

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.410
our place and our context
within this country does matter.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:27.390
I'm going to speak a bit now
around the identity category.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.980
Not just as a
label, but when you

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.560
think about the broader
construct of the Latin American

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.620
community, if you will.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.880
So that is a group of people
from 26 different countries.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.110
And different social
class backgrounds,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.430
different immigrant journeys.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.650
When data gets
collected on this group,

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.020
as we're discussing right now,
it's discussed as a monolith,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.640
as a Latin American term.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.820
What are the risks and
limits to doing so,

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.950
and what could be
alternative approaches

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.947
to highlight range and
variation within the community?

00:26:59.947 --> 00:27:01.280
RHONDA GONZALEZ: May I go first?

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.950
OK.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.640
Well, I think one of the basic
things that's a little bit

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.520
problematic and challenging for
us is that within those 26--

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.830
and I didn't know
there were 26--

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.080
is that class really matters.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.510
So what is a starting point?

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.750
You know, for a family,
or individual, or group

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.500
that either has been
here for generations

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.430
or is newly arrived and
is in that category.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.610
So I think understanding
the class reality

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.460
and how strikingly
different that is,

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.480
and how that also shapes
identity, is really important.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.140
Also access to social
mobility or economic mobility.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.440
And I think, you know, as
corporations-- and I mean,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.840
I'm in an institution
of higher learning.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.006
So, you know, we
think of ourselves

00:27:48.006 --> 00:27:49.380
a little bit
differently invested

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.930
in the students who
come to our university.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.550
I think as university leaders,
we need to think about all

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.970
of the heterogeneity
in the room.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.500
Not just the Latino
heterogeneity--

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.310
race, ethnic, religious-- but
also their class diversity.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.840
Because when you have a group
of people-- in this case,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.970
students--

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.060
where their ability to
navigate through a system that

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.445
wasn't built for them,
in the case of a Hispanic

00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:17.820
serving institution, which
the University of Texas at San

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.620
Antonio is, you have
a lot of students

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.850
who are arriving there.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.840
And, for all intents
and purposes,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.140
the institution is a
middle class environment.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.202
And many of them arrive
there not middle class.

00:28:27.202 --> 00:28:29.160
I mean, I'm a first
generation college student.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.960
My mother has a third
grade education.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.720
My father had an
eighth grade education.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.954
So when I arrived at UCLA,
I was like, wow, this is--

00:28:36.954 --> 00:28:39.120
and that was my first
experience with Jewish people.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.351
I was like, what is this
salty donut thing they eat?

00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:41.850
You know?

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.220
That's how I thought
about it when I got there.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.880
You really have a
clash of cultures,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.620
but also a class clash
of material history

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.700
that often happens.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.950
And I think that, if we're
not aware of how different--

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.950
and maybe even some of
the employees in the room

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.325
have come from
these backgrounds,

00:28:57.325 --> 00:28:59.280
and then you arrive on
this amazing campus.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.130
And it's like so state of
the art, and all of this.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.010
It's like, wow, you know,
I've never really maybe felt

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.750
like I belonged in
this environment.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.140
And, you know, how am
I going to make sure

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.370
that this is part of my
home so that I can thrive,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.920
and I can be as
creative and contribute

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.037
as much to this company
as I really want to?

00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:18.120
And so I think the institution
of higher education

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.735
is similar in that way.

00:29:19.735 --> 00:29:21.110
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.086
Anyone else?

00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:25.200
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
Well, I'll go.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.060
I hope I was clear,
America and Dr. Gonzalez.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.162
Labels matter, names
matter, and words matter.

00:29:32.162 --> 00:29:33.370
I thought that was the theme.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.060
It's just somehow, along
the line, I felt as if--

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.430
I didn't do a lot of debating.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.010
And I felt as if I was facing
an opponent who countered

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.390
a position that I didn't make.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.310
So I wanted to make sure that
I was clear with the audience,

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.942
as well.

00:29:43.942 --> 00:29:45.650
I'm a firm believer
that names and labels

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.880
and how you identify matter.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.290
Clearly.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.587
So this is why this question
is so important as to--

00:29:50.587 --> 00:29:52.920
because we come from all these
different classes and all

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.030
these different races,
how is it that--

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.340
what are some of the
risks that are involved?

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.540
I think there are a lot
of benefits with creating

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.590
a monolithic group.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.160
There are.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.200
And let me be very
honest with you guys.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.390
There is an incredible
amount of benefit.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.190
When you consider
that politicians

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.850
in this recent election were
talking about the Latino vote,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.720
as if the Latino
vote was monolithic,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.900
as if we all just agreed
on the same things,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.174
and they view us as being
millions and millions

00:30:19.174 --> 00:30:21.340
of people, then they're
going to cater to what is it

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.300
that the Latino people want?

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.950
You can't really quantify that.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.200
You can't really quantify--
even at Google, what is it

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.550
that the Latino employees want?

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.960
That's a ridiculous question.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.670
Because the Latino
employees are just

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.490
as diverse as the
non-Latino employees.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.370
You know, us-- when I say
descendant of Latin America,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.346
I'm talking about, our
parents are from there,

00:30:39.346 --> 00:30:40.220
and we are Americans.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.050
Because I claim American, and
it upsets a lot of people,

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.140
especially in New York.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.530
Because when people come
up to me and ask me,

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.490
where are you from?

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.865
And I go, the Bronx, they're
like, no, no, no, seriously,

00:30:48.865 --> 00:30:49.680
where are you from?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.200
They want to know more
and more whether-- they

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.430
don't go to the white
guy and ask him that.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.670
Because the white guy
gets around and says,

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.210
oh, I'm a quarter Italian,
quarter Irish, quarter German.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.334
And by then, I'm just lost.

00:30:57.334 --> 00:31:00.620
I don't even know how you divide
a human being in quarters.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.942
So this idea is to--
the benefits that

00:31:02.942 --> 00:31:04.900
are surrounded by just
calling us all Hispanic,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.590
I think that there are a lot.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.650
I think that we can take
advantage of that, politically.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.647
Because politicians
in Washington

00:31:11.647 --> 00:31:12.980
will have to think about things.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.850
And I hope they do.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.100
I know they're not right
now, and it really upsets me.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.750
I hope they realize
that there are

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.760
issues that affect
all of us, regardless

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.170
of our ethnic background.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.410
There are some issues
like immigration

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.552
that affect us as Latinos.

00:31:26.552 --> 00:31:28.260
You may not be an
undocumented immigrant.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.780
Your father may not
even be an immigrant.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.030
You may be here for hundreds
of years, like the person

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.100
that I met earlier today.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.004
But there are so many
differences between us

00:31:38.004 --> 00:31:39.920
that it's very interesting
to see, how can you

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.600
unite all these people?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.980
And when you say
Latinos, we have

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.650
something in common where
we could identify with.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.674
And for the most part, we
have Spanish as a language

00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:50.090
that many of us
can identify with.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.180
And not that all of us
Latinos speak Spanish.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.059
My kids don't.

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:57.350
But for the most part, we
have language that unites us,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.570
and we also have a certain
immigration experience.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.340
It may be now or it may have
been a couple of years ago.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.730
And unlike so many of the
Chicanos, and you see labels

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:05.959
are important, right?

00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:08.250
The Chicanos who have been
here for thousands of years,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.880
in our territory here
in the United States.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.910
So labels can matter now.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.180
And how you identify Latinos
matters for purposes of power.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.760
And if Hispanics,
or Latinos, begin

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.650
to understand the
importance of how there

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.182
are singular issues that
impact all of us, then

00:32:24.182 --> 00:32:26.390
perhaps we'd be able to get
more power in Washington.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.400
Perhaps President
Trump would think twice

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.990
before saying some
of the things,

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.180
and how he says some of
the things, about people

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.009
that affect us.

00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:33.800
I'll tell you this.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.320
On June 16th, 2015--

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.720
as a Republican, and
this was very hard--

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.790
I became a never
Trump Republican.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.730
Because Donald Trump came down
those escalators and blasted

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.120
undocumented immigrants.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.150
Blasted Mexicans, in particular.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.770
Now I'm not Mexican.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.380
I know a couple of Mexicans
in New York, but I'm not.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.530
But when he did that,
I felt insulted.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.110
I felt like, my people
just got dissed!

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.820
On TV!

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.470
We're murderers, and rapists,
and we're not the best?

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.140
And it bothered me,
but I had nothing--

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.030
if you look down
my ancestry DNA,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.980
you're going to find
Mexican anywhere.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.067
But I felt an affinity.

00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:09.650
I felt a bond.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.460
I felt an allegiance
to these people.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.560
So there are some very
good things that happened.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.230
And I was very angry about that.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.180
Because, when he
did that, he really

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.310
castigated an entire
group of people.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.060
When he did that about
the Mexican people,

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.835
I knew that he was
thinking about me.

00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:23.960
AMERICA FERRERA: Of course.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.950
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
I knew that.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.736
I knew he was thinking
about me, and he

00:33:25.736 --> 00:33:26.840
was thinking about us up here.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.880
AMERICA FERRERA: He doesn't
know the difference--

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.046
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I know.

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:31.200
I know he was, and
it bothers me, a lot.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.820
A lot.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.190
And I wish I could talk to him,
but because I was never Trump,

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.523
I'm not allowed near Washington.

00:33:35.523 --> 00:33:36.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.840
Anywhere near it.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.360
But there are some advantages
for knowing the differences,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.010
and this is why I get excited.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.220
Once you realize that the Latin
American experience is very

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.130
similar to the so-called
American experience,

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.190
and that our history--

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.950
and I know Dr. Gonzalez
as a historian.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.300
She'd appreciate this.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.780
Our history is very similar.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.120
It is.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.730
We had a slave experience
in the United States.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.950
We had a slave experience
in Latin America.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.946
We had a European
conquest in North America.

00:34:03.946 --> 00:34:05.570
We had the same thing
in South America.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.670
We have a class structure
based on race in North

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.760
America for the most part.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.219
Not always, but
it just so happens

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.260
to be that the wealthiest
are of a certain class,

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.100
of a certain race.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.933
And then you go to Latin
America, especially

00:34:14.933 --> 00:34:16.540
in the Caribbean, very similar.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.590
The percentage of
the class elites,

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.100
or all of the
European descendancy,

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.062
and the great majority of the
people in poverty, are not.

00:34:23.062 --> 00:34:24.520
So there are a lot
of similarities.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.900
And I think once it becomes more
common for non-Latino students

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.400
to enroll in Latino
studies classes,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.500
and to learn about
what Dominicans are,

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.800
and Puerto Ricans
are, and Mexicans

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.008
are, and know how important
the Mexican community has

00:34:34.008 --> 00:34:36.570
been in the United States--
how 63% of our population that

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.529
is Hispanic is Mexican.

00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:39.278
When you study the
contributions that they

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.409
made to civil rights--

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:43.080
although not as covered as the
African-American civil rights

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.719
movements, and I understand
the frustration for some--

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.940
you'd appreciate, have
a sense of appreciation.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.219
And that's I continue to
say, if our politicians,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.949
and our leaders take an
opportunity just read a book,

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.120
or have a discussion with
one of our panelists,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.639
they'd think twice before
saying some of the things

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.020
that they've done and said.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.186
And I'll say one more thing.

00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:01.430
America, I'm sorry that
I'm taking so much time.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.600
And I hate to beat
up on my own guys.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.760
But Senator Sessions on
the floor of the US Senate

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.800
in 2006--

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.740
not in some club,
not during lunch,

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.210
on the floor in 2006 said
that-- and I'm paraphrasing--

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.160
that immigrants from
the Dominican Republic

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.659
have nothing to
offer our economy.

00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:20.700
Because of that, they have
nothing to contribute.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.270
It broke my heart.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.550
It devastated me.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.942
I said, well, how can that be?

00:35:24.942 --> 00:35:26.400
How could it be
that the only thing

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.983
they identify with
Dominican-Americans

00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:29.110
is baseball?

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.185
How don't they know about
Junot Diaz or Julia Alvarez?

00:35:32.185 --> 00:35:34.560
Do they not understand the
contributions that we've made?

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.120
Or even Oscar de La Renta?

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.850
You can go down the list
and study how that's

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.260
an awful statement to make.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.914
That man today is the attorney
general of the United States.

00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:45.330
And I blame the
fact that we don't

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.934
talk enough about
our contributions

00:35:46.934 --> 00:35:49.350
to the United States, and we
don't hold people to account.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.430
To learn about our struggle.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.470
To learn about what we've
done, what we've overcome,

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.678
and what we have contributed.

00:35:53.678 --> 00:35:54.670
So I think they--

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.810
I know I spoke too long.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.370
I'm sorry, America.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.120
But I think it's
important that I'm clear.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.910
Because when I'm
not clear, I panic.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.493
So I want to make
sure that I'm clear.

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:02.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.970
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: We're
going to avoid you panicking,

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.110
JC, but are going to
move over to America now.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.280
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: When
I heard America tackle me,

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.510
I said, America, you're
beating me up for no reason!

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.801
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: America?

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.410
AMERICA FERRERA: I'm passionate!

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.160
I'm-- am I allowed to say this?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.360
I'm Latina!

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.209
Yes.

00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:17.000
What do you expect?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.780
AMERICA FERRERA: That's a
stereotype I get to use, right?

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.990
Own it.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.500
This is something
that we are constantly

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.070
talking about inside of
the entertainment industry.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.672
Because everybody
wants to know, how

00:36:30.672 --> 00:36:31.880
do you get the Latino market?

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.580
How do you get
the Latino market?

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:39.030
And there's so much nuance
lost in that mindset.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.170
You know, I think there's an
importance differentiating

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.060
diversity of race and
diversity of experience.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.470
And, you know-- and
both have value.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:56.970
And if a Latino, any Latino,
is dehumanized and ridiculed

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.660
by anyone, much less someone
running for president,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.370
it hurts us all.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.510
And if a Latino succeeds,
we all claim it.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.020
We take the pride in
that, because we do.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.320
However, that doesn't
mean that, if there's

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.260
a Latino at the head
of said studio, that's

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.190
going to translate to my
experience as a Latino

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.650
in their stories and
the stories they tell.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:28.110
And so, you know, I have
tried from before I ever even

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:33.060
imagined myself a producer,
a 17-year-old kid trying

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.400
to talk to a film
studio about like,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.670
don't market to
Latinos that way.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.010
Because who you're
talking to is me,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.890
and I grew up watching "Fresh
Prince of Bel Air" and "Family

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.610
Matters" and "Dawson's Creek."

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:50.940
And if you're looking for me,
then maybe listen a little bit

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.210
to the nuance of what
someone like me wants.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.750
I want to see people who look
like me in all these stories,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.790
in all these images.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.770
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.030
that if you just throw the word
"telenovela" in it, I'm like,

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.960
that's me!

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.660
You know, that's-- I walked
out of the room if my mom put

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.380
on a telenovela.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.670
I couldn't stand it.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.633
Or, you know, if it's
just half in Spanish,

00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:16.091
it's all of a sudden going to
appeal to all of the Latinos.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:22.170
It will never
equal good business

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.570
to think of us as a monolith.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.050
And that's why I think
that this term of Latinx--

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.460
which I think I may not
even understand fully,

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.700
so I would love kind
of a concise definition

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.850
of what Latinx means--

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.450
it has-- even as a producer,
even as a storyteller,

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.620
even as somebody who goes out
on a daily basis and speaks

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:53.430
to content makers about this
young group of Latinos who

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.420
identify themselves as not
the Latino that you have

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.770
in your mind--

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:05.580
it's given us agency and power
to delineate ourselves inside

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.189
of that monolith.

00:39:07.189 --> 00:39:08.730
And there's power
in that when you're

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:11.730
having conversations about
storytelling and business

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.220
and nuance inside of a very,
very, very broad stroke.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.130
That doesn't serve us when--

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.490
if you're a politician,
or if you're a businessman

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.670
genuinely trying to reach
a specific audience.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:33.380
Because our experiences are so
vastly nuanced and different.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.755
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Andrew, do

00:39:34.755 --> 00:39:36.171
you want to speak
about continuing

00:39:36.171 --> 00:39:38.875
to embrace our nuances?

00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:39.750
ANDREW HERRERA: Yeah.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.450
I think there's one uniform
theme for all of us,

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.790
is that I think we're proud.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.420
We're very proud of what
this culture represents.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.550
I think we all have
different definitions

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:54.600
or have different experiences
on how that plays out.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:59.670
And I think, for me
personally, I think, you know,

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.490
what I've created
was-- you know,

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:07.230
I created a forum that was out
of an identity crisis of me

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:12.120
wanting to not really
identify as a Latino.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.120
And, you know, I
was born Andres,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.360
and my name is Andrew today.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.860
Why?

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.190
Because, in the 90s,
my name was "undress"

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.210
or "Andre as," and no one
knew how to-- and that was--

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.810
but today, Andres is cool.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.600
And where I'm going with
this is that I think--

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.450
in today's environment,
I think I'm

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.980
starting to see more pride
than I've ever seen before.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.920
And that didn't necessarily
come through labels.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.520
I think that came
through the culture

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.160
evolving and the
influence that we've

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.070
had beyond our own
community, right?

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:55.290
Beyond kind of just
Hispanics, but how we see--

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.820
I think our non-Hispanic
friends embrace our own culture,

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.450
and I think that allows
us to also go down

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:07.350
this new path of having
an identity that, one, we

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:08.940
can be proud about.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.240
Two, can continue to evolve.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.540
And that isn't only
based off of race.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:20.070
I mean, I-- you know,
it's pretty frustrating.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.836
You know, one of
the reasons I do

00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:24.210
what I do and I
love what I do is

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.760
because I get to
break stereotypes even

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.980
within my own community.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.990
You know, for example, it's--

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.430
we talk about Afro-Latinos.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.360
And it's something that
we talk about today,

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.190
but Afro-Latinos have been
part of the Hispanic community,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.490
Latin community, Latinx
community for decades.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.890
But you never saw
them on Univision.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.810
You never saw them on Telemundo.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.430
They were never
a representation.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:52.920
I know a lot of friends that I
didn't even know were Latino.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.410
That were basically assimilated
to African-American-- you know,

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.190
being--

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.570
calling themselves
African-American without

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.947
mentioning that they were
Latino, because that wasn't--

00:42:07.947 --> 00:42:09.030
they didn't feel welcomed.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.810
So I think-- but
today, we're starting

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.410
to see that evolve into
where they are welcomed,

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.579
or that we talk
about these issues

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:19.620
within our own community.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.110
So I agree with some of what
you're saying, but I also--

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.860
but I disagree in
terms of it just

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.960
being about a label
that we get behind.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.200
I think what we get behind
is that we are influencing

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.960
and that we want to
push others to be

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.680
more fluent in our culture, not
just in how people define us.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.530
And I think if we
do that well, I

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.430
think this conversation goes
from actually not just being

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.430
an academic conversation
but a conversation that

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.040
goes into practice in terms
of how people make decisions.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.654
Whether it be around
content, around--

00:42:56.654 --> 00:42:58.820
you know, around-- I deal
with a lot of advertisers,

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.430
and it's like being
in the dark ages

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:08.670
sometimes about how they
want to chase and really

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.830
communicate with our community.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.110
So I do hope that--

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.470
I think we do need
to embrace this time,

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.680
and I think the fact
today is that we

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.540
do have this great pride.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.340
We do have this great diversity.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.820
But I think we're
just beginning.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.500
And I think we have to
embrace something like Latinx,

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.490
but embrace it for the people
that it means something for,

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:37.500
not put it as a label that a
group has to identify with.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.249
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
I'm going to switch

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.590
slightly away from the label.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.100
I know we keep on revisiting it,
but it is such a salient topic,

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.460
and something that we do need
to discuss amongst ourselves,

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.130
and also for the
wonderful audience that's

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.780
watching us today.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.280
But I want to pick up on
your comment around race

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.290
within the Latino community.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.650
And we're not comfortable
talking about race

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:03.000
within the Latino community.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.950
Racial hierarchy,
white privilege

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.420
within the Latino community.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.110
And I'd love to hear
from all of you,

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.150
or if anyone in particular
who wants to speak about,

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.950
how does that show up for us?

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.550
And how has it shown up,
if at all, for any of you

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.770
individually?

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.100
AMERICA FERRERA: Well,
I think I started my--

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.700
the first thing I
said was very much

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:29.010
based on learning
what kind of Latino

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.710
was an OK Latino to be when
you were growing up in the San

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.578
Fernando Valley and seeing--

00:44:37.242 --> 00:44:42.570
you know, seeing the
version of Latino that

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.900
was sort of dismissed
and stereotyped and put

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.440
in a certain box,
and not wanting

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.690
to be shoved in that box.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.810
Therefore, trying to make
myself as different as possible.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:55.140
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: Was
that because of socioeconomics

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.710
or because of race?

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.918
AMERICA FERRERA: I think it
was about a lot of stuff.

00:44:57.918 --> 00:45:01.710
I think, for one, I think
race is a really, really

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.480
big part of that.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.320
I think that-- I heard
a friend say this,

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.760
and it seems so true to me.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.100
When people demonize or
don't like your Latino-ness,

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.860
it's not the European
part of your Latino-ness

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.270
they don't like.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.070
It's the brown part.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.370
It's the indigenous part.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.320
And, I mean, I saw
a horrible example

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.080
of that on social media.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.060
There was all kinds of
horrible things being

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.270
said during the Super Bowl,
and someone was talking about

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.430
like Gisele Bundchen being
Brazilian and people saying,

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.650
yeah, but she's white.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.850
She's a white Brazilian.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.610
And that's not Latino,
and therefore white people

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.520
are still supreme.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.620
And that sort of stuff,
it's such a key reminder

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.870
of what we don't like to
discuss and talk about.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.680
Which is-- is that race
plays such a huge part.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.510
And, you know, I'll say it.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.000
Like the older family
members I grew up

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.690
with spoke of black people
in the most demeaning ways.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.190
You know?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.450
Race was always a part
of the conversation.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:05.587
And I remember--
I won't say who,

00:46:05.587 --> 00:46:07.170
because I feel like
they'd be ashamed.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.710
But an older person in
my family would always

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.962
say to my half white,
half Latina cousin,

00:46:13.962 --> 00:46:15.420
come out of the
sun or you're going

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.628
to be dark like your cousins.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.210
Or my mother would never ever
let me go out into the sun

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.950
without sunscreen, and a
hat, and, come out of there,

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.470
you don't want to look like--

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.730
you know, a campesina
or whatever.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:35.280
We grew up with that constant
sort of injection of race

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.400
always, and skin color
being a part of a hierarchy.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.340
And you wanted to be a
light skinned Latino.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.320
You didn't want
to have an accent.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.690
I mean, we grew up not
even speaking Spanish.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:53.190
Because to speak
Spanish, I believe--

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.250
assuming the best of
my parents, they just

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.930
wanted the best for us.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.370
So it was about
wanting to be perceived

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.010
as someone who could
take advantage of all

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.970
the opportunities and succeed.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:12.090
And so much of that was
about stripping away

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.370
the parts of being Latino
that other people weren't

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.790
comfortable with.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.490
And it was about other.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.980
It was about be as much--

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.580
try to be as much
of a white person

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.390
as you can in America to
be a successful Latino.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.630
And I've had to
reckon with that,

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.950
and think about how that
has shaped who I am,

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:39.690
and go on this journey of
learning that my value is

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:46.200
inherently there and not based
upon, you know, how appealing I

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.305
am to the people
in powerful rooms.

00:47:48.305 --> 00:47:49.680
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.013
[INAUDIBLE], would you like to--

00:47:51.013 --> 00:47:52.682
RHONDA GONZALEZ: Sure.

00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:54.390
Well, I guess I'm one
of those people who

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.860
is not uncomfortable
talking about race at all.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.180
But I do think that--

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.340
again, I think nuance of
language is important.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.382
And I think we all need to
be reminded again and again

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:06.840
that when we're
talking about race,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.240
we're talking about
large systems of power,

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.130
and not just individual
prejudices or biases,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.460
and those kinds of things.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.350
But I do think that there is
a deep historical and colonial

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.164
legacy that is part--

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.080
been referred to here.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.130
And that is the
roots of Latinidad

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:32.010
is inclusive of Africans,
indigenous folks, and then

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.750
all kinds of Iberian people.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.240
Really complicated as well
from the Iberian world.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.640
And those colonial
legacies, in part,

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.680
JC mentioned, you see in access
to material wealth still today.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.180
And those are like
the legacies we

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.790
see in especially Latin
American countries, when we're

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:51.300
talking about Latino nations.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.320
And so there's that.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.560
But I also think the
uncomfortable part is not

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.350
so much race as it is
the color discrimination,

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.930
or which is now, in the
literature, an evolving

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.790
field of colorism.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.760
And that is-- and I won't
mention names either,

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.490
but the first time I went back
to East Texas-- my parents

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.280
migrated here in 1954.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.160
And then, college graduation,
I had this really great idea.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.810
I want to go see where I came,
where my parents came from.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.530
And so took Mom back.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.510
And they're in Texas,
where I am now.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.620
And I love Texas.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.980
But in East Texas,
you know-- and I

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.781
think a lot of maybe panelists
had this experience, where

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.280
you meet people you didn't know,
but they're related to you.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.440
And what they want to
show you are the pictures

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.100
of their children who
married white people,

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.770
and their light
skinned grandchildren.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.280
And these are the things
you hold up as a trophy

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.920
or as a point of pride, and
you don't see the others.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.170
I mean, so that's like
kind of a familial context,

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.060
but I think the same thing
happens in our institutions.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.000
I don't think it's
an accident that when

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.760
you look around institutions,
you see people in positions

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.680
of power who might be Latino.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.270
That they may be fair skinned.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:09.920
That they may look like the
more standard ideal of beauty--

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.907
European features,
whatever it might be.

00:50:11.907 --> 00:50:14.240
You know, however that idea
is constructed in our minds.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.580
And so I think there are
a lot of intersecting

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.730
points on this
topic, but I really

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.740
think that we could
really benefit

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.980
from talking more about colorism
and color discrimination.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.630
Not just within
Latino communities--

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.930
because this affects every
community, Asian, white,

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.700
African-American, so
across the spectrum.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.960
But I do think that's a
really important point.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.670
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you so much.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:40.400
We have-- unless you
have any other points.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400
I have one-- I think--

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.585
JC, you look like you're
itching to answer that question.

00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:47.960
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I'm so
excited about the Afro Latino

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.580
movement.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.160
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: Yes?

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.860
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
I really am.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.730
You know, as a Dominican--
and I mentioned this again--

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.730
if you ever want to study
a group of people that

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.580
are really conflicted,
92% of our people

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.200
have African descendancy.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.700
We avoid it like
it's the plague.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.784
For us to admit that
we have black in us?

00:51:00.784 --> 00:51:01.450
Let me tell you.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.150
You know this.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.800
You know this, Daisy.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.340
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: I'm
Dominican and Puerto Rican.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:04.880
That's why he says.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.463
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: My kids are
too, so it's a real conflict.

00:51:07.463 --> 00:51:08.180
Think about this.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.480
We will mention every shade
before we accept blackness.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.910
We will call ourselves
oat, dark oat,

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.390
burnt oat, light Indian, medium
Indian, dark Indian, light

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.050
chocolate.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.039
You go down the list.

00:51:19.039 --> 00:51:21.080
You never want to be
associated with being black.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.556
And that was the concept
for a very, very long time.

00:51:24.556 --> 00:51:26.180
I grew up-- and as
I mentioned earlier,

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.888
and I shared with you
that I am biracial.

00:51:27.888 --> 00:51:29.810
But my entire family is
either white or black.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:30.950
So we are that family.

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.140
We are that little
unit of people

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.210
that look like me, that
are accepted by one side

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:36.710
but not by the other too much.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.501
And I'm sorry if you
watch and you get mad,

00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:40.590
but you really didn't
accept me, guys.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.289
But it's interesting.

00:51:42.289 --> 00:51:44.330
And I want to share
something with you, because I

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.350
think history is so important.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:45.830
Words matter.

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:46.413
Labels matter.

00:51:46.413 --> 00:51:47.155
I got it.

00:51:47.155 --> 00:51:48.780
There's a reason why
this is happening.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.250
There's a reason why this is.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.640
And if you study the
Latin American conquest,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.000
you soon realize how important
it was, at one point,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.960
for the Spanish landowner to
have a ratio on his plantation

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.740
that would be enough
master to slave

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.020
to be able to
control a rebellion.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.180
And how it was, the reality,
that there was never

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.160
enough white slave masters.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.482
And it's because of that.

00:52:11.482 --> 00:52:13.220
That the white
slave master began--

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.890
not accepting citizens of
Spain, because you couldn't be,

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.780
but citizens of the land.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.510
And Dr. Frank Moya Pons,
who is the authority when

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.030
it comes to the history
of the Dominican Republic,

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.627
really writes
clearly about this.

00:52:24.627 --> 00:52:26.210
When he talks about
the fact that they

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.060
were forced to accept people
that were more like them

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.720
in hue, and have them want
to now be the overseers

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.640
and manage the other
black folk, that

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.640
created a sense of superiority
among those that appeared

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.910
to be more lighter in tone,
more European in tone,

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.580
and really created resentment
amongst many people that

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.710
wanted their children to
be the ones on the horse.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.272
The one on the porch, the one
inside, the one not getting

00:52:48.272 --> 00:52:49.730
raped and killed
in the plantation.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.460
That reality, because
everything's historical,

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.721
affected people today.

00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:55.970
And it's been ingrained in
so many Latinos not wanting

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:56.950
to accept their blackness.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.220
I've written a lot about this.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.970
I get really excited
about this topic.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:03.569
So when I see African
descent Latinas no longer

00:53:03.569 --> 00:53:06.110
feel the need that they need to
have their hair a certain way

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.940
and go through a
process of chemical

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.610
destruction of their follicles,
and accept their blackness.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.590
And when I see them
say, I don't have

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.270
to get plastic
surgery on my nose.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.380
When I hear them say, I'm black,
and I'm proud, and it's OK,

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.160
and yes, you can be
black and Latino.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.410
Like you could be
a white American.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.300
Like you could be
a black Frenchmen.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.100
Like you can be a black Latino.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.860
Like we could have Ricky
Martin and David Ortiz,

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.780
and they're both Latinos, right?

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.580
So it's a great
thing to talk about.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.757
I'm really happy that you're
starting to write about

00:53:33.757 --> 00:53:35.090
and people are talking about it.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.220
And the Afro Latino
movement is very important.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.330
Because a sense of self
inferiority is being diluted.

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.596
I'm really excited about it.

00:53:42.596 --> 00:53:43.970
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.430
Andrew, I keep on--

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:47.090
I want to call you
Andres, but I'm

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.950
going to stop myself from it.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.680
Andrew, would you like to--
you've spoken about the work

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.540
that you're doing
around racial identity.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.635
Is there anything else
you'd like to share?

00:53:55.635 --> 00:53:56.510
ANDREW HERRERA: Sure.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:02.370
I think, in terms of--

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:07.540
from an Afro-Latino
perspective, or from, you know--

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.380
I think it is--

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.410
it's gotten to be
very much a time

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:20.350
where I think we can have
these conversations today.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.804
In terms of Afro
Latinidad, it's not just

00:54:23.804 --> 00:54:24.970
with the Dominican Republic.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.700
It's the entire region.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.870
And I think, you know,
we need to push people

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.440
to be more fluent within
our community to actually

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.520
understand all of this.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.460
I think, for example,
we talk about it here.

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.724
But I still think there
are people within--

00:54:42.724 --> 00:54:44.140
whether it be
Google or whether it

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.530
be other places, people that
are in power and make decisions

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.420
that have no idea
that this is a thing.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.480
So we talk about this
and it's a topic.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.770
So I think--

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.436
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
How do we make it

00:54:55.436 --> 00:54:58.470
less of a topic and more part
of the general conversation?

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.850
You You know, I
hope, with the way

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.860
we look at this
community in the future--

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.230
I don't know if that's
in the 2020 census, which

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.930
is supposed to evolve
in terms of having

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.850
more ways to look at how this
community identifies itself,

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.350
right?

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:15.510
I think there's a lot of
people like myself who--

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:20.080
you know, you have to check a
box of whether you're white,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.629
black, or Asian or other.

00:55:21.629 --> 00:55:23.670
And then you have a lot
of people that, you know,

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.930
are like me and will
probably pick white.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:29.980
Because it's-- and I
think we need to give--

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.580
start moving in a
direction of having ways

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.850
that people can identify
themselves more accurately.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:41.560
And not just more
accurately, but in a way that

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.690
is honest with how
they should feel

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.000
versus having to conform
one way or the other.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.010
So I think this is a larger
to be continued discussion.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:53.200
I'm just personally
excited about the fact

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.340
that we are talking about it.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.410
I would hope that
even Hispanic media

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.439
outlets continue to embrace it.

00:56:01.439 --> 00:56:02.230
I still don't see--

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:05.350
I see magazines that
represent Latinas,

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:07.480
and it's still
not really showing

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:13.870
the true diversity of race
within our own community.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.060
You know, I think we're
in this point where

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.310
it's being redefined.

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.920
It's being-- it's not--

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.050
we're remixing the way--

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.980
I think we're breaking
the stereotypes every day.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.060
So I think the great thing
about it is that it's being,

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.930
actually--

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.140
I think this is coming
out of our youth, right?

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.071
Pr coming out of the youth
wanting to understand.

00:56:37.071 --> 00:56:37.570
Right?

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:39.190
I think they-- we have failed.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.050
I think, in a way,
society has kind of

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.840
failed to give them a way to
embrace their own identity.

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.970
And now they're taking it--

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.490
you know, they're taking that--

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:50.772
you know, they're
taking leadership.

00:56:50.772 --> 00:56:52.480
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you so much.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.860
We're about to--

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.490
I'm going to prep
the group here.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.230
We're about to go
into live questions.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:03.510
But before we do that, I want
to honor the HOLA community who

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:05.260
is here today.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.866
HOLA is our employee
resource group

00:57:08.866 --> 00:57:11.120
that is focused on
the Latino community,

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.910
both internally within
Google and externally.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.150
And they do a lot
of amazing work--

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:21.530
volunteering, and tutoring,
and a host of other projects

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.030
locally here within LA.

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:25.340
And I'd love to go
quickly, before we

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.500
move into live questions.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.080
So you can start lining
up for the live questions.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.940
If you have any recommendations
to the HOLA community on what

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.280
they could do here
in the LA community,

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:39.020
or for the broader LA
community, to support our Latino

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.500
community.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.500
AMERICA FERRERA: Well, I
think, in general, it's

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:46.610
really about letting people know
that there is space for them

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.710
inside of your community.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:52.770
And I feel so
indebted to Remezcla

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.010
and other organizations,
group media

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:59.030
outlets like it, inviting
certain people who'd

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:02.390
never seen a space for them
inside of a certain community

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:05.210
to get to be a part
of it and claim it.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:08.620
And, you know, you guys
are in the tech industry.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.490
You're in a huge company.

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:17.780
And to just, as you are,
setting examples for people who

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.840
can reach this level of
being in the tech world,

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.690
but also reaching
out to the community

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.740
around these neighborhoods
that may never

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.750
ever see a space for themselves
inside of a place like Google.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:35.540
I think that that really,
really makes a difference,

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.820
and it matters.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:37.904
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: JC?

00:58:37.904 --> 00:58:40.153
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: Well,
I got to meet Hector today.

00:58:40.153 --> 00:58:41.990
And I think Hector
does a great job.

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.650
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Yes, he does.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.420
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I got
to meet the rest of the team.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.460
I think it's great.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:50.600
And I didn't know that there
were that many Hispanics

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.931
involved in this field.

00:58:52.931 --> 00:58:54.680
So it's really interesting
to see the work

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.330
that you're doing to get
out there and get people

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:57.787
to know that, not
only you exist,

00:58:57.787 --> 00:58:59.120
but that they can be part of it.

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.834
I think that the media has
to do a much better job

00:59:01.834 --> 00:59:03.500
in putting this out
there and showing us

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.512
as computer engineers and people
involved in the tech field,

00:59:06.512 --> 00:59:07.220
as you mentioned.

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.720
I never get to see us--

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.740
as you mentioned, I want
to see us everywhere.

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:10.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.070
AMERICA FERRERA:
Tell more stories.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.040
Tell me of our stories.

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.831
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
This is very exciting.

00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:16.370
So good to see you
and your group,

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.790
and you're doing
a really good job

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:21.314
by just even helping
organize these discussions.

00:59:21.314 --> 00:59:23.480
ANDREW HERRERA: You know,
thank you for inviting me.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.510
I think this is a
great discussion.

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:28.010
It's a complicated
discussion, but I

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.740
think complicated
discussions are positive.

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.220
I think one thing that
I would encourage--

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.780
you know, whether it be HOLA or
other Googlers-- is to really--

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.960
I think it's great to unite.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.420
But we also need to figure
out how to be inclusive

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.250
around that discussion, right?

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.840
You know, I think that's
my fear with creating

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.000
an "us and them"
kind of discussion,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.150
is that I don't think it
allows to be inclusive.

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:59.234
You know you, for example,
in the women's march,

00:59:59.234 --> 01:00:00.650
there were thousands
and thousands

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:05.210
of men that wanted to
support that movement.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:08.780
And I think there
are non-Latinos

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.420
that want to also support,
I think, our community.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.400
And I think we just need to kind
of create ways for other people

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.220
to really support
this community.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.980
So I think-- you know,
I think that would be--

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.419
I hope what organizations
start to do.

01:00:24.419 --> 01:00:26.210
Because this has been
something-- you know,

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.460
diversity initiatives
have been going on

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.540
for a really long time.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.500
But I think it needs to go
beyond the cafeteria having

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.850
Mexican food for Hispanic day.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:38.870
I think it needs to be--

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.550
And this is what I still see
at major, major corporations.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.920
And we need to do
the 2.0 of that.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.440
And I think it has to be a
little bit more inclusive.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.580
And I think people want-- and
I think we are living in an age

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:57.560
where there is this more
cultural fluency of people

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.480
that don't want to be-- that
are already embracing it

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:02.990
themselves.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:05.573
And, you know, I think as long
as we continue to be inclusive,

01:01:05.573 --> 01:01:07.412
I think that's the
right direction.

01:01:07.412 --> 01:01:08.220
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:08.540
RHONDA GONZALEZ: OK.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.956
I want to just say, I don't
know what Google already does.

01:01:10.956 --> 01:01:14.080
So this may be a
recommendation that you all

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:14.990
already take care of.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:21.470
But in terms of demystifying
the Google entity,

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.320
I think definitely
bringing children here

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.690
to campus on the regular.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:28.160
Like you can't do that enough.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.640
Because just them
having been to visit

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.220
lets them imagine, you know,
when they see your Chrome

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.140
platform, that they
are within that wall,

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.910
I guess, so to speak.

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.960
And so I think just creating
those opportunities for them

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.980
to visit.

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:48.110
And secondly, I would say
within the institution is that--

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.500
really pay attention to
not just your practices,

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.260
but your policies
that you all establish

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.670
within your institution.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:59.480
And that takes a
lot of vigilance

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.510
and a lot of attentiveness
to speaking out in the room.

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:09.680
And whether you're of an
identified group or an ally--

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.710
to use the word that
we now use so often--

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.450
to really speak up if
no one's there to speak,

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:17.270
and also to amplify
the voices in the room.

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:20.090
Because that's probably one
of the hardest things to do,

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:23.630
is to be the token in the
room and then have everybody

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:26.660
sit around like crickets
after you've made a point.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.320
So if there's any inclination
to agree or appreciate

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.812
a perspective, please use your
voice to back that person up.

01:02:33.812 --> 01:02:35.520
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you so much.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you all so much.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.570
I actually wrote my question,
because I'm a little bit

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:44.960
nervous asking this.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.480
So my name is Olga Garcia.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.790
And, again, thank you
guys for being here.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:54.026
So as a proud Latina,
Colombiana, HOLA Googler,

01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:59.480
you know, your
voice really impacts

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.050
how our Googlers function.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.190
So thank you.

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:05.640
And as an internal
advocacy group,

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.750
so HOLA, the thing that
we grapple with the most

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.840
is, how do we make sure that
our leadership understands

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.920
the urgency and advocates
for our Googlers

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.230
within our community at
Google as well as externally?

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:25.470
And so what advice do
you have for us, at HOLA,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.270
to talk to our leaders?

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.220
To support our
Googlers, whether it's

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:33.060
taking a stance on immigration,
whether it's building products

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.890
for our community,
both internally

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:38.880
and externally to Google, or
having more leaders like Daisy,

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.230
at the senior level,
representing and giving us

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.950
an example that we can
aspire to be like Daisy?

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:53.230
ANDREW HERRERA: That's
an interesting question.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.960
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
You've stomped the panel.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.370
RHONDA GONZALEZ: I guess--

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.530
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: All
I heard was [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.550
RHONDA GONZALEZ: Well,
I feel like it picked up

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:02.758
a little bit maybe on the
point I was trying to make.

01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:06.670
Earlier But, for me, the
bottom line is persistence.

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:09.850
Refuse to forget an idea.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:12.610
You know, if you have a
good idea, stick with it.

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:15.850
Talk to people until people are
just tired of hearing about it.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.720
Right?

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.620
Because I think that whatever's
in you and whatever HOLA,

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.301
your vision is, that I'm
sure it's worthwhile, right?

01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.300
So you want to continue.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.390
It may take 10 years.

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:30.010
10 years to push to a
point where you actually

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:30.885
see something happen.

01:04:30.885 --> 01:04:32.843
And I think one of the
things we're not used to

01:04:32.843 --> 01:04:34.510
is that delayed
gratification, right?

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:36.994
We want instant, click
a button, it happens.

01:04:36.994 --> 01:04:38.410
And I think that
this is where you

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:41.050
know the realness
of humanity comes

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:45.190
in is that it takes a lot of
time to steer the barge, right?

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.141
To really get it in a direction.

01:04:47.141 --> 01:04:47.890
But don't give up.

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:52.180
Because, you know, what happens
is that once you get there,

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.650
it starts to snowball.

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:56.860
And so that 50 years from now,
100 years from now, the legacy

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.700
is that there is so much
representation in Google.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.130
So you may not even
see it-- sorry to say--

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:04.840
in your lifetimes, right?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.120
But you know that
you're leaving--

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.625
opening up that space
for a legacy to evolve.

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.500
AMERICA FERRERA: I would
love to add to that.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.270
We have these conversations
all the time as content makers

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:19.150
in Hollywood, this conversation
about diversity, diversity.

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.920
What's the answer?

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.270
And, you know, I think
on a very personal level,

01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:24.640
how we approach the
conversation really matters.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.210
And I think removing shame and
blame from the conversation

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:30.280
is a really, really
important piece of it.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.540
Because if we can remove
the personal blame of,

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:38.540
there aren't Latinos here
because you don't care,

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.210
then we can remove the defenses.

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:44.650
And we can all sort of
ask ourselves, how do I--

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:48.570
how am I contributing
to the way things are?

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.500
And I'm not-- we
all think, you know,

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.100
if there's a bunch of bad evil
people trying to keep diversity

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.650
from happening, well,
I'm not that evil person,

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.160
so I'm not the problem.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.240
But if we remove
that myth, that it--

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.910
you know, that it's bad
because people are bad--

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.710
then we can start
having the conversation

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.510
that we all have a role to play.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:12.370
And approaching the
conversation with allies,

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:17.760
from a place of
finding solutions,

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.610
and a place of positivity,
and a place of excitement

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.500
and what we all have to gain.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:30.127
And I would say, removing
the stigma and the shame of,

01:06:30.127 --> 01:06:31.710
there's something
wrong and it's wrong

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:34.120
because you're not doing it.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.470
It may open the conversation
up for more engagement

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.185
from many people.

01:06:40.185 --> 01:06:41.560
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.572
Thank you so much.

01:06:42.572 --> 01:06:43.697
RHONDA GONZALEZ: Thank you.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.410
AUDIENCE: Thank
you guys so much.

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:50.200
So my question is
around-- and I really

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.580
appreciate the
honesty with which

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.250
you shared some of the
anti-blackness that exists

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.510
within Hispanic communities.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.593
Because I feel like this
is something that we know

01:06:57.593 --> 01:06:59.170
is kind of consistent
and pervasive

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.170
across communities-- white
communities, Asian communities,

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.720
even within black
communities there's colorism.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.030
So I guess one question
that I have is,

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.640
what organizations,
or what work do

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.310
you feel like is being
done with young Hispanics

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.370
and young Latinos to combat
that so that we don't take it

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:16.240
forward?

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.370
And then what
promise really lies

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:21.220
in true ally-ship between
black and brown communities

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.370
in the US, and how
do we get there?

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.440
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
That's a great question.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.700
You know, I'm a teacher.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.170
I started in the public
schools, not too far

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.711
from where you're
from, in the Bronx?

01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:31.420
AUDIENCE: Yep.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.035
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
Truman High School?

01:07:32.035 --> 01:07:32.868
AUDIENCE: Shout out.

01:07:32.868 --> 01:07:34.250
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: Shout out.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:37.660
And I think there's no better
organization than a school

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.010
to start that difference.

01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:39.610
I really do.

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:40.744
In my heart, I feel it.

01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:42.910
I know that there's no
better place than a classroom

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.236
to have a teacher that
understands the topic.

01:07:45.236 --> 01:07:46.610
That understands
the differences,

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.400
that understands
the issue, and is

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.980
able to facilitate a discussion
and change hearts and minds

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.269
and bring people together.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.560
So you mentioned organizations.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.964
I'm thinking Truman High School.

01:07:54.964 --> 01:07:57.130
I'm thinking Borough of
Manhattan Community College.

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.740
I'm thinking PS85
on Valentine Avenue.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.350
These are all areas where
incredible things can happen

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:04.930
if the teacher is well equipped
to be able to facilitate

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.130
that kind of discussion.

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:12.170
I'm hopeful that you're going
to see-- because of Andres

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.175
And the good work he's
doing at Remezcla,

01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:15.550
you're going to
see more and more

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.091
people feel comfortable having
the discussion about blackness

01:08:18.091 --> 01:08:21.582
in our communities and the
commonalities that exist.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:23.290
So I'm really excited
to see that happen.

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:24.790
RHONDA GONZALEZ: I just wanted
to add a little bit that

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.640
may be a little bit surprising,
but there's actually

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.330
been a lot of work on this
kind of topic among scholars.

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.580
In some ways, maybe there is--

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.039
we're a little bit
behind the times

01:08:36.039 --> 01:08:38.121
when it comes to the
scholarship that's out there.

01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:40.000
And I think part of
why we don't really

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.560
know about a lot of the
allyships that have gone on

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.520
across US history is that
much of that scholarship

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.359
isn't in the foreground of
traditional departments.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:54.819
And so this is
why, for people who

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:59.439
are in the conversation about
de-funding Chicano studies,

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.740
or de-funding Latino studies,
or African American studies,

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.720
Pan-African studies,
Asian studies, LGBTQ

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.649
and queer studies,
I mean, this is

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:11.359
where that breaking-- that
scholarship has resided.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.100
And so there are a
number of scholars.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.733
I can give names later.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:16.149
But there is
scholarship out there

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:18.670
that has talked about
precedent for these allies.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.660
And I think that--

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.101
these alliances, rather.

01:09:21.101 --> 01:09:23.350
But I do think that right
now, because of the shifting

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:26.109
demographics of the nation that
they're-- it's all the more

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:30.160
critical that
Latinos especially,

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.670
or Latinx's, especially, create
a very conscientious outreach

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:41.600
to our brothers and sisters
who may be excluded,

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.359
or may be without any
intentionality toward it from

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:47.790
a national shifting
conversation.

01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:49.290
AMERICA FERRERA: I
would love to add

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:51.870
to that I think leadership
really matters as well.

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:56.550
I think convening people
who are already established,

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:58.650
trusted voices in
their community

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:02.460
to exemplify and model
building those bridges.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.510
My husband and I started
sort of a convening and--

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:11.070
not "sort of"-- a convening
of influencers and people

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.910
in organizations.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.550
And what we try to do
in those conversations

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:17.370
is draw what aligns us.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.510
You know, bring that out.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:21.360
And to hear someone from--

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.310
a co-founder of
Black Lives Matter

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:28.770
say that DACA students showed
up for Black Lives Matter.

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:31.740
And so Black Lives Matter,
they show up for DACA.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.500
Or DACA and Black Lives Matter.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.560
We're on the front
lines at Standing Rock,

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.830
with the Native American
youth leadership.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:43.950
Leadership really matters and
exemplifying, especially today,

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.290
that we see our
struggles inside of one

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.570
another's struggles
I think really

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.760
makes a difference and
matters, especially when

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.430
you talk about setting
an example for our youth,

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:55.290
and our young people,
and whether or not

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.796
they can see themselves in
each other's experiences.

01:10:59.796 --> 01:11:01.170
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.647
I'm going to move over
to the Dory for a bit.

01:11:03.647 --> 01:11:05.230
We have we have quite
a few questions,

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:08.350
so I'll do the first two
and then move live here.

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:10.890
The first one is from Marrissa.

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:13.110
Using Crenshaw's theory
of intersectionality,

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.720
we place excluded
groups at the center

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.340
of analysis, which helps us
see that hierarchies are not

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.110
absolute, but relative.

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.540
How do we recognize the
matrix-like interaction

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.960
of race, gender, social
class and upward mobility

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.552
within the Latinx community?

01:11:31.552 --> 01:11:32.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.030
These are light questions.

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.863
RHONDA GONZALEZ: OK.

01:11:34.863 --> 01:11:37.560
From the professor, I'm going
to say read a lot, right?

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.310
Read.

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:39.030
Read.

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:40.980
Read deeply.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.730
Read deeply instead
of just broadly.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.350
You know, really read deeply.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.062
But I also think that this
gets to the kind of climate

01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:51.270
that I think really pervades
our nation, as it's kind

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.470
of an anti-intellectualism.

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:55.770
And I think that embracing
the idea of intellectualism

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:59.040
means that, of course we
deal with these complicated

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.132
intersections.

01:12:00.132 --> 01:12:01.590
That not only do
we deal with them,

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:03.930
but we actually
should thrive on them.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.400
I often tell my
students, because I

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.740
teach African history,
that, in this classroom,

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.340
we embody a Nigerian
cafe environment.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.440
So, you know, if you were
to walk into a coffee

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.890
shop in Nigeria, people are
engaged in a really vigorous

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.260
discussion and
debate, but really

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.350
for not so much winning
a debate, right?

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:25.740
But for the collective
understanding and the growth

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:26.970
that comes out of debates.

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:28.657
So I really think
that that's one way.

01:12:28.657 --> 01:12:30.240
AMERICA FERRERA: An
idea came to mind.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.820
You know, I heard earlier
that, within Google, you

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.500
have all these groups.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.780
You have HOLA, you
have the black network.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.960
And that's an opportunity
inside of Google for you all

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.870
to start building bridges,
and finding intersectionality,

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.750
and showing up for one
another's conversations,

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:51.445
and modeling how we begin
to find what aligns us.

01:12:51.445 --> 01:12:52.820
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.820
ANDREW HERRERA: Yeah, I
was just going to add--

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.890
I mean, that's a great segue.

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:58.470
I mean, one of our
most successful pieces

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:02.270
was on how Filipinos
are our cousins,

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:03.300
are our Latino cousins.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.740
And actually, it went viral.

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.830
And those are the types
of things where, you know,

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:12.210
what aligns us is actually what
is able to create a stronger

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:12.840
message.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.920
So, and, you know, I think
I would continue down

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.170
that road of--

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:22.740
I think there's a lot of
youth that are trying to,

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.260
whether it be on
political issues,

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.830
to kind of depoliticize
the conversation.

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.020
It's happening in music.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.400
It's happening in people
creating great content, where

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.790
people are collaborating and
adding their own nuance to it.

01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:40.920
And so I think, in terms of--

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.980
at Google, I think
you could also--

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.630
I wanted to enter on
the last question.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.550
I think you guys
should definitely

01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:48.600
feel entrepreneurial.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.330
Don't wait for the
organization to change.

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.430
Be part of the change.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:57.200
And whether that be within
an official Google--

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:02.430
you know, Google organization,
you can do that on your own

01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:03.980
and be entrepreneurial
with that.

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.760
And, you know, I think--

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.420
we're a culture that's
pretty scrappy in terms

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:13.110
of how we evolve and how
we achieve great things.

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:17.200
I think taking that into--

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.600
as a way to create
change, I think,

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.960
was something I would recommend.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.420
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.060
Googlers, get scrappy.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.080
All right?

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.590
Selena, from Austin, asks,
how do we support each other

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.890
within the Latinx community and
across the various backgrounds

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:33.420
that make up Latinx
in a way that

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:36.390
allows us to break down the
pre-established structures

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.418
of discrimination?

01:14:41.154 --> 01:14:42.820
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
I don't understand.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:45.670
The question regarding
discrimination in the United

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.679
States, and how it's--

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:48.220
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Across-- yeah,

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.200
how do we support each
other within the community,

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.700
and across our
various backgrounds--

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.179
intersectionalities, I'm
going to understand--

01:14:54.179 --> 01:14:56.470
that allows us to break down
pre-established structures

01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:57.714
of discrimination?

01:14:57.714 --> 01:15:00.130
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: Well, I
think there's a lot going on.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:00.610
I do.

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:01.780
I think there are
a lot of movements.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.160
I think that the
election of-- and I

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.118
know that there are lot
of people that disagree

01:15:05.118 --> 01:15:06.457
with me, especially on my side.

01:15:06.457 --> 01:15:08.290
I think that the election
of President Obama

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:12.070
did a lot to tear down some
of those walls of things

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.614
that we thought were
impossible, of groups

01:15:14.614 --> 01:15:16.780
of people that we thought
would never come together.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.940
I think that a lot
has already happened.

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.230
A lot has been written.

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:21.700
A lot has been discussed.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.560
And I think we can
learn from that.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.690
And I think we
can say, you know,

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:30.320
this election of President
Obama has created an environment

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.010
where a lot of the
vestiges of discrimination

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:34.420
may be breaking down.

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.350
So I know he's not
in office anymore,

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:39.246
and I know a lot of my friends
are very sad about that.

01:15:39.246 --> 01:15:40.870
But I think it's an
opportunity for you

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.536
to see, what is the vestige of--
what is the legacy of President

01:15:43.536 --> 01:15:44.140
Obama?

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.820
And I'm asking you
as a Republican.

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.910
What is the legacy behind--

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.120
is it just Obamacare?

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.500
I think there's more.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.210
I think that the
legacy has to be

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:55.600
how many of these walls
that we had before

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.090
may not be perfectly torn down.

01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:59.110
There may be some
bricks up there still.

01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:00.910
But a lot of them
have come down.

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.850
And I think that the person
that asked the question

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:07.390
has to just realize that
we are in a new age.

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:09.700
And there is discrimination,
but not even close

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.670
to how it used to be.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:11.930
I think

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:15.310
AMERICA FERRERA: I think on
a very, very basic level,

01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:18.160
it's that you have to do
something for someone else,

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.120
wherever you are.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.430
If you've reached a position
of influence or power

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:24.059
or privilege, even if that means
you've found a way to graduate

01:16:24.059 --> 01:16:26.350
high school, in a community
where people don't know how

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.590
to graduate high school,
or can't get through it,

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:32.980
turn around and figure out
a way to open that door

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:36.910
or remove a barrier for someone
else to come in behind you.

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:40.930
I know my career would
not have been possible

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.750
five years before it began.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.910
You know, I came
around and I had--

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:50.350
it was a perfect confluence
of a million things

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.870
that allowed me to get to step
in and take that opportunity.

01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:55.078
That doesn't mean there
weren't hundreds or thousands

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.310
of other people who could
have just as easily taken

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:58.510
that opportunity.

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:02.020
And now I have access because
other people created access

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:02.860
for me.

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:06.730
And so wherever we are, in
whatever industry we work in,

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:10.000
whatever privileges we've
had in our lives, especially

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.640
people who work
at Google, we have

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.547
to understand that
we are the ones that

01:17:16.547 --> 01:17:18.130
are going to be able
to open that door

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:19.480
for that next generation.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.855
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:17:20.855 --> 01:17:21.355
Yes.

01:17:21.355 --> 01:17:23.280
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:25.129 --> 01:17:26.670
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Live question.

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:28.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:32.220
So I've noticed, at least in
the kind of white culture,

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.910
if there's an indigenous
person from Mexico in the US,

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:38.370
they're a Latino, Latinx.

01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:41.340
If they're an indigenous
person from America,

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:42.600
they're a Native American.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.558
And they're not Latino.

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:47.760
Why does Native American
seem to be this kind

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.850
of different group from Latino?

01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:52.620
Do you agree with that?

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.700
I mean, I don't--

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.600
as I said, that's kind
of the stereotype.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.066
But do you see Native
Americans as part of Latino?

01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:00.316
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I am a
firm believer that you can

01:18:00.316 --> 01:18:02.317
be many things and be Latino.

01:18:02.317 --> 01:18:04.650
And I think that when you
think about Native Americans--

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:06.150
and I have this
discussion in my class.

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.733
When you think about the Native
American nations that existed,

01:18:08.733 --> 01:18:12.270
and how so many of
them are located

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:14.460
in what we call the
United States today,

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.920
at one point were part
of the Spanish conquest,

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.550
those people today are Latinos,
and they are Native American.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:21.880
And you can be both.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.920
I don't think it's
one or the other.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.060
I think that it's time that we
as Latin Americans or Americans

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.844
of Latino descent understand
that there are millions

01:18:29.844 --> 01:18:31.260
of our people in
the United States

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.240
that are in fact
Native Americans.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.560
They may speak Spanish
and have Spanish surnames,

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.940
and share in our
Latino identity,

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.150
but I think both of
them are coexistent.

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:39.600
AMERICA FERRERA:
You know, I think

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.641
this goes back to sort of
one of the first things

01:18:41.641 --> 01:18:44.610
we were talking about, like
identification, and labels,

01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:45.480
and why they matter.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.700
And, you know, the
truth is, as a Latina,

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.690
I never thought to think of
myself as an indigenous person.

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:54.930
And I've actually
heard of conversations

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:59.040
amongst Native American thought
leaders about this concept

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.440
of indigenousness and how Latino
Americans have been completely

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.190
ripped from their indigenousness
and don't claim that

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:12.330
and don't identify
themselves, and how powerful

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:16.380
would that be if we could
find a way to merge, you know,

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:21.030
our efforts and see ourselves
in our Native American brothers

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:27.210
and sisters, as related
through our indigenousness?

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:31.260
And I think there's an
incredibly powerful thought

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:35.070
in there, that I've only
recently begun to even

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:43.710
hear be verbalized outside of
academic or scholarly worlds,

01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:46.260
where I'm sure it probably
has been discussed.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.470
ANDREW HERRERA: I mean, there
are indigenous communities

01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:51.990
that I would say, in Latin
America and South America,

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:54.950
that wouldn't identify
themselves as Latinos.

01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:56.700
So I think that's one--
you know, actually

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:01.790
to be accurate about kind
of that that labeling again.

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:05.040
So I think we need to
understand that piece.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.870
You know, obviously,
from my skin color,

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.470
there is an
indigenous side of me.

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.394
But there are communities
that still don't.

01:20:12.394 --> 01:20:14.310
So I think we need to
be conscious of the fact

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:17.670
that I think there's that same
issue that Native Americans

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:21.810
have that also exist in Latin
America, where they actually

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:22.890
don't even speak Spanish.

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:28.380
So they've actually continued
to live out their independence.

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.970
In Ecuador and Peru,
they speak Quechua.

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:34.977
And that's a language that is
not at all tied to Spanish.

01:20:34.977 --> 01:20:36.060
RHONDA GONZALEZ: I think--

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.920
the small comment
I'll make I think

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.740
is about the politics
of indigeneity

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.685
and the claims of it is tied
to the nation, and the nation's

01:20:43.685 --> 01:20:44.310
history, right?

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:48.960
So in our context
here in North America,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.750
the idea of indigeneity
and indigenous populations,

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:56.370
Native Americans, I mean, this
is their land that was taken,

01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:57.330
given back.

01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:00.580
Now they're, for all
intents and purposes,

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:05.280
in an apartheid structure in
the state, in this country.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.630
But I also think the politics
of being Latina or Latino,

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:13.200
and within that
context, has created--

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.030
part of what we're
really talking about

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:18.120
is that many Latinos
feel like they

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.700
live in this sort
of liminal space,

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.790
or the interstitial spaces,
if you get into theory

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:25.440
about what that means.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.380
And that is neither being
of here or there, right?

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.970
So you're kind of
like without a nation.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:34.770
And so I think part of this
complexity and nuance--

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:38.460
because we are everywhere,
and yet this is not ours.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.410
And especially when
we have leadership

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:44.190
at the political level, speaking
as if we don't belong here,

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:48.150
even though, for many of
us, our roots go very deep.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:51.404
So I think there's-- it's a
really complicated answer,

01:21:51.404 --> 01:21:53.820
but I do think it's tied up
in the politics of the history

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.345
of this nation in particular.

01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:56.720
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.930
Yes, please.

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.530
AUDIENCE: So in the
political events

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:02.160
that have been happening in
the US and many countries

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.294
in Europe, if there is a
political philosophy that

01:22:06.294 --> 01:22:08.460
is articulated, to the
extent that it's articulated,

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.150
it's that strong nations
have to be homogeneous.

01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:13.530
That there has to be--

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:18.740
which, de facto, means a white,
you know, European culture.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.514
And so you have to strip
any part-- to be successful,

01:22:21.514 --> 01:22:22.930
to be a part of
that society-- you

01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:25.080
have to strip anything
that doesn't fit in that.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.360
How do we best counter
that narrative?

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.850
How do we advance
a narrative where

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.580
a pluralistic diverse society,
where there is no majority,

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.987
is not threatening and is a
positive feature-- future.

01:22:35.987 --> 01:22:37.070
How do we articulate that?

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:39.340
How do we counter
that narrative?

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.090
RHONDA GONZALEZ: I would ask for
the evidence of that statement.

01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:44.090
AUDIENCE: Which, what--

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:46.256
RHONDA GONZALEZ: What's the
evidence that they would

01:22:46.256 --> 01:22:47.780
use to support that position?

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.358
I can say anything, but
what's your evidence?

01:22:51.358 --> 01:22:51.982
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:51.982 --> 01:22:53.964

evidence, at this--

AMERICA FERRERA:
I mean, what comes

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:02.351
to mind for me is,
in my conversations

01:23:02.351 --> 01:23:04.850
with my friends involved in the
Black Lives Matter movement,

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:08.510
is that they are doing
just that and also facing

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:11.424
a lot of backlash for it.

01:23:11.424 --> 01:23:13.340
You know, they talk a
lot about their movement

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:15.006
in relation to the
civil rights movement

01:23:15.006 --> 01:23:16.730
and how a big part
of the civil rights

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:21.680
movement for black people was
to kind of dress a certain way,

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.420
and look a certain way,
and talk a certain way,

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:27.480
so that there would be
success for the movement.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.840
And my understanding is
that Black Lives Matter

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.610
wants to bring exactly
who they are and not

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:38.870
have to strip away their culture
to be successful as a movement

01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:40.310
inside of America.

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:42.860
But it's created a
lot of controversy.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.060
And so, you know, identifying
where that conversation is

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.010
happening and where
people are actually

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:53.990
daring to step out and
model that, I think

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.620
we need to turn
our focus to that,

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:59.076
and pay attention, and
support and amplify.

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:00.950
JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: I
wanted to add to that.

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.017

JUAN CARLOS POLANCO: Tom.

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:04.870
I think your
question deals with--

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:07.620
and I don't know if Google's a
political environment or not.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.500
But I think we're
tiptoeing around--

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.090
tell me what you
really want to say.

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:12.740
Ask the question
that you're feeling.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.615
Because I feel like
you're dancing around it,

01:24:14.615 --> 01:24:16.700
and we're limited in the
answer that we may have.

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.500
Is your concern the
election of Donald Trump?

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.220
Is that what it is?

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.720
Is creating an
environment where you

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.970
think that you have to
have a homogeneous country?

01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:24.916
Is that what you're getting at?

it's just Donald Trump.

behind closing the walls.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:34.880

the brown population,

JUAN CARLOS POLANCO:
It's interesting.

01:24:51.064 --> 01:24:52.460
I come from a world of politics.

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.150
I don't come from
the tech world.

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.490
So this is my life.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.600
This is what I deal with.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:01.280
And as someone intimately
involved in the party that won,

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.870
I know firsthand
the conversations

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:04.080
that are happening.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.040
And I have to push
back just a little bit.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.290
Not everyone that supports the
idea of having a wall, that

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:12.560
supports the idea of
having legal immigration,

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.530
or deporting some very,
very terrible people,

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:20.200
subscribes to the idea that
we have to be homogeneous.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.950
And I think that there
are a lot of people

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:27.180
that actually want to see a
more nationalist approach.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.942
That are in fact not
even close to what

01:25:28.942 --> 01:25:30.150
you may be thinking they are.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.537
And they feel as if they've been
created into a class of bigots.

01:25:33.537 --> 01:25:35.120
I know them, because
I work with them.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.744
I know them because
they're my friends.

01:25:36.744 --> 01:25:40.460
I know them because they
voted for Obama in 2008.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.447
And they voted for
him again in 2012.

01:25:42.447 --> 01:25:44.030
And they don't exactly
see the country

01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:45.685
as having to be
homogeneous, they just

01:25:45.685 --> 01:25:47.810
view that their country
should be a country of laws

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.340
where the laws are respected.

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.820
And this issue of immigration
is such a delicate one.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.410
Because yes, in
fact, you can respect

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:55.670
undocumented immigrants.

01:25:55.670 --> 01:25:58.220
You can say that the
overwhelming majority of them

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.485
are wonderful human beings.

01:25:59.485 --> 01:26:01.610
And you can never speak
about them the way you did,

01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:02.660
Mr. Trump.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:05.450
But at the same time say,
we are a nation of laws.

01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:08.090
And there is a problem with
undocumented immigration

01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:09.080
in some places.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.970
And then you can have
that honest discussion

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:13.910
without feeling as if the
country must look the same way.

01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.280
And too many people, I
think, feel as if they've

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.560
been put in a class of bigots.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.446
And they're very,
very upset about it.

01:26:20.446 --> 01:26:23.070
I speak to them, and I think we
have to change the conversation

01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:24.350
and change the tone, I think.

01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:26.570
I know I'm in the minority
of people when I say that.

01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:28.605
Because if not,
there can't be unity

01:26:28.605 --> 01:26:30.980
when you have a group of people
that have been castigated

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.349
as bigots when they're not.

01:26:32.349 --> 01:26:33.890
And I'm very concerned
about the idea

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.110
of having a homogeneous
society when that's not

01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:39.390
in fact what so many people
that supported the Trump agenda,

01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:41.450
if you will, were behind.

AUDIENCE: If I can
respond to that.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.080
So if I heard conversations
about immigration

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.970
that were more in
that reasonable tone,

01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:51.590
then I would find
it easier to believe

01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.490
that that's the motivation.

But it always-- and
not just in the US,

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:59.630
it's in other countries-- it's
always associated with fear

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:01.910
mongering, and putting
down certain groups,

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:04.020

dangerous and so on.

ANDREW HERRERA: Oh, no.

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.878
I was going to say, you know,
when you don't have evidence,

01:27:25.878 --> 01:27:26.570
you use fear.

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:28.790
And I think that's what's
been happening-- you know,

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.700
whether it be in Brexit or
whether it be here I think,

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.830
you know, there's this
fear of immigrants,

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:38.140
or fear of Syrians or
fear of these things.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.447
And they're instilling fear
with people that, you know,

01:27:40.447 --> 01:27:42.030
aren't really asking
for the evidence.

01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:44.460
And I think,
unfortunately, the only way

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.800
to fight that is to protest.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.770
Is to fight--

01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:50.400

about when they go high--

when they go low, we go high.

go with really fighting

louder and a more aggressive

01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:00.900
way.

seen the amount of voices

streets in my entire life.

that we're doing it,

look at some of the countries

have to turn on the TV and see

what happens in Nice and
see what happens in Paris,

because of the porous borders

you're going to have people

are creating havoc and creating

ANDREW HERRERA: When we're
talking about evidence

01:28:49.419 --> 01:28:51.330
it's, the people that
are voting on this

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.910
are people that don't know
immigrants, that have never--

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:56.370
that don't know a
Syrian, that don't have

01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:58.140
this issue in their own homes.

01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:01.680
And the people that are voting
against what this presidency is

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.030
about are people that live
within this community.

01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:08.430
So I think when it goes
back to, if we do live

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.650
in a true democracy,
let's not instill fear

01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:14.820
with the people that actually
don't actually live--

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.520
aren't actually having to--

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.627
you know, have to
deal with these issues

01:29:20.627 --> 01:29:21.710
that we have to deal with.

01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:24.210
And, I would say,
in New York, it's

01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:26.250
a very different
environment than if I

01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:28.840
were in rural America.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.140
But that's why we're instilling
fear over immigration.

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:33.910
That's why we're instilling
fear over terrorism.

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.160
You know, I don't think that--

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.530
I think that's not necessarily
a straight forward conversation

And my team advises all of
the employee resource groups

01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:01.720
like HOLA and BGN and others.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.330
And one of the things
that-- and I've

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:05.180
worked at other
institutions, as well.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.540
But one of the things that--

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:09.000
they all do wonderful,
really great work.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.300
And I think HOLA is doing a
really, really amazing job,

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.670
as all the other employee
resource groups are.

01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:15.780
But what I've noticed--

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.240
and something that resonated
with me not too long ago--

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.330
is that they were working
on some of their stances

01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:24.090
on really wanting Google to
take a stance on immigration,

01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:26.100
and that voice, and all of this.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.960
But one of the
things that they said

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:33.120
is, our voice isn't as loud
as the Black Lives Matter.

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.010
And one of those
things is, I've noticed

01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:37.200
that a lot of the
black communities,

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.590
and the black movement, has a
really loud, amplified voice.

01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:42.930
And there is a lot of really
great work of the Latinos

01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.580
here within Google
doing work, but how

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.440
do we amplify that voice?

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.599
And it's not just here.

01:30:47.599 --> 01:30:49.140
Sometimes we see it
externally, where

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.090
you might see so
much more coverage

01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:52.620
on the black movements.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:55.200
Or it's just much
louder and amplified.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.820
And that might just
be a perception,

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.660
but perception is reality.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.531
So how do we empower--

01:31:00.531 --> 01:31:02.280
and sometimes it might
be cultural, right?

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.794
We try not to create
a lot of waves,

01:31:04.794 --> 01:31:06.210
or ruffle too many
feathers, or we

01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:09.150
try to be much more
collaborative about it, where

01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:13.180
some communities just do
it and apologize later.

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:15.990
How do we get our
Latinos to really

01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:19.080
kind of take that stance,
and just amplify that voice,

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.312
and not be worried about
the backlash, like you said,

01:31:22.312 --> 01:31:24.020
where they kind of
just take that stance?

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.340
So I'm just trying
to grapple with,

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.730
how do we get our Latino group,
the HOLA, to kind of really

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.760
amplify that voice the
way that their other peers

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.222
and colleagues are doing?

01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:39.080
RHONDA GONZALEZ: That's a
really beautiful question,

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:39.860
I have to say.

01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:44.360
It's a really, really important
one, and I love those pants,

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.586
and I'm taking them from her.

01:31:45.586 --> 01:31:46.460
No, I'm just kidding.

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.690
They're great.

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:49.537
So--

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:52.120
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ: In Latino
culture, you say [INAUDIBLE].

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.203
Which means that, anytime
you want to borrow them.

01:31:54.203 --> 01:31:56.720
RHONDA GONZALEZ: OK, OK.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.970
But I think part
of that question

01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:03.650
about being emboldened, and
maybe being a little bit

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:06.350
careful, and trepidatious
is anchored in the fact

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:08.060
that, in some ways,
we have privilege.

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.656
In some ways, we
are not of here.

01:32:09.656 --> 01:32:11.280
Because we talk about
that [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.240
So it's like a very
precarious kind of history

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.430
that we all, I think--

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:19.580
at least when we reach a
certain level of consciousness

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.790
or understanding, that
if we're too loud,

01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:26.290
there might be backlash
against undocumented friends,

01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:27.360
their communities.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.870
Or maybe people
will talk about how,

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:31.400
you're not from here anyway.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.590
I mean, even though
we may be of here.

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:38.860
But I also-- and then, with
black history, for all of its--

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:41.180
you know, the awful
tragedy of it--

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.160
there is a collective
identity anchored

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.691
in that experience of the
transatlantic slave trade,

01:32:45.691 --> 01:32:46.190
right?

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:49.380
And for people who are
descendants of that.

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.530
And so there is a
collective identity

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:54.470
shaped by that long enduring
history which is very powerful.

01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:57.470
Whereas we're talking
about 26 identities

01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:59.480
that we talk about
that are in conflict.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.240
And that's not to say
Africans aren't diverse,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.540
or even in that original
experience of 400 years ago

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.484
and onward.

01:33:06.484 --> 01:33:08.150
But there is something
about the history

01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:09.440
that needs to be
understood, I think,

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.481
in that collective voice.

01:33:10.481 --> 01:33:11.810
And the other thing is that--

01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:14.450
maybe you touched on this,
the idea of respectability?

01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:16.460
You know, like not
wanting to step on toes

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.110
and maybe being demure.

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:21.770
And I think that, from what
I've seen in not just the Black

01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:24.290
Lives Matter movement of
the last couple of years.

01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:27.200
But, you know, if you go back
to read Du Bois and more,

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.326
you see that there
is a certain idea of,

01:33:30.326 --> 01:33:31.700
if we're going to
be respectable,

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.534
we're not really pushing
against status quo.

01:33:33.534 --> 01:33:35.325
And if we're going to
push against status--

01:33:35.325 --> 01:33:37.700
we need to push against
status quo if we want change.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.582
And that's really
just the bottom line.

01:33:40.582 --> 01:33:42.040
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
America, you

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:42.910
look like you want
to say something.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.993
AMERICA FERRERA: Yeah, I
do want to say something.

01:33:44.993 --> 01:33:49.480
You know, I think too what's
so hard about right now

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:53.440
is that we're labeling things
political which actually

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.850
are not just political.

01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:57.860
They're about value systems,
and they're about humanity.

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:02.470
And I think the more we can
message the values and say,

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.120
you know, it's one
thing to ask Google

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.130
to take a stance on
immigration reform,

01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:10.090
it's another thing to ask Google
to stand up for the kids who

01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:11.920
are being bullied
in their schools,

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.380
for the violence
that is happening

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.670
towards our communities.

01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:19.820
Regardless of intent
of the conversations,

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:23.350
the outcome is such that
people feel emboldened

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:26.860
to attack our children
in schools, verbally

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.000
or physically, and we can't
stand for that value system.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.390
And I think that is where
our alliances help us.

01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:35.870
There is safety in numbers.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:39.430
So if it's not just the
Latino group saying,

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:42.770
Google, we want you to stand
up for our communities,

01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:43.660
find alliances.

01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.950
Because you know what?

01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:46.596
Muslim kids are
being attacked, too.

01:34:46.596 --> 01:34:48.220
And black kids are
being attacked, too.

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.990
And gay kids are
being attacked, too.

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:52.630
So finding the
strength in numbers

01:34:52.630 --> 01:34:55.180
and emboldening yourselves
around your value system,

01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.420
and then asking Google
to make a decision

01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.100
about where their values lie.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.800
And try to remove the political
out of it, which is nearly

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.730
impossible in this day and age.

01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:07.960
But I think we are at an
unprecedented moment in history

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.840
where it's about humanity.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.850
And we can talk around
politics all we want.

01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:16.440
But at the end of the
day, people's lives

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.820
have been made vulnerable.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.280
And what Google
does today matters.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.280
What Google and corporations
and companies like it,

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.880
where they stand and how they
choose to use their influence

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.000
and voice, will define
the world that we

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.890
live in in 15 and 20
years, and the world

01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:36.030
that our kids grow up in.

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:39.450
And holding them to
their value system.

01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:40.950
And you're going
to piss people off.

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:43.136
And it's not going
to be happy go lucky,

01:35:43.136 --> 01:35:44.760
you know, let's all
sit around and have

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760
a conversation about it.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.360
You're going to have
to be willing to know

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.300
that not everyone is going
to be happy about it.

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.008
DAISY AUGER-DOMINGUEZ:
Thank you so much.

01:35:53.008 --> 01:35:54.030
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:56.910
We are well above our time,
so we're going to close.

01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:57.990
I think that--

01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:03.360
I'm deeply thankful,
grateful for you to have come

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.790
and helped us have
this conversation

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:08.910
with Google, and eventually
outside of Google.

01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:10.770
I think what we've
heard, consistently

01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:13.590
and repeatedly, is
that words matter.

01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:14.790
Labels matter.

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:16.320
Values matter.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.230
We are at a really critical and
exciting time for the Latino,

01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:24.690
Hispanic, Chicano.

01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:28.080
Whatever whatever name we
want to use, but this richly

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.165
diverse community, there
is tremendous pride,

01:36:31.165 --> 01:36:32.790
and there's tremendous
influence that's

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:35.310
coming from this community.

01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:37.560
As Googlers, we're
incredibly privileged,

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.540
and we struggle
with our privilege.

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.467
But it's also a privilege that
we want to share and expand.

01:36:42.467 --> 01:36:44.550
And we have unique
opportunities and great lessons

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:46.080
that we've learned here today.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.450
As I'm as I'm looking
through my notes,

01:36:51.450 --> 01:36:53.730
I'm thinking about the
challenges of bringing together

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:54.229
one--

01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:55.680
you know, 26
different identities

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.970
into one shared platform.

01:36:56.970 --> 01:36:59.140
But the opportunities
that come from that.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:01.840
And I know that
we're ready for that.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.410
And so I want to thank America,
JC, Andrew, Dr. Gonzalez.

01:37:07.410 --> 01:37:09.780
Thank you so much, on
behalf of all Googlers here.

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.700
And we hope to continue
this conversation.

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:16.850
[APPLAUSE]
