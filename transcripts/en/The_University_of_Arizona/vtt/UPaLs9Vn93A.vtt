00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.760
Greenhouse systems are the
types of food production systems

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.480
to grow crops under
controlled environments using

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.270
natural sunlight in
two-dimensional space.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.770
When it comes to
vertical farming,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.645
these are the types of
controlled environment

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:18.410
agriculture systems using either
container-based applications

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.340
or, in warehouses, to
use artificial lighting,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.740
such as fluorescent
light or LED lighting,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.890
to grow the crops in
hydroponic systems

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.580
or aquaponic systems in
three-dimensional space.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.360
We are trying to design
environmental control

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.250
around the plant and actually
use the plants as sensors.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.250
We are really looking into
applications of precision ag

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.680
or digital agriculture
applications

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.220
as we look at future for more
sustainable plant production

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.840
systems.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.120
My ambition, my goal,
is to-- in the future

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.490
to have plans, actually,
to be able to control

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.900
their environments and make
adjustments to their production

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.620
settings and systems.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.239
This will be the
most sustainable and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.792
resource-conserving
way of production

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.100
in the controlled environment
agriculture systems.
