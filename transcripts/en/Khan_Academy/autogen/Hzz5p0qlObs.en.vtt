00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.450
 Let's draw a square. 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.520
 It is not drawn ideally, but it is 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.920
 acceptable square experience. And of course 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.720
 one of the things we know about the square, 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.020
 is that all of its sides will have the same length. 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.090
 If the length of this side is x, 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.050
 then all of them, 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.490
 each of them will be x length. 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.490
 We also know it will be 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.110
 makes angles, so it's a square. 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.190
 Now the question I want to ask, 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.390
 is whether the length of the sides of the square 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.890
 is direct to his face? 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.450
 And I recommend pausing the video and thinking about it 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 whether the lengths of the sides of a square 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 are directly proportional to the face of the square? 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.250
 To think about it, let's draw 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.750
 a small table here. 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.730
 The length of the country 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.450
 will be given as x, 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.290
 this will be x, then 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.850
 I'll have another column, I can draw 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150
 this a little better, let me 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.520
 I use this tool, here, 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.490
 I will draw two columns 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.881
 right here, 

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.170
 and then here I will put the face. 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 Face ... How much will be the face? 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.090
 The face will be one of the sides raised in a square, 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.800
 you can see it as the width of the height, 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.650
 so we will have x by x or x square. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.490
 Let's simply choose multiple values ​​for x 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.850
 and then determine what the person will be. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.790
 If x is equal to 1, 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550
 the face will be 1 in 1, 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.020
 which is also 1. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.590
 If x is equal to 2, 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 the face will be 2 in 2, 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.790
 which is equal to 4. 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.920
 If x is equal to 3, 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.770
 the face will be 3 by 3, 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
 which is equal to 9. I can go on, 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.190
 but I think that's enough. There are enough points, 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.450
 to consider whether the length of the country is directly proportional to the person, 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 or is the person directly proportional to the length of the country? 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.890
 One way you can view 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.840
 the proportionality, is whether relations between 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050
 the length of the country and the person concerned 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.650
 are always the same. So we want to look 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.250
 the relationship between the length of the country and the person, 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.160
 or the face and length of the country, as they are always constants. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.050
 The face and the length of the country, let me do it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.380
 as two separate ... 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.150
 I'll make one extra column here. 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.070
 Let's draw an extra column here, 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.350
 behold, let us look at this attitude, 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.710
 the attitude of the person 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.940
 to the length of the country. 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.620
 Here the ratio is 1 on 1, 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.281
 which equals 1. 

00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.850
 This seems acceptable. 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.620
 For these follow the attitude of the person 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.820
 and the length of the country is 4 on 2, 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.220
 4 on 2, which is equal to 2. 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.590
 I do not even have to move on to the third one. 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.800
 I can say that this attitude, 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.520
 the face on the length of the country will be equal to 3. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.380
 Note that every time I get a different value. 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.350
 This is not equal to a constant, I do not 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.680
 a constant relationship between face and length of the country, 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.720
 which shows us that these two, 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.790
 length of the country and person are not directly proportional. 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 No, they are not straightforward. 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.650
 And if you look at it, it is quite logical that 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.250
 the relationship will actually be equal to 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.290
 the actual length of the country that will change 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.750
 depending on the length of the country and that's because 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.080
 we lift a square. 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.420
 You literally raise x to square, 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.020
 if you have x here, 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.510
 this will be x square, 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.190
 and the ratio will be x of a square on x, 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890
 which of course will always be 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.990
 equal, x is x, divided by x, 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.590
 this will always be equal to x, 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.590
 we see it here. 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.931
 But it is definitely not straightforward.
