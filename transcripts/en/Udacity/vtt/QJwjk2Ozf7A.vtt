00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.320
separation make managing data centers easier? The

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.260
ability to monitor and control routes from a

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.300
central point of control. The ability to

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.570
migrate virtual machines without renumbering host addresses. A

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.220
requirement for fewer switches or making load

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.440
balance automatic. Please again check all that apply.
