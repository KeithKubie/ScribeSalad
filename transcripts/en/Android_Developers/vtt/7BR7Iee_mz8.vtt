00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.640
I was born in Chengdu

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
and I also graduated from the university of Chengdu.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.480
Then I started working and founded Tap4Fun in 2008 after my graduation.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.160
Tap4Fun is a Chinese company based  in Chengdu, specialized in developing mobile games.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.440
We have been focusing exclusively on developing mobile games,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.520
So the exclusive development of mobile games is indispensable and critical, 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.200
and is also the founding philosophy of the business to survive sustainably.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.000
The very beginning of the business was quite  funny                                                                                                           since a small office was unavailable at the time.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.360
But it was good as we got along with each other inside and                                                                                                                 outside of the office, and the dedication of the team was also very strong.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.520
我们是一家总部位于中国的公司，但是我们不为中国市场开发游戏

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.000
这一点让很多人感到惊奇

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.400
从2013年开始，我们看到Google Play增长迅猛

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.240
安卓系统的市场规模也大到无法忽视的境地

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
所以我们把一款游戏放到Google Play上进行尝试

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760
The income of Google Play accounts for 55% of our total game income

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.920
while players of Google Play account up for 65% of all our players.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 The reason for this is that users start to update immediately within one hour

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.760
when we issue updates or uploads of an App

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.840
Google have a good developer relationship

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.680
They will often contact us

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.760
and inquire whether we need help or not. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840
Then they’ll get themselves involved in our piperline and give us suggestions. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.200
Besides that,  they pay great attention to each game while also offering great solutions

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.120
Beta testing at Google Play enables us to issue                                                                                                                     new versions by specifically targeting just a section of players

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.120
Therefore we not only achieve version  testing but also care about users’ experience 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.920
By avoiding a mass release which might still have problems. 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.040
谷歌希望来自全球的开发者都能够取得成功

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.840
所以谷歌做了很多事情鼓励开发者们看到这样的成功故事

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840
另一个原因就是谷歌的全球影响力

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800
所以Google Play一定是我们的重点平台

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.840
通过Google Play平台， 可以让来自全球的玩家获取我们的游戏，享受我们的游戏，这点对我们很重要

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 A VIP customer support system is supposed  to be available,                                                                                                and the players paying money for the game

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.560
will be served by special members

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.280
We also attentively solve problems met  by players through the Google review system

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280
Through this, user ratings from players have increased from 3.6 - 4.2

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.680
Meanwhile, feedback and customer service emails                                                                                                                         sent by players will decline by 15% to 20% in the following days.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.680
As far as I am concerned, a platform needs to be open,                                                                                                                         generous and powerful enough to support any company or team 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.400
Looking to produce quality games for the global market.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.400
And Google Play is just that kind of platform
