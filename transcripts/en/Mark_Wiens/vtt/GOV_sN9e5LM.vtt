Hope you're having an amazing day, it's Mark Wiens in Tel-Aviv

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.039
We're going on another food tour today, and I'm not sure all the places that David is taking us today

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.580
But I do know that we're gonna go to what he considers to be the best of the best fish restaurants in all of Israel

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.799
So we're on our way to start eating, and I can't wait to share the food with you today

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.339
We're on our way... to Ashdod(David) and it's an ancient city

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.200
David's gonna take us to some gems, it is a ancient city but it is a new city.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.360
It like a biblical--- it appears in the bible, but today, it's Motor City

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
So today we are going to see three  amazing places

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.340
(Music)

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.130
That was about a 30 minute drive to Ashdod

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.519
And we have made it here and the first place that we're stopping on this food tour is known as the old lady

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.860
And I'm not sure exactly what she prefers, but anything cooked by the old lady

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.279
You know it's gonna be amazing, and we've just arrived here. She has some tables set up

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.930
It's almost like a it almost kind of looks like a park here, and then this is the stall

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.849
Thank you (Mark)

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.440
The smell is amazing

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.580
Okay, it is okay we will wait.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.669
We arrived here, we're a little bit early and this this is a beautiful beautiful place

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.520
She is the most amazing grandmother

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.880
Can smell the aroma of the fish? She's already greeted Micah with a kiss oh?

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.380
I love this place already, and I love grandma already

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.810
The food's gonna be ready in about 30 minutes, but we're giving grandma some some privacy some some time to finish cooking otherwise

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.020
We'll just be talking and trying to smell the entire time oh

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.019
She is a beautiful a beautiful grandma

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.899
I think she opens right at 11:00 so we got here early

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:22.979
but literally she sell out people local people have said that she sells out within 30 minutes or an hour, so this is a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680
local gem here

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.340
Thank you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.740
The wait is over all of her cooking is ready and the food

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.440
Okay of anywhere you travel in the world

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.660
this is the best type of food experience you can possibly have a

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.349
Friendly amazing grandmother home cooking they just set up these tables right in the park

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.518
I don't even know if this this is kind of a halfway between a park and just a walkway

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.069
Sidewalk through the neighborhood. They set out the tables here. This is a friendly environment

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.689
Home cooking by Grandma, it doesn't get better than this anywhere in the world

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.119
This is Moroccan style Jewish food

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.129
And this is the type of cuisine I've never had before look at that spice in there

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.219
You can see the red oil you can see the chilies on there

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.119
You can see the garlic you see you can smell the garlic and this is one is tuna

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.828
Caught right here from the Mediterranean Sea. It's absolutely stunning

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.269
It's it's beautiful beyond description. You can see some

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.979
Look at this spice. Just caked up onto that tuna. Oh, wow okay. I have to just taste this

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.210
Oh, yeah

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.500
That's spice blend there are Chilis' in there it has a kind of a little

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.210
Sourish taste as well

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.210
There's garlic in there oh

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.000
That's good follow with some of those cucumbers that she was making

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.090
Mmm!

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.960
Even those simple cucumbers are amazing it's very very light

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.039
Maybe some olive oil, and then she you can see little pieces of parsley in there

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.499
And the parsley is what really comes through nicely. This is a mixture of both tongue and head beef and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.380
It looks like to be a similar stew

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.559
Just get a close-up look all that is some that is some fragrant oil that you're gonna want to soak up

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.699
Oh, that's melt-in-your-mouth. Oh, it's so tender

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.159
The flavor that dry chili you can really taste the spice blend in there that is insane

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:50.469
Wow!

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.909
That's actually stunning follow that with some cucumbers

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.949
They also have another chilli sauce here so for my next bite

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.558
I'll grab a piece of that tuna and let me go into that chilli sauce

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.320
It's like tomatoey I think to like dried tomatoes it tastes like you can taste the onions in there

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.149
There's a little bit of chilli as well. It's absolutely sensational. Oh yeah, they're seedless already

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.260
Everything has that same red chili flavor to it. This is my kind of food grab a piece of fish oh

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.550
And I'm gonna go in for some of that chili sauce as well may as well

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.040
This is a place I want to just hang out for the rest of the day

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.940
I want to do a quick test to show you how tender this meat is

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.670
This is fork tender and not only not only fork tender but plastic fork tender we get that

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
The tuna is awesome

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.009
But the the mixture of tongue and cow head

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.760
This is the the dish that is the dish

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.860
I'm a very happy man

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.820
(Music)

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.400
We drove over to the next spot, and this is a legendary place

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:43.569

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.569
Tunisian sandwiches and it's a big

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:53.859
It's a big blob of like fried dough fried dough bread, and then I don't even know what's all outside

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.710
But I can't wait to watch him assemble this and that's my friend Morris

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:02.499
He is well known in the whole country for his fricassee which is a Tunisian bread

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.900
Filled with tonight's like a Tunisian sandwich.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.960
Said he said everybody all over Israel come here specially just for a sandwich

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:25.560
Not only from Israel; from all over everybody comes to Israel comes to him I told him he is a celebrity and look at him. He looks like

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.588
He has been here 30 years

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:48.159
He said um he should be aware because it's gonna be addicting for you once you taste this fricasse say

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.470
You will have to come back here

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.010
Salad

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.460
Potatoes

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.450
Tuna

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:02.410
So here it is

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.769
this is the beautiful fricassee they first take a piece of dough and

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:13.169
Deep-fry it so it turns to a completely crispy fry bread, then he slices it open

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.899
He adds in some harissa, which is that spice blend? He adds into some tomato paste some fresh chilies

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.579
there's some potatoes in there some salad some pickled lemon and

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:28.679
Then also he adds in one of the main components is tuna now then he adds in the tuna

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.279
He finishes it off with a hard-boiled egg and some capers

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:37.799
Sprinkled on the very top you got to give it a little squish to get that harissa mixed in with all the ingredients

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.560
Okay, I can't wait

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.680
Oh, yeah

00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.339
Oh, that's a stunner you've got all that harissa, that chili in there all that flavor is insane!

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.269
Mixed with the tuna the egg the the crispness of the the green chilies and the cucumber in there

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.140
Wow

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:16.030
But I mean it's it's all those ingredients inside, but really what the foundation of this sandwich is is that fry bread.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.379
But that private is perfect it's crispy and gooey all at the same time

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.590
That is a treat oh

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.020
Good!

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:38.499
On that bite, I got some of that pickled lemon che Maurice has brought over a little cup of Boukha and Boukha is a Tunisian

It's good though yeah, yeah, you get you can, you can taste the figs in there

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.470

Well okay, I'll take another bite of the sandwich.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.160
Wow!

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.020
That went down way too easy, and I'm gonna just tell you that that is probably the best tuna sandwich

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.640
You will have in your entire life. This is the spot right here

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.209
Everything was amazing within that sandwich, but really the standout flavor was that harissa that chili sauce

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.750
the flavor explosion was amazing

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.760

We arrived at the lunch restaurant this place is called pescado

They've served us a bunch of different types of sashimi

00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:18.418
And there's three different types of tuna this one is tuna with soy sauce

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:22.829
this one is tuna inside a little shell of onion with tahini and

00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:25.619
Basil I think and then this one is

00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:29.248
Tuna with olive oil and that this one is yellowtail

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:32.609
kind of like a fusion of sashimi with

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:36.268
with local ingredients and local flavors

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.740
That's awesome!

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:52.960
Sashimi and tahini and that basil was so so pungent so fresh

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:02.869
That's the type of  tuna that just melts in your mouth, oh, it's like pure butter

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:12.139
This is cured Spanish mackerel as well as cured fish eggs. I'm gonna take a little piece of both in one bite

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.929
And they make this right here at the restaurant and it's a delicacy

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.459
Cut Spanish mackerel oh it's salted

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:28.410
The flavor..

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:36.350
That's like... It's it's somewhere between like jerky texture, and then just moist and then you've got those those

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.300
Cured eggs as well

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.740
which are

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.679
They're wonderfully fishy and delicious. Next dish is a whitefish which has been tossed with

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:48.949
There's some zatar in here there is

00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:53.779
Onions and some arugula and some peppers, and then there's also some tahini

00:15:53.780 --> 00:16:00.350
I think I'll just go in with my..... and garlic you can see the garlic in there too. This is a beautiful beautiful dish

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.340
Look at all that Tahini on the bottom there

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.780
ho-ho-man!

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:14.919
It's so nutty from that tahini you can take the Zatar in there, the Thyme, the sesame seeds

00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:23.559
The Arugula, and then the little bits of white fish next up. We have a deep-fried fin or like the wing of a meager fish

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:26.529
Wow I'm just gonna break this

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.930
Break this off

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:40.700
Oh look at all that steam coming out. Oh, this is like a chicken wing oh look at that!

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:51.579
That is sensational

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:58.079
Oh it's deep-fried so fresh. It's perfectly salty. It's so meaty look at all that meat.

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:04.739
Actually what you can do what I will do is take some.. oh it's hot. I will dip some of that in the harissa.

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:12.749
It's perfectly fresh. I'll open your world

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.429
And so you know how much you like spicy we just put the whole stuff

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.209
Here on this side

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.849
The other side will be like normal.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.690
With Harissa.

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:42.779

This is a both Haga omelette and boat Agha is the type of preserved fish eggs look at this beauty?

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.159
I'll just slice it in half so we can all see the inside. I think it must be kind of mixed in there

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.060
Grab a bite of this

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.520
Oh, I think that's all of it on the top shaved on the top

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:26.429
That is nice and fishy, has that salted preserve paste. Ending that beautiful lunch with a cup of espresso a double espresso

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.180
This restaurant, it's packed now.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.909
No better way to finish a meal than with a double espresso

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.379
We just made it back to Tel Aviv from that day trip food day trip to Ashdod

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.980

Amazing food all the way from grandmas cooking to that gourmet fish experience my favorite meal of the entire day

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.290
Was grandma's cooking and those spicy stews that she made

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.810
They were just absolutely outstanding!

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:06.220
I loved everything from her cooking to the place where she set up to the park where we ate
