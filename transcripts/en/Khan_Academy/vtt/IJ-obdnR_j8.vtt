00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Tutor] Let g of x equal one over x.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.608
Can we use the mean value theorem

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:06.950
to say that the equation g
prime of x is equal to one half

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.580
has a solution where negative one

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.170
is less than x is less than two,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.805
if so, write a justification.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:13.260
Alright, pause this video

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.510
and see if you can figure that out.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.750
So the key to using
the mean value theorem,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.810
even before you even think about using it,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.770
you have to make sure

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.730
that you are continuous
over the closed interval

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.730
and differentiable over the open interval,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.955
so this is the open interval here

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.540
and then the closed interval
would include the end points.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.370
But you might immediately realize

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.210
that both of these intervals
contain x equals zero

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.570
and if x equals zero,
the function is undefined

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.682
and if it's undefined there,

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:41.440
well it's not going to continuous

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.090
or differentiable at that point

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.593
and so no,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.240
not continuous

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.920
or differentiable,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.000
differentiable

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.250
over the interval,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.318
over the interval.

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:59.170
Alright, let's do the second part.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.330
Can we use the mean value theorem

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.010
to say that there is a value
c such that g prime of c

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.530
is equal to negative one half

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.660
and one is less than c is less than two

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.390
if so, write a justification.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.490
So pause the video again.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.100
Alright, so in this
situation, between one and two

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.836
on both the open and the closed intervals,

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.580
well, this is a rational function

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.360
and a rational function
is going to be continuous

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.900
and differentiable at
every point in its domain

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.980
and its domain completely contains

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.847
this open and closed interval

00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:26.260
or another way to think about it,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.140
every point on this open interval

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.330
and on the closed
interval is in the domain,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.800
so we can write g of x

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.180
is a rational

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.933
function,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.420
which lets us know that it is continuous

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.420
and differentiable at
every point in its domain,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.850
at every point

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.963
in its domain,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.830
the closed interval from one to two

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.580
is in domain

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.560
and so now, let's see what
the average rate of change is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.020
from one to two

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.680
and so we get g of two

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.380
minus g of one

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.420
over two minus one is equal to one half

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.110
minus one over one, which is
equal to negative one half,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.510
therefore,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.320
therefore

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.540
by the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930
mean value theorem,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.537
there must be a c

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.540
where one is less than c is less than two

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.540
and g prime of c is equal to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.390
the average rate of change
between the end points,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.637
negative one half

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:51.463
and we're done, so we can put
a big yes right over there

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.283
and then this is our justification.
