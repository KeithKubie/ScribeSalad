00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.659
- (sighs) Jesus.

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.888
We came behind the stadium
where the elephants perform

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:26.332
and we found this juvenile elephant.

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:29.685
He had gaping red wounds at his temple.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:32.033
He also has a broken leg.

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.128
The other one is chained up.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:35.532
He looks totally emaciated.

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:36.782
Skin and bones.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.320
And this is the worst shape I've seen

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.093
an elephant in in Thailand.

00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:44.494
(mellow music)

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:46.452
All in the name of entertainment.

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:49.035
(mellow music)

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:56.266
(crowd cheering)
(intense orchestral music)

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.293
Wildlife tourism is a massive industry

00:00:58.293 --> 00:01:02.613
accounting for 10-20% of
the global tourism industry.

00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:06.540
People go on vacation and
pay money to either view

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.078
or interact with animals.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.659
I don't think we can ignore the role

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.460
that social media plays.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.563
The sheer number of people now
not only posting their travel

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.520
experiences, but consuming
others' travel experiences

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.678
means that these things
are spread in an instant

00:01:23.678 --> 00:01:25.327
with the click of a button.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:27.162
But the issue with wildlife tourism

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:30.329
is most people have absolutely no idea

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:33.794
of what goes on behind the scenes.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.843
(crowd chattering)

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:38.330
I reported this story on wildlife tourism

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.830
with photographer Kirsten Luce for a year.

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.999
And we set out knowing that
we really had to sort of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.523
narrow our focus and
go to kind of hot spots

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:55.058
around the world where this
industry is a massive part

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.459
of the local economy.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.973
But there was nothing that prepared me

00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:02.025
for what I actually saw in the field.

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:03.814
Especially when we went to Thailand.

00:02:03.814 --> 00:02:07.147
(mellow woodwind music)

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:10.981
(tires scraping against road)

00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:13.648
(cage clanging)

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.124
This is a place that puts on monkey shows

00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:20.355
and as you can see behind me,

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:22.536
this monkey is in a small metal cage

00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:24.642
and you can see he's jumping over and over

00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:26.020
and this is called zoochosis

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.049
and animals that are kept in captivity

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.405
do this when they're in
psychological distress.

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:35.364
(cage clanging)
(woodwind music)

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:38.226
I'm here at a zoo on the top floor

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:41.211
of a shopping mall in Bangkok.

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.301
This kind of place, animals
are living in conditions

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.948
that no living being should be living in.

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:51.257
The only gorilla in Thailand
is apparently in this zoo.

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:54.897
The gorilla was reaching
its hand through the cage

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:56.881
onto a puddle on the concrete floor

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.548
scooping up fingerfuls of water.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:01.755
It seemed to be the only way

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.038
this gorilla could access water.

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.621
(somber music)

00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:09.600
We just finished watching
the crocodile show

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.484
which was pretty
disturbing and consisted of

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:16.051
two trainers dragging crocodiles
around by their tails,

00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:18.981
smacking them on the head with sticks,

00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:20.090
and then everyone would laugh.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.840
It was like all designed
as a comedy routine.

00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:29.672
On most people's bucket
lists for going to Thailand,

00:03:29.672 --> 00:03:32.035
you're gonna want to see an elephant.

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:36.167
So we went to dozens
of elephant experiences

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:38.274
all over Thailand.

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:40.795
Mahouts, trainers that
care for their elephants,

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.702
used their bull hooks on the
elephants to get them to pose

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:47.847
to allow tourists to
take photos with them.

00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:51.397
A bull hook is a stick and at
the end of the wooden stick

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.480
is a metal prong or hook.

00:03:54.558 --> 00:03:59.141
And this is the instrument
used to control an elephant.

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.733
(crowd chattering)

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:07.816
I'm here at Maetaman
Elephant Camp in Chiang Mai.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.994
(elephant trumpeting)

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.199
I think the most shocking thing
was during the actual show.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.947
Some of the bull hooks
had nails on the end.

00:04:17.947 --> 00:04:20.428
I witnessed a couple of
mahouts that had nails

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:21.519
in their hands and they were poking

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.760
behind the elephant's ear to get them

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.463
to perform and do the painting.

00:04:26.463 --> 00:04:28.441
(crowd chattering)

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:29.590
A young elephant named Meena,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.783
she's four years old and
she performed in the show.

00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:33.631
She painted a picture.

00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:36.581
So she did have a nail in her ear.

00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.209
And after the show we walked over to

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.292
where she was being kept.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.737
(broom scraping against ground)

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:47.814
There was a chain around her
leg that had spikes in it.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:51.174
The spikes were all the way
around, pressing into her skin.

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:53.274
She was kind of hovering it in the air,

00:04:53.274 --> 00:04:55.226
because obviously it
hurt to put weight on it

00:04:55.226 --> 00:04:56.808
and I asked her mahout why and he said

00:04:56.808 --> 00:04:59.391
it's because she likes to kick.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.569
Her mahout said that he puts
it on for a little while

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.052
to teach her and then he
takes it off at night.

00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:10.888
I decided that I wanted to come back later

00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:14.411
to see if she actually
was on a different chain.

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.600
With permission of the facility

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.531
we ended up coming back six hours later

00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:24.531
and I feel like before I
got to her I just knew.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.905
(rain hitting structure)

00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.241
It's about 7:30 PM and you
can see it's getting dark

00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:33.269
and it's pouring rain.

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:36.936
Meena has had a spiked
chain around her ankle

00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:41.049
since we last left her and her mahout,

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.849
he told us that at night he removes it.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.011
But he hasn't and it was a lie.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.435
So I don't know how she's gonna sleep

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:52.291
and it's really, really
upsetting to watch.

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.011
It was the first time I
sort of witnessed deception

00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:58.261
that sort of runs through this industry

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:04.089
and I wanted to see for myself
where these animals are born,

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:08.756
how they're trained, the
economics behind this industry.

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:14.357
And if you wanna go to
ground zero basically

00:06:14.357 --> 00:06:15.785
of the elephant industry in Thailand,

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:18.229
you have to go to Ban Ta Klang.

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.812
(mellow music)

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.265
There are 3,500 captive
elephants in the country

00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:30.197
and half of them are actually
sourced to Ban Ta Klang.

00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:34.114
It's a place where
elephants are bred, trained,

00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:37.129
and then when they are ready,

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.765
they're sold down south to
camps around the country.

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:44.437
(mellow music)

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.864
The Thai government
actually offers a subsidy

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:50.689
to mahouts who care for elephants there.

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.617
The elephant tourism industry
is a massive source of income

00:06:53.617 --> 00:06:57.034
for the country so they actively fund it,

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:01.641
ensuring that the elephant
entertainment industry

00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.645
is healthy and that there
are always new babies

00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:09.145
being funneled in and that it is thriving.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.601
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:14.177
Most people in the town are mahouts,

00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:16.517
meaning they work with
elephants for a living.

00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:20.384
A young man was happy to be honest with me

00:07:20.384 --> 00:07:22.533
about how they train their elephants

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:24.901
and what tourists don't realize is that

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:27.333
in order for an elephant
to be docile enough

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:31.053
to stand there and let
you touch him safely,

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:34.353
that elephant has to be
trained in the same way

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:37.217
that an elephant throwing
darts at a show is trained

00:07:37.217 --> 00:07:42.050
as a young baby going through
abusive fear based training.

00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:47.193
What usually happens is
when a elephant is about

00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:50.026
two years old the baby is confined

00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:53.584
and over several days and weeks

00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:57.072
the baby is slowly trained.

00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:00.661
This young elephant...

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.661
he's kinda freaking out.

00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:07.018
The first thing they teach
the baby is how to sit.

00:08:07.018 --> 00:08:09.524
He said they use a hook at the back

00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:11.490
and someone pulls down and then someone

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.874
uses another hook at the front

00:08:12.874 --> 00:08:14.566
and the baby's legs are tied together

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:16.199
and they pull the legs front

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:17.373
and they do this over and over

00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:21.061
until the baby learns how to do it.

00:08:21.061 --> 00:08:23.388
He said to me we have to use the bull hook

00:08:23.388 --> 00:08:24.992
so the baby will know.

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:27.909
(crowd chattering)

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.553
Knowing that Meena was four years old

00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:36.701
and elephants live 80 years.

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:38.817
They live as old as people do.

00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:41.053
She was at the beginning of what could be

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:44.220
another 60, 65, 70 years of this life.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:49.325
Was very overwhelming
to sort of grapple with.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.490
So it's been three days since
we were last at Maetaman Camp.

00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:02.433
We're returning today just
to see what the situation is.

00:09:02.433 --> 00:09:05.793
And we'll of course check on Meena

00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:09.210
and see how she's being held in her stall

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.651
when she's not performing.

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:17.812
It's the spiked chain.

00:09:22.143 --> 00:09:24.207
Watch her foot, it's her right foot.

00:09:24.207 --> 00:09:26.790
(somber music)

00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:35.508
She was just out posing with tourists.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:39.679
Then her mahout just brought
her back to her (mumbles)

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.183
and put the spiked chain
back around her foot

00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:45.379
and I'm realizing now
that this is her chain.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.967
This isn't a chain that he uses
sometimes to discipline her.

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:51.123
This is her chain.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:53.806
She's been in it every
time we've seen her.

00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:54.892
There's no other chain in sight

00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:58.225
that he could possibly be switching out.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.237
It's tethered to the pole.

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:05.024
If any tourist sort of
thinks, "Is this okay?"

00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:07.456
"Is this hurting the animal?"

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:09.524
Most places are very quick
with a response to say,

00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:10.468
"Oh no, they're fine."

00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:11.301
"It's just the way the way it is."

00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.476
"Don't worry about it."

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:14.348
And that satisfies most people

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:16.000
and they say, "Oh okay, they
must know what they're doing."

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.498
"They care for the animal."

00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:20.948
The system is actually
designed to be confusing.

00:10:20.948 --> 00:10:22.846
Most tourists I really do believe

00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:24.972
kinda wanna do the right thing.

00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:27.282
They love animals and they
wanna get close to them.

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:28.260
It's simple.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.011
It's understandable.

00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:33.594
And since 2014 the
number of animal selfies

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.252
that people have posted
has grown almost 300%.

00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:42.356
Part of what often inspires
people to go on this trip

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.944
is because they saw someone else do it

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:46.420
and they want that
experience for themself.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.337
However, social media
really does go both ways.

00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:55.517
I wanted to actually
visit a couple of good

00:10:55.517 --> 00:10:57.301
elephant experiences in Thailand

00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:59.881
just to see for myself
what that looked like

00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.805
and how it differed from
places that may call themselves

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:06.735
a sanctuary but offer
a lot of interaction.

00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:11.735
So we went to Elephant Valley
in Chiang Rai, Thailand.

00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:13.913
They have elephants that have been rescued

00:11:13.913 --> 00:11:16.970
from the traditional industry

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.141
and tourists are not allowed
to get close to the elephants.

00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:23.589
This is probably the only
interaction that tourists will get

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:25.973
while they're here.

00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:29.394
It's snack time so they're able to feed

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:31.141
each of the elephants some bananas

00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.869
and you can see this barrier is there

00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:37.104
mostly to prevent people from

00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:39.771
going into the elephant grounds.

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:43.918
It's totally voluntary.

00:11:43.918 --> 00:11:46.439
The elephants come for snack time

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:49.035
and then they can leave
whenever they want.

00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:53.952
It's a sustainable option for
elephant tourism in the area.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:00.299
Social media can actually
be harnessed for good.

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:02.604
You can go to an ethical place

00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:04.975
and you can use social
media to sort of educate

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:08.692
your own communities on ways that they can

00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:11.038
be part of the solution.

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:15.375
This entire industry is so
incredibly entrepreneurial

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:18.359
that it can and does change on a dime.

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:22.442
So when people decide that
they no longer want to

00:12:23.532 --> 00:12:27.252
give their money to a
certain sort of experience,

00:12:27.252 --> 00:12:28.599
and if enough people do that,

00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:32.115
then the experiences
themselves will shift.

00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:34.651
You the viewer and reader and traveler

00:12:34.651 --> 00:12:38.595
and just citizen are at
the heart of this story

00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:40.603
just as much as anyone else is.

00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:44.595
You have tremendous power as
a consumer to change things.

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:47.178
(mellow music)
