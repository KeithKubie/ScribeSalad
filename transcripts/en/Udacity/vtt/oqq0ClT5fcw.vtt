00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.200
Now that we have a working database,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.780
let's create our first
web server in Python.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.270
Once our web server is up and running,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.340
let's use the CRUD commands from lesson
one to access, our data from a Web page.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.670
There will be some opportunities
in this lesson for

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.860
you to try coding a few
things on your own.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.750
Set aside, some extra time to
work through these challenges.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.605
But before we get started coding,
let's review some of the basics of

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.620
client/server communications
across the Internet.
