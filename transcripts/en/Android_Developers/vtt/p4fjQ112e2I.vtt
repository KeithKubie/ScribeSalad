FERGUS HURLEY: Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.971
My name is Fergus Hurley.

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm product manager
on Google Play,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.126
focused on app excellence.

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:13.964
RICARDO GOVONI: And I'm Ricardo,
engineering manager on Play.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:15.380
SHAINIEL DEO: Hi,
I'm Shaniel Deo.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.432
I'm CEO of Halfbrick Studios.

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:18.890
FERGUS HURLEY:
Great and we're here

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.690
to talk to you about five
new products we're announcing

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.000
at this year's Google I/O to
help you achieve a better app

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.890
rating on Google Play.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.030
So what we've found through
a lot of data analysis,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.160
feedback from users,
feedback from developers,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.280
is that there's two major
components to achieving

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.800
a high rating on Google Play.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.770
One is technical app quality.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.070
And the other is
listening to users

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
and interacting with them
to be able to have them feel

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.330
that you're giving
them what they need

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.950
and having good experience.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.810
So first we're going to jump in
to improving your technical app

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.740
quality.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.510
Last year we announced
a Cloud Test Lab.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.190
And as you heard today
with Jason in the keynote,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.900
we now have Firebase Test Lab,
which has run, since last year,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.150
over a million tests on
a real physical Android

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940
devices in the
Google Data Center

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.580
running developers
like yourselves' apps.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700
And if you haven't
used it so far,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.490
go ahead and go to Firebase Test
Lab today, and start using it.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.930
You can use it from
Android Studio.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.036
You can use it from
the Firebase console.

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:23.910
Or you can even use it
from the command line.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.100
Within Play we've
had an integration

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.810
where you don't have to
write any custom scripts.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.460
And we will give you a report
back of how your app performs

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.430
on 10 plus physical devices.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.710
And we're now updating
that this year

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.630
with the Pre-launch Report.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.130
Before I jump into what exactly
is in the Pre-launch Report,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.260
hands up if you have an
app on Google Play today.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.360
OK, and keep your hand
up if you tested your app

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.080
on more than 10 physical
devices with your latest version

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.000
that you pushed out.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.667
OK, I'm impressed
with some people here.

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.041
Now keep your hand
up if you were

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.030
able to get those results
from those 10 devices

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.661
within an hour.

00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.910
OK, we got one person that's
[INAUDIBLE] down the back

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.010
who is impressive.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.740
And I'm here to show
you how all of you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.780
can have your hand
up to that question

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.000
if you're ever asked again.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.610
So, with the Pre-launch Report
we have three sections today.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.100
the Crashes section
shows you how

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.850
your app performs when
a robot is interacting

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.050
with it for about five minutes
on real physical Android

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.580
devices, representing a range
of devices and form factors.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.060
And here you can see
that we show you,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.740
over time, how your
latest versions are

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.030
impacted by the robot
interacting with them.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.750
You can see at 453, a
few older versions ago,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.440
the app wasn't doing so well.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.470
And a vast majority of devices
were experiencing a crash.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.430
And with the latest few versions
it was doing pretty good,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.590
until the last version, which
had two crashes detected.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.740
As you scroll down this
part of the report,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.360
you can be able to see the
details on the devices that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.030
were tested.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.260
You going to be able
to click on any device,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.384
and you're going to be able
to see the stack trace,

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:00.370
if there was a crash,
the log cache, the device

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.660
configuration, a video
of the robot interacting

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.710
with your app, and lots
of other information

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.800
to help you with actually
fixing the issue that

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.700
has been detected.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.010
Now we know this, all the
developers in this room

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.990
never have crashes.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.600
So we thought, how can
we make the report still

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.830
valuable for you guys?

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.490
And so we are introducing
the Screenshots section,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.850
where we show you usability
issues that are potentially

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.710
occurring with your app.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.780
So here we show
you what your app

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.980
looks like on different Android
versions, different models,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.532
different screen sizes,
different screen resolutions,

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:34.740
and even different languages.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.320
So you can be able
to see if there's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.310
any issues when your app
runs in Arabic in right

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.620
to left language.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.070
You can see when you're going
for the emerging market,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.090
you can see what your
app looks like in Hindi.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.070
When you're going
to look at languages

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.170
that have longer
strings, like German,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.350
you can be able to see what
it looks like in those.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.560
And as you can see
in this example here,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.680
there is a layout issue
that's occurring in German.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.900
And I'd encourage you to have
your designers go through

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.940
and have a look at
these results as well.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.639
Because it is really
valuable for them

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.180
to be able to see
what that app looks

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.010
like on all these
Android devices

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.670
with not much work for them.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.730
The final part of the Pre-launch
Report is the Security section.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.959
And this is where we put
Google's security team

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.220
to work for you.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550
And where we show you
known vulnerabilities

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.570
that we detect in
your application

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.900
before you launch it out to
the 1.2 billion Android users.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.410
For developers who don't
have lots of resources

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.190
and want to be able
to get quick testing,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.480
this has been a really
valuable resource for them.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.470
Now it doesn't replace
all your testing,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.990
but it's a really good
way to be able to enhance

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.070
your existing QA and
testing of your application,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.780
as the Flinc team
has identified.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.270
To be able to get access
to the Pre-launch Report,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.970
you just need to go to the
Play Developer console, click

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.470
on the Pre-launch
Report tab, which

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.886
replaces the previous Cloud
Test Lab in the Play Developer

00:04:57.886 --> 00:04:58.460
Console.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.040
And you can click to opt in.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.620
From that point on,
when you upload an APK

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.250
to your alpha or
beta channel we'll

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.190
generate a pre-launch
report for you

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.160
within an hour of
uploading your APK.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.970
And so yeah, we think that this
is really, really valuable.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.240
In the past we've found that
60% of the top 1000 apps on Play

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.670
are already running alpha
and beta channel testing.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.220
And if you're not
doing it today,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.530
we highly encourage
you to do so.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.460
Great, so the Pre-launch
Report fits into the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.620
before you launch your app
and trying to figure out

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.422
if there's any issues with it.

00:05:31.422 --> 00:05:33.710
But, as you all
know, it's always

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.950
that there's issues
that occur in the field.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.940
And that's where we have tools
now for live in production too.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.880
So, as you're
rolling out your app,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.710
you should use stage rollouts
if you don't already.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.250
And this is where you can be
able to roll it out to 1%, 5%,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.010
50% of your Play audience.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.190
And be able to see how new and
existing users are experiencing

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.550
the latest version of your app.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.930
And as you do
that, you should be

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.550
able to monitor
your crash reports.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.940
We encourage developers
to use ProGuard

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.690
to be able to obfuscate their
code when they release an APK.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.510
If you are a ProGuard
user, you can now

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.770
be able to upload your ProGuard
mapping file to the Google Play

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.500
Developer Console and have
your stack traces deobfuscated

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.250
for you when you actually go
to look at any crashes that

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.670
have occurred out in the wild.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.720
As you heard Jason
today in the keynote,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.230
we now have a full
cross-platform crash reporting

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.180
tool for iOS and Android called
Firebase Crash Reporting.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.520
This is part of a
much larger suite

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.920
of analytics and notifications.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.950
So if, let's say, Sundar
is using your app,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.610
and he experiences a crash.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.350
Then you can be able to see
how his engagement in your app

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.106
has changed.

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:44.230
And you can be able to send
him a notification when

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.310
you fixed that issue
that he is experiencing.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.820
This is completely free.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.910
And it's available
starting today.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.529
So if you use this,
your ProGuard mapping

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.070
files that you upload
as part of Play

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.010
will also work for the
Firebase Crash Reporting.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.110
All you have to do
is link your account.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.780
So we've gone over, in
terms of technique app

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.540
quality, the Pre-launch
Report before release.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.930
And when your live in
production, the Crash Reporting

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.071
part.

00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.570
I'm going to hand
it over to Ricardo

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.570
to talk about the
new three tools

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.732
that we have available
for customer interaction.

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:19.100
RICARDO GOVONI: Cool.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.030
So Fergus told you
how you can focus

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.490
on improving your app technical
quality with the tools

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.630
that we have announced.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.580
But listening to your
users is equally important.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.795
And we could say, the
customer is always right.

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:32.170
So you should really focus on
listening and understanding

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.941
what your users are telling you
to make your application great.

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:38.190
But it's not only a matter
of making your users happy.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.400
It can also have a significant
impact on your performance

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.320
of your app.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.500
Gamevil, a popular
game studio, they

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.820
focused on improving the
quality of one of their app

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.260
from 3.3 stars to 4.1.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.820
And over the same period, they
observed that their revenue

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.067
increased by 160%.

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:57.150
So this is pretty significant
and a good incentive

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.690
to make your applications great.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.360
Aviary tells us that
it's never too early

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.016
to start collecting
feedback from your users,

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:06.890
even when you're app is
still in development,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.880
even when you're still not live.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.980
And these can have a significant
impact on your development

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.860
speed, your iteration speed,
and how quickly you can

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.190
launch your app in production.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.960
So for these, we have a
few announcements to make.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.720
The first one is
I'd like to announce

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.180
Early Access in Google Play.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.110
So this is a new program that
allows users, early adopters,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.440
to find apps that are still
in development straight

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.760
from the Play Store.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.169
As part of Early Access, if
you are using an open beta,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.789
if you're running an open beta,
even if your app is still not

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.260
in production, users will
be able to find and opt

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.960
in to your app,
to your open beta,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.910
straight from the store listing
page of your app in the Google

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.350
Play Store.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.650
And this is a great way also to
start collecting early feedback

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.820
from these users
and help them help

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.456
you improve your
quality of your app,

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.830
collect that early feedback
while you're still developing

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.840
your app and really make it
great from the moment you're

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.660
ready to go to production.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.550
In fact, until now
it was the case

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.910
that if you were running
a private beta or an alpha

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.470
and beta, users would
not be able to review

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.490
or rate your app.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.270
As part of Early
Access, users will

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.180
be able to write a private
feedback that is directed only

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.790
to you developers.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.349
And it's a way for
your early adopters

00:09:31.349 --> 00:09:33.890
to give feedback on how you can
improve your app while you're

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.430
getting ready for your launch.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.600
They can go to Play Store, to
your store listing section,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.110
and just leave feedback there.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.170
It's private.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.340
It does not affect
your overall operating.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.300
It's available only to you.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.730
On your side as a developer,
you can go to the Play Developer

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.650
Console.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.200
And you will find that in
the Ratings and Review page,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.580
there is a new section, which
is called Beta Feedback.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.760
In here, are you
can find everything

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.560
that your early adopters
have shared with you.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.970
And you can use
filters and search

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.950
to obviously navigate
through this feedback.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.850
And you can reply to
them to start engaging

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.812
in a conversation with them.

00:10:10.812 --> 00:10:13.270
So we hope that this is going
to be a great way to increase

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.728
the amount of early feedback
that you get while your app is

00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:17.430
still in development.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.870
So let's add another tool
to what we mentioned so far.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.360
Beta feedback, very
helpful we expect,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.780
we hope, as one of
the tools that you

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.660
will use while you're still
in the early development

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.300
phases of your app.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.940
At some point you're
ready to go to production.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.720
And now the game changes.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.460
You're going to get a lot more
reviews, a lot more feedback.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.990
And it becomes important
to be able to sift

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.020
through these reviews and
early identify what matters,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.010
where you should spend
your attention, what

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.843
are the bits that your
users are telling you

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:49.220
that are really important.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.030
And so we have a few more things
to help you out with this.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.540
First, as you already know,
in the ratings section

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.280
of the Developer
Console, you have

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.720
access to an indication
of your overall operating,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.630
historical trends, how
it is changing over time,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.150
and drill downs and
breakdowns on how

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.360
your rating changes
across countries

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.300
and across application versions.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.500
But what we really
focused on is making

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.750
the reviews part even better.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.030
We really want to be able
to capture the most of what

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.140
your users are telling you
and make it available to you

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.660
in the easiest way possible.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.350
So we have a few
things to announce.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.850
First, in the Reviews part
of the Developer Console,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.210
you will find Highlights.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.070
Highlights are salient
snippets that we have

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.700
extracted from user reviews.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.630
They are available to you
in the Developer Console.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.260
And they are also
visible to your users

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.450
straight from the Play Store
in your store listing page.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.030
They are a great
way to understand

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.400
what captures your
users' attention

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.060
and also what signals users use
to decide whether to install

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.850
your application or not.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.890
One new thing that
you will find is

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.900
Topics, again, in the reviews
part of the Developer Console.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.500
What we have done is we
are using machine learning

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.110
and natural language processing
to look at all the reviews

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.700
that are being
submitted for your app

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.010
and identify peculiar topics
that are specific to your app.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.400
For example, if your are
a language learning app,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.980
you might find that your
users find it really difficult

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.730
to learn Klingon.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.380
Or they might comment
on the quality

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.020
of your spoken translations
or the availability

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.180
of an offline mode for your app.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.120
If you're a car
racing game, people

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.330
might comment on the
quality of the graphics

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.340
or the difficulty
of the game play.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.430
For each topic that
we identify, you

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.330
will be able to observe
the distribution of ratings

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.310
and the volume of reviews that
mention that specific topic.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.470
And also, we give
you an indication

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.990
of how big of an effect
user reviews and ratings

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.400
on that specific topic have
on your overall app rating.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.910
So the more they're read, the
bigger the opportunity that

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.870
you have to really focus
on addressing your users'

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.620
concerns on that specific topic
and increase your overall app

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.750
rating.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.090
And we hope that this
will be a great way

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.050
to help you prioritize
your attention

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.020
and really focus on the
things that matter most

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.130
for your users.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.890
But we have one more thing.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.140
We also have Benchmarks.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.910
So what we did,
again, we used machine

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.560
learning to look
at all the reviews

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.540
that have been submitted in the
Play store for all of the apps.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.480
And we identified eight
common traits, common aspects,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.800
that we think pertain
and can be quantified

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.120
for any app in the store, from
its design, its usability,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.880
the stability in back of the
apps, the speed of the app.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.740
And for each of these
topics, we quantify

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.180
how you score on those topics.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.220
What is your rating on
those specific topics?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.850
And again, how
much your users are

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.040
talking about these aspects.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.220
And as I mentioned before,
you get an indication

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.570
of where you should focus
your attention with a factor

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.940
rating, which tells you
where you have the biggest

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.120
opportunity to capture a good
chunk of your rating score

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.230
back.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.670
Groupon was one of our testers.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.400
And they have great
feedback to say

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.160
how much it helped them
prioritize their work

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.490
and focus on what
really matters.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.930
But you don't really have
only to trust our words.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.710
We can look at some data.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.080
So one thing that we
did is we looked at all

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.470
our English reviews
in the Play Store,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.930
where we could identify
at least one topic.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.920
And here is what we found.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.900
For all the reviews that are
one star, in 50% of the cases,

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.190
people will be complaining
about the stability

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.870
and bugs of the app.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.910
For all the reviews that are
five stars, 65% of your users

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.320
will be praising the speed,
design, and usability

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.770
of your app.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.560
You can go to Developer Console
and look at what the data looks

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.240
like for your app.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.030
And we think that this is
going to be a great way for you

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.540
to understand maybe where you're
letting your users a bit down.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.620
And on the other side,
where your app is really,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.900
really shining.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.260
And it will be a great way
to improve your app rating.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.520
OK, so this is great.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.984
Now you understand
where you should

00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:18.400
focus your attention, what are
your users are telling you.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.700
The next up is to start engaging
in a conversation with them.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.670
Because I think an active
conversation with your users

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.980
can make a real difference.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.940
With filters and
search functionality,

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.760
you can drill down from
the topics and benchmarks

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.050
that I mentioned before,
the specific reviews

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.090
that contribute to them.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.580
And once you have identified
a review that you really

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.590
need to take action
on, obviously you

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.270
want to reply to your users.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.960
Because it's really
important to start

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.890
addressing their feedback.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.660
But one thing that we
announced a few weeks ago

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.510
is the ability to be notified
whenever one of your users

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.130
update or change their
review after your reply.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.300
And this is a great way to
stay in touch with your users

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.860
and the ones that are willing
to engage in a conversation.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.600
And it can really
have an impact.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.570
In fact, we have seen
great adoption over time.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.320
As of today, 40% of
Play top developers

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.750
have enabled this feature
to be notified whenever

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.940
one of your users, to
which you replied to, comes

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.930
and update the review.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.189
So you can stay in touch
with what they're saying.

00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:25.480
So if you're not using yet,
go to the Developer Console

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.360
today and give it a try.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.180
You will start receiving
e-mails and notifications

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.960
whenever your users
change their review.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.400
So you can stay
on top of things.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.370
Engaging with your users
in an active conversation

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.470
and replying to their
reviews is really important.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.640
It's a crucial part
of your app quality.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.800
Users are really expecting these
from any developer these days.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.440
And in fact, we've
seen great adoption

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.690
of the functionality of being
able to reply to your usera'

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:57.560
reviews over time, 92%
growth year over year.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.550
"The Guardian," a popular
newspaper in the UK,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.460
considers replying to
reviews an invaluable part

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.119
of their customer
management experience.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.170
So if you're not replying
to your users yet,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.930
go ahead and start doing that.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.380
Because I'm pretty
sure all of you

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.720
want a bunch of five star
loyalists for your app as well.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.200
But replying to your users
from the Developer Console

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.443
can be quite cumbersome if
you have a ton of reviews.

00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:22.859
And we have heard
from many of you

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.750
that you would like a
way to be able to deal

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.109
with your customers at scale.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.580
So starting today,
we have a new API

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.250
available among the
API's part of the Play

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.100
develop experience that
lets you fetch and reply

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.560
to your users' reviews with just
a handful, a couple of lines

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.820
of code.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.070
If you're not in the mood
of writing a couple of lines

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.650
of code, we also have
integrations, zero effort,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.830
available out of
the box with some

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.180
of the most popular customer
management solutions

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.500
out there, like Zendesk
and Conversocial.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.350
So if you're using
Zendesk, for example,

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.980
you can just go to
your Zendesk account,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.080
with a couple of clicks
link it with Play,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.190
and start receiving your
reviews directly in Zendesk.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.350
Integrate them with your flow
in there, reply from there,

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.000
and see them be propagated
live in the Play Store

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.550
within seconds.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.350
Responding to your users,
let me say once more,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.380
is really, really important.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.790
Here is another data
point that we noticed.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.140
Users that come and update
their star rating after you

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.680
have engaged with them,
after you have responded

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.090
to their review,
on average increase

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.350
their star rating by 0.71 stars.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.170
And this is pretty
significant because it's

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.350
the difference between
a four star app

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:42.140
and a 4.7 star app, which can
be really, really massive.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.520
So we've covered a
ton of stuff so far.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.500
From while you're
still developing

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.530
your up to when your live,
from telemetry and crash

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.770
reporting to managing
user reviews.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.000
I would like now to have
Shaniel as the CEO of Halfbrick,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.432
creator of great apps like
Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride,

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:02.140
give a demonstration
of how they're using

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.100
the feature in their own world.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.410
SHAINIEL DEO: Thanks Ricardo.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.190
Hey, guys, I'm going to give
you a few demonstrations of how

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.240
we're using some of
these tools at Halfbrick.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.020
Just to give you guys
some idea of what

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.989
I'm trying to do with reviews in
customer service at Halfbrick.

00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:23.155
We have a goal where we try
and have all of our apps

00:19:23.155 --> 00:19:26.230
at 4.5 stars or greater.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.740
So it's a pretty lofty goal.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.226
And I guess it's one that we're
trying to find new ways to sort

00:19:31.226 --> 00:19:31.726
of hit.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.520
So I'm going to show you
how we're using the Zendesk

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.480
integration as well as
the Pre-launch Reports

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.810
and the reviews analysis tool.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:50.800
So who uses Zendesk here
for their customer support?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.690
OK.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.957
And who actually replies
to their Google Reviews.

00:19:55.957 --> 00:19:56.790
OK, a lot of people.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.050
That's really great.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.250
So one of the things that
I'm going to show you

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:08.520
is how easy it is to pipe in
all of your Google Play reviews

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.360
into Zendesk and then
actually reply to them.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:18.650
So I'll start off by creating a
new review for Jetpack Joyride.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.500
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.720
So I'm filtering out four
and five star reviews.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.220
So I'll give it a
three star review.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.594
Hopefully this
will come through.

00:20:27.594 --> 00:20:29.500
So let's see how we go.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.460
I think it's worth more
than three stars by the way.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.620
OK, so for this particular
one I'll just put in a review.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.622
Just say I'm addicted
to this game.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:53.802
But, I'd love to
save my high scores.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.230
OK, so let's submit that.

00:21:14.014 --> 00:21:16.430
And I guess it's going to take
a little time to submit it.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.180
But then it will take
a little bit of time

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.990
to come through into
Zendesk as well.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.660
And if it doesn't,
I have a backup one

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.120
that I've created previously.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.570
So let's see how we go.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.330
All right, maybe I might go
to the pre-generated one.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.136
Let's see that.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.420
Hang on a second.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.590
OK, so this is a review there
that we put in previously.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.600
And it's come
through to Zendesk.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.200
So what I'll do is, for those
of you that have used Zendesk,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.240
you can set up macros that
allow you to reply real easily.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:08.130
So I've created one previously,
which is-- let me see.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:22.010
So OK, the review that I put in
was about saving high scores.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.359
So this is pre-populated one is
about how to actually do that.

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:26.400
So we'll just go through.

00:22:29.022 --> 00:22:30.525
We'll submit this as pending.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.530
And then we will click through
to the Google Play Store.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:56.099
And as you can see, the response
that I put in previously

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:57.390
has come through straight away.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:03.225
So, you know, talking to
our customer support agents,

00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:04.850
one of the things
that I stress to them

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.660
is I want them to reply to
pretty much every single one

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.390
star review that comes in.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.776
And they were doing a lot
of this manually themselves.

00:23:11.776 --> 00:23:15.410
But after using this for
one week, one of the quotes

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.230
that they said
was-- you know, one

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.980
of the statistics that
they really look at

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.720
is that first touch
time statistic.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.990
And they said, when this feature
came through their first touch

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.420
time statistic for the
initial week was implemented

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.115
was still within their KPI,
which is less than 24 hours.

00:23:34.115 --> 00:23:37.360
So they were able to handle
all of their existing

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.530
volume of support requests,
which is quite a number.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.140
I think Jetpack
has over 3 million

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.690
reviews as well as lots
of tickets that come in.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.350
But they managed to
handle that as well

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.560
as respond to the Google Play
reviews all within 24 hours.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.700
So it's a really,
really amazing feature.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.110
And our guys really love it.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.330
So I guess that's one side of
the equation, which is actually

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.317
responding to reviews and
tickets as they come in.

00:24:05.317 --> 00:24:07.150
The other thing that's
really crucial for us

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.440
is to actually
analyze the reviews.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.380
And as part of trying
to hit 4.5 stars,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.960
we've created a
whole bunch of tools

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.896
that our guys use to
actually try and make

00:24:17.896 --> 00:24:19.770
some sense of the reviews
that are coming in.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.390
So as I mentioned, Jetpack has
a lot of reviews every day.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:30.546
So if we jump across to--
just give me a second here.

00:24:30.546 --> 00:24:33.040
OK, that one's frozen.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.960
If we jump to the
Developer Console-- OK,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.775
so if we go to the
Reviews and Ratings.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.640
As you can see, here is
the reviews analysis tab.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.170
So as Ricardo mentioned,
there's a number of things here.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.120
There's the review
highlights, which

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.830
is really good to
see it gives you

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.760
a quick sort of idea of
what's going on with the app.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.100
But the thing that's more
important for our guys

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.610
is the benchmarks
because really it

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.970
goes to show you which
areas of your app

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.760
are not doing so favorably.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.066
And as you can see here,
stability is obviously

00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:17.190
one of the biggest factors.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.200
And I guess the stats that the
guy shared clearly shows that.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.527
So, stability is
one thing, but it's

00:25:23.527 --> 00:25:25.110
hard to figure out
what it is exactly.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.609
I mean you can look
at crash reports

00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:27.970
and various other things.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.280
But this tool really allows
you to drill down quite easily.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:39.170
So we can look at--
obviously, click on stability

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.070
and see the various
reviews that come through.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.305
So there's a number
of different reviews.

00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:45.930
I think one of the
things that I really

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.660
like is the fact that you
can, obviously filter these.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.470
And once again.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.800
One of the go to's is to look
at the one star sort of ratings.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:02.000
So if you look here,
most of it will be based

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.524
around various crash issues.

00:26:03.524 --> 00:26:04.940
You can see, our
guys are actually

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.495
replying to all
of these reviews.

00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:10.487
So, 17th of May, I think
that was yesterday.

00:26:10.487 --> 00:26:12.070
They're just going
through and they're

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.430
responding to all of these.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.950
So, most of these reviews
are OK, the thing is buggy.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.476
And that can only
tell you so much.

00:26:20.476 --> 00:26:22.600
So one of the other areas
that's really interesting

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.830
is the topics that
people are talking about.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.690
And I know that with Star Skater
in particular, when we released

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.090
it, one of the key issues that
we had was around the controls.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.170
And so you can see here
that actually controls

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.830
is the number one factor
that's affecting our ratings.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.370
So once again, you
can jump in and you

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.540
can have a look at
control issues as well.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.674
So the filter that I put on is
already there, the one star.

00:26:46.674 --> 00:26:48.090
You can go through
and have a look

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.210
at all of the different
issues that people

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.390
are having with controls.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.130
Sometimes people just say,
OK, the controls suck.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.760
But other times you find some
really useful information

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.440
in here as well.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.130
And it really allows
our guys to hone

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.990
in on the key things
that are going to impact

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.580
on improving their reviews.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:11.287
So once again, we have
internal tools for this part.

00:27:11.287 --> 00:27:12.870
You know, these tools
in the developer

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.192
console just save us so
much time, and particularly

00:27:15.192 --> 00:27:17.400
for our larger games where
there are so many reviews.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.610
It's really hard.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.450
We don't have the
machine learning

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.830
to process all of
that information

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.330
and give us the key insights.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.190
So it's a really good tool.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:31.110
And I think we'll see over
the coming months how it just

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.960
helps us reach our
target of 4.5 stars.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.070
So OK, the last tool
that I wanted to show you

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.210
is the Pre-launch Report.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.010
And we have an internal
queue QA team at Halfbrick

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.680
And the way they
work is they wait

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.630
until a build is being
submitted or uploaded

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.706
before they start testing.

00:27:52.706 --> 00:27:55.080
And one of the first things
that they do is a smoke test.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.910
And so we can't cover 10 devices
within a short amount of time.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.110
So this has been really,
really helpful for us.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.160
So you can see here the
latest build that they

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.390
uploaded of Star Skater.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.960
Had a problem on the Nexus
5 with the Android version

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.940
5.1 so Nexus 5 with Android
version 4.4 was fine.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.220
But obviously, the
problem was with 5.1.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.910
So this saves a lot of time.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.350
Our guys don't even
have to start QA-ing

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.080
until they get a bill
that sort of passes some

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.490
of the tests on these devices.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:37.130
So similarly with
the screen shots,

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.860
one of the other tools that
we really invested a lot into

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.310
was how to go about supporting
all the different aspect ratios

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.400
and form factors of devices.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.250
So I might switch
to another app here.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.130
Let's look at Dan the man,
which is still in Soft Launch.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:04.420
So quickly jump to
the Pre-launch Report.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.450
So it crashes, no crashes,
which is really good.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.580
Screenshots, so
we can have a look

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.700
and see the various screenshots
in the different form factors.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.120
So, obviously this
is something that you

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.710
can mess up quite easily.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.610
I don't think we
currently support

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.700
languages other than
English at this point.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.180
So we're not really getting
a good read on that.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.080
But we can see, OK, all the
aspect ratios look pretty good.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.171
All the different form
factors look pretty good.

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.170
So once again, this sort
of saves a lot of time.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.210
And we did build these
tools internally.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.420
But they're not
integrated into everything

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.650
around the Developer Console.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.670
So it's not as
efficient for us to use.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:54.140
So the last thing, and this
one is really important for me

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.990
because we have had issues
in the past with security

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.480
for some of our apps.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.620
And typically, these are
some of our older legacy

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.580
apps, which we released the last
update months and months ago.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.810
And now to come back and
actually fix those security

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:11.220
issues is a real nightmare,
because the code base has

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.400
changed so much and you have to
get the thing rebuilding again.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.550
So being able to upload and
get a security scan to say

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.730
everything's OK is great.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.880
Because if there is something
wrong you can fix it then

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.040
and there not have to come back
to it months down the road.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.960
So this is another
really important feature

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.010
that our guys use all the time.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.270
OK, so I guess that's
a quick overview

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.030
of some of these features.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:42.990
My main feedback really is that
these can help you really raise

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.760
the quality bar for your
apps, and the resulting user

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.050
reviews that you get.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.310
So I'd highly recommend
you check them out,

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.800
get familiar with them, and
try and use them as much as you

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.630
cam/ it'll save you a lot
of time and allow you to hit

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.729
your ratings goals that
you set for yourself.

00:30:58.729 --> 00:30:59.270
So thank you.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.230
I'm going to hand
back to Fergus.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.760
Thank you.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.426
FERGUS HURLEY: Thanks
so much, Shainiel.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.730
Great, thanks very
much, Shainiel.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.610
It's always great to
hear from a developer.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.470
Because, as the app
and tool creators,

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.050
we kind of are a bit biased.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.970
So thanks, Shainiel.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.520
So, we've gone over five
different tools today.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.110
And I really encourage you to
take advantage of all of them.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.380
Pre-launch Report for
early on development cycle,

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.650
when you're building that
latest version of your app,

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.090
use Firebase Test Lab.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.850
Then [INAUDIBLE] check,
Pre-launch Report,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.230
then when you're actually
in that phase as well,

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.150
start doing beta testing and
have your private communication

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.900
one to one with
your beta testers

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.120
and without that impacting
your star rating.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.810
Then once you've launched,
start using Firebased Crash

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.320
to monitor your app
out there in the wild

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.030
to see if there are any crashes
that are impacting users

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.850
and they are to see what
crashes are actually

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.100
the most impactful to
the business metrics

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.450
that you care about.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.400
So you can be able to prioritize
which crashes you fix.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.850
The reviews analysis
is really helpful

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.310
to be able to understand
the reviews at scale

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.550
and your functional areas
within your company.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.591
So your designers can go
in, read all the reviews

00:32:13.591 --> 00:32:14.140
about design.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.030
The person who is going to work
on the crashes and stability

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:19.480
of your app can go in , read
all the reviews talking about

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.230
crashes, without having to go
through all the reviews to find

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.680
those ones about crashes.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.170
And the reviews API, so
your customer support team

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.190
can be able to use their
existing workflow of whatever

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.350
customer support tool
they use, Initial Partners

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.460
or is Zendesk, and
Conversocial But I'm

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.180
sure many will follow to be
able to respond to your views

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.000
right there.
