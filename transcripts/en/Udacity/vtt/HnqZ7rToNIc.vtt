00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's not like there are some real similarities between charge and mass.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Specifically, similarities between the electric force and the gravitational.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's do some comparison to see just how similar or how different these forces are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First, let's analyze the cause of each force.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, the electric force is caused by charged objects

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whereas the gravitational force well it's caused by massive objects.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Charge and mass are the causes of these forces.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What about the effect? What kind of object feels the effect of the electric force?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well once again it's an object with a charge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Likewise, gravitational force is felt by objects with mass.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Notice that we already see one similarity.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The thing that causes the force is the same as the thing that feels it. What about the force law?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And by force law I mean what's the equation that describes these forces?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well with gravity we knew the force of gravity was proportional to 1

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
over your distance away from the mass of object that's causing the force.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the case of the earth and the moon, r would be the separation between the two bodies.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
With the electrical force, it turns out the force law is almost identical.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's still proportional to 1 over rÂ². So doubling the distance will decrease the force by a factor of 4.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What about the direction of force? Well for gravity, objects always attract each other.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In fact, it's this attraction that allows large bodies like the earth to form

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because every little tiny chunk of rock is attracted to every other little tiny

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
chunk of rock and together they coalesce and form this wonderful beautiful sphere.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What about with electricity? This is where things get interesting.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
With electricity, the direction is not always attractive. Sometimes it's repulsive.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And this one key difference is responsively for many of the fascinating

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
aspects of electricity which well we can learn about now.
