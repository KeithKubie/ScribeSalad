[Music]

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:19.890
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.527
Thank you to everyone for coming out to this presentation about inaccessible websites.

00:00:24.527 --> 00:00:27.497
And what inaccessible websites mean.

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:30.735
Because people often say, "OK, so websites are inaccessible. What does that mean?"

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.717
"How does that impact on your life?"

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:36.274
And that's what I want to talk about today.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:39.277
Just starting with an overview of assistive technology:

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:44.316
just by a show of hands, how many people would consider themselves at least somewhat familiar

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:48.883
or somewhat comfortable with even the idea of assistive technology, by a show of hands.

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:51.056
OK, so about half the audience.

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:57.359
So let's talk about that. You could really split it up into three different types of assistive technology.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.131
One, assistive technology for transportation—

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:04.236
so things like power wheelchairs, things that
 help you walk, electronic prosthetics.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:07.804
You've got assistive technology for communication—

00:01:07.804 --> 00:01:12.009
So, if you think about someone who either
 can't speak or someone who can't sign,

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.515
or has trouble communicating, and they maybe have technology that helps them communicate.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:21.887
Right? So if you think about, for instance, Stephen Hawking, right, using a computer to communicate.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:26.863
But there's a third area, and that's assistive technology for access to information,

00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:28.693
and that's what I want to talk about.

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:34.942
I want to talk about people with disabilities, who use different types of computer input or computer output

00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:40.137
to access the same information on the web.

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:42.876
What is web accessibility? Let's talk about that.

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:47.782
But before we talk about it, I just want to pass out 
two devices here, so you kind of get an idea

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:53.984
of what someone might use if they are not
 using a traditional keyboard and mouse.

00:01:53.984 --> 00:02:02.493
So, first of all, this is orbiTouch. This is a keyboard for someone who does not have use of their fingers,

00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:05.731
but maybe has use of their hands, kind of like this.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:11.669
So let's say if you have extreme arthritis—don't have use of your fingers, you can move this keybowl

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:16.540
right, eight directions basically on each one 
of these bowls, so you have a total of 64,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.678
you have enough for a keyboard, 
and in fact, what I'm going to do,

00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:24.315
here is a little guide to using this, so I'm 
going to pass this around, start on one side.

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:28.318
So this is basically a keyboard for someone
 who doesn't have use of their fingers.

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:34.058
So, here you go, if I can give that to you, 
and we will wrap up the cord here.

00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:35.781
This is relatively inexpensive.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:40.040
If you are going to drop something and break something, please break this one. [Laughter]

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.734
This is only about, that's only about 
three hundred, four hundred dollars.

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:47.037
Oh I didn't mean you breaking it. I mean, 
just in general, someone breaking it. [Laughter]

00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:51.375
Now, this is the one, please don't drop.
 This is a refreshable Braille display,

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:54.178
and this is on loan from Harvard University.

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:57.716
So, what it is, notice there is a little thumb
wheel here, and as you move it up,

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:01.276
you can feel lines of Braille.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:05.123
So, please be careful. This one's about, what
 would you say, about five thousand dollars?

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:09.526
Around five, somewhere, about five thousand,
 so please be careful with this. [Laughter]

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:14.892
That's right, I trust you.
That's why I gave it to you first.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.193
So, people with various types of disabilities 
often use different input or output devices.

00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:24.646
So that maybe, for instance, the keyball there,

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:27.731
it may be the refreshable Braille display for output.

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.385
It can be, for instance, 
you see over here on CNN,

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:34.439
there's captioning right there,
 on a video on CNN, right there.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.621
So that is, basically, that's captioning—that's output.

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:41.826
There's a picture of me using speech 
recognition to do speech input—

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:45.396
you see here the keyball and 
the refreshable Braille display.

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:46.779
And there are other ways, as well.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.292
There are, sometimes, people may use a keyboard

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:54.072
but may not be able to use a mouse or a pointing device, sometimes people with motor impairments.

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:57.876
Even things like repetitive strain injury, you know, 
if you've gotten, uh, or repetitive strain,

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.443
I know I've gotten one or two in my life.

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:05.450
So, you've got screen readers, which are speech output, which blind people can use to listen.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.527
So there's lots of different technologies, lots of different input/output approaches that can be used.

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:15.210
And what you want to make sure is 
that a web page is flexible enough

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.894
to work with all of these
 different input and output devices.

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:23.636
OK, so, accessibility doesn't change 
the look or feel of a webpage.

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:26.538
If you don't have a disability, you can't 
look at a webpage and say,

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:29.442
"Aha! That one is accessible, that one is not."

00:04:29.442 --> 00:04:32.609
It's in the back-end coding. 
It doesn't change the appearance.

00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:36.313
It's having the right labels, 
it's having the right markup.

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:39.349
OK, and accessible does not mean text only.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.988
So, the idea is that, it's just
 following a good coding standard.

00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:47.725
So, for websites, right now, there are 
two sets of standards out there.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:51.761
One is from Section 508 of the 
Rehab Act from the United States.

00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.455
The other, the web content
 accessibility guidelines

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:57.418
from the World Wide Web Consortium 
and the web accessibility initiative.

00:04:57.418 --> 00:05:03.206
And, as an example, of what type of guideline,
 what would you do to make it accessible,

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.576
well, here's an example from the standards.

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:11.383
Provide text alternatives for any non-text content.
 So if you have a picture, label it.

00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:16.619
Make sure you can still have as many pictures 
as you want, just label the picture properly.

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:22.026
And so, to give you an example of how people 
use assistive technology in accessing websites,

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:27.579
I'm going to introduce you to three friends of mine, and just tell a short story about each one.

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:35.874
So this is my friend, Rachel Dubin. 
Rachel is a researcher at a think tank.

00:05:35.874 --> 00:05:36.832
Judy, you'll appreciate this.

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.637
You're always referring to me as
 the camp counselor of the group.

00:05:39.637 --> 00:05:44.010
Well, I actually worked with Rachel at summer camp about 20 years ago, 25 years ago. [Laughter]

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.611
So Rachel and I were actually camp counselors together. [Laughter]

00:05:47.634 --> 00:05:51.622
So, Rachel has had profound hearing loss 
since she was five years old.

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:55.926
She speaks four languages, but ASL is not
 one of them. She doesn't use sign language.

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:58.561
She uses two cochlear implants.

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.601
And so, when she visits websites,

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:05.002
and she actually works in DC doing, 
we'll say, diplomacy type of work

00:06:05.002 --> 00:06:07.571
and so, this is a perfect example of what she needs.

00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:14.144
Here's a video of Hamid Karzai and President Obama and so she needs the captioning on that video.

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:16.145
That's a video from the State Department.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:19.111
So she needs the captioning so
 she can hear what's going on.

00:06:22.572 --> 00:06:24.687
Next we have Mark Riccobono.

00:06:24.687 --> 00:06:28.591
Mark is the executive director of the 
Jernigan Institute for Research and Training

00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.526
at the National Federation of the Blind.

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:35.400
So, Mark is blind, and he uses screen reader software, which is speech output.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.403
He uses screen reader software to listen 
to what appears on the screen.

00:06:39.403 --> 00:06:44.026
He uses it to manage banking and bills, to get information from his son's elementary school.

00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:45.840
And I'm going to play a short clip.

00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:53.314
So this is actually a clip of what a portion of the Radcliffe Institute homepage sounds like.

00:06:53.637 --> 00:06:55.859
Let's see, did it come back up? Yea, OK, good.

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:58.410
So this is a short clip. This is not the whole page.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:04.360
[Automated voice]
 Page has 14 headings and 157 links.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.005
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study
 at Harvard University

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:11.243
Vertical bar, home page, page link, jump to navigation

00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:15.169
Visited link Radcliffe home, 
list of three items, visited link home.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.695
Link make a gift, link subscribe to news, 
[inaudible] heading level two search form search.

00:07:21.464 --> 00:07:25.482
OK, so that's an example of the speech 
output he would hear when listening

00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:27.818
to the Radcliffe Institute homepage.

00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:32.791
Now let me say, most people who are 
experienced screen reader users, like Mark—

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:35.459
you know, Mark's been using a
 screen reader also for about 20 years—

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:38.452
most people are not going 
to listen to the entire page.

00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:40.651
They'll use a series of navigation techniques.

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:44.865
So he'll either browse through headings on a page, he'll do a keyword search,

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.536
you know, he has a lot of sort of quick techniques.

00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:48.457
He'll listen to only the links,

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:50.998
so that's how he'll navigate the page.

00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:56.214
And also, by the way, one quick note, Mark, Mark Riccobono is also well-known as the blind driver.

00:07:56.214 --> 00:07:58.138
If you've heard about the blind driver challenge,

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:01.718
where they had a blind person
 driving a car around Daytona,

00:08:01.718 --> 00:08:03.570
so Mark is actually that blind driver.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.881
This is not the Google car project.

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:07.915
[Laughter] 
This is, no no, this is not the car—

00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:10.738
no, but Google's working on cars
that drive themselves.

00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:14.793
Mark actually drove the car 
using non-visual techniques,

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:18.092
using sensors in the seat and on his wrists,
 and he drove around Daytona.

00:08:18.092 --> 00:08:22.942
If you haven't . . . how many people looked at the video of Mark driving the car? Anyone? On YouTube?

00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:25.410
Michael Stein! OK, we have one.
 Can I make a suggestion?

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.109
If you want a fascinating video,
 search on blind driver challenge.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.449
You know, don't do it yet on your phone. 
I mean, wait until I'm finished presenting.

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:34.118
[Laughter]
 But afterwards, you can do it.

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:38.855
So what they did is like, they threw boxes out and 
he swerved to miss the boxes. It's really cool.

00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:47.332
OK, and the third person here, 
Barbara Schaffer, who's an artist,

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:50.200
and Barbara's actually the mother of one of
 my summer camp friends, so there you go,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.569
there's like, there's the camp theme.

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:55.135
And so, Barbara's an artist.

00:08:55.135 --> 00:09:00.543
She has rheumatoid arthritis, a broken spine,
 and a stroke which left her with aphasia.

00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:04.012
And so, she has limited use of her hands,
 especially her fingers,

00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:09.568
so she uses speech recognition to do things 
like dictate documents and email messages.

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:12.384
We also tried the . . . who has the key bowl now? 
It's back there?

00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:16.416
We actually tried the key bowl with her.
 She didn't like the key bowl. But we did try it.

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:21.565
So, here's three of my friends who use
 assistive technology. That's how they use it,

00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:24.091
and you might say, "Why is it so important"

00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:32.477
"that people with disabilities have access to the
 same content, the same price, at the same time?"

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.776
Well, I'll tell you why. I'll start with a great story.

00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:39.525
So, I was speaking on a 
National Public Radio show in DC.

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:44.188
And normally, when they do shows
 on topics like assistive technology,

00:09:44.188 --> 00:09:48.559
they make sure they do live captioning on the show. Well, the live captioning wasn't working.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:53.034
So they did a whole radio show on assistive technology and essentially cut people who were

00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:56.733
deaf or hard of hearing out of taking part, 
out of emailing in . . .

00:09:56.733 --> 00:10:01.775
What happened is that they posted a transcript two days later of what happened on the radio show.

00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:05.862
Guess what? Two days later,
 you couldn't send emails in to ask questions.

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:08.011
They were cut out of the show.

00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:13.483
On average, you see a three-year delay between when a technology is put in place inaccessibly

00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:14.751
and when it's made accessible.

00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.388
So when a company says, "Well, yup, we know
 it's not accessible, but we're going to work on it."

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:20.824
On average, that's a three-year delay.

00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:24.994
That's a three-year advantage that
 people without disabilities will get.

00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:30.400
So you want to make sure that when you introduce any type of technology, any type of website,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.803
that you make it born accessible.

00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:38.940
One of the biggest problems is 
at universities, in high school, in middle school,

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.281
when kids with print disabilities don't actually
 get their textbook in an accessible format

00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:46.548
until week eight or week nine.

00:10:46.548 --> 00:10:49.921
Guess what? How would you do without 
the textbook until week nine? Right?

00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.022
It puts you at a disadvantage.

00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:55.759
Think about the value of information.
 Right? It drops over time.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.661
You know, we had this big snowstorm.

00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:01.231
What happens if you got the weather alert
 or the "Please evacuate your neighborhood,"

00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:03.700
but you got it three days later.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.779
It doesn't mean anything three days later.
You've already missed out.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:10.698
You saw that a lot with Hurricane Katrina, 
where people with disabilities did not get

00:11:10.698 --> 00:11:13.309
the emergency information in a timely manner.

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:16.761
So that information isn't worth anything a week later.

00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:21.419
Hey guess what, we're going to have a snowstorm, it's going to be two feet, and you found out today.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.439
I mean, it's ludicrous.

00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:32.062
So people with disabilities need access to 
the same information, the same content, right?

00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:35.065
Maybe it's in a different format, 
maybe it's large print, maybe it's Braille,

00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:38.869
but they need access to the same content,
 not different content.

00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:42.806
And guess what,
 most digital content starts out accessibly.

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:45.042
We add the barriers.

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:51.023
Now, a great example of why we need 
access to the same content is captioning.

00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:56.319
People who are deaf or hard of hearing want 
the same, verbatim, captioning.

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:58.988
They don't want summarized captioning.

00:11:58.988 --> 00:12:01.605
They don't want something different.
 They want access to the same text.

00:12:01.605 --> 00:12:04.629
They can judge for themselves whether or not 
they want to read through all of it.

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:06.130
But they don't want a summarized version.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.803
They view that very much as someone is 
taking away their right to get the real information,

00:12:11.803 --> 00:12:14.805
someone is really summarizing it 
and taking away that right.

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:20.076
You see when you talk to companies and you say, 
"Look, the website doesn't work. It's not accessible."

00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:23.810
They say, "Oh, but it's okay. 
Use our mobile version instead."

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.901
"That's accessible. The full website is not accessible."

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.886
Well, guess what? The mobile version usually only has about a third of the functionality

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:33.254
that the full website version has.

00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:37.190
Did anyone hear the big news announcement
 about Monster.com in the last few weeks

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.773
and the Massachusetts Attorney General? 
Anyone hear that?

00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:45.023
No one? Oh, I was going to say—you sent me
 an email about it, so I know, I know you've heard it.

00:12:45.023 --> 00:12:48.469
So, think about this for a minute.

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:49.906
Think about this:

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:56.180
If you want to go to Monster.com, the big job search website, you want to find out what jobs are available,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.083
but when you go, the website's not accessible.
You can call Monster on the phone.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:05.521
It's not very likely that they're going to read you the
300 jobs opening, you know,

00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:07.493
that are open in your, in your area.

00:13:07.493 --> 00:13:11.127
So there was actually a settlement recently 
between Monster.com and the

00:13:11.127 --> 00:13:16.039
Massachusetts Attorney General, where they agreed to make Monster.com accessible.

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:20.202
They agreed to make the website accessible
 because otherwise, I mean, it's ludicrous.

00:13:20.202 --> 00:13:24.226
You can't get the same content by
 calling on the phone or using a TTY.

00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:27.911
They're not going to read you 
300 job ads over the phone.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:34.250
So these are all really important concepts of 
same time, same content, and the same price.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.220
Have you ever called an airline and they say,
 while you're put on hold,

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.725
"Lower fares may be available on our website."

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:46.162
Well, guess what? Most people have heard that
 when you've called them, right? Guess what?

00:13:46.162 --> 00:13:50.499
If you can't use the website,
 you can't get the lowest fare.

00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:53.004
There's a great example of 
a settlement with MegaBus.

00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:57.374
The Justice Department had a settlement with MegaBus. Are you all familiar with MegaBus?

00:13:57.374 --> 00:13:59.041
You know, they're the buses that go in the northeast.

00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:03.836
They have the big signs on the back:
 "Fares low as one dollar! Website only."

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:09.187
So guess what? You can't get the one-dollar fares. And their website wasn't accessible, so,

00:14:09.187 --> 00:14:12.689
if you couldn't use their website, 
you couldn't get the one-dollar fares.

00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:14.891
And that was part of the settlement
 with the Justice Department.

00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:21.502
When stores have web-only prices, guess what? 
If it's a web-only price, and the website doesn't work,

00:14:21.502 --> 00:14:23.567
you can't get that price.

00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:25.602
When you have to use a call center
 and get charged an extra fee,

00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:30.907
there's all these situations where really, you wind up, if you don't have access to their website,

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:33.911
you generally get charged more.

00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:37.948
And that's why I say separate access 
to information is inherently unequal.

00:14:37.948 --> 00:14:41.652
If you look back at the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, right, and they talk about

00:14:41.652 --> 00:14:44.689
that separate schools are inherently unequal, 
well guess what?

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:50.560
If you don't have access to the same digital content, it's inherently unequal. Okay?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.214
Regardless of where in history you look,

00:14:52.214 --> 00:14:55.633
if you want to look at Emily Davies
 and the history of fighting for women's education,

00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:59.069
if you want to talk about
 Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP,

00:14:59.069 --> 00:15:05.343
the idea, that disability groups have really pushed
 for many years, is integration not segregation.

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:09.946
So they talk about community-based living, 
right, not going into institutions.

00:15:09.946 --> 00:15:12.501
They talk about mainstream education 
in the classroom.

00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.835
They talk about public transportation, buses in Boston that you can go on in a wheelchair

00:15:16.835 --> 00:15:20.291
rather than calling paratransit, 
which is a separate service and

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.762
you are segregated from the mainstream public.

00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:26.591
Even seating in a movie theater. 
Under the American with Disabilities Act,

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:28.576
they have to spread out
 wheelchair-accessible seating.

00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:31.179
They can't just say,
 "OK, here's the wheelchair section.

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:33.271
All the people in wheelchairs sit here."

00:15:33.271 --> 00:15:37.685
So really, you have a situation
 where you want to have integration.

00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:44.014
Because inaccessible websites reduce 
the quality of life for people with disabilities.

00:15:44.014 --> 00:15:45.107
That's the main idea here.

00:15:45.107 --> 00:15:47.748
Inaccessible websites reduce the quality of life.

00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:51.750
It's not theory, this is not a hypothetical situation,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.890
this is real discrimination occurring every day.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:01.363
Discrimination like pricing discrimination.
 And employment discrimination.

00:16:01.363 --> 00:16:05.937
Lack of access to reading materials. You can't take part in social networking. You can't form communities.

00:16:05.937 --> 00:16:11.764
How much of our life is digital? And if you're excluded from that, how much are you excluded from life?

00:16:11.764 --> 00:16:14.312
These are real barriers.
They're not always obvious.

00:16:14.312 --> 00:16:16.911
Before this talk, how many people,
 by show of hands,

00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:20.503
were generally familiar with all these
 problems related to accessibility?

00:16:20.503 --> 00:16:23.199
How many people were familiar,
 by show of hands?

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.849
OK. They're not,
 and many of you are not,

00:16:26.849 --> 00:16:31.301
these are not always obvious barriers,
but they are real barriers.

00:16:33.317 --> 00:16:35.464
So let's talk about some of the laws in the US

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:40.758
that relate to technology access 
for people with disabilities.

00:16:40.758 --> 00:16:43.703
You've got Section 504,
 the Rehab Act from 1973,

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:45.941
one of the early disability rights laws,

00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:49.846
which basically says that you may not 
discriminate against people with disabilities

00:16:49.846 --> 00:16:52.449
in any program that is federally funded.

00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:55.752
You've got Section 508
 of the Rehab Act from 1998

00:16:55.752 --> 00:17:00.590
which says that any technology procured, 
acquired, developed, built, or anything else,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.962
by the federal government,
 must be accessible to people with disabilities.

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.825
You've got the Americans with Disabilities Act,

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.825
which is probably the one 
most people are familiar with, right?

00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:10.995
By show of hands, how many people 
are familiar with ADA?

00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:16.273
You've at least heard of it. OK, and now while 
the web was not mentioned originally in the ADA,

00:17:16.273 --> 00:17:21.878
the Justice Department has said for years that it does apply to public websites, of public accommodations.

00:17:21.878 --> 00:17:27.116
A number of court rulings, like the Netflix and 
the Target cases, have said that it does apply.

00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:32.275
And you've got the newest law, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act,

00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:38.828
and that relates to things like accessibility of smartphones and streaming video, and voiceover IP,

00:17:38.828 --> 00:17:42.667
and emergency information, so that basically,
 new communications technologies.

00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:44.426
You actually have a number of other laws

00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:49.063
that either are not technology 
or not disability-focused per se,

00:17:49.063 --> 00:17:51.641
but they have components, 
like the Help America Vote Act,

00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:56.047
which talks about making sure each polling place 
has at least one accessible voting machine.

00:17:56.047 --> 00:18:00.149
IDEA, from education, 
which talks about assistive technology

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:03.319
as a part of an individualized education program.

00:18:03.319 --> 00:18:06.656
You even got regulations,
 like from the Department of Transportation,

00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:10.393
the non-discrimination on 
the basis of disability in air travel.

00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:13.294
So you've got all these laws,

00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:16.630
even ones that don't immediately appear 
to be related to technology or disability,

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.177
that impact on technology and disability.

00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:25.585
Now you might say, "Now Jonathan, 
this sounds great. Wonderful. I like it."

00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:28.921
"But how do we design for everyone? 
We can't design for everyone."

00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:34.088
Well, guess what?
 You can design for most people with disabilities.

00:18:34.088 --> 00:18:36.574
Are there some that we haven't 
solved as computer scientists yet?

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.170
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.357
But, I mean, if you look, human-computer interaction research, we have over a 30-year tradition

00:18:42.357 --> 00:18:46.462
of perceptual and motor impairment research,
 so research perceptual impairment,

00:18:46.462 --> 00:18:50.868
people who are either, um, perceptual, 
for instance, deaf or hard of hearing,

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:54.003
people who are low-vision or blind, 
people with motor impairments,

00:18:54.003 --> 00:18:58.443
who have limited use of fingers,
 hands, arms, or speech.

00:18:58.443 --> 00:19:03.086
And we've actually been starting as a community to get involved with cognitive impairment as well.

00:19:03.086 --> 00:19:07.816
So, some people call it cognitive impairment,
 some call it intellectual disabilities,

00:19:07.816 --> 00:19:10.168
you have a number of research groups 
that are working on this.

00:19:10.168 --> 00:19:13.890
So my research group is working on people 
with Down syndrome and web access,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.586
there are a number of groups that 
are working on autism.

00:19:16.586 --> 00:19:20.963
And the technical guidelines are now starting to address some aspects of cognitive impairment.

00:19:20.963 --> 00:19:23.085
Are we there yet, at a 100 percent? No.

00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:27.937
Does that mean we can help two-thirds of people 
out there with improved guidelines? Absolutely.

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:32.918
Note, also, that there are a number of disabilities 
that are covered under the ADA,

00:19:32.918 --> 00:19:35.003
that have nothing to do with technology.

00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:38.047
Or at least don't impact what 
we're talking about here with web access.

00:19:38.047 --> 00:19:42.019
So, things like diabetes, anxiety,
 AIDS, gluten-intolerance.

00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:46.252
These are all things covered 
as disabilities under the ADA

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:49.560
but none of those change the input or output design.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.963
So at least from our point of view as researchers, 
at this point, we don't need to worry about that

00:19:53.963 --> 00:19:58.368
as computer scientists, although maybe we'll find 
over time that there are some differences.

00:19:58.368 --> 00:20:04.307
But the point is, we can help so many people with improved interface design, and there's so little work

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:08.123
that's being done to understand 
how it impacts on people.

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:12.062
Not just the technical side, but 
how does it impact the quality of life?

00:20:12.062 --> 00:20:18.555
So I'm going to talk with you about five projects 
that I've done with my research team,

00:20:18.555 --> 00:20:21.423
some projects at Towson,
 some projects here at Harvard.

00:20:21.423 --> 00:20:28.632
And I'll talk about these five projects that kind of give you a sense of how it impacts on the quality of life

00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:29.966
and where the problems are.

00:20:29.966 --> 00:20:34.003
We're going to talk about federal, state, and 
also emergency alerts at the county level,

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:37.307
airline website pricing, and applying for jobs online.

00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:41.612
First, let's talk about federal-level web accessibility.

00:20:41.612 --> 00:20:48.586
OK, in terms of Section 508 of the Rehab Act,
 Section 508 says that all technology developed,

00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:52.856
procured, maintained, or used by the federal government must be accessible.

00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:56.260
Basically, if federal dollars are purchasing
 federal technology, it must be accessible.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.569
And this is true for not only 
public-facing systems like websites,

00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:03.600
but also internal systems for federal employees.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.771
We have technical guidelines. Compliance, though, 
has been beginning since the start.

00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:12.841
And so, it's been a problem. Federal agencies 
have not complied with the regulation.

00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:19.248
So in 2010, we actually evaluated 100 federal homepages for Section 508 compliance,

00:21:19.248 --> 00:21:24.069
using a combination of human experts,
 who would examine each page and, you know,

00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:26.891
using assistive technologies 
and examining the code.

00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.512
And also, we used two different 
automated software tools.

00:21:30.512 --> 00:21:34.698
Now, to give you a sense of the problem,
 with our human inspections,

00:21:34.698 --> 00:21:38.935
96 of the 100 federal homepages 
had accessibility problems.

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:43.106
According to the automated software tools we used, 92 of the 100 pages had problems.

00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:47.576
So basically, this was a problem.
 But the solutions are easy to solve.

00:21:47.576 --> 00:21:49.697
Really. I mean, look at it.
The solutions are very easy to do.

00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:52.516
I'll give you an example of 
the type of problem, right here.

00:21:52.516 --> 00:21:59.867
So, on the White House homepage, in 2010, there was a picture of Michelle Obama. Right?

00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:05.328
So, you should have that markup properly as,
 you know, or the alternative text should be,

00:22:05.328 --> 00:22:08.698
"Michelle Obama" or 
"Picture" or "image of Michelle Obama."

00:22:08.698 --> 00:22:12.137
Here's what you heard 
if you were using a screen reader:

00:22:12.137 --> 00:22:15.553
"Zero, underline, [inaudible] slash, zero, underline, first one, slash, first one, underline,

00:22:15.553 --> 00:22:23.053
slash zero four three seven underline 
one underline zero one two three four."

00:22:24.211 --> 00:22:26.273
Well, that was clear, right?

00:22:26.273 --> 00:22:30.484
We often call those junk links where, 
instead of properly labeling something,

00:22:30.484 --> 00:22:34.291
what they do is, they kind of just put 
in some junk that's the name of the file,

00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:37.116
that's some, some type of random code,
 which is meaningless.

00:22:37.116 --> 00:22:41.531
You hear that, and you say, "Well, what does 
that mean? I don't know what that means."

00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:43.800
That doesn't actually identify it for you.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:51.724
Here's another example in 2010, where ready.gov 
of the FEMA website had this information:

00:22:51.724 --> 00:22:55.257
prepare, plan, and stay informed about hurricanes.

00:22:55.257 --> 00:22:59.403
If you were blind, all you heard was, "01, 02, 03."

00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:02.115
See that little text at the bottom there? The whole thing was Flash-based, and they didn't have

00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:06.856
any equivalent except 01, 02, 03. That was it.

00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:09.744
So it's been a problem.

00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:13.534
And one of the interesting things that
I've gotten to do at the Radcliffe Institute,

00:23:13.534 --> 00:23:17.112
is that, when I first got here, 
I got to analyze FOIA requests—

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:21.014
Freedom of Information Act requests?—
that had been sent around to federal agencies.

00:23:21.014 --> 00:23:25.408
So, here are some of the three choice examples,
 based on all of the material I was looking through.

00:23:25.408 --> 00:23:30.132
From the US Northern Command, 
in an email on March 8, 2012,

00:23:30.132 --> 00:23:33.236
the five-way coordinator there said the following:

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:39.787
I quote, "The current site was maintained by me 
but not set up by me. It was never 508 compliant."

00:23:39.787 --> 00:23:45.662
Again, I quote: "Crap! I wonder why they put the statement on the site that says we're 508 compliant?"

00:23:45.662 --> 00:23:49.366
[Laughter]
 Right?

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:55.203
OK, can you see why it was fascinating to do 
all these, to analyze all these FOIA requests?

00:23:55.203 --> 00:23:59.910
So here's another example: The Department of Labor employees had a whole discussion about

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.781
whether they could qualify for an undue burden, meaning they could avoid the law,

00:24:03.781 --> 00:24:06.984
because they don't have 
any employees with disabilities.

00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:09.751
OK, well, there are a few problems with this.

00:24:09.751 --> 00:24:13.935
First of all, think about it, if you say we don't
 have any people with disabilities working for us,

00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:19.157
and so what we're going to do is buy inaccessible technology, which will mean we've set up barriers

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.999
to hiring anyone with a disability in the future.

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:23.634
You're basically saying, "We want an undue burden"

00:24:23.634 --> 00:24:26.635
"to make sure we don't hire anyone 
with a disability in the future."

00:24:26.635 --> 00:24:30.606
And by the way, did I mention 
this is the Department of Labor?

00:24:30.606 --> 00:24:36.546
People who are in charge with enforcing laws 
related to employment and disability? Right?

00:24:36.546 --> 00:24:41.237
And then, the VA reported in 
one compliance study they did,

00:24:41.237 --> 00:24:45.241
they estimated 97 percent of their 
web content was not accessible.

00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:50.358
Remember, VA: veterans, 
including a lot of veterans with disabilities.

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:56.307
So, you might say, "Wow, this is horrible," right? 
Why is it no one's talking about this more?

00:24:56.307 --> 00:25:01.651
Well, I try to talk about it as much as I can,
 but one of the reasons is that very often,

00:25:01.651 --> 00:25:04.299
federal agencies won't talk 
about what they are doing,

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:07.021
they won't be public about it, 
they won't share with others,

00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:08.724
they try to hide this.

00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:13.317
And, agencies, every federal agency 
uses their own software tool to test,

00:25:13.317 --> 00:25:18.087
they all have, like, 15--20 different 
software tools, right? They don't validate them.

00:25:18.087 --> 00:25:21.225
They don't determine if they're effective or not. 
They just say, "Aha, we have a software tool!"

00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:23.756
"We use it! We have a software tool."

00:25:23.756 --> 00:25:29.132
Each agency creates their own 508 documents, so each agency creates their own documentation.

00:25:29.132 --> 00:25:33.670
Guess what? They're all using HTML, they're all
 using Java, they're all using the same technologies.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.038
You only need one set of documentation.

00:25:36.038 --> 00:25:40.275
Based on what I saw, I would suggest 
taking Department of Homeland Security

00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:44.448
just giving their documentation on 508 to everyone. They've got good documentation.

00:25:44.448 --> 00:25:46.785
And a lot of agencies don't have good documentation.

00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:50.839
There isn't clear guidance on how often 
or what to test for accessibility.

00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:55.421
Agencies won't share, they won't be public, 
even when they're doing a great job.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:59.594
I spent a year bugging this one federal agency who was doing a phenomenal job with 508 compliance

00:25:59.594 --> 00:26:02.864
to share what they were doing,
 and they didn't do so.

00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:04.768
Here's one of the other big problems—

00:26:04.768 --> 00:26:09.506
So, the Justice Department, according to the statute,
 has the requirement, every two years,

00:26:09.506 --> 00:26:13.168
the Department of Justice has 
to do a 508 compliance study.

00:26:13.168 --> 00:26:14.703
Every two years.

00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:18.781
But after 2003, they said,
 "We are not doing these studies anymore."

00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:23.425
"We're not going to do them." Well, guess what? If you say there's speeding limit

00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:28.457
but you say, "Look, I want to be clear. We're no longer ticketing people for speeding on the highway."

00:26:28.457 --> 00:26:31.927
"But we don't want you to speed, but we're not ticketing you, we're not going to enforce."

00:26:31.927 --> 00:26:35.765
Guess what?
 No one's going to worry about enforcement.

00:26:35.765 --> 00:26:38.665
And so, in 2010, they sent out a memo saying,

00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:43.668
"Oops, we goofed. We haven't been following 
the regulation. We're going to do it."

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:49.281
They sent out a survey in 2011, and they got the survey back. They put out a report in September.

00:26:49.281 --> 00:26:55.118
And basically the report showed that a lot of federal agencies were not compliant with Section 508.

00:26:55.118 --> 00:26:58.287
And the most interesting thing, was when they asked, a number of federal agencies said,

00:26:58.287 --> 00:27:03.025
"And we have no plans. We're not going to be compliant in the future either."

00:27:03.025 --> 00:27:07.964
And remember, they told that to the Justice Department, and it was a survey. OK?

00:27:07.964 --> 00:27:09.827
And they were just outwardly saying, "Yeah."

00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:11.662
I mean, they could've said,
 "Oh, it's the Justice Department."

00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:15.271
"Well, we're not doing so currently,
 but we're going to start thinking about it."

00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:19.175
No, the agencies, many of
 the agencies just said, "No."

00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:20.444
It's fascinating.

00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:23.619
So that's the problem at the federal level.

00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:27.813
Just some quick data from the state level—

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:31.184
We examined web accessibility 
in the state of Maryland. Why?

00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:37.085
It's Maryland, that's where I'm from, and that's where
 I have the ability to influence policy makers the most.

00:27:37.085 --> 00:27:41.270
We had done an evaluation study in 2009 
to examine website accessibility.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.768
We looked at the data again, we looked
 at the sites again in 2012. Why?

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:52.271
Between 2009 and 2012, they added a webpage 
template, which was supposed to be accessible.

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:54.777
Look, this is a blank document, 
you see it's a blank document.

00:27:54.777 --> 00:27:58.113
If you think of a style sheet, 
for those of you who are designers, right?

00:27:58.113 --> 00:28:03.120
It's got formatting, it's got color, it's got branding, 
it's got layout, it's got all those things.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.604
So, they instituted this website templating.
 Encouraged agencies to use it.

00:28:07.604 --> 00:28:11.560
We thought, hm, let's see what happened. 
Does it make any difference?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.623
So, for the 15 homepages 
we examined in both years,

00:28:15.623 --> 00:28:19.993
there was a little bit of improvement 
between 2009 and 2012.

00:28:19.993 --> 00:28:24.974
But we also broke it down,
 we looked at many more homepages in 2012

00:28:24.974 --> 00:28:28.076
and compared the ones using 
the template to the ones not using it.

00:28:28.076 --> 00:28:35.384
The ones using the template had an average of
 2.1 violations of paragraphs of the law per homepage.

00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:38.503
The ones not using the template 
had 3.1 violations.

00:28:38.503 --> 00:28:40.013
But that's a little bit misleading. 
Why?

00:28:40.013 --> 00:28:44.727
Because there were two websites that
 were the only two that were fully accessible

00:28:44.727 --> 00:28:45.996
but did not use the template, and that was

00:28:45.996 --> 00:28:49.132
the Library for the Blind and 
Maryland Division of Rehab Services.

00:28:49.132 --> 00:28:52.735
They weren't using the template, but they were 
the only two websites that were fully accessible.

00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:57.474
Take them out of the analysis and those 
not using the template had almost double

00:28:57.474 --> 00:29:01.019
the rate of violations as those using the template.

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:04.681
So clearly the website template has helped.

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:06.297
On to emergency alerts.

00:29:06.297 --> 00:29:09.249
So we're going to do five studies here. 
A brief tour of five different studies.

00:29:09.249 --> 00:29:10.909
This is a study actually I was doing this fall

00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:14.791
with Michael Stein and the
 Harvard Law School project on disability.

00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:19.395
Most counties have emergency alerts where you 
can sign up to receive a text alert on your phone,

00:29:19.395 --> 00:29:24.435
or an email when there's a weather problem,
 when there's a traffic backup, something like this.

00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:26.921
To sign up, you generally go to a webpage,

00:29:26.921 --> 00:29:32.499
you go to one like this for Arundel County or
 this for Boston, you type in some information.

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:38.667
One of the problems, though, is that many of 
these emergency alert signups are inaccessible.

00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:41.195
Guess what?
 They're web-based forms.

00:29:41.195 --> 00:29:44.453
Web-based forms are easy to make accessible. They're not hard.

00:29:44.453 --> 00:29:48.354
It's one of the easiest things, from a 
technical point of view, to do.

00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:53.753
There are maybe ten major providers
 or so, of these services,

00:29:53.753 --> 00:29:56.512
like Cassidian, Cooper Notifications, Everbridge.

00:29:56.512 --> 00:30:00.703
So we examined all of the emergency 
alert signups at the county level

00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:03.873
in Maryland, Massachusetts,
and New York. Why?

00:30:03.873 --> 00:30:08.495
Again, those are states where I live, have lived, or 
have connections and can influence policy makers.

00:30:08.495 --> 00:30:12.049
You always want to use this data
 somehow to influence policy makers.

00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:16.159
So we examined them.
 Now we didn't actually submit to sign up.

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:19.499
We went through every stage, up until the 
"Click here to sign up"

00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:23.244
because from what we understand,
 to submit false data to an emergency,

00:30:23.244 --> 00:30:26.347
to a county emergency, system is
 maybe a little bit problematic.

00:30:26.347 --> 00:30:31.167
So we basically examined all of the steps but we did not actually submit and say, "Sign me up."

00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:34.863
We had a number of people, a number of 
evaluators who looked through each one.

00:30:34.863 --> 00:30:39.900
Guess what? Twenty-one out of the 26 
we looked at had accessibility violations.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.868
And guess what? 
They're really easy.

00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:46.873
So if you look at this example right here, 
this is from Arundel County, Maryland,

00:30:46.873 --> 00:30:49.183
and all of the ones that had CodeRED,

00:30:49.183 --> 00:30:52.653
that used the CodeRED service,
all had some of the same violations.

00:30:52.653 --> 00:30:58.877
For instance, right here, where you have
 1, provide, 2, verify, 3, submit.

00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:01.979
Well, guess what? 
It was highlighted as being a darker shade.

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:06.566
That's the only way you knew that 
that's the stage you were on.

00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:10.414
So, that's the only way you knew that. 
It wouldn't be very hard. Here's the code.

00:31:10.414 --> 00:31:12.798
I decided to throw some code 
into the presentation.

00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:15.900
Here's the code.
The alt tags were 1, 2, 3.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.183
It wouldn't be very hard to change 
the alt tag for the first one to,

00:31:19.183 --> 00:31:23.817
"You're currently at step one to provide your information." This wouldn't be hard.

00:31:23.817 --> 00:31:25.121
This would be easy.

00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:30.459
As another example, this is 
from Howard County, Maryland.

00:31:30.459 --> 00:31:33.241
And note, that if you were
filling out the form visually—

00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:35.794
if you look up there,
it says, the forms says

00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:41.171
to write in your home address, required. 
Home address, parentheses, required.

00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:45.207
OK? So if you can visually see,
 that's what you're told to do.

00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:48.911
If you're using a screen reader, 
here's what it says.

00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:53.948
Remember, home address, and 
in parentheses, required.

00:31:53.948 --> 00:31:58.120
[Automated voice] 
"Tab, supplementary text field edit, type of text."

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.693
Supplementary text field, edit. So it doesn't
 tell you that it's looking for the home address,

00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:06.008
and it also doesn't tell you 
the home address is required.

00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:07.061
Guess what?

00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:11.031
If you're blind, you're probably never going 
to be able to figure out how to get through that.

00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:13.970
Because it keeps telling you it's a 
supplementary text field, OK, it's not required.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.592
These are easy things to fix. Right? 
They're very easy. But, they're not fixed.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.781
Let's talk next about pricing discrimination in airlines.

00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:33.254
So, there's been a Department of Transportation 
ruling in effect since 2009,

00:32:33.254 --> 00:32:36.291
saying airlines don't have to 
make a website accessible,

00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:38.560
but if a website is not accessible,

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.096
then what they need to do is make it so 
you can call or use a TTY and say,

00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:46.570
"Hi, I have a disability, your website doesn't work,
 and I want to book a flight."

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.803
So, you're not supposed to be 
charged a call center fee,

00:32:49.803 --> 00:32:53.304
you're supposed to get the lowest fare
 available on the website at that time.

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:57.343
So, of course, I hear that I think, 
"Ooo, we need to test this."

00:32:57.343 --> 00:33:00.397
So, we examine the ten largest airline websites,

00:33:00.397 --> 00:33:04.496
we found that four of them had 
major accessibility problems. Right?

00:33:04.496 --> 00:33:08.687
And to give you an example of the type of problem, when we did the first evaluation,

00:33:08.687 --> 00:33:13.361
and we did a follow-up recently, the type of problem that occurred is on the JetBlue website here.

00:33:13.361 --> 00:33:19.260
Where JetBlue, when you're going to type in the city that you want to fly to, you actually can't type it in.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.768
You have to use a mouse pointer,
 or other pointing device, to choose the city.

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:26.900
You could not type it in text.
 You had to use a pointing device.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.507
And guess what?

00:33:27.507 --> 00:33:31.276
Some people, not only people who are blind, 
but some people with motor impairment,

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.773
some people with repetitive strain
 can't use a pointing device.

00:33:33.773 --> 00:33:38.513
So you just need to make it more flexible.
 Right? So they've since fixed this.

00:33:38.513 --> 00:33:45.663
But what we did, we created 15 travel itineraries 
per airline when where you called, right,

00:33:45.663 --> 00:33:48.209
and you said, I want to go
 at a certain, you know, day.

00:33:48.209 --> 00:33:52.758
I want to fly from Baltimore to San Francisco,
 there's only one flight a day.

00:33:52.758 --> 00:33:56.770
Um, you know, here's around when I want to fly.
 There was only one real answer they could give you.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.107
And so what I did is I teamed the students, 
one student would call up and say,

00:34:00.107 --> 00:34:02.842
"Hi, I'm blind, and I want
 to get some flight information."

00:34:02.842 --> 00:34:06.546
"Your website doesn't work for me because I'm blind."

00:34:06.546 --> 00:34:10.317
And another student would be sitting there . . . 
[laughter]

00:34:10.317 --> 00:34:14.521
What? You're laughing but this is classic from, 
I mean, this is classic from civil rights law. Right?

00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:19.091
So the other student would be sitting there 
and continuously checking the price. Right?

00:34:19.091 --> 00:34:22.861
To make sure because, you know, 
airlines change their prices every few minutes.

00:34:22.861 --> 00:34:25.641
So, basically, we had
 one student checking the price,

00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:29.192
the other calling and saying, 
"Hey, I'm blind, your website is inaccessible."

00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:33.296
So we use the same methodology 
in fall, 2009 as 2011.

00:34:33.296 --> 00:34:36.881
Let's start first, with the 2009 results.

00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:40.781
United Airways, right,
 price discriminated a third of the time.

00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:44.873
US Airways price discriminated 40% of the time,
 and higher in some cases.

00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:51.189
So, generally, they didn't charge you a higher fare 
for the flight. What they did, is they said,

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:55.493
"OK, here's the flight price, 
and there's going to be a $25 call center fee."

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:56.115
And our student said,

00:34:56.115 --> 00:35:00.921
"Oh, well, no, no, no. According to the regulation,
 according to the law, you can't charge me that."

00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:03.495
Generally, what happened is the
person at the call center said,

00:35:03.495 --> 00:35:05.333
"Wait, hold on. Let me check with my manager."

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:08.101
You're put on hold, you know,
 you get the little Muzak, then they come back:

00:35:08.101 --> 00:35:10.335
"Yes, sorry, sir, we don't follow that law."

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.245
Seriously.

00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:18.222
The type of things that happened, 
included things like, the person said,

00:35:18.222 --> 00:35:21.649
"Oh, you're blind. I feel bad for you. I'm sorry."

00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:28.328
Or, in one case, or in one case, what actually 
happened, is the person—believe it or not—

00:35:28.328 --> 00:35:32.899
at the call center, started speaking loudly and slowly. [Laughter]

00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:36.167
And you're like, that's just insulting. 
That's just insulting.

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:41.339
So, we did a follow up study on the fall of 2011.
 Again, picked the airlines—same method.

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:46.981
Picked the airlines that had inaccessible websites,
 Alaska Airlines and American actually still

00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:49.982
price discriminated 30 percent of the time.

00:35:49.982 --> 00:35:52.650
But United Airlines, this time, 
had no price discrimination at all.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.324
Can someone tell me why United didn't have any price discrimination? How about Michael Stein?

00:35:57.324 --> 00:35:58.890
[Michael Stein] They got sued.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.365
They got sued by blindness advocates, yes.

00:36:03.365 --> 00:36:07.798
In between 2009--2011,
 United had trained their call center folks.

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:11.737
They said, 
"Oh, sir, or ma'am, we know you have rights."

00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:14.307
"Right. We will make sure that you get 
what you're entitled to."

00:36:14.307 --> 00:36:20.293
They were actually, they had been trained.
 So advocacy, advocacy cases do work.

00:36:20.293 --> 00:36:24.416
Now, on to the fifth one.
On to inaccessible online applications.

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:30.221
Now, most jobs, most employers, now require, 
if you want to apply for a job, you have to do it online.

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:34.360
They'll say, "Go to our website. 
All of the jobs that are open are on our website."

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.855
"Our application process is on our website."

00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:42.690
Well, guess what? If the website is inaccessible 
and you can't apply for a job, and you can't even

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:48.240
find out what jobs are open, that cuts you out 
of the process before you even can apply.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.613
We know the unemployment rate has historically 
been high, 70--80% for people with disabilities.

00:36:53.613 --> 00:36:56.641
Typically adults with disabilities
 are unemployed, right?

00:36:56.641 --> 00:37:00.441
And so, what we decided to do, and we were
lucky enough to receive funding for this

00:37:00.441 --> 00:37:04.652
from the Burton Blatt Institute and
 the Southeast ADA Technical Assistance Center,

00:37:04.652 --> 00:37:08.523
is that we actually had 16 blind users 
attempting to apply for jobs

00:37:08.523 --> 00:37:11.626
on 16 employer websites, right?

00:37:11.626 --> 00:37:14.802
And so they submitted fake applications—
apparently for employers as long as we marked it,

00:37:14.802 --> 00:37:18.227
"for training purposes only," 
that is legal to do,

00:37:18.227 --> 00:37:21.607
just as long as we're not applying 
to the federal government.

00:37:21.607 --> 00:37:27.480
So, what happened, is that we had our blind users attempt to apply for jobs online. Right?

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.384
We actually had to do a number of interventions because when we did our pilot studies,

00:37:32.384 --> 00:37:37.564
we found that there were so many barriers, if we didn't jump in and move them pass a barrier,

00:37:37.564 --> 00:37:40.961
most of our blind users would never even get past searching for jobs.

00:37:40.961 --> 00:37:45.229
They never would even get to apply. And we
wanted to learn about the whole process.

00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:50.233
So what we did, we had a very well-documented way
 of how we were actually going to measure this,

00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:52.988
how we were going to mark down 
that they asked for help,

00:37:52.988 --> 00:37:55.876
that they reached a barrier 
that they couldn't overcome.

00:37:55.876 --> 00:38:02.614
So, out of the 32 attempts, again, two applications per blind users, 32 attempts for applying for jobs,

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:06.285
only nine could be completed
without assistance. Only nine.

00:38:06.285 --> 00:38:11.190
So that's about a 28 percent task
success rate. And think about this,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:16.662
the way the Americans with Disabilities Act works is that when you're applying for a job, you don't

00:38:16.662 --> 00:38:20.165
have to call up and say, "Hey, I have a disability."

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:24.403
You don't have to identify your disability, 
they can't ask you about the disability.

00:38:24.403 --> 00:38:26.564
But, if you suddenly have to
 call up the company and say,

00:38:26.564 --> 00:38:32.070
"Hey, I tried to apply for a job and, guess what,
 your website's not accessible, and I have a disability,"

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:36.135
you then almost had to identify 
your disability, right?

00:38:36.135 --> 00:38:37.201
So that could be problematic.

00:38:37.201 --> 00:38:41.054
And if you immediately have to call before
 you even apply and say, "I can't do this,"

00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:43.922
that makes it sound like you're not capable 
of doing the job when in reality,

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:49.260
they've put that barrier in place. 
So this is really problematic.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.752
And you see, again,
 some of these are very easy to solve.

00:38:54.875 --> 00:39:01.212
PNC Bank, right? You couldn't even search for a job. Before you even applied at PNC Bank,

00:39:01.212 --> 00:39:04.042
you couldn't even search for a job 
to find out what's available.

00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:06.595
The whole set-up was Flash-based.

00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:10.764
If you could not use a pointing device,
you could not click on these things.

00:39:10.764 --> 00:39:12.050
They had no equivalence.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:17.188
Keep in mind, you can still use Flash, you can still
 use graphics, you have to put equivalents in place.

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:21.059
You have to make your page flexible, 
and they didn't do that.

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:23.328
Here's another example. Smithfield Foods.

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:26.532
You had to click on a map, 
either that you wanted to apply for a job

00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:28.432
in the US, Europe, or Mexico,

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:31.068
and then once you got to the US,
 you had to click on a state.

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:33.728
How easily could that be done 
with a drop down menu.

00:39:33.728 --> 00:39:37.757
Or, you could leave the graphics up there 
and also do a drop-down menu.

00:39:37.757 --> 00:39:41.929
These are not technically hard things to do. Right?

00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:47.003
So, you couldn't even search for jobs,
again, to find out what was available.

00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:52.060
Progress bars were very problematic, OK?

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.200
So the progress bars to let you know what steps,
 very similar to in the emergency alerts, right?

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.536
What steps do you need to take 
in the application process?

00:40:01.536 --> 00:40:03.111
They're done totally visually,

00:40:03.111 --> 00:40:07.042
they don't have text in any way, shape, 
or form that let's you know what step you're at.

00:40:07.042 --> 00:40:10.410
You don't know what step you're at,
 you don't know how much more you need to do, right?

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.639
You need to provide this in a flexible manner.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:16.012
And that's what we're talking about here, 
we're talking about flexibility.

00:40:16.012 --> 00:40:18.717
We're talking about making sure—
a lot of these things, by the way,

00:40:18.717 --> 00:40:23.421
that will make it accessible—will also make 
your website work better on a smartphone.

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.021
So we're talking about flexibility.

00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.395
So what are my suggestions for 
improving web accessibility?

00:40:29.395 --> 00:40:32.222
What are my suggestions for how 
we're going to improve this?

00:40:35.701 --> 00:40:40.711
I split these suggestions into educators,
 government and policy-makers,

00:40:40.711 --> 00:40:42.637
developers, designers and researchers.

00:40:42.637 --> 00:40:45.175
Let's first talk about educators.

00:40:45.175 --> 00:40:48.110
Now, out of curiosity, how many of you 
who are at universities,

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:53.661
have heard about IT accessibility concepts 
being taught in any of your technology curriculum?

00:40:53.661 --> 00:40:59.324
CS, IS, IT, show of hands, anyone heard of that?
 How many of you . . . OK, very few.

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:03.230
And actually, it's the people who study accessibility
 who are raising their hand, right?

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:09.334
So, it's close by. But, so, you really need 
to teach this more and what else?

00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:15.074
How many people who are faculty at universities have actually been approached about making sure that

00:41:15.074 --> 00:41:18.977
what you post for your classes is accessible? 
How many people have had that happen?

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:21.780
Have been approached about that? 
OK, three or four.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.686
So, really, what we need to do is find a way 
to talk more about accessibility in

00:41:26.686 --> 00:41:31.785
the university curriculum models, 
in computer science, IS, IT.

00:41:31.785 --> 00:41:35.120
In many of these curriculum models,
it's not even included.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.165
Even human-computer interaction isn't included 
in some of them at a general level.

00:41:39.165 --> 00:41:42.518
But we want to focus on improving accessibility.

00:41:42.518 --> 00:41:46.268
We want to focus on 
improving accessibility by teaching it.

00:41:46.268 --> 00:41:51.311
By making sure it's part of our curriculum.
 By training the newest generation of technology folks.

00:41:51.311 --> 00:41:55.712
And not only that, not only do we have to
 make sure we're training the future,

00:41:55.712 --> 00:42:00.613
we have to make sure that the technology 
infrastructure on our campuses are accessible now

00:42:00.613 --> 00:42:03.421
for students with disabilities who come to campus.

00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:07.727
And this is a problem that a lot of campuses 
are really struggling with, right?

00:42:07.727 --> 00:42:13.232
Everything from online applications to apply, 
to registration systems to register for classes,

00:42:13.232 --> 00:42:19.472
social networking, your course management systems,
 you know, like Moodle, Sakai, Blackboard.

00:42:19.472 --> 00:42:24.051
Not only do you have to make sure that the 
shell system is accessible, the software,

00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:27.346
but you have to make sure your content is accessible.

00:42:27.346 --> 00:42:32.184
How many people take documents, scan them into a
 PDF, and just post them without doing anything else?

00:42:32.184 --> 00:42:36.889
How many people do that? 
OK, please stop doing that. Right?

00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.824
Think about other ways of making it accessible.

00:42:38.824 --> 00:42:43.663
Find out if maybe there's already a copy
somewhere in a digital library that's marked up.

00:42:43.663 --> 00:42:48.634
Find out if there's a Word version available.
 Find out if you can go through OCR,

00:42:48.634 --> 00:42:52.712
optical character recognition.
 Try to make your documents more accessible.

00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:57.409
Your course materials, more accessible. 
Because universities are struggling with this.

00:42:57.409 --> 00:42:59.844
And they're now, many of them
 are at the point where they say,

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:02.970
"Ooo, accessibility. We haven't thought about this."

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.084
"The justice department has said they're 
going to start enforcement."

00:43:05.084 --> 00:43:08.598
"Ooo, we need to start putting together a plan."
 Right?

00:43:08.598 --> 00:43:12.462
So really, that's where a lot of universities are at.
 They're just starting to think about this.

00:43:12.462 --> 00:43:17.468
And faculty can help push this along.
So you can make a difference here.

00:43:17.468 --> 00:43:22.602
For government and policy makers. 
We need to make sure that we push government,

00:43:22.602 --> 00:43:27.439
we push policy makers to make sure that
 enforcement activities and compliance studies

00:43:27.439 --> 00:43:32.511
are done on a regular basis, at the 
federal level, state level, and local level. OK?

00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:37.182
The justice department needs to do their studies, 
federal agencies need to do studies.

00:43:37.182 --> 00:43:42.286
We need to make sure not only that studies are done
 because a lot of agencies, a lot of government,

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.989
they just have no idea if they're accessible or not.

00:43:43.989 --> 00:43:47.229
You ask them, they say, 
"Well, we don't know. I don't know."

00:43:47.229 --> 00:43:50.812
You know, if when disability advocacy
 groups call up and say,

00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:54.313
"You know, the website is not accessible.
 You know, you're violating the law."

00:43:54.313 --> 00:43:58.367
You know what most agencies say? 
"Can you tell us how? We don't know."

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:00.274
That's really what happens.

00:44:00.274 --> 00:44:02.542
They say, "Well, tell us how, we'll fix it, 
we don't know what we're doing."

00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:06.412
Well, if they don't know, they're probably 
going to make mistakes again.

00:44:06.412 --> 00:44:13.692
So we also have to make sure that we publicly
 post the results so we're discussing this openly.

00:44:13.692 --> 00:44:18.400
A few weeks ago, the White House came out with 
a Section 508 comprehensive improvement plan,

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.728
where they say, we're going to improve Section 508,
 we're actually going to require that agencies

00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:26.766
do yearly compliance studies, but they don't
 have to share that with other agencies,

00:44:26.766 --> 00:44:31.604
or share it with the public, or report it to anyone.
They can keep it secret.

00:44:31.604 --> 00:44:36.987
So much for transparency.
 So much for open government.

00:44:36.987 --> 00:44:39.011
I've been pushing for a long time.

00:44:39.011 --> 00:44:43.648
The open government initiative needs to 
include open access for people with disabilities.

00:44:43.648 --> 00:44:48.288
Transparent, open government means 
open government for all.

00:44:48.288 --> 00:44:53.826
So, we need to make sure also that government
 agencies use procurement processes wisely.

00:44:53.826 --> 00:44:56.239
When I talk about procurement,
 you know what I'm talking about, right,

00:44:56.239 --> 00:45:00.199
the processes you go through when
 you need to spend government dollars.

00:45:00.199 --> 00:45:02.103
Even universities that are private, right?

00:45:02.103 --> 00:45:05.431
Guess what, if you're a private university,
 you're covered, you receive federal funds

00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:08.606
so you're covered in at least one 
of these laws and in many cases,

00:45:08.606 --> 00:45:13.343
you're covered under both Section 504 and the ADA.
 So private universities are covered as well.

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:18.251
We need to make sure that the procurement 
processes include aspects related to accessibility.

00:45:18.251 --> 00:45:23.056
So make sure that the contracts specify 
the technology must be accessible.

00:45:23.056 --> 00:45:26.458
Guess what? The Cal State University system
 did this for a number of years,

00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:32.298
where they had it in all their procurement where they 
did demos, they tried it out, they evaluated it.

00:45:32.298 --> 00:45:37.846
So we need to make sure that money being spent 
is a lever to improve IT accessibility.

00:45:37.846 --> 00:45:42.307
And the way to do that is 
through procurement processes.

00:45:42.307 --> 00:45:44.576
And, of course, openness.

00:45:44.576 --> 00:45:49.648
For developers and designers: We want to make sure,
first of all, developers need better tools.

00:45:49.648 --> 00:45:54.118
Software engineers, web developers, programmers,
 designers, they need better software tools.

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:58.123
The ones that are out there right now to check 
for accessibility and help developers,

00:45:58.123 --> 00:46:05.196
they're not that good. They give misleading results. 
So, we want to make sure that we have better tools.

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:07.130
That's why, I'll sometimes use an automated tool,

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.968
but every one of my studies 
always has human inspections.

00:46:09.968 --> 00:46:11.871
We have to have human inspections.

00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:14.841
Either people with disabilities or
 experts reading through the code.

00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:16.019
So we need better tools,

00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:21.279
but we also need a better understanding of
 supporting designers and developers.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.447
We need a better understanding of
 how they do their work.

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:28.022
We need to study how system engineers, 
how software developers, how web programmers,

00:46:28.022 --> 00:46:32.857
we need a better understanding of how they work.
 We need to study that.

00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:35.845
So, we really need a lot.

00:46:35.845 --> 00:46:41.298
We need for research, we need a lot more 
research done on IT accessibility.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:44.468
We need to have, we still need some research
 on perceptual and motor impairment

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.666
but we need a lot more on cognitive impairment.

00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:49.541
We need a lot more work done on all these 
different populations that are considered to

00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:52.946
either have a cognitive impairment or 
intellectual disability, the label changes,

00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:57.950
depending on what community you're working in.
 So we need to have much more research done.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.654
We need people to go out and do studies 
involving people with disabilities.

00:47:01.654 --> 00:47:04.552
We need government agencies
 to fund more of these studies.

00:47:04.552 --> 00:47:07.206
We need a lot more information.

00:47:07.206 --> 00:47:11.731
This is something that is technically solvable.
It's doable. We can make it happen.

00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:13.645
We have the knowledge to make it happen.

00:47:15.184 --> 00:47:20.237
And so what we need to do is improve
 web accessibility because it's technically possible

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:22.575
and the best part is it's not hard.

00:47:23.909 --> 00:47:29.981
But we have to put better policies and better 
practices and better processes into place

00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:34.350
to make sure that this happens.
 OK, we need to improve this situation.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:39.282
This impacts on the quality of life 
for people with disabilities.

00:47:39.922 --> 00:47:40.788
Thank you.
