00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.370
Most of what I learned about spider sex I
got from Charlotte's Web.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.180
So, spider sex, y'all?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.180
How they do that?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.680
Well, different species do it differently.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.029
And just like the old rhyme, first comes love,
second comes marriage then comes the baby

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.060
in the baby carriage -- for spiders it's more
like first comes love then comes sex, then

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.060
sometimes comes death…

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.930
Male spiders are much smaller than females.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.000
The female Black Widow, for example, is about
1.5 inches (3.8cm) with a characteristic black

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.020
body and red hourglass.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.070
Males, on the other hand, are only HALF the
size and are brown!

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.640
For spiders, the responsibility to find a
mate is on the guys, which means so is the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.690
danger.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.920
Spiders are highly solitary, so finding a
female can be tough.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.090
According to a study in Animal Behavior that
came out this month, the western black widow

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.730
uses pheromones to turn her web into a, sort
of, sexual antenna.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.040
Receptors on the spiders front legs can detect
the age, mating history and even hunger level

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710
of the female in-question from her pheromones!

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.292
If he's DTF he'll hop on her web and to stop
other guys from hitting on her, he starts

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:17.292
destroying her web!

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.590
THIS IS LIKE SPIDER NEGGING.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.590
Gross.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.710
The web destruction makes the female seem
LESS ATTRACTIVE to other males!

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.050
Scientists think it reduces the pheromones
so they can be alone while they mate; which

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.049
goes on for hours and sometimes ends in his
death by cannibalism (but not always).

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.420
It's a common misconception all black widows
kill their mate.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.500
The pheromone signals tell the female's hunger
level, remember, so males prefer to mate with

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.150
a female who has recently eaten -- no one
likes sex when they're hangry anyway.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.490
How spiders "do the deed" can vary too.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.049
Most have something called a "pedipalps" to
deposit their sperm into the female spider

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.710
-- it's sort of like a spider's penis.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.730
If the female is receptive, he'll deposit
his sperm aaaaaaand then hightail it outta

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.170
there (because if he survives he can mate
again!)

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.890
That being said, many spiders are monogamous.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.290
A paper in Biology Letters found the dark
fishing spider mates only once not because

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.080
it gets eaten, but because they literally
can't run their brain and penis at the same

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
time!!

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
HAHAHAHA!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.030
Their pedipalp is inflatable, so when they
find a receptive female and inflate their

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.709
pedipalp, the blood pressure in their body
drops so dramatically they become immobilized!

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.709
Wow.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.709
That's awful.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.019
After he makes his final deposit, that bulb
can't be deflated… so he lingers for a few

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.239
hours before he dies, stuck inside the female.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.989
Afterward she either eats him or tosses him
away.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.860
Even with all this though, the POINT of the
mating isn't for funsies, it's to spread genes.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.950
Recently, scientists discovered the males
have a way to influence the spread of their

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.529
genes using a recently discovered nerve in
their pedipalp!

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:53.010
Apparently, male spiders use this nerve to
sense stress and strain during copulation!

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.230
The researchers believe males who sense a
lot of stress could reduce the sperm load

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.249
they deposit, so they don't get metaphorically
screwed!

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.620
Females mate with a bunch of males, choosing
which sperm they want to use for fertilization

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.829
and throwing away the stuff they don't want.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.239
This discovery shows the men aren't just fodder,
but can strategically deposit some sperm,

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.939
and (if they escape) live to fornicate another
day.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.230
Man, animal sex can be so weird sometimes.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.969
Take shark sex, for instance -
