00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.080
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.670
My name is Jason Steinhauer,
I'm a program specialist

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.480
at the J. W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.310
Today's lecture is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.030
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.100
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capitol Hill

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.780
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.020
to stimulate and energize one
another, to distill wisdom

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600
from the Library's rich
resources, and to interact

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.760
with policy-makers and the public.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.460
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.430
post-doctoral fellows, and PhD
candidates to conduct research

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.490
in the Library of Congress'
collections.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.080
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.960
and other programs, and we
administer the Kluge Prize

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.220
which recognizes outstanding
achievement

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.810
in the Humanities and
Social Sciences.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.920 position:56%
For more information about the Kluge
Center, please visit our website,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.500
loc.gov/kluge and I invite you
to sign up for our RSS email list

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.190
on your way out to learn about
future programs and opportunities

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.740 position:56%
for you to conduct your own research
here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.890
Today's program is titled,
"Medieval Manuscripts

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.680
at the Library of Congress."

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.650
It features scholar Ilya
Dines, currently a Kluge fellow

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.870
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.240
While at the Library of Congress,
Dr. Dines has been working

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.450
to catalogue 150 medieval
manuscripts

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.510
and fragments held by the Library.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.170
In his presentation, he will
analyze and detail the importance

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230
of the Library's Medieval
Manuscript collection

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.860
and outline the role it
could play in expanding

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.020
and deepening understandings
of the medieval era.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020
For those of you with us
today who have had a chance

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.690
to view the wonderful
manuscripts that we've put

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.000
out in the other room, we'd like to
thank the Law Library of Congress,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.110
the Rare Books Division of
the Library of Congress,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.400
and the Music Division of
the Library of Congress

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.600
for making those documents
available to us today.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.380
Dr. Ilya Dines has been involved
in numerous cataloguing projects

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.400
since receiving his PhD
into -- excuse me --

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.260
in Medieval History from the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem in 2009.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.660
He was the director of the Medieval
and Renaissance Catalogue Project

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.280
at the National Library of Israel
and is currently head paleographer

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
and codicologist for the
Lazarus Project at the University

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.610
of Mississippi, perhaps the best
title I've ever had the opportunity

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.910
to read [laughter].

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.730
Dines has been a post-doctoral
researcher at the University

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.950
of Cologne, University of
Cambridge, Ben-Gurion University,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.980
and Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
and has taught at the Higher School

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.410
of Economics in Perm, Russia.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.470
Besides publishing
numerous articles,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.330
Dr. Dines has written three
books, <i>Apocalyptic Cartography </i>,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.060
<i>Thematic Maps </i>, <i>The End of the
World in a Fifteenth-Century </i>,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.170
co-written with former scholar at
the Kluge Center, Chet Van Duzer.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.630
As well as both "<i> Westminster
Bestiary: Text and Commentary </i>,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.100
and a critical edition
of the "<i> Bestiaries</i>

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.880
<i>of the Third Family</i>
forthcoming this year.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Dr. Ilya Dines.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ilya Dines: Thank you
[inaudible], thank you very much

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.240
for all for coming to my talk.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.850
This is a big honor for me.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.410
Let me start.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.500
Medieval manuscripts at
the Library of Congress --

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.640
it gives me great pleasure
to begin my talk with thanks

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.450
to the Kluge Center for
the wonderful opportunity

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.210
to work here during the past
year and to conduct my research

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.390
on medieval manuscripts [noise].

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.950
A year ago, I was granted
the Kluge fellowship

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.840
to catalogue medieval
bestiary manuscripts acquired

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.450
by the Library of Congress.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.770
This was a great honor considering
the scope of the collection

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.730
and that [inaudible] who's
distinguished role I was to assume.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.570
My work wouldn't have been possible
without the care and collaboration

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.800
of the director of Kluge
programs, Dr. Mary Lou Reker,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.000
the Collector of the Rare Books
Department, Dr. Mark Dimunation,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.210
Dr. Eric Fraser, Dr. Nathan
Dorn, Dr. Susan Claremont,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.260
and my many other colleagues
for their valuable contribution.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.240
Thank you.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.400
The [inaudible] are the treasure,
the Library of Congress possesses

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.230
about 300 medieval manuscripts.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.550 position:56%
These manuscripts have been produced
in various parts of Europe from 1100

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.050
to about 1600, throughout Europe.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.360
Several words about the collation
and its place of origin in order.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.970
Contrary to many European
collections, the time to recite

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.960 position:56%
where they were produced, the
Library of Congress manuscripts came

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.520
from various collections.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.060
They were donated by
various individuals

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.220 position:56%
and were purchased at various times.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.170
Two of these collections are
particularly worthy of mention.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.690
The first is the <i>Collection
of Sir Thomas Phillips </i>,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.440
who was probably history's greatest
private collector of manuscripts.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.610
His collection included
about 60,000 manuscripts.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.820 position:56%
His success as a collector was due
-- at least in part, to the solution

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.410
of the monastic libraries,
[inaudible] the French Revolution,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.720
and to the relative and expensive
use of manuscripts at that time.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.170
And as [inaudible], Phillips
established Middle Hill Press

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.050
in 1822 which he named
after his country,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.410
set in Broadway, Worchester,
England.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.110
At Middle Hill, he not only
recorded his book holdings,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.800
but also published his findings on
English topography and genealogy.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.500 position:56%
During his lifetime, Phillips
attempted to turn over his collation

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.880
to the British library as his
legacy to the British nation.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.930
He corresponded to then Chancellor
of the Exchequer Disraeli,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.520
but the negotiations proved
unsuccessful and ultimately,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.240
the dispersal of his
collection took over 100 years.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.600
Significant portions of
the European material sold

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.450 position:56%
to national collections on the
continent included the Royal Library

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.560
in Berlin, the Royal
Library of Belgium,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.060
and the Provincial
Archives in Utrecht.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.830
Outstanding individual items
were sold to J. Pierpont Morgan

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.330
and Henry Huntington
libraries in the US.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.160
The Library of Congress is
very fortunate to have acquired

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.550
about 10 manuscripts from Sir
Thomas Phillips' collection.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.850
The second notable collection is

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.890
that of the famous
Chicago businessman

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.280
and chess patron Lessing
Julius Rosenwald.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.160
Eventually, he dedicated
himself full-time

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.140
to collecting rare books and art.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.550
In 1943, he pledged to donate
his collection to the Library

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.860
of Congress and to the
National Gallery of Art.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.890
The Library of Congress
collection contains

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.420
about 20 medieval manuscripts.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.040
Among them is the famous
Giant Bible produced ion 1452,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.720
1453 probably in Mainz
or its [inaudible].

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.070
It is well known not only because
of its beauty, but also that is one

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.330
of the last manuscript bibles
written before the invention

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.710
of printing in the west.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.040
The Bible was written by a single
scribe on high quality parchment.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.910 position:56%
The pages measure 576 millimeters to
405 millimeters with wide margins.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.070
Because the collection of
manuscripts at the Library

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.950
of Congress came from so
many different sources,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.550
it has a very mosaic character.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.280
Another peculiarity of the
Library of Congress collections is

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.570
that contrary to many
other libraries,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.700
its collections are
not kept in one place

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.610
but are distributed among
several library locations.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.960
Thus, manuscripts can be
found in the Rare Books room,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.370 position:56%
the Law Library, the Music Division,
Manuscript Department, Geography

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.300
and Map Division, and
probably some other places

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.710
that I hope I didn't
over look [laughter].

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.930
Most of the Library of Congress
manuscripts have been briefly

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.280
described in census of medieval
and Renaissance manuscripts

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.900
in the United States and
Canada, prepared between 1935,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:46.510
1940 by the same duration
with the assistance of Wilson.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.880
Here's how the standard
description appears in the region.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.180
You can see.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:58.410 position:56%
Manuscript number one, Biblia Velum,
circa 1340, 352 and394 folios.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.610
Then, we have size, there's
one folio in volume one

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.890
and five folios in volume two.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:10.450
Written in Italy, probably in
Bologna, contains 146 miniatures,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.120
formerly bound in velvet.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.040
Rebound circa 1830 in dark blue
Morocco, with H. Perkins arms.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.620
As you can see, the
description is very short.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.650
It mentions briefly the
content of the manuscript,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.580
specifies the material of the
manuscript, paper or parchment,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.650
provides information
about the number of pages

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.900
to get the [inaudible] size and
gives a not very precise date,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.320
such as the 13th Century.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.180
Sometimes, it mentions
the place of production,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.510
usually very generally, say Italy.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.120
It also specifies whether or not
the manuscript is illustrated.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.420 position:56%
This is generally all areas that are
[inaudible] from the Rich Catalogue

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.980
which until today, remains the most
common way readers gain information

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.170
about manuscripts.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.350
The Rich Catalogue has
been updated several times.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.490
In 1962, Foy and Bond
composed a supplement

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.130
in which they described
more manuscripts

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.130
and where they provide readers
with slightly more details

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:17.050
and when possible, with important
corrections of the Rich data.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.380
The 1980s are shown in a
new e-book for the Library

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.870
of Congress manuscripts
when Swetha [inaudible] one

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.380
of the finest manuscriptologist

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.750
of that period assumes scholarly
responsibility for the collection.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.240
In this presentation, I
will be using the notes

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.690
and technological records compiled
by Swetha and other librarians.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.070
Swetha has a huge advantage
over most cataloguers.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.480
Before starting to work at
the Library of Congress,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.370
Swetha was a priest
and his deep knowledge

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.680
of Catholic literature
stood him in a good stead

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.050
in describing various
medieval liturgical books.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.960
During the past 30 years, several
important North American libraries

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.960
such as the Chicago Newberry
Library, Yale's Beinecke Library,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.570
Princeton University Library, and
some others produced new catalogues

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.520
of the medieval and
renaissance manuscripts

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.620
but none equals the
catalogue produced by Swetha.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.320
It comprised a special place among
them and deserved practical notice.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.120
Then to [inaudible]
catalogues showed

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.110
that there are many ways
to describe manuscripts.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.370
This way depends on
manufacturers such the amount

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.420
of time [inaudible] chooses or is
able to devote to the manuscript.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.890
This series in which he approached
each manuscript, the skill

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.220
and the scholarship
of the researcher,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.240
and the opportunity
to fulfill his goals.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.850
Most catalogues, however, present
that to promote further research.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.080
The fact is most historians
including our historians do not

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.840
possess the skills of archivist
and of good cataloguers.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.410
The [inaudible] described 116
manuscripts is simply amazing.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.270
His description combined
what is seldom contained

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.500
in a simple catalogue entry,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.190
that is the fullest
description and research.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.690
His every manuscript entry
represents many articles

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:26.090
of approximate 10 pages which makes
this entry virtually unparalleled

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.470
in cataloguing practice
throughout the vault.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.440
This [inaudible] explains why
116 manuscripts are described

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.140
in two volumes and occupy
more than 1000 pages.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.040
It also explains why this
research took more than 20 years.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.110
Let us look at standards
[inaudible] description.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.580
This is the description of
manuscript number one --

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.880
I used, in this case,
I use Foy Bond number.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.640 position:56%
An early 13th Century Bible of
English production and it's possible

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.650
to see the depth of the
descriptions [inaudible].

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:06.210
At the left -- because
see the correct date

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.560
of the manuscript [inaudible]
13th Century.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.660 position:56%
Thirty-one [inaudible] important
[inaudible] information about number

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.870
of columns in the test
and the measurement

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.170
of the bound volume itself.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.540
For [inaudible] description of
the content of the manuscript,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.050 position:56%
for instance, there is a description
of the preface to the Bible.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.950
A considerable amount of
medieval Bibles are preceded

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.010 position:56%
by introductory text from
[inaudible] who translated the Bible

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.650
from [inaudible] at the
end of the 4th Century.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.900
This entry provides information
about the structure of this prefix

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.180
which is slightly different
in many medieval manuscripts.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:52.290
This way, the reader can get
initial information about the group

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.710
to which this manuscript belongs.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.010
Furthermore, contrary
to [inaudible] order

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.450
of the books is set
beginning with Genesis.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.170
The medieval Bible
shows great consistency

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.980
in the order of the books.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.070
Therefore, [inaudible] is very
important in describing manuscripts

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.150
because quite often a single
manuscript may contain a number

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.590
of texts that at some point
in time, were bound together.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.680 position:56%
The deRitchi and other short
catalogues simply overlook this fact

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.460
and mostly mentioned on the first
item for text in the manuscript.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.080
As a result, scholars don't know
what else the manuscript contains.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.550
The situation is dramatized
by Umberto Eco in the name

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.270
of the [inaudible]
who's plot is based

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.490
on an erroneous catalogue
description

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.310
where a relatively unimportant text
by Cipriani is noted in the context

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.460
of the manuscript while
[inaudible] copy

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.960
of Aristotle's second book
of [inaudible] is not.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.090
[Inaudible] detailed
description save readers

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.290
and researchers an
incredible amount of time.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.720
After two or three pages of such
a description comes a codological

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.900
analysis of the manuscript.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:15.470 position:56%
Swetha describes the system of
foliation, the [inaudible] numbered,

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.150
then he provides details about
measurement of [inaudible] space.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.150
The number of columns, the number
of lines, the margins are close,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.990 position:56%
and the way the manuscript is ruled.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.960
All this information is of
crucial importance for the reader.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.720
Of great importance is an
analysis of the number of hands

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.690
that participated in
creating a manuscript.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.980
To illustrate this importance,
the first like of the folio

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.000
in a medieval manuscript can be set
either above or below the top line.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.930
While the difference seems
insignificant, in fact the position

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.230
of the line in many cases can be
crucial for the proper [inaudible]

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:59.390
of the manuscript, in accordance
with the rule of Neil Ker,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.240
the name of the English
scholar who discovered it.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.570 position:56%
For some probably mostly [inaudible]
reason, after the year 1250,

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.320
the practice of most
European scribes changed

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.150
from placing the first
line in the above position

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.500 position:56%
to placing it in the below position.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.610
In the absence of other indicators,
such information can point

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.040
to the date of the manuscript.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.000
Without such a notation
in the catalogue,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.160
much research will
be lost as sometimes

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.300
on microfilm or in digital image.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.650
[Inaudible] is hardly visible.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.520
The analysis [inaudible] undertook

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.710
in his research is virtually
unparalleled in modern cataloguing.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.010 position:56%
He described the correct usage of
letters and justified his conclusion

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.420
about the number of
[inaudible] and the date

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.360
and origin of the manuscript.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.760
The codological description
and coloration --

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.450
-- this is one of the
most problematic elements

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.470
in manuscript research.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.620
The manuscripts are made
from [inaudible] of leafs.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.480
They usually have four,
six, eight, and 10 folios.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.060
Depending on the number of
folios, in some cases, the country

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.770
and region of the manuscript
production become possible

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.670
to determine.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.810
Checking the [inaudible] is
a very sensitive process,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.580
some manuscripts [inaudible]
are fragile

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.500
and many manuscripts
are bound very tightly.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.160 position:56%
In many libraries, librarians
understandably prohibit [inaudible].

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.200
Thus, the only possible
way for a researcher

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.970 position:56%
to obtain the required
information is a catalogue and thus,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.090
the crucial importance of such
information in catalogues.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.570
The description of the
entry and the description

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.970
of the [inaudible] program
of the manuscript --

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.250
-- and if notes about
prominence and bibliography.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.820
The way Swetha described
160 manuscripts is amazing.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.920
It saves researcher a lot of time
and helps keep manuscripts safe.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.900
Readers who are not interested

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.800
in [inaudible] Swetha's codological
analysis can easily find this data

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.490
in his catalogue.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.970
Such a thorough description is also
very useful in our digital era.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.010
Nowadays, many libraries
tend to digitize manuscripts

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.630
and the process becoming
progressively is indeed.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.180
With the reduction of the
cost of good [inaudible],

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.870
we can see that every era, more

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.810
and more libraries put their
collections sometimes even entire

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.430
collections online.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.500
The [inaudible] problem for
scholars arise not from the images,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.050
but from the fact that the image
itself is not as [inaudible]

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.820
as description in the manuscript.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.970
As I noted earlier, the catalogues
of many libraries are simply old

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:04.380
and uninformative so that
the large efforts library --

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.890
librarians and technical
assistants result

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.910
in beautifully [inaudible]
manuscripts [inaudible]

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.290
with very poor descriptions
like for instance,

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.480
the [inaudible] of
the Rich Catalogue.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.580
A further complication is that
once a digital copy is available,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.140
many libraries tend to bar scholars

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.140
from examining the
original manuscripts

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.430
and make an accurate catalogue
entry virtually impossible.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.300
The possibility of destruction of
manuscripts also makes accurate

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.560
and thorough catalogue
description mandatory.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.970
During the last decades, we have
seen the manuscript which survived

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.070
for 1000 years in medieval
repositories are not as safe

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.440
in our modern environment.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.010
It is enough to recall
[inaudible] Library of Anna Amalia

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.170
in Germany 10 years ago and the
tragedy that happened in 2009,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.920
to the famous archive at
Cologne where in several minutes,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.460
a huge collection of
[inaudible] charters

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.920
and many medieval manuscripts
was lost.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.220
A considerable portion

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.620
of manuscripts have not
been properly described

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.480
or at least they're not described
in the way Swetha has done

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.780
and such precious information
is lost to us forever.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.600
At the time Swetha retired,
the [inaudible] description

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.440
of manuscripts have been
stopped for [inaudible].

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.700
Before retirement, Swetha compiled
a list of manuscripts to be added

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.250 position:56%
to the third already-planned volume.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.540
This list includes
about 70 manuscripts.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.500
In 2015, Swetha generously
provided the draft

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.880
that he had compiled
for some manuscripts.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.480
One problem however, [inaudible]
catalogue was published

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.540
because Swetha had used his
own shelf marks for manuscripts

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.240
and despite the fact that
the volume include the index

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.240
of the [inaudible] of
old and new numbers.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.330
In many cases, [inaudible]
errors of within the numbers.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.630
To resolve the problem,
today the library tends

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.560
to use [inaudible]
system of shelf marks.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.610
As I noted, the library [inaudible]
and the manuscripts are spread

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.590
over several departments.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.360
As a result, about 70
manuscripts were never noted

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.030
by deRitchi, [inaudible],
and Swetha.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:29.300
Some of them didn't have any
shelf mark at all and as a result,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.670
they are not known to
the general public.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.600
All these manuscripts would
appear in the third volume

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.970
that I have been compiling
during the past year.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.630
Let me come directly
to these manuscripts.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.180
A considerable part of the Library

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.500
of Congress manuscript treasures
consist of eight Bibles,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.010
about 40 liturgical manuscripts,
and about 20 books of ours.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.640
These items are described
in the first volume

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.370
of the Swetha's Catalogue.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.730
Of particular interest
is the creation scene

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.940
from manuscript number 71
produced in Paris around 1250.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:26.140
The peculiarity of this
manuscript is evident

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.850
in its initial [inaudible]
at the beginning of Genesis.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.780
The sections of compartments in
this initial doesn't correspond

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.830
to the days of Scriptural
account but the order of days goes

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:47.940 position:56%
as follows, like firmament, division
of waters, dry land, plants, sun,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.970
moon, fish, reptiles, birds,
quadrupeds, man and [inaudible].

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.970
In the manuscript 71,
the first compartment --

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.340
-- appears to stand for
the general beginning,

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.410
the second for creation of light.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:15.070
The meaning of the third and
fourth is rather unclear.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.220 position:56%
The fifth compartment showed plants,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.750
the sixth birds, and
the seventh, man.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.260 position:56%
Liturgical manuscripts -- liturgical
manuscripts are represented

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.650
by Antiphonals, Graduals,
Breviaries, Missals,

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.250
and of course, the Book of Hours.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.810
Antiphonary is one of the most
popular liturgical books intended

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.420
for use in the liturgical choirs
and characterized by the assignment

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.360 position:56%
to principally of the antiphons used

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.590
in various parts of
the Roman Liturgy.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:56.220
It has included general antiphons
and antiphonal chants sung

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.390
by the cantor, congregation,
and choir at Mass

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.990
and in the canonical hours.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.850
The Library of Congress has
several beautiful [inaudible]

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.190
where the most beautiful
is manuscript number 128.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.150
The book was produced in
Northern Italy probably

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.930
at the beginning of
the 16th Century.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.680
The Book of Hours is
a devotional book,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.270
extremely popular in
the Middle Ages.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.690
It is the most common type

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.940
of surviving medieval
eliminated manuscripts.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.490
Book of Hours show a huge diversity

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.600
in the textual and
[inaudible] program.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.510
But most contain a similar
collection of texts, prayers,

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.370
and psalms for Grecian devotion.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.410
The Book of Hours,
are mostly written

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.300
in Latin although there are
many manuscripts written

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.170
in vernacular languages,
especially Dutch.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.340
A considerable part of them and the
most beautiful ones were produced

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.970
in the [inaudible], Yiddish,
[inaudible], and Gelt.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.010
Here's an example of a
beautiful Book of Hours

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.970
in the Library collection,
manuscript 46.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:22.360
Among the -- among the manuscripts
that don't relate to Bibles,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.250 position:56%
liturgy, and Book of Hours are books

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.660
of various important
medieval authors.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.620
The collection includes
for instance,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.070
one of the most popular [inaudible]

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.930
of the Middle Ages is Torres
Scholastica of Petrus Comestor

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.300
who lived in Paris in the middle of
the 12th Century and was a member

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.660
of the Church of Notre Dame.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.060
Peter's nicknames Comestor,
Devourer, demonstrates the esteem

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.440
in which his learning was held.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.410
He was a bibliophile and
prolific author although much

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.610
of his work wasn't published.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.410
Historica Scholastica is a sacred
history written for students.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.570 position:56%
The author begins the book from the
Creation and continues it to the end

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.280
of the incidents related in
the Acts of the Apostles.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.700
Another important visual text was
mentioned is the Golden Legenda,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.240
the Golden Legend, Legenda Aurea,
a collection of hagiographies.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.490
It was written around 1260 by the
Dominican chronicler and Archbishop

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.390
of Genoa, Jacobus de Varagine

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.830
and it immediately became a
late medieval best seller.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.980
Thus, more than 1000
manuscripts have survived to date.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.310
During the next two centuries,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.630
many texts were added
to the original Legenda.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.740
Among other rare texts,
I would like to bring

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.720
to your attention [inaudible]
text entitled,

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.910
"Tractatus de members beate
Maria Virginis," a treatise

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.860
about the body of the Virgin Mary.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.360 position:56%
This is an old piece of writing that
combines the image of [inaudible]

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.260
with a rather graceless
anatomic scrutiny

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.060
of the Mother of Jesus Christ.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.110
Connoisseurs of Medieval Book
Binding will certainly appreciate

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.360
the original bindings which
are in the Library of Congress,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:15.050
manuscript 127 is [inaudible]
probably around the year 1200.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:21.820
The manuscript is important
because of its iconographical style

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.450
but what is really precious
in this it's binding.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:34.520
It is bound in old oak boards,
each about 12-millimeter-thick

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:41.960
with [inaudible] compartments for
[inaudible] and or jewels none

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.990
of which are [inaudible] both
on the face and the edges

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:54.080
of the covers showed the former
locations of the fasteners.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.390
The boards are oversized
for the [inaudible] book

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.740
in its present state and might
have been taken from another book.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.330
Manuscript 84 is a
mid-15th Century copy

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:11.050
of the immensely influential
Italian theologian

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.330
and philosopher Thomas Aquinas.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.370
The impressive protection arranged

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.640
for the manuscripts indicates
it was highly esteemed.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.860
As you can see -- as you can
see its bindings are made

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.440
of yellowish pigskin
over thick wooden boards

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.970
with five round [inaudible] --

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.560
-- on each cover made to prevent
the rubbing off the surface

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.170
of the cover.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.930
The manuscript is also equipped
with an iron chain intended

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.880
to protect the book from theft.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.220
The last interesting binding I
will show is that of manuscript 91

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.970
which is -- which is a 15 Century
Gradual produced in Northern Italy.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.840
It is bound in contemporary covers
sewn over seven leather bands.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.400
The covers are made of
reddish-brown goatskin

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.580
over wooden boards heavily
protected and decorated by brass

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.970
around all the edges with added
hexagonal spike like protections.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.800
[Inaudible] cover.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.070
On the surface of each cover,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.710
there are five hexagonal
[inaudible] protruding

00:29:54.710 --> 00:30:00.060
from the octagonal rosettes also
[inaudible] four eight-point stars.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.260
The metalwork is strong,
sometimes even crude.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.520
The overall impression
being that of armor.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.030
Okay, the goatskin of the
covers is also blind stumped

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.360 position:56%
with fleuron forming a latch rosette
around its central metal ornaments.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.620
[Inaudible] creating a large
rectangular frame closed

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.930
with a scalloped protecting metal.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.270
The catalog I am compiling, which
compliments the two volumes written

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.200
by Svato will include
about 150 items.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.760
Because of the time restrictions,

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.390
I have had only one year
for all these books.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.640
I cannot describe the manuscripts
in the same level of detail

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.140
that Svato has done
in his two volumes,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.200
but I hope to match the high
standards for codicology

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.960
and paleography established
by Svato.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.110
The books chosen for the third
volume are also different

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.210
from the ones which formed
the previous volumes.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.170
Many of these items are
classical Roman and Greek authors

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:10.780 position:56%
and their translations into
vernacular languages such as Caesar,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.510
Plutarch, [inaudible],
Terence, Cicero,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.690
[inaudible], Virgil, and Plautus.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.850
There is a good scope of alchemical
and cartographical material,

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.960
various encyclopedic material
represented by the work

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.920
of Johannes de Sacrobosco
and Bartholomeus Anglicus.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.820 position:56%
Several manuscripts deal with music.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.790
I am not going to demonstrate a
few highlights from the manuscripts

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.770 position:56%
that will comprise the third volume.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.870
Manuscript 101 is a very
important medical work.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.350
It is a book called "Thesaurus
Pauperum", "Treasury of the Poor,"

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.830
written by famous doctor
Petrus Hispanus.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.650
Petrus Hispanos was born of noble
family in Lisbon between 1210

00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.870
and 1220 and was called
Peter, the son of Julian.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.930
After having studied in
Paris where he took degrees

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.390
in all the faculties,
he returned to Lisbon.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.950
Soon he became Archdeacon
of the church in Braga.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.380
Then he went to Rome when he
was appointed First Physician

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.850
to Pope Gregory 10th.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:22.260
While in Pope's service, Peter
composed his "Thesaurus Pauperum"

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.210
in which he discussed in
detail remedies for the disease

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.600
of every part of the body.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.900
The book quickly became popular and
was widely quoted and circulated,

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.620
with many additions made
by later physicians.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.430
Later, in recognition of his
merits, the Pope appointed Peter

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.470
as Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.000
The Library of Congress possesses
a very good late-13th century copy

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.220
of Peter's "Thesaurus Pauperum,"
which you can see in the images.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.540
The book, typical for
medieval period,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.380
opens with various zodiac tables --

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.680
-- and only later addresses
the subject of medicine itself.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.310 position:56%
In this image you can see a typical
Italian [inaudible] made by scribes,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.750
so that the book binder will not
confuse [inaudible] while binding.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.890
About 14 manuscripts, many
of which were not described

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.900
by any previous cataloger
are kept in the law library.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.490 position:56%
Manuscript L5 is of great importance
for all specialists dealing

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.210 position:56%
with the Latin Empire in the Orient.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:44.100
The laws of this empire
were formed by the leaders

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.870
of the Fourth Crusade, Baldwin of
Flanders, the first Latin Emperor;

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.230
Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat;

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:56.410
and Enrico Dandolo,
doge of Venice in 1204.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:00.300
The laws were codified following
the model of laws of the kingdom

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.660
of Jerusalem, which had been
compiled a century before.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:10.470
On April 4, 1453, when the
Latin Empire had been extinct

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.150
for almost a century, and only

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.580
about eight weeks before
the Byzantine Empire

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.530
of Constantinople collapsed,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.540
the Venetian doge Francesco Foscari
approved the use of this code

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:26.260
in Euboea, Negroponte which was
a Venetian possession until 1470.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.710
The previously-mentioned Rosenwald
collection contains a manuscript

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:37.590
which is of great importance to
the local history of Nuremberg.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.770
This manuscript was
produced in the year 1555 --

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.720
-- and contains the Coat of Arms

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.650
of many Nuremberg families
with their description.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.540
And here [inaudible]
with the description.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.970
The manuscript includes an index
of the Coat of Arms at the end --

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.830
-- according to the alphabet.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.140 position:56%
Another Rosenwald manuscript I would
like to mention is a manuscript

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:14.950
of Roberto Valturius who was born
in Rimini in 15th-century Italy.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.060
He was an engineer and writer.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.020
In 1472, he wrote a
treatise entitled,

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.480
"De Re Militari," or
"About Warfare."

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.420
The book consists of a
preface with a dedication

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.490
to Sigismondo Pandolfo
Malatesta then follows a list

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.570
of the classical works on
warfare, an introduction

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.130
to the history of the subject.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.300
The book became extremely popular.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.340
Various European kings,
including Louis 11th of France,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.840
the Hungarian King
Matthias Corvinus,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.260
and the ruler of Florence
Lorenzo de Medici had copies

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.500
of the printed book.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.910
Most of the methods of war

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.110
that Valturius describes are
[inaudible] and medieval.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.640
Here are the impressive
illustrations of various methods

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.550
and fashion, catapults
and battering rams

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.600
of siege warfare from this book.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.980
The last manuscript I would like
to show today is a copy of the

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.610
"Sachsenspiegel," or the
"Survey of Saxon Law."

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.450
This is the most important
book of laws and customs

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.280
of the German Middle Ages.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.510
The "Sachsenspiegel" was
written in about 1220 as a record

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.700
of existing customary law.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.890
The author was probably the Saxon
administrator Eike of Repgow,

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.190
who wrote it by the order

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:38.040
of his liege lord Count
Hoyer of Falkenstein.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.000
Later, the influence of the
"Sachsenspiegel" extended

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.990 position:56%
to the laws of several, mostly
German-speaking, European countries.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:49.250
The manuscript which is in
possession of the Library

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.200
of Congress was made in the
south in Germany and dates

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.360
to the late 15th century.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.700
Article 42 of the book contains
a condemnation of slavery

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.510
as contrary to the law of God.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.530
I hope I have managed to
demonstrate that the Library

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.880
of Congress has a very impressive
collection of manuscripts,

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.140
which until now has not
been properly described,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.360
and as a result, not
properly studied.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.080
I also hope that all these
manuscripts will be digitized one

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.160
day and put online with
proper descriptions,

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.180
and in this way will
become widely available.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.480
The researcher who would

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.750
like to investigate further will
certainly find more manuscripts

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.100
in the Library of Congress,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.030
particularly fragments
of manuscripts.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.930
The Music Division has
about 100 unstudied

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.140
and uncatalogued fragments.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.040
The Rare Book Division has about
200 fragments, some of them letters

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.730
of European kings and Papal Bulls.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.150
And also there is a [inaudible]
collection in the Rare Books

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:53.180
that has many incunabula,
a minimum of about 100,

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.100
whose bindings are leaves
of medieval manuscripts.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.390
I hope the Library of
Congress will encourage

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:02.090
and support further investigations
in these important resources soon.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.890
Thank you very much.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:17.120
[ Applause ]

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.620
Questions, please.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.950
Yes, please?

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:25.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.080
This was really fascinating.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.870
In your talk you gave a really
wonderful overview of sort

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:38.950
of the thematic context of
a lot of the manuscripts

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.850
within the Library's holdings
[inaudible] liturgical texts,

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:50.860
as well as [inaudible]
alchemical works, works of music,

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:56.220
works on warfare, and
so on and so forth.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:08.950
In terms of the chronological
and geographical focuses

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:14.590 position:56%
of the manuscripts here, where do
you see the greatest concentrations?

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.590
Do you see the greatest
concentrations

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:22.500 position:56%
in the traditional areas of northern
Europe, of England, France, Germany?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.680
Or do we also have [inaudible]
in the Mediterranean?

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.190
Topologically what are
areas where you see --

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.230
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: It is much
easier to answer the second part

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.580
of your question about chronology.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:43.220
Most of manuscripts which
kept here, they date from 1200

00:39:43.220 --> 00:40:04.830
or 11 up to 1600, at least I didn't
touch any manuscript after 1600.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:12.230
So I had restrict my
research up to 1600.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:18.080
And as to manuscripts themselves,
I would say most manuscripts came

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.970
from France, Germany, and Italy.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:29.490
But this is standard
for Middle Ages.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:38.440
About 20% of all manuscripts which
we possess were made in Italy.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.460
Thank you.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.760
Yes, please, [inaudible].

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:54.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Is there question of the material
on which the Parisian [inaudible],

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.270
about 500 of them were hidden.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:04.680
Has it been solved?

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:14.580
It can be solved probably on
basis of some DNA study or some --

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.880
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Oh, [inaudible].

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.180
Oh.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.480
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] of the
15th century [inaudible],

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.750
and the books are [inaudible] about
500 of [inaudible] for students.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.830
They are about the size of
the [inaudible] and such.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.590
And I [inaudible] that
it was [inaudible]

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.070
because for the 500 books.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.370 position:56%
And -- but it was [inaudible] and --

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.670
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: So thank you
very much for the correction.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:30.970
As far I know, there
is no one who made DNA

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.270 position:56%
of pocket Bible for Parisian origin.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.570
This is the only thing I know.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.870
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] find some
[inaudible] which is going

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.170
to be able to DNA studies --

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.470
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Thank
you much for that.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.770
Thank you very much --

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.000
Yes, please?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.040
&gt;&gt; Hi, [inaudible] this
cataloging of manuscript,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.270 position:56%
and it makes me curious, do you have
examples or evidence of manuscripts

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.510
that were deliberately
miscataloged, or misplaced,

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.700
or hidden for ideological purposes?

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:03.130
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: From a
geological -- here or at all?

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.820
&gt;&gt; Anywhere at all.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.050
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Yes, for example,
there are many medieval treaties

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:14.930
against women, which are usually --

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.330
and in this case, the
content of manuscripts

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.940
in many libraries was
hidden in catalogs of --

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.990
many medieval or post-medieval,
18th and 19th century catalogs.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.440
This is the only thing
I can think about.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:43.430
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] nothing [inaudible]
books that would have been saved

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:49.990
from being destroyed [inaudible]
in the [inaudible] various works --

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.290
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Here?

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:55.060
In Rare Books there
are two manuscripts

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.050
where there are [inaudible]
downs which are --

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.290
which came from Jewish Bibles.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.590
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.890
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Yeah, but only two.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.190
But only two.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.490
&gt;&gt; Fragments or --

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Fragments, fragments.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.870
A 13th-century one
of Parisian origin,

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.010 position:56%
and one probably [inaudible] origin.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.930
This all I know.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.440
&gt;&gt; The work is fragment?

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.740
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Yeah.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.220
&gt;&gt; Of all the manuscripts that
you've looked at while here,

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:33.930
which one most excites
you, or resonates with you,

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:39.220 position:56%
or do you find the most fascinating?

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.600
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Well, this --
well, thank you very much,

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.980
this of course a question
of preference.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.570
You have seen this book binding
of -- where most of [inaudible] --

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.870
where all [inaudible] were student.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.230
This is my favorite, because this
is rare -- very rare and atypical.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.890
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: If there are
no more questions -- last chance.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:07.550
Ilya will stick around
for a few minutes.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.140
If there are no more
questions -- oh, was there one?

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.290
Oh, yes.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:26.660
&gt;&gt; I was actually [inaudible] but
I also wondered is there anything

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.050
in the manuscripts
[inaudible] that you wanted

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.530
to point our attention to, or --

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.540
&gt;&gt; Ilya Dines: Actually, most of
manuscripts which are in that room,

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.610
these are manuscripts
which are demonstrated,

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.520 position:56%
except several manuscripts which are
-- except for manuscripts which came

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.280 position:56%
from Music Division, and they simply
were beautiful, and I want you

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.580
to see the real treasures
of Library of Congress.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.880
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Well,
that's a great note to end it.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.180
So please join me in
thanking Ilya again.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.980

you, my pleasure.

A quick just tad-bit

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.650
of administration before we let you
go for the rest of your afternoon,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:09.910
there is an event survey
circulating around the institution

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:14.080
that we are asking those who attend
our events to give us some feedback

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.370
on our events and also feedback on
how you found out about our events.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.610
So please do fill that
out on your way out.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.210
We would be appreciative.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.090
We are on break here at the Kluge
Center for a couple of weeks.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:29.630
Our next event is actually an
evening event, on Tuesday evening,

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.620
April 19th, we will be

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.690 position:56%
in the Coolidge Auditorium
downstairs holding the second annual

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.660
Daniel K. Inouye distinguished
lecture.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.800
And this year's lecture will
actually be a conversation

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.280
between former Secretary of
Transportation Norman Mineta

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.070
and former U.S. Senator
Alan Simpson.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:53.680
They'll be discussing how America
balances its national security

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.320
with civil liberties.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.350
So if you're interested in that
topic or other future events,

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.540
please sign up for a list
or check our website.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.160
