00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Usually during the midterm elections, the party in power suffers from a lack of enthusiasm.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:04.640
Usually during the midterm elections, the party in power suffers from a lack of enthusiasm. 
But with Trump's doubling down on fearmongering and falsities,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.520
But with Trump's doubling down on fearmongering and falsities,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.880
he's whipping up his base yet again.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.080
It is concerning if they're taking our jobs and they’re taking our benefits.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.560
This town is 95% white.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.040
There aren't any immigrants coming to this town, so how are they taking your jobs?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.720
Well, they’re not.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.040
What does?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.240
And who are these people, exactly?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.800
We came here to Jamestown, Tennessee,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.440
a tiny town of just under 2,000 residents, to find out why Trump's message resonates so well with people here

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.440
who feel abandoned by the government.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.920
There are places all over the United States like this that's forgotten, nobody's ever heard of.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.960
Here in Jamestown, 95% of the population is white. It's also one of the poorest towns in America.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.680
There's really not a lot of jobs around here.
- That's what I've heard.
We used to have a lot of factories and stuff here.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.960
Between 2008-2012, Jamestown had the sixth lowest median 
household income of any place in the entire country.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.520
But during the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency, Tennessee quickly
saw a surge in small business job growth.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.600

Do you feel that things got better since 2016?
- I think so.
Really?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.680
Do you feel things got better since 2016?
- I think so.
Really?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.840
I do better, myself. You see a lot more businesses starting up, evidently because of Trump. I don’t know.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.640
I think the economy got a little bit better, but it’s still got a long way to go.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.080
Who do you blame for things getting so bad? 
- I don’t like to point fingers at anybody, but I believe it’s the government as a whole, really.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.120
He's talking about Mexican criminals. 
He's talking about Middle Eastern people invading America from the border.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.600
Do you think that that resonates with people here?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.880
Yeah, I believe it does. They believe whatever they hear.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.800
It’s not bad anymore to be a racist or anything.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.240
I don’t understand why. I just don’t have an answer.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.800
Here in Fentress County, Tennessee, President Trump won 82.5% of the vote in 2016.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.720
He talks about Mexican criminals, he talks about terrorists, 
he talks about grabbing women by the p*ssy.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.440
When he says all those things, what do you think?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.920
I think he needs to keep his mouth shut, too.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.280
He shouldn't try to influence the American people to feel a certain way.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.920
I mean, that's his opinion, that's how he feels, keep it to yourself.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.640
I think that's what he don't really realize, how much impact he has.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.000
Do you see a connection at all between the level of hateful rhetoric

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.920
and these kinds of hate crimes happening?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.560
Probably.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.280
You see bombs sent in the mail to these people, you know what I mean?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.960
Aw, you think that?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280
I think that.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Really?
- Yeah.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.760
It used to be all, “Aw, we can't say that," but now it's like,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760
“Eh! We don't care anymore.”

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.040
Every voter we talked to says that's why they voted for him.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.760
We shouldn’t be wondering why all these crimes are happening against these people.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.360
Because he's the one saying it’s OK.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.760
He’s the one who said it to begin with.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.240
I just don’t want to see racism back again like we did in the ‘50s and ‘60s.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.800
I remember, I just don’t want to see that again.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.080
Getting on here every day, saying stuff about these people, just to get a sh*tstorm started,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.080
I don’t understand it. I don’t get it.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.000
Running for midterms, I don't know why that should be the number-one thing that they should be talking about,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.520
is the economy and healthcare.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.400
We all worry about healthcare. I mean, everybody will tell you that, probably.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.560
Democrat and Republican. 
- Right, exactly.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.900
Trump claims he’s fighting hard against a plan by Democrats 
that would destroy Medicare.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.680
I’ve got Medicare. It pays 79% – it could get better.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.000
And you’re not concerned at all that the Republicans might try and change Medicare coverage?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.840
No, I don’t think they will.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.880
In reality, the fund is suffering under his administration.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.640
In June, the government projected Medicare funds would be gone by 2026,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.640
due to low wages and lower taxes.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.520
I come and vote because that's my right,
and do I feel like it's gonna make a difference? No.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.920
Did you feel like he was gonna rock your world?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.000
Yeah, I did.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.120
Yeah, I did.
They don’t want regular politicians …
- They want underdogs.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.240
They don’t want regular politicians …
- They want underdogs.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.360
They want underdogs – somebody that they think will stand up to them.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.320
I think that's all across the country.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.320
Would you vote for Trump again?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.120
Depends on who he's running against.
- Good answer.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.080
Yeah, I think if you had a presidential election – like if you had Trump,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.960
Clinton, Sanders – it would have been a different whole story, probably.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.920
We need more parties. We don’t really need to look at party lines. We need to look at the 
people that's running for office.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.000
We need more parties. We don’t really need to look at party lines. We need to look at the 
people that's running for office. 
You voted for Trump, though, in 2016?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080
You voted for Trump, though, in 2016?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.080
I'd rather not say.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.840
If I knew today, after voting for him, that it would pretty much stay the same,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200
I probably wouldn’t have voted for him.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.560
So when President Trump says Islam hates us, 
or he thinks Islam hates us, you believe him?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.120
Yep.
- And you agree that it's a danger?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.560
Yep, I sure do.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.880
And you think that they're trying to take jobs, or that they're trying to do something more sinister?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.120
I think it's more sinister, myself. 
- Really.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.600
I don't think the average American really worries about immigrants right now.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.640
I think they're worried more about their family and their livelihood.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.040
I was born in California, but my parents are Middle Eastern.
My parents are Muslim.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:29.440
And I just wonder – does it change some of what you were thinking, 
to know I’m originally Middle Eastern?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.080
Or do you feel it’s the same?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.320
How do you feel about it? You want to kill us off, or what?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.560
I don’t want to kill you. Why would I want to kill you?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.480
I still think you’re a pretty good guy to talk to.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.720
Well, maybe that’s a small step, then.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.600
There’s always steps you gotta take.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.680
What'd you say?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.600
I said, "I wish everybody was like me, then we'd all get along."

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.440
I mean, I try to get along with everybody.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.840
But you do have certain people you can't get along with.
