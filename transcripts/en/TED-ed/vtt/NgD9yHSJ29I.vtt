00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:09.404
Most atoms don't ride solo,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:12.125
instead they bond with other atoms.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.743
And bonds can form between atoms

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:14.943
of the same element

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:17.065
or atoms of different elements.

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:20.190
You've probably imagined bonding as a tug of war.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.966
If one atom is really strong,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.110
it can pull one or more electrons

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.775
off another atom.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.801
Then you end up with one negatively charged ion

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.042
and one positively charged ion.

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:33.811
And the attraction between these opposite charges

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.975
is called an ionic bond.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.233
This is the kind of sharing

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.993
where you just give away your toy to someone else

00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:41.958
and then never get it back.

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:45.005
Table salt, sodium chloride,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.757
is held together by ionic bonds.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.331
Every atom of sodium gives up one electron

00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.252
to every atom of chlorine,

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.362
ions are formed,

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.244
and those ions arrange themselves

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.911
in a 3D grid called a lattice,

00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:59.441
in which every sodium ion

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.667
is bonded to six chloride ions,

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.498
and every chloride ion is bonded

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.706
to six sodium ions.

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:07.472
The chlorine atoms never give

00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:09.925
the sodium atoms their electrons back.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:13.684
Now, these transactions aren't always so cut-and-dried.

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:16.622
If one atom doesn't completely overwhelm the other,

00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:19.316
they can actually share each other's electrons.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:20.819
This is like a pot luck

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.919
where you and a friend each bring a dish

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:25.920
and then both of you share both dishes.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.353
Each atom is attracted to the shared electrons

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.652
in between them,

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:31.726
and this attraction is called a covalent bond.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.757
The proteins and DNA in our bodies,

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:34.584
for example,

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:37.775
are held together largely by these covalent bonds.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:39.358
Some atoms can covalently bond

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:41.250
with just one other atom,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.917
others with many more.

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:44.367
The number of other atoms

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:45.690
one atom can bond with

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.577
depends on how its electrons are arranged.

00:01:48.577 --> 00:01:51.543
So, how are electrons arranged?

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:53.972
Every atom of a pure, unbonded element

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:55.393
is electrically neutral

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:56.829
because it contains the same number

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.458
of protons in the nucleus

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.247
as it does electrons around the nucleus.

00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:04.422
And not all of those electrons are available for bonding.

00:02:04.422 --> 00:02:06.420
Only the outermost electrons,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.684
the ones in orbitals furthest from the nucleus,

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.338
the ones with the most energy,

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.731
only those participate in bonding.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.808
By the way, this applies to ionic bonding too.

00:02:15.808 --> 00:02:17.487
Remember sodium chloride?

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.400
Well, the electron that sodium loses

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.604
is the one furthest from its nucleus,

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:23.410
and the orbital that electron occupies

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.034
when it goes over to chlorine

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:28.283
is also the one furthest from its nucleus.

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:30.166
But back to covalent bonding.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.692
Carbon has four electrons

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:32.797
that are free to bond,

00:02:32.797 --> 00:02:34.133
nitrogen has three,

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.412
oxygen two.

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.274
So, carbon is likely to form four bonds,

00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:38.106
nitrogen three,

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:39.603
and oxygen two.

00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:41.303
Hydrogen only has one electron,

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:43.410
so it can only form one bond.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.890
In some special cases,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.432
atoms can form more bonds

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.522
than you'd expect,

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.998
but they better have a really good reason to do so,

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:52.077
or things tend to fly apart.

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.099
Groups of atoms

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.112
that share electrons covalently with each other

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:56.819
are called molecules.

00:02:57.557 --> 00:02:58.578
They can be small.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.612
For example, every molecule of oxygen gas

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:03.087
is made up of just two oxygen atoms

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:04.523
bonded to each other.

00:03:04.523 --> 00:03:06.192
Or they could be really, really big.

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:09.379
Human chromosome 13 is just two molecules,

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.022
but each one has over 37 billion atoms.

00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:14.210
And this neighborhood,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.183
this city of atoms,

00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:18.230
is held together by the humble chemical bond.
