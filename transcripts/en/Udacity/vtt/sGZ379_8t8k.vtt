00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.950
We've just made an interactive
InVision prototype.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.980
Well done.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.110
&gt;&gt; Remember though, the vital part
of prototyping is iteration and

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.820
constant improvement.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.150
We got some feedback at the end
of the last lesson, and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.610
we decided on a few potential changes.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.680
&gt;&gt; It's now time to implement those
changes in our interactive prototype.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.770
Jay Can you remind me
what those changes were?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.150
The main feedback we received revolved
around the task functionality

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.600
not being clear.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.910
Carl suggested making the main screen be
our day screen which had the checkboxes.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.160
We also decided that it would be best to
have those checkboxes have some higher

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.340
visibility and visual weight.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.230
Finally, we decided that our wording
around task and events was unclear.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.890
Remember, we had intended for
them to be the same object, but

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.690
we've used two different words for them.
