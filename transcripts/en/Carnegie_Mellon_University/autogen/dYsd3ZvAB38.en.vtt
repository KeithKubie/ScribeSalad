I think Carnegie Mellon can play a key

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460
I think Carnegie Mellon can play a key
 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.040
I think Carnegie Mellon can play a key
role in solar technology

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050
role in solar technology
 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.260
role in solar technology
we can make plastics that conduct

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270
we can make plastics that conduct
 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.850
we can make plastics that conduct
electricity

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860
electricity
 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.200
electricity
or absorb light from the Sun and turn

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
or absorb light from the Sun and turn
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.900
or absorb light from the Sun and turn
the light into electricity now the power

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910
the light into electricity now the power
 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.159
the light into electricity now the power
of that is that you can make that you

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169
of that is that you can make that you
 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.529
of that is that you can make that you
can dissolve these plastics just like

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539
can dissolve these plastics just like
 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.630
can dissolve these plastics just like
you can dissolve any plastics and then

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640
you can dissolve any plastics and then
 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.609
you can dissolve any plastics and then
you can make any shape or form out of

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619
you can make any shape or form out of
 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.490
you can make any shape or form out of
them so you can print them you can do

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500
them so you can print them you can do
 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.770
them so you can print them you can do
roll-to-roll printing you can print it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780
roll-to-roll printing you can print it
 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.510
roll-to-roll printing you can print it
essentially like a newspaper because you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520
essentially like a newspaper because you
 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.850
essentially like a newspaper because you
can make an ink and so the technology

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860
can make an ink and so the technology
 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.850
can make an ink and so the technology
will be incredibly cheap if you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860
will be incredibly cheap if you can
 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.550
will be incredibly cheap if you can
imagine literally going to home depot

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560
imagine literally going to home depot
 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.460
imagine literally going to home depot
and buying just sheets of plastic that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470
and buying just sheets of plastic that
 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.040
and buying just sheets of plastic that
they could tear off that basically you

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050
they could tear off that basically you
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.330
they could tear off that basically you
give to the person who cleans your

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340
give to the person who cleans your
 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.460
give to the person who cleans your
windows who would just install these

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470
windows who would just install these
 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.979
windows who would just install these
into your windows so that you would have

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
into your windows so that you would have
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.650
into your windows so that you would have
electricity in your homes that is

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660
electricity in your homes that is
 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.330
electricity in your homes that is
basically integrated into your windows

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
basically integrated into your windows
 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.289
basically integrated into your windows
and if I had on my blackberry simply

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299
and if I had on my blackberry simply
 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.170
and if I had on my blackberry simply
coated with a plastic that was a solar

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180
coated with a plastic that was a solar
 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.850
coated with a plastic that was a solar
charger then I would never have to worry

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860
charger then I would never have to worry
 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.450
charger then I would never have to worry
about ever charging it so we could just

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
about ever charging it so we could just
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.080
about ever charging it so we could just
revolutionize the world through off-grid

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
revolutionize the world through off-grid
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.149
revolutionize the world through off-grid
portable lightweight solar power and

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159
portable lightweight solar power and
 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.410
portable lightweight solar power and
these were technologies that were

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
these were technologies that were
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.710
these were technologies that were
created at Carnegie Mellon
