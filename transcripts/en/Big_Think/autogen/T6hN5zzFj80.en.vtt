sensory deprivation we put people in

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450
sensory deprivation we put people in
 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.430
sensory deprivation we put people in
dark soundproof rooms or water tanks and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440
dark soundproof rooms or water tanks and
 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.100
dark soundproof rooms or water tanks and
people are becoming aware that we needed

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110
people are becoming aware that we needed
 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.460
people are becoming aware that we needed
sensation stimulation variation

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470
sensation stimulation variation
 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.140
sensation stimulation variation
stimulation almost as much as we need

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
stimulation almost as much as we need
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.170
stimulation almost as much as we need
food and water and so forth the basic

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
food and water and so forth the basic
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.990
food and water and so forth the basic
need and deprivation of this kind of

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000
need and deprivation of this kind of
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.340
need and deprivation of this kind of
stimulation led to some very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350
stimulation led to some very
 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.500
stimulation led to some very
uncomfortable states so we we asked is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
uncomfortable states so we we asked is
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.750
uncomfortable states so we we asked is
there a sense a personality trait that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760
there a sense a personality trait that
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.950
there a sense a personality trait that
some people need more stimulation or

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960
some people need more stimulation or
 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.620
some people need more stimulation or
more variety or intensity of stimulation

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630
more variety or intensity of stimulation
 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.780
more variety or intensity of stimulation
than others that's when we developed our

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790
than others that's when we developed our
 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.889
than others that's when we developed our
first sensation-seeking scale and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
first sensation-seeking scale and
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.569
first sensation-seeking scale and
subsequently that expanded became the

main focus of my research is the we were

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229
main focus of my research is the we were
 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.499
main focus of my research is the we were
surprised by how many things were

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509
surprised by how many things were
 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.740
surprised by how many things were
affected by this trait sensation-seeking

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
affected by this trait sensation-seeking
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.700
affected by this trait sensation-seeking
and then we got interested in the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710
and then we got interested in the
 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.749
and then we got interested in the
biological basis a genetic and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759
biological basis a genetic and
 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.180
biological basis a genetic and
biological basis and here again we had

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190
biological basis and here again we had
 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.850
biological basis and here again we had
some very interesting findings pointing

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860
some very interesting findings pointing
 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.990
some very interesting findings pointing
to the fact that this is a very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000
to the fact that this is a very
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.480
to the fact that this is a very
fundamental trait with biological roots

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490
 
 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.670

biometrics of behavior genetics actually

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509
biometrics of behavior genetics actually
 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.950
biometrics of behavior genetics actually
and using both these twin studies we

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
and using both these twin studies we
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.929
and using both these twin studies we
initially found that roughly 60% the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939
initially found that roughly 60% the
 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.050
initially found that roughly 60% the
heritability heritability is the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060
heritability heritability is the
 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.700
heritability heritability is the
proportion of the variance trait that's

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710
proportion of the variance trait that's
 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.330
proportion of the variance trait that's
determined by genetics and we discovered

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
determined by genetics and we discovered
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.240
determined by genetics and we discovered
that was 60% which is very high for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250
that was 60% which is very high for
 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.399
that was 60% which is very high for
personality trait which generally run

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409
personality trait which generally run
 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.840
personality trait which generally run
between 30 and 50% so 60% is high for a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
between 30 and 50% so 60% is high for a
 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.949
between 30 and 50% so 60% is high for a
personality trait

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959
personality trait
 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.139
personality trait
well it's higher for intelligence and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
well it's higher for intelligence and
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.600
well it's higher for intelligence and
some other traits so more recently this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
some other traits so more recently this
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.130
some other traits so more recently this
was established not only using twins

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
was established not only using twins
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.039
was established not only using twins
raised together but twins raised apart

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049
raised together but twins raised apart
 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.930

showing that it wasn't due to the fact
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.340
showing that it wasn't due to the fact
of sharing a stimulating environment

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350
of sharing a stimulating environment
 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.280
of sharing a stimulating environment
let's say there is an environmental

we can surmise
is that the fortunately since a

related the sensation-seeking uh
 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.720
related the sensation-seeking uh
dopamine receptor gene so that means

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
dopamine receptor gene so that means
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.400

it's been there a long time well
 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.290

you say how risky is this the highs are

00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:39.759
you say how risky is this the highs are
 

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:44.519
you say how risky is this the highs are
going to say it's riskier and then when

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:44.529
going to say it's riskier and then when
 

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:47.519
going to say it's riskier and then when
they do it they demonstrate less fear

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:47.529
they do it they demonstrate less fear
 

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:49.530
they do it they demonstrate less fear
arousal because fear arousal make

something unpleasant those who are not
that high in sensation seeking they may

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.130
that high in sensation seeking they may
 

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.280
that high in sensation seeking they may
get the try it under peer pressure or

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:56.290
get the try it under peer pressure or
 

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.019
get the try it under peer pressure or
something and then they find that

00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:58.029
something and then they find that
 

00:13:58.029 --> 00:14:00.179
something and then they find that
they're tremendous even though no harm

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:00.189
they're tremendous even though no harm
 

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:02.790

unpleasant experience because of the
 

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.050
unpleasant experience because of the
fear that it arouses so they'll never do

fear that it arouses so they'll never do
 

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.400
fear that it arouses so they'll never do
it again they say okay I've done that

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:08.410
it again they say okay I've done that

you know because it was fearful they
 

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:23.579

as high sensation seekers become

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079
as high sensation seekers become
 

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.679
as high sensation seekers become
habituated they become bored with it and

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:56.689
habituated they become bored with it and
 

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.239
habituated they become bored with it and
they need something more they go to

00:15:58.239 --> 00:15:58.249
they need something more they go to

something that's more exciting
 

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:02.799
something that's more exciting
same thing in thrill seeking for

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:02.809
same thing in thrill seeking for
 

00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:06.639
same thing in thrill seeking for
instance skydivers they stay find that

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:06.649
instance skydivers they stay find that
 

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:08.049
instance skydivers they stay find that
very initially very exciting and that's

00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:08.059
very initially very exciting and that's
 

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:10.540
very initially very exciting and that's
why they like it the high sensation then

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.550
why they like it the high sensation then
 

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.919
why they like it the high sensation then
they become used to it so they have to

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:11.929
they become used to it so they have to
 

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.949
they become used to it so they have to
do new things like they do the stunting

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959
do new things like they do the stunting
 

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:17.470
do new things like they do the stunting
and things like this group things and

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480
and things like this group things and
 

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.600
and things like this group things and
then that becomes boring and someone go

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:19.610
then that becomes boring and someone go
 

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.509
then that becomes boring and someone go
on even more dangerous forms like BASE

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519
on even more dangerous forms like BASE
 

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:24.639
on even more dangerous forms like BASE
jumping you know what BASE jumping is

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:24.649
jumping you know what BASE jumping is
 

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:28.150
jumping you know what BASE jumping is
BASE jumping is you jump not from an

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160
BASE jumping is you jump not from an
 

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.730
BASE jumping is you jump not from an
airplane but from a cliff or a building

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:30.740
airplane but from a cliff or a building
 

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.369

even or when something where you have

00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:33.379
even or when something where you have
 

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:36.389
even or when something where you have
very little time to open your parachute

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399
very little time to open your parachute
 

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:38.889
very little time to open your parachute
timing is very important and a lot of a

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:38.899
timing is very important and a lot of a
 

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.160
timing is very important and a lot of a
lot more people die at that sort of

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.170
lot more people die at that sort of
 

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.639
lot more people die at that sort of
parachuting

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:42.649

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:45.009
parachuting
okay and yet why do they do it you know

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:45.019
okay and yet why do they do it you know
 

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:47.290
okay and yet why do they do it you know
because it's really more exciting that's

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:47.300
because it's really more exciting that's
 

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.670
because it's really more exciting that's
because the fact that they have less

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680
because the fact that they have less
 

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.439
because the fact that they have less
time it's not that they they do it you

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:53.449
time it's not that they they do it you
 

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:54.790
time it's not that they they do it you
know they be clever think I'm a bitch

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800
know they be clever think I'm a bitch

that's that's why everything tends to
 

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:04.090
that's that's why everything tends to
escalate in the sensation-seeking field

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:04.100
escalate in the sensation-seeking field
 

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.799

scream more and more restless twitching

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.170
scream more and more restless twitching
 

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.140

turning you know on the bed they began

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.150
turning you know on the bed they began
 

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.460
turning you know on the bed they began
to sing to themselves even though they

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.470
to sing to themselves even though they
 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.470
to sing to themselves even though they
knew they weren't supposed to speak or

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480
knew they weren't supposed to speak or
 

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.970
knew they weren't supposed to speak or
to stimulate themselves they become the

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:51.980
to stimulate themselves they become the
 

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.799
to stimulate themselves they become the
stimulate themselves so that was the

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:53.809
stimulate themselves so that was the
 

00:17:53.809 --> 00:18:01.540
stimulate themselves so that was the
expression if you go a long period

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:01.550
expression if you go a long period
 

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.190

what's happening in the brain is over

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200
what's happening in the brain is over
 

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.980
what's happening in the brain is over
longer periods of time even over shorter

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:05.990
longer periods of time even over shorter
 

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.020
longer periods of time even over shorter
periods is that the the brain waves is

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.030
periods is that the the brain waves is
 

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.380
periods is that the the brain waves is
slowing down the basic arousal patterns

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.390
slowing down the basic arousal patterns
 

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.290
slowing down the basic arousal patterns
in the brain the the alpha waves are

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:14.300
in the brain the the alpha waves are
 

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.980
in the brain the the alpha waves are
getting slower okay and that the most

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:17.990
getting slower okay and that the most
 

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.770
getting slower okay and that the most
people is unpleasant I mean you know the

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:20.780
people is unpleasant I mean you know the
 

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.450
people is unpleasant I mean you know the
group below your optimal level of

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:22.460
group below your optimal level of
 

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.790
group below your optimal level of
arousal because for any prolonged period

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:24.800
arousal because for any prolonged period
 

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.280
arousal because for any prolonged period
of time becomes unpleasant and if you

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:27.290
of time becomes unpleasant and if you
 

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.049
of time becomes unpleasant and if you
give them any kind of stimulation in

00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:29.059
give them any kind of stimulation in
 

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:30.970
give them any kind of stimulation in
sensory deprivation even looking at the

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:30.980
sensory deprivation even looking at the
 

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.330
sensory deprivation even looking at the
meaningless blotches of color they will

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:34.340
meaningless blotches of color they will
 

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.760
meaningless blotches of color they will
have at least press a bar to do that

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:36.770
have at least press a bar to do that
 

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.060
have at least press a bar to do that
know they're being deprived of something

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.070
know they're being deprived of something
 

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.970
know they're being deprived of something
variety and variety of stimulation and

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:42.980
variety and variety of stimulation and
 

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.280
variety and variety of stimulation and
when you deprive people of that that is

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:45.290
when you deprive people of that that is
 

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.770
when you deprive people of that that is
very immersive to them okay it's one of

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:47.780
very immersive to them okay it's one of
 

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.500
very immersive to them okay it's one of
the ways of torture you actually of

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:50.510
the ways of torture you actually of
 

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.080
the ways of torture you actually of
putting people it's not just the social

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.090
putting people it's not just the social
 

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.330
putting people it's not just the social
and sensory deprivation when you put

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:55.340
and sensory deprivation when you put
 

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.070
and sensory deprivation when you put
someone you know it's the sensory

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080
someone you know it's the sensory
 

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.010
someone you know it's the sensory
deprivation you put people in the

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.020
deprivation you put people in the
 

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.320
deprivation you put people in the
environment they may not be in the

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.330
environment they may not be in the
 

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.880
environment they may not be in the
sensory deprivation but if nothing is

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:03.890
sensory deprivation but if nothing is
 

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.250
sensory deprivation but if nothing is
varying in their sensory environment it

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.260
varying in their sensory environment it
 

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.090
varying in their sensory environment it
is becoming increasingly aversive

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100
 
 

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:17.470
 
no it's not humane and it's not and over

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480
no it's not humane and it's not and over
 

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.880
no it's not humane and it's not and over
solitary confinement that's gold and you

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:19.890
solitary confinement that's gold and you
 

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.870
solitary confinement that's gold and you
know in prison this one they want to

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880
know in prison this one they want to
 

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.920
know in prison this one they want to
punish them and they put them in

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:21.930
punish them and they put them in
 

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.440
punish them and they put them in
solitary confinement which is usually a

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:24.450
solitary confinement which is usually a
 

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.330
solitary confinement which is usually a
sensory deprivation as well because

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340
sensory deprivation as well because
 

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.040
sensory deprivation as well because
they're even if there's light in the

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.050
they're even if there's light in the
 

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.160
they're even if there's light in the
cell there's no variation okay nothing

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.170
cell there's no variation okay nothing
 

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.590
cell there's no variation okay nothing
is changing no one to talk to you know

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600
is changing no one to talk to you know
 

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.990
is changing no one to talk to you know
part of social isolation is the lack of

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000
part of social isolation is the lack of
 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.370
part of social isolation is the lack of
social stimulation okay so this this is

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:42.380
social stimulation okay so this this is
 

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.310
social stimulation okay so this this is
over times is very torturous you might

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
over times is very torturous you might
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.300
over times is very torturous you might
say it's a it's a mental torture of a

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:50.310
say it's a it's a mental torture of a
 

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.490
say it's a it's a mental torture of a
sort that's that is very could be very

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500
sort that's that is very could be very
 

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.270
sort that's that is very could be very
effective the torture is often usually

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280
effective the torture is often usually
 

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.910
effective the torture is often usually
isolate their prisoners before they

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:58.920
isolate their prisoners before they
 

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.240
isolate their prisoners before they
begin interrogating them because then

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.250
begin interrogating them because then
 

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.000
begin interrogating them because then
they respond but the tendency to respond

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.010
they respond but the tendency to respond
 

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.680
they respond but the tendency to respond
to any stimulation even interrogation

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:06.690
to any stimulation even interrogation
 

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.670
to any stimulation even interrogation
there's more there's more run by the leg

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:10.680
there's more there's more run by the leg
 

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.280
there's more there's more run by the leg
by the sensory deprivation

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:15.290
 
 

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.430
 
well as I say it came out of a natural

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440
well as I say it came out of a natural
 

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.880
well as I say it came out of a natural
course out of my research and sensory

sensation-seeking
 

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.290
sensation-seeking
but I must admit perhaps I was at the

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:29.300
but I must admit perhaps I was at the
 

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.870
but I must admit perhaps I was at the
time of my life you know I looked at

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880
time of my life you know I looked at
 

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.690
time of my life you know I looked at
people and friends who are higher since

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:34.700
people and friends who are higher since
 

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.270
people and friends who are higher since
high sensation seekers and I looked at

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280
high sensation seekers and I looked at
 

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.130
high sensation seekers and I looked at
that once I can now use them as well

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.140
that once I can now use them as well
 

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.540
that once I can now use them as well
that kind of a prototype when I was

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:40.550
that kind of a prototype when I was
 

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.580
that kind of a prototype when I was
designing this straight but oh well what

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:42.590
designing this straight but oh well what
 

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.050
designing this straight but oh well what
would they what are the things they do

would they what are the things they do
 

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.800
would they what are the things they do
what do they like you know it's kind of

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:47.810
what do they like you know it's kind of
 

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.710
what do they like you know it's kind of
prototype for writing items for my scale

no it didn't of course it went on you

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.040
no it didn't of course it went on you
 

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.910
no it didn't of course it went on you
know we have other ways then once we had

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:54.920
know we have other ways then once we had
 

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.860
know we have other ways then once we had
these items we have to have the idea it

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:56.870
these items we have to have the idea it
 

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.820
these items we have to have the idea it
was a new idea for a trait it was a new

which no one was really measuring at
 

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.710
which no one was really measuring at
that time okay so to get my idea I

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720
that time okay so to get my idea I
 

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.330
that time okay so to get my idea I
looked around me at you know and what

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340
looked around me at you know and what
 

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.150
looked around me at you know and what
people were doing and I said and I and

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:10.160
people were doing and I said and I and

parachutes skydiving you know because we
 

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.130
parachutes skydiving you know because we
assume most people aren't doing it but

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.140
assume most people aren't doing it but

you know when we looked at sex drugs and

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.150
you know when we looked at sex drugs and
 

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.170
you know when we looked at sex drugs and
we asked questions about would you like

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.180

so that's how I got the initial items
 

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.740
so that's how I got the initial items
now we have different kinds of items now

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:11.750
now we have different kinds of items now
 

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.360
now we have different kinds of items now
the don't include content just the need

professor teaching you can't be too high
 

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.370
professor teaching you can't be too high
because if you're too high you know you

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:26.380
because if you're too high you know you
 

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.810
because if you're too high you know you
know you're out of it y'all doing other

was in England by this time I was

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:46.150
was in England by this time I was
 

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.640

mine was my last sabbatical but I had

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.550
mine was my last sabbatical but I had
 

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.400
mine was my last sabbatical but I had
the chance I was in the genetics lab

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.410
the chance I was in the genetics lab
 

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.760
the chance I was in the genetics lab
there and I had the chance to have my

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:56.770
there and I had the chance to have my
 

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.180
there and I had the chance to have my
own DNA an examined for the presence of

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.190
own DNA an examined for the presence of
 

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.180

gene so I did and I found I had the long
 

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.530
gene so I did and I found I had the long
form of the gene which is the type

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:07.540
form of the gene which is the type
 

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.390

but as I explained to my colleagues

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.090
but as I explained to my colleagues
 

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.100

of the double-decker bus in London you

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:23.710
of the double-decker bus in London you
 

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.990
of the double-decker bus in London you
know because eight you know you may have

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000
know because eight you know you may have

biological factors related to age

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260
biological factors related to age
 

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.880

normally like the rise of Mao with age

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:37.890
normally like the rise of Mao with age
 

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:45.280
normally like the rise of Mao with age
which reduces sensation-seeking

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.290
