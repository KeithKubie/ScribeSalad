00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.136
SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:10.110
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.985
SPEAKER: Happy pride.

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:11.910
AUDIENCE: Happy pride.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.850
[CHEERING]

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.880
SPEAKER: So a big welcome
to everybody in Dublin

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
and to everybody watching
on livestream in EMEA.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.969
2016, is it really that easy to
bring your whole self to work?

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.760
Have you ever received
a few average grades

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.203
at university or
failed something,

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:32.119
and you've overanalyzed
it time and time again

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.660
wondering what went wrong?

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.050
Have you ever gone to
school in the morning

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
and put your head down and not
wanted anyone to look at you?

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.530
Have you ever gotten a new
haircut and it's gone a bit

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.777
lopsided or it looks
a bit different,

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:47.360
and you know everybody's
watching you,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.420
and you wish they'd stop?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.930
So Google Dublin
for this year is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.381
trying to set the gold standard
for culture and inclusion.

00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:56.630
So I'm very delighted that
we have an external speaker

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.970
with us today, Ailbhe Smyth.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.690
Smyth is an activist
and former academic

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.330
who has been involved in
feminist, LGBT, and radical

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.380
politics for a long time.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.960
She set up the Women's Education
Research and Resource Centre,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.790
and was head of
Women's Studies at UCD,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.770
which is the university in
Dublin, from 1990 until 2006,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.860
when she left the university
to work independently, mainly

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
with community women's
groups and organizations.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760
Ailbhe has lectured
and written extensively

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.350
about feminism, women,
politics, and culture

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.930
in contemporary Ireland.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.360
She's a founding member of
the organization, Marriage

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.200
Equality, and she was
centrally involved

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.551
in the victorious Yes Equality
referendum campaign in 2015.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.300
Please put your hands
together and welcome

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.216
Ailbhe Smith on stage.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.150
AILBHE SMYTH: Thank you.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.930
Thank you very much, Adam,
for that lovely introduction.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.580
And hello everybody.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.270
It is such a treat
to be here in Google.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.115
And perhaps I'll take
my jacket off, actually.

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:07.900
A little bit of strip
at the beginning

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.070
is always a good idea, I think.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.430
You get down to
the real business.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.850
Is it really that easy to
bring your whole self to work?

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.002
I looked at this when Adam sent
me a really very clear e-mail.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.460
And I thought, I
really don't think

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.440
I can do this with
Google because there

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
is a whole experience, there
is a whole world of change,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.250
if you like, that separates
your work experiences and mine.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.350
There's generations
of change there.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.790
And I thought, hmm, maybe
I'll go to the second time

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.170
and see what it says under that.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.640
Take the scarf off?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.310
Right, OK.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.820
What next?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.470
Well, Gayglers are well
used to this kind of thing.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.400
And then the next line was,
how we cope with or bounce back

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.630
from or keep going in adversity.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.960
And I thought, adversity.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.260
I know all about
adversity, absolutely.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.640
So I don't have a grand theory.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.450
I don't have expert solutions.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.520
I don't have a recipe.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.220
I don't even have tips
on how you bounce back

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.920
or stay resilient or whatever.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.620
All I can tell you is
that a couple weeks ago,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.440
as Andrew will confirm,
I celebrated a really big

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.300
birthday.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.400
I really don't want to have to
say it, but my 70th birthday.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.500
And I'm still here.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.760
And I'm still going strong.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.580
So something must be working
somewhere along the line.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.950
And in a way, I thought maybe
the most honest and true thing

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.120
that I could do with
you today is really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.040
tell you a little bit about
what has gone on in my life,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.410
not only in relation
to work because I think

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.630
maybe the first thing I
would say about bringing

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.220
our whole selves into
work is that you have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.360
to be in touch with
who your self is

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.380
and have quite a clear idea
about what parts of your self

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.930
might not be fitting
in here out there.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.520
Whether you bring and what you
bring into the workplace also,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.870
therefore, depends a lot on
you, a lot on your context--

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.990
your social context,
your political context,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.460
your geographical context.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.980
But also, it depends hugely on
the nature of your workplace.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.940
And it's my
impression-- obviously,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.070
I've never worked here.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.960
But it is my impression that
Google is the kind of place

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.260
that you can bring far more
of yourself into than probably

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.700
most of the places
I've ever worked in

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.550
and probably most of the
places that the majority

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.570
of people in the world
actually still work in.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.710
And I think that that's really
a very, very important point.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.110
But before I go on
to talk personally,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.090
I do want to say, echoing Adam's
words, something really very

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.840
important.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.270
And that is to say happy
pride to everybody here

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.270
and to everybody in Google
whether you're L, G, B, T, I,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.700
Q, R, A, I gather--
allies-- whatever you are,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.150
and to say that I love
pride, that I think

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.440
pride is incredibly important.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.130
I think it's
important politically.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.220
I think to make a point that
life is not OK for LGBTQIs

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.870
here, or across the
world, even more.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.560
Everything is not
won because we did

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.460
win that wonderful, glorious
marriage equality victory.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.460
Everything is not
resolved by that.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.460
But I also think that it's
really important socially

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.940
and for our communities.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.100
And I say communities
because I do

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.360
think that LGBTIQ communities
are several, that we interlink,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.520
that we interweave.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.130
But we're not necessarily all
absolutely the same thing.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.670
And I constantly
bear that in mind,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.160
that there are many, many
differences between us.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.640
But I do think it's important
for community, and not least

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.870
because that sense of community
and the importance of community

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.340
is something which I think
is becoming increasingly

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.270
difficult to maintain in the
material and physical world

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.050
in the 2000s.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.360
And it seems to me
that that's something

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.080
that we do very, very well
through our pride celebrations,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.930
not just in Ireland, but
throughout the world.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.350
So I think it's
absolutely true that when

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.520
I march with all the wonderful,
the beautiful, the brave,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.320
the excellent, the
funny, the clever people

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.350
who also march in pride,
and whatever their sexuality

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.320
and however they define or we
define our sexuality, I do.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.050
I just burst with pride when I
think of all of the challenges

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.100
and the difficulties
and the obstacles

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.910
and the plain downright
horrible, damaging homophobia

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.100
that so many of us
have faced and go

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.160
on facing in some instances
in our lives, some people,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.760
much more so than others.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.410
But there is hardly--
and certainly

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.530
in my generation and the
generation after me, there

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:17.180
is not an LGBTIQ life that is
unscathed by that homophobia.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.620
None of us have
got off scot free.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.570
I've never yet met
somebody, LGBT,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.240
et cetera, who has said to
me, oh, of my generation

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.110
and certainly the
one after me, and I

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.700
do believe right down or
up or across or however it

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.770
is you talk about
generations, there

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.010
is no life that hasn't
been touched in some way

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.000
and in many ways shaped
and really framed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.100
by that homophobia.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.800
And just to remind
myself as much as anybody

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.100
else here that homophobia
is quite simply

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.450
a dislike, a hatred of
people who are lesbian

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.070
or gay or bisexual or
transgender or intersex

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.680
or queer, and that even to say
that to yourself, even for me

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.010
to say that to myself,
gives me a shock every time

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.690
I think of it,
every time I see it.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.310
Why?

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.690
Because I feel it in my body.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.050
And I feel it in my bones.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.490
And however brave and however
determined and however much fun

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.360
we have and however much
whatever, to have that frisson,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.810
to have that shake
in your bones,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.380
to have that little
feeling in your flesh

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.679
still there, that
there are people

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:37.250
who don't like people like you,
people like me, people like us,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.809
to feel that whether it's
in relation to our sexuality

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.140
or any other aspect
of ourselves--

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.620
our ethnicity, our
social class, whether we

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.930
have a disability,
whatever it is-- that is

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.190
a deeply disempowering thing.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.920
So it is incredibly
important for us,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.820
I think, in a way
to recognize it

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.690
and to overcome that and
deal with it because I don't

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.450
know about you, but my vision
or my dream for a world--

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:11.980
and I say this as a feminist as
much as an LGBT activist-- is

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.370
a world where gender doesn't
matter anymore, where gender

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.160
doesn't determine in any way
the shape of your life, where

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.540
gender is not a factor that
is in any way allowed to get

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.750
into your bones and
shape you and make you,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.990
where gender is simply neutral.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.610
And that doesn't mean, by the
way, that we don't have sex.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.360
That has absolutely
nothing to do with sex.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.000
So let's get that point very
clear in our heads as well.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.640
A world where gender is
not socially determining

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.540
is the world I would dream of.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.900
And are we there yet,
as they say in the ad?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.430
No, absolutely not.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.100
Maybe a bit closer
here in this country.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.240
Maybe a bit closer
in some countries.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.720
But in many cases, not at all.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.580
But when I say I burst with
pride, marching in pride,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.810
there's also a part
of me-- and it's maybe

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.040
the contrary part of
me-- that's saying

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.900
I'm not quite sure the
"proud" is the right word

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.910
to use to describe or to define
how I feel about being lesbian.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.306
I came out late.

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.180
Well, I mean, I think
that nowadays, it would

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.310
be considered rather late.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.090
I was in my 30s, although
back then, way back then,

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.070
it wasn't all that bizarre.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.280
I grew up without ever
hearing the word "lesbian."

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.320
I didn't even get
the word "gay."

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.060
I mean, there was Hilton Edwards
and the whole Michael Mac

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.120
Liammóir, who were two
theatrical personages.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.660
And we knew that
they were a couple.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.520
But nobody ever said
to me, oh, they're gay.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.910
And nobody ever
said to me, well,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.290
do you see that woman there?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.170
She's lesbian.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.750
I just had never heard them.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.630
We didn't have the internet
obviously, the media.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.070
I grew up in a world which
was definitionally, absolutely

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.170
dead straight.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.580
A lot of it was pretty dead.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.680
But it was really,
really, really, really,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.510
really straight.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.650
So when I did come out-- as I
say, rather late, in my 30s--

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.020
even though I knew-- I
knew that in my bones

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.620
already that it wasn't
going to be a picnic being

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.370
lesbian in Ireland at the time.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.590
I was still absolutely thrilled
to discover that I was lesbian.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.140
And I have to tell you, I
am still totally thrilled

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.070
by the fact that I'm lesbian.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.980
So it's not about being proud.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.340
I didn't do anything.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.480
I didn't achieve anything
in order to be lesbian.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.720
It's not something that I
deserve merit for or applause

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.220
or anything.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.200
I just am lesbian.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.730
And I absolutely love it.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.710
And I love girls!

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.596
I love women!

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:49.548
And that's it!

00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:51.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.290
But I am at the same
time very proud to be

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.930
part of a set of
communities, if you like,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.740
where we have fought so
hard so that people like me

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.480
and people like you can
stand up and say, oh,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.670
isn't it great to be gay?

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.090
Isn't it fantastic to be bi?

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.374
Isn't it just brilliant
to be lesbian?

00:12:14.374 --> 00:12:16.040
Frankly, I think
that's the best of all.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.748
But there you go.

00:12:16.748 --> 00:12:18.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.920
A world where it's not all that
easy to stand up and say I'm

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.770
trans or I'm intersex.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.830
And that, I think,
is true in Ireland,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.220
as much as it is right
across Europe insofar

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.940
as we have Europe anymore
at all after today.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.850
And also, in North
America, in South America,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.830
and so on and so forth.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.350
So there are a lot
of difficulties.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:45.220
But of course, although I say I
came out when I was in my 30s,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.066
I didn't really come out
at all because I couldn't.

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.360
I couldn't.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.270
There were people, also
lesbians, who knew.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.920
And I knew.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.520
And we went to more or less
the same sorts of places,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.770
and we were friends.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.890
But I couldn't come out
to most of my family.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.890
Indeed, when I tried, it wasn't
that they pushed me away.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.500
But the shutters came down.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.880
They didn't want to hear.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.100
They didn't want to know.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.730
It was not part of
their vocabulary.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.340
It wasn't part of
their picture of me

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.810
as a member of their family.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.490
So for a long time, it was as
if you can imagine a family

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.460
photograph, where I was in
it, but with a black curtain

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.300
or something, yeah,
a big black curtain

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.810
pulled down over my face
so that I was in the family

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.300
but not as me, not the whole me.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.790
And that's where the
whole self thing comes in

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.990
because that was something
that I struggled with for years

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.850
and years and years.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.960
Eventually, most of my family
did actually come round.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.190
And my parents, one
way and another,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.510
were-- my father died
shortly after that.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.850
But my mother was
reasonably supportive.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.640
There are other
stories about that.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.060
She used to-- when I
would bring girlfriends--

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.830
because I carried on as if
I was a proper, up front,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.077
straight-up person,
member of this family.

00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:08.660
So I would arrive
with the girlfriend.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.270
And I would say,
here is Mary Jane,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.479
or here is Patricia whatever.

00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:13.103
And there was more
than one girlfriend,

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.010
as to you probably can
guess at this stage.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.874
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.920
She would make an
instant decision.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.070
And she used to offer the ones
she liked a glass of sherry,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.696
which they never liked.

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:27.820
And she would offer all of
the others a cup of tea.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.550
So that was her way of grading
her response to my lesbian

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.050
life.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.080
So it was really
very interesting.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.220
But I think my point is that
although I came out, really,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.600
I couldn't actually
be out because they

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.420
wouldn't let me be out.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.400
They didn't want me
to be the thing I was.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.940
They liked what
they thought was me.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.010
But they didn't
like that part of me

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.180
that was, at that stage,
very centrally me,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.000
if that doesn't sound
too complicated.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.320
And exactly that
kind of situation

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.470
was replicated in my
straight friendship circles,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:07.270
where my social life just
completely went to the ground,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.075
and where in work,
exactly the same.

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:14.710
Now, I worked in UCD, which
probably as a university

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.250
would have been considered
quite a liberal institution.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.070
But it wasn't when
it came to sexuality.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.080
And people told me
very specifically--

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.290
and I'm thinking back now
to the end of the '80s

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.400
and the beginning of the 1990s.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.730
People told me, well,
OK, we've no problem

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.170
with you being lesbian.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.260
That was lucky, wasn't it?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.490
They had no problem
with who I was.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.970
Think about the language there.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.040
It's actually very condescending
and patronizing language.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.030
But we don't advise
you to come out.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.550
It wouldn't be a good
idea for promotion.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.450
I was already a bad
idea for promotion.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.030
I was a feminist.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.060
I was a radical.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.680
I was pro-choice.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.290
I had left my husband after
six months of marriage

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.470
because it just
wasn't a good idea.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.630
So I got out before
we got pinned down.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.800
Why did I get married?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.800
Because that was girls
of my middle class

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.350
did in this country at the time.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.080
It didn't suit me at all.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.500
But all of those things
were known about me,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.950
that I was feminist,
and that I was radical,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.850
and that I had left a marriage.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.380
At that time, a lot
of you won't know,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.790
there was no divorce in Ireland.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.320
We didn't have divorce in
Ireland until 1995, I think.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.070
Two referendums, in '95.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.800
And of course, I was
pro-choice, which

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.280
has always been a very,
very subversive thing

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.520
to be in this country.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.590
So at work, I was advised
not to say I was out

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.930
because it would affect
my promotional prospects,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.860
whereas I knew perfectly well
that my promotional prospects

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.910
were already right down
the tubes quite a long time

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.000
before that.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.480
So within a couple of years,
I thought, let's do this.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.470
Let's actually all be out, all
of us who are lesbians in UCD,

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.450
and stop this absolute nonsense.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.800
So at that stage,
I was heading up

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.560
the Center for Women's Studies.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.280
And I thought, I
know what we'll do.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.380
We'll have a day especially
for lesbians at the university

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.260
and see how they deal
with that little one.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.030
So we did.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.839
And we started
Lesbian Lives, which

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.569
is a conference-- and now a
two or three day conference--

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.240
that goes on every year.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.319
So I think in that
instance, what

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.329
I was trying to do was
to say, I can't really

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.850
continue in this
environment unless I

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.490
am able to just simply
be all of myself.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.860
And that part of
myself is a part

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.030
that I am not ashamed of,
that I am very pleased about.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.160
But I can't do this on my own.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.400
It's not just up to me.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.950
There are other people here.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.650
There are other
people out there who

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.150
need to be involved
and included in that.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.180
And that was, in
a way, I suppose,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.850
my response, but also my
challenge to the place that I

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.390
worked in, which was really
to put it up to them, to say,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.370
we're going to have this
Lesbian Lives day on two days.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.730
And yes, we will be here openly
in this precious environment

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.280
of the university.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.860
And the wrath of God
or the president of UCD

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.380
did not fall on top of my head.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.150
What did they do?

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.260
They just simply
continued to ignore.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.090
It was as if it
had never happened.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.640
Lesbian Lives happened
the next year, same thing.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.680
It was as if that had
never, ever, ever happened.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.010
And I realized then-- it
taught me a really, really

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.740
good lesson, that
sometimes you really

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.290
have to go right
up to them and say,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.360
you have to take this on board.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.720
You can't go on ignoring this
because if you have staff

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.560
who are lesbian and students
now who are lesbian,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.730
think of all the others,
think of everyone else,

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.540
think of the future,
think of what

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.880
it is doing to your
university, our university

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.340
that you are in denial.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.730
And that was a kind
of microcosm of what

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:10.440
was happening in this country as
a whole, I think, at the time.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.420
I think that I was very lucky.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.790
I'd had a few hard
knocks at that stage.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.230
And as I say, I realized
that I wasn't exactly

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.740
on the fast track
to three chairs

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.440
and 60 million research grants,
although actually things

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.270
did come in the fullness
of time, I'm glad to say.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.130
But I knew that I had
to go out and do that.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.200
But I also knew I absolutely
couldn't do it on my own.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200
And as soon as I put the
call out, just a little

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.140
notice-- I think it was still at
the very early days of e-mail,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.640
even.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.760
Gosh, I'm so dinosauric,
when I think about it.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.760
It was all done by hand
and little notice boards

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.340
and so on and so forth, asking
people to come to a meeting

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.730
about running a Lesbian
Lives conference.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.580
Actually, women did come along.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.500
It was quite extraordinary.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.480
And I think that then
around about that time,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.860
it was decided after Lesbian
Lives that there would

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.600
be a gay [? sock ?] in UCD.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.920
And that actually happened.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.040
But as I say, I had a little
bit of previous adversity.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.350
There was the problem of
leaving my husband, which

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.390
really was a dreadful thing
to do in Ireland at the time.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.860
And I had then gone on, as
one does, and met another guy,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.770
who I really quite fancied.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.740
And we decided to have
a baby, which we did.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.080
But of course, I was still
married to somebody else.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.470
And there was no divorce.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.980
And that was a mortal sin.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.710
So I was very marginalized
because of that.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.630
And technically, my
daughter was considered

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.760
illegitimate and a bastard.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.520
And that was also something
which had to be taken on.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.010
Also, not entitled to my pension
in the event of my early death.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.310
So always a material
girl, I actually

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.990
tackled that bit
first to make sure

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.810
that that could be changed.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.462
So that regulation
was actually changed

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.170
for the whole of the
civil service, which

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.490
I thought was very important.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.180
And then, eventually
illegitimacy

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:14.650
as a category actually was
taken out of our legal system.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.550
And just a bit before
that, I had, I think,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:24.000
really it happened for
all kinds of reasons.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.040
But I had quite a
serious breakdown.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.460
I got anorexia nervosa and had
quite a severe mental breakdown

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.920
and was in hospital
for six months.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.940
And that, of course, was also
hugely, hugely stigmatized.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.860
And I think we know that
mental illness is still very

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.010
stigmatized in this country.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.450
And if nobody would
talk about the fact

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.910
that I was a feminist
and lesbian, certainly,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:51.120
absolutely no one at all
ever referred to the fact

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.640
that I had had a breakdown.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.810
And when I resumed
normal activities,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:01.230
it was, again, as if absolutely
nothing had happened.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.190
So I eventually got over that.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.120
But you might be saying, well,
why am I telling you this?

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.100
Because I think there are a lot
of lives like mine actually.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.690
And I think that what people go
through in our lives is often

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.450
very undercover, and
however open the environment

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.260
we work in, there
can be things that

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.220
are very difficult for
people to talk about.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.720
So it is, I think,
certainly much easier,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.290
much more-- Google is a very
open environment, certainly,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.950
in respect of sexuality.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.630
I don't know about other things.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.600
I do know that there are other
working environments where it's

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.040
really difficult. People
will lose their jobs

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.190
if they have a breakdown.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.840
They will lose their jobs
if there is a suspicion

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.400
that there's mental illness.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.710
They may lose their job
still, although it would never

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.990
be said explicitly, if
they come out as gay,

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.320
and particularly, if
they come out as trans.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.240
So I suppose I'm
saying that we have

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.290
to always look for the ways that
we can do more than survive.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.140
And some of the ways
that I have found

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.410
are to be myself,
full stop, in a way,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.225
to try always to be myself, with
all the complexity that that

00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:26.800
involves, all the
bits and pieces.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.870
We're never just gay.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.760
We're never just lesbian,
like, we're never

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.345
just a woman or just a
man or just a whatever.

00:23:35.345 --> 00:23:38.510
Our identities are so
complicated, aren't they?

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.420
I'm a mother.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.130
I'm a granny.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.810
And my daughter;s one
set of her in-laws,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.870
was a little bit
shocked to think that

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.330
their daughter-in-law's
mother was a dyke.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.553
I mean, not her
sister, but the mother.

00:23:53.553 --> 00:23:54.160
Right.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.660
OK?

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.150
So what was this
going to look like?

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.230
And then you do the
t-shirt bit and you say,

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.370
this is what a
lesbian looks like.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.905
And they say things
to you like, oh,

00:24:03.905 --> 00:24:05.590
but you're really very nice.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.630
What did they expect?

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.630
What did they think
I was going to do?

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.300
Eat them up?

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.530
Devour them?

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.310
I don't know.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.610
That's just those layers of
usually unspoken prejudice

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.740
and bias and fundamentally,
homophobia, fear and hatred

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.310
of lesbians and gays and
bisexuals and transpeople

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.680
that's still there.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.040
But I have found
that it's wiser.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.540
I don't know that it's easier.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.960
I don't know if it's better.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.160
It's just wiser in the long
run to be completely upfront

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.350
about who and what you
are, and preferably,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.845
to find other people
roughly similar to yourself.

00:24:43.845 --> 00:24:44.870
We're all different.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.730
We're all unique.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.350
We're all wonderful
and beautiful.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.120
So find somebody and
somebody and somebody

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.980
as you do with the Gayglers,
who's roughly similar to you.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.080
And take on the situation.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.250
It doesn't have to
be in your face.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.040
It doesn't have to
be confrontational.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.030
It just has to be consistent
and firm and fair and visible

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.160
pretty well all the time.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160
I forgot something else.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.180
I'm now actually beginning
to encounter a bit of ageism.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.555
But nobody here has any
idea what I'm talking about.

00:25:16.555 --> 00:25:18.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.300
So I won't actually
talk about that.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.182
But let me just tell you
that sometimes, I think,

00:25:23.182 --> 00:25:25.390
there's a sense in which
you feel oh, my god, there's

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:31.830
no end to what we
might encounter.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.226
So you might say,
just to finish up,

00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:37.170
have I learned anything that
might be of use to any of you?

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.880
I very much doubt that.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.190
I think that we
create our worlds.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.020
We really do.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.125
I think that for people
under-- roughly speaking,

00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:47.500
I'm not going to put a date,
roughly there in the middle.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:47.800
OK?

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.160
About half way down from me.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.460
Whatever.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.550
It is a very different world.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.230
But I do think that
bearing in mind

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.440
that people's lives--
first thing, I'd say,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.640
people's lives are complicated.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.380
Things can go up and down.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.470
And whatever we do to
always bear that in mind.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.290
Secondly, there are common
threads that unite us,

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.960
and to hold on to those threads
as much as we possibly can.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.350
And the most important thing,
I think, well, the two most

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.010
important things are to speak
up, stand up for yourself,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.550
and just keep at it.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.520
Never give up.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.465
Somebody asked me those 50
best pieces of advice podcast

00:26:29.465 --> 00:26:30.920
thing the other day.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.720
And somebody sent me an e-mail
and said, we want a photograph.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.975
And we want your best advice.

00:26:34.975 --> 00:26:37.770
And I suppose they thought
I'd write a paragraph.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.100
I just put back, never
give up because actually, I

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.530
think that's really important.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:47.040
Whatever it is you're at,
in your job, in your life,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.340
everywhere, if it's
important to you,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.690
if it really matters to you,
stick with it, stand up for it,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.360
get other people to
help you, or work

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.010
with them to stand up for it.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.860
Stick with it.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.820
Don't give up.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.610
Never give in.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.500
Why would we ever give
in to those who would

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.160
have us do something else?

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.330
I'm sure you've found
this a bit meandering.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.790
I hope it might have struck
a chord somewhere, somehow,

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.140
along the line.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.820
It's been really a
pleasure to speak with you.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.220
I'm sure you'd have great
practical questions about how

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.220
to survive in the workplace
to the wonderful panel who

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.970
are coming on now.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.190
And I'll join the panel.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.675
Thank you so much for listening.

00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:27.868
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.082
Oh, I have to sit down.

00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.530
SPEAKER: So thank you
very much, Ailbhe.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.910
Some very inspirational stories.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.436
And I can't wait to hear more.

00:27:41.436 --> 00:27:42.860
So guys, we're going to
a panel discussion now

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.030
and Q&amp;A. So please welcome
Jennifer Kelly, who's

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.914
the vice-president of the Real
Estate and Workplace Services,

00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:49.830
and Andrew Highland,
who's Community Relations

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.135
Manager for the Data Centers.

00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:53.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.528
[WHISPERING]

00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:04.270
So Jen, we might start
with you if you'd

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.960
like to share a few
of your reactions

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.587
to what Ailbhe has talked
about and your own thoughts.

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:10.420
JENNIFER KELLY: Sure,
I loved Ailbhe's talk.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.230
Thank you so much.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.450
I got a lot of laughs.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.000
I got a lot of insights.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.350
And what's great for me
and what struck a chord

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.290
with me is, I don't wake up
every day and say, oh, my god,

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.220
there's the alarm,
fantastic, because I

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.640
love that time of the day.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.140
But I don't wake up and
say, oh, I'm a woman.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.850
I'm a woman today.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.684
I wake up every day.

00:28:28.684 --> 00:28:30.350
And I'm just the same
as everybody else.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.200
I get up and do all
the crazy things we all

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.480
have to do in the mornings.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.410
And the day turns out
differently every day.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.930
So obviously, I really feel that
I do come to work as myself.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.260
I come to work as my whole self.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.450
And I come to work
as my authentic self.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.740
And I don't mask that.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.440
I get up, and I bring my
daughter to school every day.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.940
And I don't apologize for that.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.981
That's an important time.

00:28:50.981 --> 00:28:52.420
That's really important to me.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.410
And where my first
tough part of the day

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.990
is when, some of the other
moms at the gate say,

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.140
would you like to
go to a spin class?

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.389
We're going to
Insomnia for coffee.

00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:04.680
And they'll ask several people.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.670
And then they're just
like, you're going to work.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.170
Right?

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.134
So it's straight off, yes I am.

00:29:09.134 --> 00:29:10.800
And I feel great that
I'm going to work.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.860
But there's this little
judgment right there.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.320
And if I wasn't going
to work, I wouldn't

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.500
be going to spin class.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.240
I just want to put that
out there straightaway.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.350
Because when I go home,
I say to my husband,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.871
they're all off
to the spin class.

00:29:23.871 --> 00:29:26.370
And he gives me the, if you
were off, you wouldn't be going.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.231
So let's just start with that.

00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:29.980
And then I drive through
the Phoenix Park.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.940
And I see all these people out
jogging and pushing the kids.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.994
And then I have other
little bit of guilt.

00:29:34.994 --> 00:29:36.160
And then I just get over it.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.520
And I go to work.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.270
But that, for me,
is the biggest part,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.689
and probably why after
12 years, I still

00:29:42.689 --> 00:29:44.480
love getting up and
going to work at Google

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.740
is I feel that is authentic.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.720
I come to work as me.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.000
And I don't have to make any
allowances or apologies for who

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.360
I am when I come to work.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.222
SPEAKER: I suppose
for me, myself,

00:29:55.222 --> 00:29:57.180
and the world-- I lead
the Gayglers for Dublin.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.200
And I come across people who
are afraid to come out at work

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.697
and not be themselves because
they feel that, depending

00:30:02.697 --> 00:30:04.280
on their own
circumstances, where they

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.255
grew up, or for a
different environments

00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:09.860
that they grew up in, they don't
feel confident in doing that.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.100
But I suppose when you
think about coming out,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.437
it's a difficult conversation.

00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:16.270
So would you have any
difficult conversation

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.640
that you've had in your
life that you could share.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.490
JENNIFER KELLY: Yes.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.524
Specific to work,
I've had conversations

00:30:22.524 --> 00:30:23.940
and I've sat on--
a few times when

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.648
we've had career weeks
and career panels,

00:30:25.648 --> 00:30:29.880
and people have said, where
did you go to college?

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.090
What did you do?

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.220
What qualified you
to come to Google?

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.180
And people have been
quite reactionary

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.420
when I've said to them,
I didn't go to college.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.990
I don't have a degree.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.740
And people have looked at
me, shocked, first of all,

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.800
or have said, how
did you get hired?

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.000
And they've said it
not in a hurtful way.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.100
It was just in a
complete shock way.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.615
And after they've said it,
I've thought, oh, my god, I

00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:54.656
shouldn't have said that.

00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:57.800
I said, I just
guess I was awesome.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.950
I don't know.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.700
I interviewed.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.730
I did 5,000 interviews
back in the day,

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.420
12 years ago, like
everybody else did.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.170
But I came to Google with a lot
of experience doing what I did,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.910
and that was part of, I
guess, why I was hired.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.540
And I get from a culture
perspective, I was a fit.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.391
But that has come
up numerous times.

00:31:15.391 --> 00:31:17.890
And people have even said, we'd
like you to sit on the panel

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.740
and say this.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.600
It's almost you feel like
that's a judgment in itself,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.840
that OK, let's put four
people on that have degrees.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.360
And then let's get
Jen because she's

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.077
the only one we know at Google.

00:31:28.077 --> 00:31:29.660
There might be other
people out there.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.710
We could set up a little group.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.690
And I'm proud that I'm
here today having not gone

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.680
through the same process.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.980
But at the time, it
wasn't an option for me.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.010
When I left school, I needed to
get a job straightaway and be

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.250
somewhat self-sufficient.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.480
And I did.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.560
And I think that
has probably made

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.570
me feel prouder
about who I am today

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:51.800
and what I've achieved today.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.360
AILBHE SMYTH: Woo-hoo,
is what I say.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.510
ANDREW HIGHLAND: Can I
come in there as well?

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:54.880
SPEAKER: Andrew.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.080
ANDREW HIGHLAND: I've
never had to come out

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.205
at work because I've really
been reflecting on this

00:31:58.205 --> 00:31:59.820
since you asked me
to be on the panel.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.150
I've been lucky in that
sense that I've never

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:01.565
had to come out.

00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:02.860
But I have had to
be in conversations

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.690
where, in order for a
client to know that I'm gay,

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.880
I've gone, oh, I'm going
home to my boyfriend,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.838
or something like that.

00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:08.450
But similar to
Ailbhe's experience,

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.730
I have had that, oh, my god.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:11.880
You're gay.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.261
Oh, I never thought
you were gay.

00:32:13.261 --> 00:32:13.760
You know?

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.750
What was one comment.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:22.440
Yeah, you're not
stereotypical, really, are you?

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.300
So that was deep.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.890
And sometimes, I had to bury it.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.100
I had to bury my
activist self down

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.050
because I wanted to tell them
that that was quite offensive

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.840
and the comments
weren't always welcome.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.540
But because they
were a client, I

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.810
had to go, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.310
SPEAKER: And Andrew, you might
elaborate a bit more on that.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.601
So what does that mean for
you to bring your whole self

00:32:40.601 --> 00:32:41.860
to work every day at Google?

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.285
ANDREW HIGHLAND:
Yeah, first thing

00:32:43.285 --> 00:32:45.010
I want to say because
when Adam said it earlier,

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.010
you were all a bit lame.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.720
So I think when we
say happy pride,

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.220
you all need to
scream happy pride,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.270
because pride is about
protest and celebration.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.100
So happy pride, everybody!

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.074
AUDIENCE: Happy pride!

00:32:54.074 --> 00:32:56.115
ANDREW HIGHLAND: That's
much better, much better.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.010
Pride, for me-- or excuse
me, bringing my whole self

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.480
to work for me, and especially
since I've been in Google

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.960
and experiencing Gayglers
for the first time in terms

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.530
of a group for gay
people, LGBT people,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.370
I think it's
absolutely marvelous.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.580
I reflected on
things like Orlando

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.170
and what happened there.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.990
I've been reflecting on what's
happening in the Middle East

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.300
and gay men being thrown off
buildings to certain death.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.350
And the fact that in
certain countries,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:33.400
it's not just about being
OK to be gay or anything

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.910
else, that people are dying.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.450
And I think we have to realize
how privileged and lucky

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.630
we are to live and
work in a country

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.532
that not only accepts us.

00:33:41.532 --> 00:33:43.740
It's not about tolerance,
as you were saying earlier.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.710
It's about inclusivity.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.130
And I think it's brilliant
that so many people are here

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.670
to share this today.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.880
But I think when I was
thinking about it, as well,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.660
there's some
comparisons to-- I did

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.590
a masters as a mature student
at UCD in equality studies.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.250
So you think, equality studies.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.830
Everybody's down with the gays.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.680
And I realized that
people weren't.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.270
They thought there's a level of
equality that we should have.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.895
So I remember one Irish guy was
very against marriage equality.

00:34:09.895 --> 00:34:12.780
And I found that very difficult.
But there was one woman,

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.110
she was from central Africa.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.139
And when I was
reflecting on this,

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.110
similar to our
multi-continental,

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.170
multi-regional, multi-culture,
multi-religious, and

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:26.989
multi-sexuality company, the
masters was quite the same.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.090
And this woman was essentially
incredibly homophobic,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.070
based on social and
religious beliefs.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.522
But she wanted to
learn about me.

00:34:33.522 --> 00:34:35.230
And I decided, yeah,
this was going to be

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.630
my little project for the year.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.159
So whenever she wanted
to ask me a question,

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.820
I would, yeah, go ahead and--
so we had this understanding

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.580
that I knew where she was
coming from and vice-versa.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.989
By the end of the year,
she left in such a way

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:49.469
that she knew I
was a good person.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.114
She knew I came
from a great family.

00:34:51.114 --> 00:34:52.239
She knew I loved my family.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.760
She knew I had a great
community of friends.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.968
She knew I was a good person.

00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:58.830
And all those things
that the beliefs

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.240
in her country, the belief
system, said different.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.172
So I was just happy.

00:35:03.172 --> 00:35:04.630
And I think we can
do the same here

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.500
in recognizing that we work
with a vast array of people.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.050
And we shouldn't expect
that they will immediately

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.340
be OK with LGBT people.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.980
They may have come from
an education system

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.229
where they were taught that
it's not OK to be LGBT.

00:35:17.229 --> 00:35:19.520
So I think when we're bringing
our full selves to work,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.978
as Ailbhe said,
it's about bringing

00:35:20.978 --> 00:35:22.530
that honest self to work.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.610
And if somebody does have
open and honest questions,

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.720
based on them trying to
change their narrative

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.250
and their beliefs, that you
give them that opportunity.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.290
SPEAKER: And we
might bring that back

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.770
to Ailbhe as well because
you mentioned in your speech

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.040
about the use of condescending
language and the other person

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.781
who's speaking
might not understand

00:35:38.781 --> 00:35:40.280
that they're actually
using language

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.840
that might be offensive.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.710
For example, sometimes,
we'll have managers here

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.310
who have questions
and just not know

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.040
how to approach a
transgender issue

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.980
or not know how to
approach somebody

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.080
that might be LGBT on their
teams and how to help them.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.320
So what kind of tips
or tools or framework

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.850
would you give them to try
and get them on the journey?

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.974
AILBHE SMYTH: Well, I think
the first step probably

00:36:01.974 --> 00:36:03.790
is acknowledging that
none of us always

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.270
have the right language
for all kinds of situations

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.690
and that the best and most
honest thing one can do

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.820
is to ask a question,
to say, I'm not sure

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.960
how you define yourself.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.370
Would you like to tell me?

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.270
And then pick up on that
and work from there.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.661
And always say, in whatever
situation you're in-- I

00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:24.160
don't know.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.930
Jen, you'd have a lot of
experience in that too.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.690
It's better to put
your hand up or to ask.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.854
Better to say--
and never assume.

00:36:33.854 --> 00:36:35.020
Actually, I think that's it.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.770
It's not making assumptions
about who people are

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.370
and what they believe, which
picks up on several things

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.025
that Andrew was saying.

00:36:43.025 --> 00:36:45.150
JENNIFER KELLY: And I think
that has changed a lot.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.430
So Ailbhe, you talked about
your journey over time.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.320
And there was a period
of time in Dublin

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.645
where you just did not
talk about anything

00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:54.520
to do with sexuality.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.730
AILBHE SMYTH: Absolutely,
you didn't talk about sex.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.094
JENNIFER KELLY: Absolutely,
not in my house anyway,

00:36:58.094 --> 00:36:59.000
you certainly didn't.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.166
AILBHE SMYTH: No, no, never.

00:37:01.684 --> 00:37:03.600
JENNIFER KELLY: I come
from a very big family.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.683
I'm the youngest of eight.

00:37:04.683 --> 00:37:06.770
My mother was born in 1924.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.660
She raised all of us on
her own from the time

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.260
I was seven years old because
my father passed away.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.870
And we had a very
Catholic household.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.299
And you did not swear.

00:37:16.299 --> 00:37:18.590
And you didn't say, oh, Jesus,
if you dropped something

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.892
or you got a crack.

00:37:19.892 --> 00:37:21.350
And she was the
most loving mother.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.910
But above all, she was very
Christian in her approach.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.200
So she helped everybody.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.380
She helped anybody.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.830
It didn't matter who they were.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.930
But of course, she had
come through an education

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.190
where you just didn't
talk about these things.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.030
And she worked in
St. James's hospital

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.220
at night as a nurse's assistant.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.570
She specialized
with hospital, which

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.750
was the HIV patients,
which there was

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.940
so many of through the '80s.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.010
And she would work Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.210
And then I noticed she
was going in day time.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.130
And she said, some
of them are very ill.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.310
And they don't have anybody,
because at this stage,

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.960
their families did
not want to know.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.020
They wanted to pretend
it wasn't happening.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.050
So she'd be making
special dishes to bring in

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.830
because they couldn't eat.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.480
She was with-- one of the
probably more public figures

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.180
was Vincent Hanley, who
was a radio personality.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.540
And she was with him--
his family were too.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.120
He was very supported-- until
he passed away because she just

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.310
bonded with people.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.561
And to me, that told me a lot
about there's certain things.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.810
And I'm not going to bring
it up at the kitchen table.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:20.410
Right?

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.993
Because it just
wasn't the right time.

00:38:21.993 --> 00:38:25.670
But also that she just
had such a good heart.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.475
And I think that
that's what I learned.

00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:30.850
Maybe there isn't
the right time.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.670
You don't want to rock
the boat sometimes.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.094
Or you didn't at the time.

00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:35.510
And she's no longer
with us today.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.635
But I feel if she was,
she'd be saying good on you.

00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:38.360
Get up and go.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.629
Because I'm going to go
to pride tomorrow and join

00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:41.420
the team from here.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.720
And my nine-year-old is coming.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.340
And she is-- it's a hoot.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.035
She can't wait to get out there.

00:38:46.035 --> 00:38:46.910
And you will see her.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.780
She's planned the whole outfit.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.830
Everything is going on.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.560
But I think it is
important to help people

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.330
along that journey
that have come

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.914
from a different
background, come

00:38:55.914 --> 00:38:58.330
from a different upbringing,
a different religious belief,

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.110
because you just can't
expect everybody to be open

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.100
and on board the way
everybody else is.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.340
AILBHE SMYTH: I feel at
this stage of my life--

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.100
my mother, who died very
recently, actually--

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.000
that if I and other
members of my family

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.840
brought her along on the road
to more or less accepting

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.700
multiple sexualities,
even in her own family,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.950
we could do it with anyone.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.120
I mean, I really do
actually feel this.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.070
I remember years
and years and years

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.120
ago being on a radio
program on Sunday morning

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.990
about a discussion.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.490
And one part of the discussion
was about discrimination

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.240
against gays at work.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.156
So of course, I was
talking about this

00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:37.780
and saying yes, it
happens to lesbians.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.900
It happens to gays.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.400
And that evening,
I got a phone call

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.290
from my mother, who had
her very, very, very

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.810
annoyed, disapproving voice.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.830
So I knew there was
something wrong.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:46.913
I said, what's wrong, Mom?

00:39:46.913 --> 00:39:49.980
And she said, no, it's just
I'm having big problems.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.140
She said, it was that
program this morning.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.415
So I said, oh, dear,
yes, right. what was it?

00:39:54.415 --> 00:39:56.400
It's that bedroom language!

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.350
And on a Sunday!

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.218
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.090
But it was very revealing
because her whole understanding

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.860
of what it meant to be
lesbian or gay or bi or trans

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.870
or whatever it was--
oh, it's about sex.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.930
And it taught me a really,
really, really important lesson

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.710
or revealed something
really important,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.050
apart from annoying me
like mad, you can imagine.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:30.210
SPEAKER: And just one last
question maybe for you, Jen.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.298
as VP of [INAUDIBLE] you're
also the exec sponsor

00:40:32.298 --> 00:40:33.423
for the Gayglers in Dublin.

00:40:33.423 --> 00:40:34.130
JENNIFER KELLY: I am.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:35.671
SPEAKER: So why that
you want to take

00:40:35.671 --> 00:40:37.810
on that role in the first place?

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.590
JENNIFER KELLY: So
it's a group at Google

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.070
that I've always been
very interested in,

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.720
worked closely in Dubleads
alongside Gareth Morgan, who

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.560
was the exec sponsor last year.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.320
And I thought that it's
an amazing group that's

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.950
achieving a lot and has
a lot of outreach across,

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.790
not only Dublin, but all
of our sites globally.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.190
And being part of
the [INAUDIBLE] team,

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.790
our mission is to provide work
spaces and work environments

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.900
where people can come every
day and be at their best.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.935
And that's not just about having
a great gym and fantastic food,

00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:12.310
which you have to have both,
because the food is so good,

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.410
you have to have the gym.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.524
But for me, it's about
creating an environment where

00:41:17.524 --> 00:41:19.190
you can come and be
productive and work,

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.550
but you can be yourself.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.800
And so most of what we do
in the spaces we provide,

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.210
it really links into just
how people feel at work.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.200
So I thought, I would
love to get an inside

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.400
and work closely with the group
so I can bring the two together

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.810
and try to help, and not
only with creating programs

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.400
and supporting the programs that
Adam and the rest of the team

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.850
need, but wouldn't it be
great if we can actually

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.440
link the space and how
we think about the space.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.110
And I will say that I've
gone through these sessions

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.040
with Adam where I'm like,
what does that mean?

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.820
Can I say that?

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.890
Is that word OK?

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.900
LGBT, can you say the the Q?

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.030
And what the hell is the I?

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.870
So what am I?

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.240
And he's been amazing.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.530
And also, he's taken me through
the Trans 101 training, which

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.640
is really, really informative.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.640
And that's been a whole
new learning for me

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.420
because I want to be able,
in my [INAUDIBLE] role

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.870
and in my Google leader role,
to be able to support everybody.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.120
Now, that doesn't mean as
people come to me and ask me

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.540
a question, I'll be like, now,
what do you-- what do you--

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.290
It doesn't matter.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.770
I just want to have
the insights into what

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.179
makes people happy,
because if you're happy,

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.720
you're going to feel safe, and
you're going to be productive.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.000
And I think the biggest
thing-- happy is great.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.360
Productive is great.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.370
The more important
thing to me is

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.110
people feel safe, and not just
physically, security-wise safe,

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.020
but just safe in themselves.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.140
I don't send my child to
work every day and say--

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.540
or to school.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.681
She's not working yet.

00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:43.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.427
SPEAKER: The truth is out.

00:42:44.427 --> 00:42:45.510
JENNIFER KELLY: The truth.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.930
But I don't send her
to school and say,

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.590
I hope she's really
productive today.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.170
And I hope she's really happy.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.180
But safety is the one thing
I worry about every day.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.680
And I want to bring
that to work too,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.380
because that's very important.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.674
You won't be happy or productive
if you don't feel safe.

00:43:01.674 --> 00:43:02.590
AILBHE SMYTH: So true.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:04.131
SPEAKER: Thanks very
much, everybody.

00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:06.280
So we'll take questions
now from the audience.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.586
Anyone want to start?

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:09.710
We'll throw the microphone.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:13.110
Thanks, Anna.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.110
Someone at the back.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.068
JENNIFER KELLY: Oh, it's
no an Android anymore.

00:43:18.597 --> 00:43:19.263
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:23.666
Can-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:25.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:26.126
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:28.862 --> 00:43:30.820
SPEAKER: So maybe just
tell us your name first.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.124
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Pascal.

00:43:33.124 --> 00:43:34.790
First of all, thanks
for the great talk.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.410
It was very interesting.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.370
Many great thoughts I
could take away from it.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:44.320
And I wanted to ask, because
you addressed adversity

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.400
that we face-- for years I
self-described as a feminist

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.090
as well, thinking very much
like you presented that it's

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.290
all about creating a
future in which gender

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.830
does not have an influence
and who you are allowed to be.

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.840
But I dropped that
label a couple of years

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.600
ago because I faced adversity
from certain elements

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.612
within that group, specifically
transphobic elements

00:44:05.612 --> 00:44:07.070
that you sometimes
encounter, where

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.010
it's all about like
situations and events

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.022
that are only for
women born as women.

00:44:12.022 --> 00:44:13.980
And I wanted to ask, have
you encountered this?

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.670
And how did you address
this, if you did?

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.070
AILBHE SMYTH: Yes, it's
a very good question.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:25.180
First of all, feminism is a
house of very many mansions

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.340
right across the world.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.900
And there are, of course,
a whole host of attitudes.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:34.110
And the one you describe is
not one that I share at all.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.220
I could just speak from
the very early experience

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.570
of organizing Lesbian
Lives in UCD, back

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:45.910
in the very early 1990s, where
there was a challenge when

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:49.800
a transwoman was in a workshop
and was asked to leave.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.340
And I was extremely
upset and angry about it.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.670
And we immediately went
to set up, actually,

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.680
a meeting with
transpeople in Dublin.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.240
I think that was in 1993.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.950
It was a very, very,
very long time ago.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.570
And after that, Lesbian
Lives-- I'm just

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.240
giving this as one example--
was absolutely open.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.970
And the only workshop that men
who identified as men could not

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.080
attend was the
workshop on violence,

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.110
on interlesbian violence
because it does occur.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:22.770
And it was felt that for
the safety and security

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.340
of the participants this would
definitely be a woman only.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.080
but open to transwomen.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.960
So I feel very strongly
that there should not

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.560
be closed doors.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.920
I feel very strongly that we
should be doing everything

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.020
in our power to move--
and I love being lesbian--

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.070
but to move beyond
those straitjackets that

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.680
gender imposes, really on all of
us, whether we are aware of it

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.470
or not.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:53.500
So I hope that responds a
little bit to your question.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.640
And keep going.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.200
Keep standing up
for yourself there.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.530
And let's hope that
we can, together, make

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.780
that more gender-free world.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.416
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:07.165
SPEAKER: We've time
for one more question.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.350
Nobody?

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:17.009
OK, I think we might
finish up there then.

00:46:17.009 --> 00:46:18.800
And thanks very much
to the panel for today

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.925
and especially to Ailbhe
for our keynote speech.

00:46:21.925 --> 00:46:22.800
Have a great weekend.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.030
Happy pride!

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.910
AILBHE SMYTH: Happy pride!
