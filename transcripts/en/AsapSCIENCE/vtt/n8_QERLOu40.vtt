00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Almost everyone experiences romantic love in their

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.100
lifetime and although it comes with happiness, euphoria

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.145
and increased life satisfaction break-ups are associated

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:12.015
with depression mood swings and

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.945
anxiety. So, are there any scientific strategies for

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:18.175
moving past a break-up? How can you get over your

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:21.195
ex? The first thing you might wanna do? Stop creeping

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:24.065
them on social media, although we might think it's harmless

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.965
facebook monitoring a former partner

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:30.195
has been shown to lead to  greater feelings of sexual desire

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.125
and longing for an ex as well as a decreased level

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.445
of personal growth. This is similar to research of real life

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:38.735
contact with an ex. That is,

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:41.635
people who continue to see their ex after a break-up

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:44.635
report greater sadness and love ultimately

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:47.395
decreasing their ability to  move on. Similarly,

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:50.425
for the 30-50% young adults in on again-off again

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.435
relationships, habitually breaking-up and getting back together

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:55.955
is associated with increased anxiety

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.075
and depressive symptoms as well as poorer communication

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.095
and commitment. Other studies have shown that people who facebook

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.365
stalk or subtweet at their former partners' are

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.365
six times more likely to participate in

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:11.385
a relational intrusion in real life, behaviors like

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.185
showing up at the ex-partner's classroom or

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.295
workplace. All this maybe related to the fact that sensory areas

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:20.225
of the brain associated with physical pain

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.075
become activated when shown a picture of an ex.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.875
In short, break-ups and social rejection can

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.785
physically hurt, so overall it's probably best to

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:31.885
cut the digital, and real life cord with your old flame

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:35.025
if that fails, perhaps a dose of tylenol.

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:38.165
A study of undergraduates found that taking acetaminophen

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.055
the common pain killer during a period of social

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:44.155
rejection decreased self-reported levels of social pain and

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.065
also decreased brain activity in regions

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.955
associated with social rejection and physical pain

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:52.935
Tylenol also seems to decrease areas of the brain responsible for

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.715
aggression, which may help mitigate,

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.635
say, any desire to carve your name into a leather

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.235
seat. Keeping a burn book? You might

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:04.055
actually benefit from focusing on the bad parts of

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.005
your ex to get over them. One study had people look at

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.065
photos of their ex and immediately used a strategy called Negative

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:12.995
Reappraisal, which involves thinking about the negative

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.925
qualities of a former partner, or imagining  negative

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:19.005
future scenarios with them. This is actually similar to a

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.705
strategy used for people who are alcohol dependent.

00:02:21.705 --> 00:02:24.475
Thinking about the negative consequences of repeated alcohol consumption

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:27.115
can decrease craving

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:29.755
significantly. Some participants used a distraction

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:32.795
strategy when given a photo of their ex they were asked

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800
unrelated question to distract them. The results?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.280
Negative Reappraisal, decreased love feelings for the ex

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240
but caused a short term unpleasant feeling

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.295
whereas distraction increased pleasantness but did not decrease

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:46.825
love feelings. In other words thinking poorly about an ex

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.415
may put you in a bad mood for a short period of time

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:52.265
but will be beneficial in the long run, by decreasing your feelings

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:55.025
for them; while distraction may boost your mood for a bit

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:58.335
but not help you get over an ex in the long term

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.235
Based on this research one researcher suggests writing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.605
a list of as many negative qualities about your ex that you can think of

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.660
at least once a day, until you feel better. All in all

00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:10.565
break-ups are tough. Psychologists described one of

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.595
the most important challenges is to regain a sense of self

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.840
separate from a former partner.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.840
So it may be best to unplug and reconnect with old friends and old hobbies,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.340
in order to heal and move on to the next one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.800
Greg: "So we made this video because we broke up... Joking..

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.120
But we probably should've called it something like 'we broke up'
because that would've gone more viral."

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.435
Mitch: "Our newest podcast is now up on YouTube.

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.425
It's about vlogging where we debate it. I love it."

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.905
Greg: "I hate it."  Mitch: "Let us know who won."

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.815
Greg: "We take controversial subjects, then we tell stories about and then we debate them,

00:03:37.815 --> 00:03:40.825
all while splicing in the science
throughout."

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:43.965
Mitch: "You can subscribe to SideNote on Youtube, but we'll also see you back here next Thursday

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:47.105
for another science video." M: "Bye..." Greg: "Peace..."
