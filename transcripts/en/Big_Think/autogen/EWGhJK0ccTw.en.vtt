I mean I think that many societies
wouldn't even pose it that way and it

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
wouldn't even pose it that way and it
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.580
wouldn't even pose it that way and it
reflects the fact that American history

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
reflects the fact that American history
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.290
reflects the fact that American history
although it's had its unfortunate

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
although it's had its unfortunate

happy story again not for all Americans

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
happy story again not for all Americans
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390
happy story again not for all Americans
but if you think of where the United

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
but if you think of where the United
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.390
but if you think of where the United
States began in 1776 and where it ended

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
States began in 1776 and where it ended
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.810
States began in 1776 and where it ended
up in 2007 it's a remarkable run of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
up in 2007 it's a remarkable run of
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240
up in 2007 it's a remarkable run of
success and it's partly because we did

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
success and it's partly because we did
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069
success and it's partly because we did
some things right and it's also partly

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
some things right and it's also partly
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740
some things right and it's also partly
because we got very lucky in where the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
because we got very lucky in where the
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200
because we got very lucky in where the
country was located the fact that the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
country was located the fact that the
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150
country was located the fact that the
native population turned out to be very

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
native population turned out to be very
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.270
native population turned out to be very
susceptible to disease that was brought

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
susceptible to disease that was brought
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470
susceptible to disease that was brought
over from Europe the fact that the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
over from Europe the fact that the
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910
over from Europe the fact that the
European countries kept beating each

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
European countries kept beating each
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100
European countries kept beating each
other up while we SAT here and became

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
other up while we SAT here and became
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869
other up while we SAT here and became
more productive so we've been very

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
more productive so we've been very
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700
more productive so we've been very
fortunate so we have this view of the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
fortunate so we have this view of the
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.580
fortunate so we have this view of the
world that everything tends to go well

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
world that everything tends to go well
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650
world that everything tends to go well
and therefore you're questioning how can

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
and therefore you're questioning how can
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540
and therefore you're questioning how can
we solve all these problems so this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
we solve all these problems so this
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000
we solve all these problems so this
happy story continues well of course it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
happy story continues well of course it
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340
happy story continues well of course it
hasn't been as happy a story for you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
hasn't been as happy a story for you
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520
hasn't been as happy a story for you
know Russia throughout the 20th century

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
know Russia throughout the 20th century
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530
know Russia throughout the 20th century
for much of Europe which destroyed

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
for much of Europe which destroyed
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.230
for much of Europe which destroyed
itself twice in the 20th century other

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
itself twice in the 20th century other
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090

parts of the world don't tell white the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
parts of the world don't tell white the
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160
parts of the world don't tell white the
same happy story so I think the first

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
same happy story so I think the first
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.080
same happy story so I think the first
thing I would say is all right we

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
thing I would say is all right we
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969
thing I would say is all right we
shouldn't be expecting perfection we're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
shouldn't be expecting perfection we're
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679
shouldn't be expecting perfection we're
not going to be solving all of these

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
not going to be solving all of these
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480
not going to be solving all of these
problems and it's not like bad things

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
problems and it's not like bad things
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670
problems and it's not like bad things
will never happen to Americans or to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
will never happen to Americans or to
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740
will never happen to Americans or to
other people we want to try to do the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
other people we want to try to do the
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.550
other people we want to try to do the
best we can within the facing the set of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
best we can within the facing the set of
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200
best we can within the facing the set of
problems that we now face and with the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
problems that we now face and with the
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050
problems that we now face and with the
set of resources at our disposal the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
set of resources at our disposal the
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730
set of resources at our disposal the
sort of step one is be realistic about

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
sort of step one is be realistic about
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100
sort of step one is be realistic about
what we think we can accomplish and then

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
what we think we can accomplish and then
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200
what we think we can accomplish and then
start ticking off the various problems

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
start ticking off the various problems
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730
start ticking off the various problems
I'm sorry working on them I think

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
I'm sorry working on them I think
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679
I'm sorry working on them I think
Americans again tend to think of it as

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
Americans again tend to think of it as
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.080
Americans again tend to think of it as
sort of I want a perfect answer because

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
sort of I want a perfect answer because
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969
