Hello! Hello!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.560
Hello! Hello!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.720
We are the Royal Institution.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.720
We create videos that make you
think deeply about science

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.480
and the world around you.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.700
And we need your help!

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.260
We’ve been engaging people with
the world of science for over 200 years,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.000
and have a history packed full of
scientific discoveries

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.760
and incredible people.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.680
Today, we carry on that fine tradition
at our home in London

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.680
and here on YouTube with you.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.340
Our thought provoking lectures,
explosive demos,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.080
and beautifully crafted animations

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.520
will always be free,
for everyone to watch.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.620
But making videos is expensive.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.420
Despite our rather grand name
we are just a regular old charity,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.720
which means we rely on donations

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.180
and money we can make ourselves.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080
We bring in a little bit each
month through YouTube ads,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.489
but it’s nowhere near
enough to cover our costs.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.280
That’s where you come in.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.120
If you value what we do,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.300
please consider sending us a small
donation each month on Patreon.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.640
Even just one pound or one dollar per month

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.289
will make a massive difference to us.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.520
You’ll get some cool perks as a thank you.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.139
But much more importantly,
you’ll get a warm fuzzy feeling

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440
knowing you’re contributing
to something special.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.100
The more money we can raise,
the more films we can make,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.040
and the more science we
can share with the world.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.740
Thank you!
