00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.579
Check out this amoeba.

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.399
Pretty nice. Kind of a rugged, no-frills life
form.

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.230
The thing about amoebas is that they do everything
in the same place. They take in and digest

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.530
their food, and reject their waste, and get
through everything else they need to do, all

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.750
within a single cell.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.660
They don’t need trillions of different cells
working together to keep them alive. They

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.860
don’t need a bunch of structures to keep
their stomachs away from their hearts away

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.920
from their lungs. They’re content to just
blob around and live the simple life.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.330
But we humans, along with the rest of the
multicellular animal kingdom, are substantially

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.629
more complex. We’re all about cell specialization,
and compartmentalizing our bodies.

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.699
Every cell in your body has its own specific
job description related to maintaining your

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.550
homeostasis, that balance of materials and
energy that keeps you alive.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.920
And those cells are the most basic building
blocks in the hierarchy of increasingly complex

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.570
structures that make you what you are.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.850
We covered a lot of cell biology in Crash
Course Bio, so if you haven’t taken

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.720
that course with us yet, or if you just want
a refresher, you can go over there now.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.640
I will still be here when you get back.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.100
But with that ground already covered, we’re
going to skip ahead to when groups of similar

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.840
cells come together to perform a common function,
in our tissues.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.000
Tissues are like the fabric of your body.
In fact, the term literally means “woven.”

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.550
And when two or more tissues combine, they
form our organs. Your kidneys, lungs, and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.190
your liver, and other organs are all made
of different types of tissues.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.930
But what function a certain part of your organ
performs, depends on what kind of tissue it’s

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.630
made of. In other words, the type of tissue
defines its function.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.750
And we have four primary tissues, each with
a different job:

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.140
our nervous tissue provides us with control
and communication,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.750
muscle tissues give us movement,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.710
epithelial tissues line our body cavities and organs,
and essentially cover and protect the body,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.820
while connective tissues provide support.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.390
If our cells are like words, then our tissues,
or our groups of cells, are like sentences,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240
the beginning of a language.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.330
And your journey to becoming fluent in this
language of your body -- your ability to read,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.990
understand, and interpret it -- begins today.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.749
Although physicians and artists have been
exploring human anatomy for centuries, histology

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.349
-- the study of our tissues -- is a much younger
discipline.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.359
That’s because, in order to get all up in
a body’s tissues, we needed microscopes,

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.749
and they weren’t invented until the 1590’s,
when Hans and Zacharias Jansen, a father-son

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.930
pair of Dutch spectacle makers, put some lenses
in a tube and changed science forever.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.280
But as ground-breaking as those first microscopes
were then, they were little better than something

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.099
you’d get in a cereal box today -- that is to
say, low in magnification and pretty blurry.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.469
So the heyday of microscopes didn’t really
get crackin’ until the late 1600s, when

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:41.069
another Dutchman -- Anton van Leeuwenhoek
-- became the first to make and use truly

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.400
high-power microscopes.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.499
While other scopes at the time were lucky
to get 50-times magnification, Van Leeuwenhoek’s

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:52.569
had up to 270-times magnifying power, identifying
things as small as one thousandth of a millimeter.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.420
Using his new scope, Leeuwenhoek was the first
to observe microorganisms, bacteria, spermatozoa,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.319
and muscle fibers, earning himself the illustrious
title of The Father of Microbiology for his troubles.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.430
But even then, his amazing new optics weren’t
quite enough to launch the study of histology

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.639
as we know it, because most individual cells in a
tissue weren’t visible in your average scope.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.569
It took another breakthrough -- the invention
of stains and dyes -- to make that possible.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.129
To actually see a specimen under a microscope,
you have to first preserve, or fix it, then

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.569
slice it into super-thin, deli-meat-like sections
that let the light through, and then stain

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.930
that material to enhance its contrasts.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.060
Because different stains latch on to different
cellular structures, this process lets us

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.529
see what’s going on in any given tissue
sample, down to the specific parts of each

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:37.889
individual cell.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.669
Some stains let us clearly see cells’ nuclei
-- and as you learn to identify different

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.609
tissues, the location, shape, size, or even
absence of nuclei will be very important.

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.579
Now, Leeuwenhoek was technically the first
person to use a dye -- one he made from saffron

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.139
-- to study biological structures under the
scope in 1673, because, the dude was a boss.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.879
But it really wasn’t until nearly 200 years
later, in the 1850s, that the we really got the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.450
first true histological stain.
And for that we can thank German anatomist

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.790
Joseph von Gerlach.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.239
Back in his day, a few scientists had been
tinkering with staining tissues, especially

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.419
with a compound called carmine -- a red dye
derived from the scales of a crushed-up insects.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.799
Gerlach and others had some luck using carmine
to highlight different kinds of cell structures,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.379
but where Gerlach got stuck was in exploring
the tissues of the brain.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.440
For some reason, he couldn’t get the dye
to stain brain cells, and the more stain he

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.000
used, the worse the results were.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.530
So one day, he tried making a diluted version
of the stain -- thinning out the carmine with

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.110
ammonia and gelatin -- and wetted a sample
of brain tissue with it.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.680
Alas, still nothing.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.710
So he closed up his lab for the night, and,
as the story goes, in his disappointment,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.050
he forgot to remove the slice of someone’s
cerebellum that he had left sitting in the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.169
He returned the next morning to find the long,
slow soak in diluted carmine had stained all

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.860
kinds of structures inside the tissue -- including
the nuclei of individual brain cells and what

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.639
he described as “fibers” that seemed to
link the cells together.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.389
It would be another 30 years before we knew
what a neuron really looked like, but Gerlach’s

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.539
famous neural stain was a breakthrough
in our understanding of nervous tissue.

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.110
AND it showed other anatomists how the combination
of the right microscope and the right stain

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.930
could open up our understanding of all of our
body’s tissues and how they make life possible.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.069
Today, we recognize the cells Gerlach studied
as a type of nervous tissue, which forms,

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.990
you guessed it, the nervous system -- that
is, the brain and spinal cord of the central

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.000
nervous system, and the network of nerves
in your peripheral nervous system. Combined,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.060
they regulate and control all of your body’s
functions.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.349
That basic nervous tissue has two big functions
-- sensing stimuli and sending electrical

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.699
impulses throughout the body, often in response
to those stimuli.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.939
And this tissue also is made up of two different
cell types -- neurons and glial cells.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.639
Neurons are the specialized building blocks
of the nervous system. Your brain alone contains

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.699
billions of them -- they’re what generate
and conduct the electrochemical nerve impulses

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.389
that let you think, and dream, and eat nachos,
or do anything.

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.030
But they’re also all over your body. If
you’re petting a fuzzy puppy, or you touch

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.939
a cold piece of metal, or rough sandpaper,
it’s the neurons in your skin’s nervous

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.800
tissue that sense that stimuli, and send the
message to your brain to say, like, “cuddly!”

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.409
or “Cold!” or “why am I petting sandpaper?!”

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.610
No matter where they are, though, each neuron
has the same anatomy, consisting of the cell

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.789
body, the dendrites, and the axon.

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.669
The cell body, or soma, is the neuron’s
life support. It’s got all the necessary

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.189
goods like a nucleus, mitochondria, and DNA.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.389
The bushy dendrites look like the trees that they’re
named after, and collect signals from other

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.530
cells to send back to the soma. They are the
listening end.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.560
The long, rope-like axon is the transmission
cable -- it carries messages to other neurons,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.949
and muscles, and glands. Together all of these
things combine to form nerves of all different

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.879
sizes laced throughout your body.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:52.139
The other type of nervous cells, the glial
cells, are like the neuron’s pit crew, providing

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.000
support, insulation, and protection, and tethering
them to blood vessels.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.669
But sensing the world around you isn't much
use if you can't do anything about it, which

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.449
is why we've also got muscle tissues.

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.689
Unlike your nervous tissues, your muscle tissues
can contract and move, which is super handy

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.259
if you want to walk or chew or breathe.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.020
Muscle tissue is well-vascularized, meaning
it’s got a lot of blood coming and going,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.840
and it comes in three flavors: skeletal, cardiac,
and smooth.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.400
Your skeletal muscle tissue is what attaches
to all the bones in your skeleton, supporting

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.120
you and keeping your posture in line.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.939
Skeletal muscle tissues pull on bones or skin
as they contract to make your body move.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:33.110
You can see how skeletal muscle tissue has
long, cylindrical cells. It looks kind of

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.569
clean and smooth, with obvious striations
that resemble little pin stripes. Many of

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:43.110
the actions made possible in this tissue -- like
your wide range of facial expressions or pantheon

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.999
of dance moves -- are voluntary.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:49.039
Your cardiac muscle tissue, on the other hand,
works involuntarily. Which is great, because

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.960
it forms the walls of your heart, and it would
be really distracting to have to remind it

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.249
to contract once every second. This tissue
is only found in your heart, and its regular

00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:02.069
contractions are what propel blood through
your circulatory system.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:06.669
Cardiac muscle tissue is also striped, or
striated, but unlike skeletal muscle tissue,

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:11.439
their cells are generally uninucleate, meaning
that they have just one nucleus. You can also

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:16.569
see that this tissue is made of a series of
sort of messy cell shapes that look they divide

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.490
and converge, rather than running parallel
to each other.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.409
But where these cells join end-to-end you
can see darker striations, These are the glue

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:27.919
that hold the muscle cells together when they
contract, and they contain pores so that electrical

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.620
and chemical signals can pass from one cell
to the next.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.969
And finally, we’ve got the smooth muscle
tissue, which lines the walls of most of your

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:38.550
blood vessels and hollow organs, like those
in your digestive and urinary tracts, and

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.909
your uterus, if you have one.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.950
It’s called smooth because, as you can see,
unlike the other two, it lacks striation.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.870
Its cells are sort of short and tapered at the
ends, and are arranged to form tight-knit sheets.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.970
This tissue is also involuntary, because like
the heart, these organs squeeze substances

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.600
through by alternately contracting and relaxing,
without you having to think about it.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.079
Now, one thing that every A&amp;P student has
to be able to do is identify different types

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:02.959
of muscle tissue from a stained specimen.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.599
So Pop Quiz, hot shot!

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.779
See if you can match the following tissue
stains with their corresponding muscle tissue

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.149
types. Don’t forget to pay attention to
striations and cell-shape!

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:13.300
Let’s begin with this. Which type of tissue
is it?

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.149
The cells are striated. Each cell only has
one nucleus. But the giveaway here is probably

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:21.880
the cells’ branching structure; where their
offshoots meet with other nearby cells where

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.680
they form those intercalated discs. It's cardiac
muscle.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.010
Or these -- they’re uninucleate cells, too,
and they also are packed together pretty closely

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.149
together. But…no striations. They’re smooth,
so this is smooth muscle.

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:38.450
Leaving us with an easy one -- long, and straight
cells with obvious striations AND multiple

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.660
nuclei. This could only be skeletal muscle
tissue.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.600
If you got all of them right, congratulations
and give yourself a pat on your superior posterior

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.990
medial skeletal muscles -- you’re well on
your to understanding histology.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.709
Today you learned that cells combine to form
our nervous, muscle, epithelial, and connective

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:58.899
tissues. We looked into how the history of
histology started with microscopes and stains,

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:03.250
and how our nervous tissue forms our nervous
system. You also learned how your skeletal,

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.800
smooth, and cardiac muscle tissue facilitates
all your movements, both voluntary and involuntary,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.089
and how to identify each in a sample.
