1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
Hey, what's going on? Hey,
what's going on? Sorry,

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,160
I didn't know if this thing was on or not.
It's Bill Burr.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,420
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, January seven,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,410
2018 what's going on? How are Ya? Um,

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,500
it's fucking three 32
in the morning and uh,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
I slept a little bit,
but just pen,

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,650
having a motherfucker of a time with this
jet lag over here and you know why it

8
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:30,120
is. It's cause I'm not boozing. Okay.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,700
This one's for all you
alcoholics out there.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm fucking with you.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,870
People keep telling me to go get Melatonin
and send natural way to get tired.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,540
Um, all I know is the unnatural way
to get tired, tired, which was uh,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,040
what I always did was just the first
night I tried to stay up and then I'd go

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,740
out and I would just go get,
I'd go booze,

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,750
I didn't have four fucking stiff
drinks and just come home and pass out.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,410
And then I'd start to get
acclimated to their time.

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,150
I'd have to do that about three nights
in a row and then I was fine. Um,

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,670
so whatever.
I just been a,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,860
so I got to do this fucking
podcast because today I'm
getting on a plane and I'm

20
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:20,780
flying to Estonia to do one show tonight.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm very excited about it. I
googled some pictures. First of all,

22
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,410
Astonia Jesus Christ.
What a Badass flag.

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,430
That's one of those things that I collect.
I don't buy a lot of touristy shit,

24
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:36,660
so I just get those little flags so I
gotta make sure I get the time to go down

25
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:40,950
and pick one of those. Um, then
I got lot via the next day.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,880
This is the part of the tour where
I start going to all these places.

27
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,120
I've never been to as far
as countries goes. But, um,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,370
the last two nights I started in
Cologne. I'd been there before. Um,

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,700
we did Munich on Saturday and yesterday
we did often back often Bach and um,

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,900
it's just been a fucking great time
being over here with [inaudible]. Sorry,

31
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,210
my voice is going through,
you know,

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,460
I'm trying to make sure you have
good shows and I don't know.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't know what the
fuck I did to it. But, uh,

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,990
yesterday I should say Saturday
and Sunday we had two shows,

35
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,160
Munich to and often buck.

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,520
And the first fucking
show was like at 3:30 PM.

37
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,340
This is what kills me.
I've,

38
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,410
I've never in my career that I can really
remember ever gone on stage like that.

39
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,780
I mean at that time,

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,550
I think maybe one time I was doing
hilarious and Cleveland and I did an

41
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,990
afternoon show, but I think that was at
like four or five, I dunno, just three 30.

42
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:50,820
It was fucking weird. But I got to
tell you, the crowd was unbelievable.

43
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:55,260
Munich crowds were fucking ridiculous.
I mean, they've all been great,

44
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,120
but they were just like,
we went like this,

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,150
I swear to God that felt it
goes on like a little and um,

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,550
it was like snowing out and I had to walk
from the green room back outside into

47
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,030
the snow and then back into the venue.
And I was just like,

48
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,740
these motherfuckers are
trying to get me sick.

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,700
So my coat on by big stupid palm
plum hat that I got in Finland,

50
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,200
where back in the day, which has been
saving my ass, that the vitamins,

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,120
seed packets and a bowl shows,

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,610
the crowds were just crazy
good. And, uh, in between shows,

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,220
I ran around trying to find my diaries,
some sneakers, some course sneakers.

54
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:38,190
I have found this store called early,
somebody told me about, and uh,

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,330
we drove over there and I bought
a couple pairs of sneakers.

56
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,080
I go to the forest Gump once, you
know, the classic Nike Cortez.

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,790
And I made sure that I got the,
uh,

58
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,080
the Velcro straps so she can get a
little fat fucking toddler feeding their,

59
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,670
you know,
um,

60
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,800
but it's pretty fucking cool because
in the middle of the city they had this

61
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:01,770
giant, just giant war going on, you
know, and it couldn't see how it could,

62
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,110
we just literally drove by and it
was the original wall of the city,

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,920
um, for like back in the day when
there was just like, you know,

64
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,030
it was a free for all.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,510
You just sit in your village and all
of a sudden some fucking assholes would

66
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:20,430
just show up and just start murdering
the men and rape in the women in Layton,

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,700
shit on fire. And it was just like,
like that's what people did back then.

68
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,830
Like that was like a fucking like
something that someone aspired to.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,200
They aspired to rape and pillage
and he just fucking lunatic shit.

70
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,240
So these people, you
know, wanted to survive.

71
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:45,160
So they would build these giant walls,
I guess around their fucking villages.

72
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,560
And then someone's trying to tell me a
till the hun used to save the bodies from

73
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:54,970
the previous village and then he'd sneak
up on a village he'd liked the body's

74
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,430
on fire and then with like a catapult,

75
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,200
which starts shooting them into the
fucking village, he wanted to attack.

76
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,700
Like you just sitting there chilling out,

77
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:08,320
enjoying yourself and like all the sudden,

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,820
you know,
I dunno what was the job back then?

79
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,160
Some fucking coppersmith comes through
the top of your fucking little hut.

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,990
They're on fire and lands on
your goddamn dinner table.

81
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,903
And that that was,

82
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,510
that was the first sign that your life
was going to fucking change. I mean,

83
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,430
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's crazy.

84
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,820
And I don't know what it is about Europe
maybe because I watched all this shit

85
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:40,150
about World War II and it, you know, and
a lot of, you know, American history,

86
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,830
they don't give a fuck about,
um,

87
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,100
you know, the whole curriculum was
designed by white descendants from Europe.

88
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,120
So that's all we fucking talked about.
So you just know certain shit.

89
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,760
And of course they, you know,
they dance around a lot of shit.

90
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,910
Um, but as I've been opening, I go,

91
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,950
when we took the train from fucking
Munich up to often Bach, uh,

92
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,520
they were like, next stop,
like Nurenberg. And I'm like,

93
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,520
Norenberg like Nuremberg trials.
For some reason I thought that that was,

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,290
those trials weren't France.

95
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,060
And now that I'm getting exposed a little
more to the German language, I'm like,

96
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:23,280
well, obviously that's not
a fucking French city. Um,

97
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,290
so I'm on the train and I'm
texting version to be like, dude,

98
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,790
this is where they fucking tried all
the Nazis, the SS and the Gestapo.

99
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,980
And Shit after World
War II when they like,

100
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,820
they'd like fucking put him to death and
shit hanging them and everything and uh,

101
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,550
um, texted him and he can't fucking,
yeah, he's not getting service.

102
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,420
So Mike Vaters II and he looks up,
you know, he's a couple seats away,

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,290
you know, but out of the
respect for German people, I
don't want to be like, hey,

104
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,560
this is where they fucking killed all
the Nazis have to function in World War

105
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,910
Two. I walked over to him
and I started to say it,

106
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,320
but because I'm speaking English,

107
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,530
people just look at you like all these
a fucking American, let's judge him.

108
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,370
Is he fat? Is he breathing through
his mouth? You know, was he loud?

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,820
So I just literally had
to show him the text. Um,

110
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,140
yeah.

111
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,240
And I'm sitting here, you know,
like when you go to fucking Berlin,

112
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:18,560
that's where Hitler killed himself
in part of his bunker. Still exist.

113
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:23,180
I know they didn't, they fucking
destroyed most of it. Soviets did.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,240
And then they build just like an
apartment building around it. You know,

115
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,780
it's like Los Angeles,
how they do that shit. Um,

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,390
they just knocked shit down and they
don't give a fuck what happened.

117
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,960
And I get it. Cause the guy was so fucking
evil. But like, I'm just like, wow,

118
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,930
it's so fucking crazy that people,

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,620
the German people just walk amongst
all of this shit. And then I was like,

120
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,740
wait a minute.
I live in the United States of America.

121
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,570
I go down to south all the time.

122
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,670
I can't imagine what the fuck happened
right where I'm sitting when I'm sitting

123
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,140
in a fucking waffle house.

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Like if that used to be like a plantation
or some slave was running away and

125
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,450
they got caught and God
knows what the fuck happened,

126
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,530
forget about the native Americans.
So I was like, well, why the fuck

127
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,400
do I only think about that shit you
don't like every time I go to Paris,

128
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:15,490
like when I look at this, Sean's
Elisa, that fucking street,

129
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,790
I just pictured when the Nazis
fucking paraded up the damn thing,

130
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,440
uh, when they occupied their
country and when the allied forces,

131
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:26,200
when they took it back.
Um,

132
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,200
and then all the French ladies banged
a bunch of Americans evidently. Um,

133
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,190
how come I don't think of that shit,
my own country.

134
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:36,700
It's just cause cause I
grew up then it's fucked.

135
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,410
I always thought that
would be like a weird

136
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,840
willow cy five fucking movies
slash horror movies that um,

137
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,761
I don't know if you just,

138
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,750
if you get them because they kind of
do what they do it on like light shit.

139
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
Like if you move into a house and someone
got murdered there in the 20s, right?

140
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,830
Like let me tell something. She, I'm going
to select you from fucking [inaudible].

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,710
Right. Then all of a sudden that
place is haunted. They don't wait.

142
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,850
Maybe American horror story did it.
I don't fucking know. I watch sports,

143
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,220
but um, anyway, um,

144
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,180
and then,

145
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,080
then I'm reading all of this shit and
it's like about the Nuremberg trial when

146
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:20,980
I'm on the fucking train and making sure
nobody's looking over my shoulder and

147
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm seeing how like a,

148
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,140
they had to decide how they were going
to go sort of like the first time I think

149
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,640
of World War One,
they tried to do it,

150
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,550
but this is the first time
they were trying to make
people pay for their fucking

151
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:33,430
war crimes.
So you know,

152
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,730
FDR and fucking Churchill and all
these guys are trying to figure out how

153
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:37,840
they're going to go about doing it.

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,080
And FDR balked at something and then
he died and then Truman came in and was

155
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:48,760
just like, well wait a minute.
Yeah. Truman came in and was like,

156
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:52,840
no, we're going to do that shit. So he
must have still been at war with Japan.

157
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:56,590
And then he goes and he drops to fucking
nuclear weapons on fucking Japan.

158
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,540
Like it was, it's like they were
all fucking world war criminals.

159
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,790
We sit in there firebomb
and Dresden and shit.

160
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,720
It's like women and children down
there. It's, it's, so, I don't know.

161
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,250
That's why I always say like,
to this day,

162
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:13,270
I can't believe that like
war is still a legal,

163
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
you know,
slash like glorified and uh,

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,190
I mean, I understand defending
your country and shit like that.

165
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:26,090
If there's a fucking lunatic out there,
but like, you know, who's kidding?

166
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,030
Hope you know a lot. You know,

167
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:33,650
there's been a lot of iffy decisions
made out there for, you know,

168
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:38,630
it's just, it's a fucking land grab.
You're going after oil, you know, you,

169
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:42,410
you want, you want that land because it's,
it's got some water around it. I mean,

170
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:45,920
that's why people go to fucking war most
of the time it seems nowadays. Anyways.

171
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,870
Um, but anyways, I don't know.

172
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,060
Some of that leads to me

173
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,230
yeah.

174
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,600
To talking about fucking thin privilege.

175
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,620
I follow this Guy Yonis Papa's
on the Instagram. He's like,

176
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,270
fucking genius does all these characters
and stuff. So I'm always watching him.

177
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,350
Cal Dunnigan uh, Jeff Richards. I like
my favorite, like the fucking characters.

178
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:16,420
They do the fucking geniuses,
right? So I was watching his end,

179
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:19,850
he posted something about at some going,
what the fuck is then privilege?

180
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,580
I already know I have white privilege.

181
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,720
Evidently I have been privileged to like
if it was like monopoly and there was a

182
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,870
stretch, a little properties that
were the privileged properties.

183
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:33,020
Like I feel like I got some of those
little green houses on a lot of them.

184
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,590
So evidently it's a privilege to be
thin rather than a reward for having the

185
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:45,810
discipline to push yourself away from
the fucking table. You know? And I'm not,

186
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,670
I'm not talking about when
you were a kid and you just,

187
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,720
some people have baby fell like I
baby fat. I was a fat fucking kid.

188
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,230
I was like 10 pounds. You
know, when I was born,

189
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:00,850
I was a big fucking read Charlie
Brown looking fucking baby.

190
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,290
There's not one cute picture of me till
I'm like three in my head was literally

191
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,600
almost the size it is right now.
When I was at adult.

192
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:12,460
Like I literally from day one look like
I could fuck up a Lego city. Right.

193
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,500
And, um, you know,

194
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,370
by just use that to my advantage that'd
be on the playground and people be

195
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,590
fucked with me cause my orange hair and
I just lean on him, you know, like a,

196
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,150
like a boxer that just wear him out in
the early rounds. And then I just fucking,

197
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,253
you know,

198
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,790
bunch of body shots and it would be over
me with my big flabby freckled arms.

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,390
And then somewhere in like junior high,
I just sort of leaned out.

200
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,360
My goal was Sunday,
grew a little bit and uh,

201
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,510
and then I stopped growing and
then I was just a small skinny kid.

202
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,540
I kind of had it all, you know,
when it comes to the bullying,

203
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:57,420
I was a fat kid when I was
real young then I was, uh,

204
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,990
but I was big and then I became small
and I was skinny and you throw it all in

205
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,220
there.
I had orange hair,

206
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,190
so it was kind of inevitable that I was
going to end up being some sort of a

207
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:10,960
fucking comedian or something. I
don't know what. But, um, anyways,

208
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,920
this then privileged shed.

209
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:16,690
It's like they like people who are
thin need to fucking acknowledge.

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,340
You know, it's up to you to realize
how privileged you are that, you know,

211
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,840
people don't judge you when
you eat a cookie in public
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,710
And all the cities like,
well,

213
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,250
go to the fucking judge me when I put
on a pair of shorts and look at our

214
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:34,240
fucking white, my legs are,
you know, these fucking people.

215
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:39,160
You know what kills me about shit
like that. All right, I get it.

216
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,070
Where you shouldn't tease fed people
and make them feel bad and all that,

217
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,090
you know, it's fucking immature
and it's me, I get it. Right?

218
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,720
But on the other side,
it's like there's no,

219
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,070
there's no burden of responsibility.

220
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,340
It's something that's
totally fucking curable.

221
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,100
And I know some people literally have
like food addictions and like it's a

222
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:04,420
psychological thing or whatever. But
you know, for most people who have fat,

223
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,620
it's just, you've just eaten
too much fucking food, you know?

224
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,710
And considering most of the
goddamn world is starving.

225
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,900
You know, it's just like, if,

226
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,380
can you underscore believe that
with this train of thought,

227
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,670
fat white people in a first world nation
can literally walk around and call

228
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:30,430
themselves victims? Well, you know,

229
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,160
I don't know all of these
fucking fatties I swear to God,

230
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,830
that's why I did that bid
on it at my last special.

231
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,460
You need to go to some countries where
the people are really have some problems.

232
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,780
I mean, you can even go to score on
the fucking Internet and read about it.

233
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,610
You can fill a hell of a lot fucking
better about yourself. You know,

234
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,830
I was sitting there, uh, you know, I was
getting frustrated with being fucking, uh,

235
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,930
jet lagged and Shit in these three 30
in the afternoon show is, I was like,

236
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,580
fuck man,
now I can't fucking sleep.

237
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,240
And I was like feeling like I was a Zombie
and I was getting old grumpy and shit.

238
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,480
And then like I go on the Internet
and I'm like, wait a minute. Okay.

239
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,630
So if Nuremberg is here, where was
Auswitch also, I can never say it right.

240
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,310
The concentration camp place right.

241
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,500
And it turns out it's in Poland and I
was like, well I don't have the time,

242
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,910
it's going to be too far away.

243
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,870
So I kind of googled some fucking pictures
of it and shit and I looked at it and

244
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,240
I was like, oh my God, I
could never fucking go there.

245
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,530
I mean literally like you're fucking blood
runs cold, like looking at this shit.

246
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,700
And then they had like,
you know,

247
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,900
pictures of like piles of
like kids shoes and shit.

248
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,300
And I'm literally buying shoes for
my kid and I'm just like going,

249
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,270
am I really bitching that I
have a three 30 fucking show?

250
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,060
Kind of a fucking asshole.
Am I right?

251
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,080
I think people eat fucking hot fudge
Sundaes. I'd do that every once in awhile.

252
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,843
You know what I mean?

253
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,890
They got to look up a bunch of starve and
fucking kids in the middle of nowhere.

254
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,360
Not even in the middle of nowhere,

255
00:15:56,361 --> 00:16:01,361
in the middle of where the world for
whatever reason considers nowhere before

256
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:06,650
you sit there and try to like figure out
a new way to try and fuck up somebody's

257
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,720
career.
Cause that's going to be another thing.

258
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,490
This is such a weird fucking time of so
many goddamn people like they just keep

259
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:20,630
trying to like,
I keep looking at it like a bike race.

260
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,290
Like they try to get behind somebody
who has like a legitimate complaint.

261
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,700
Like I gotta be honest with you,

262
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,620
the fact that white women can fucking
use the term white male privilege and

263
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,930
they're like a white woman in
the United States of America.

264
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,370
The fact that they can some out hop on
the other side of the fence as some sort

265
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:42,290
of like, you know, um, underprivileged
group. And I'm not saying that,

266
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,380
you know, they don't get less than
white males, but it's just like,

267
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,930
should I really be listening
to your complaints next?

268
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,760
Are you really going to be first in line?

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,020
You actually have white privilege when
it comes to complaining because people

270
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,530
are going to pay attention to your shit
first even though you're suffering the

271
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,640
least.
Right.

272
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,900
As far as my complete lack of research
goes as far as me babbling here fucking

273
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,350
four in the goddamn morning in and really
help us on that week and somebody up

274
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,870
mumbling here. Um, anyways,

275
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,430
so I guess that's the latest thing
that can get you to not fucking,

276
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,100
I dunno, sell some tickets on
the road or fucking, you know,

277
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,060
host an awards show, like whatever
the fuck we're going to do. You know,

278
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,390
you know what blows my mind about
that whole ward show scandal is,

279
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:37,391
I just love how whatever was said was
said around 2011 and all these adults who

280
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,460
were well old enough,

281
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,260
well old enough work were plenty old
enough to have gotten offended back then

282
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,980
and made a big stink. And for some
reason it doesn't fucking come out.

283
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,050
It's almost like they get you on
something. They're like, all right,

284
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:54,840
hold onto that card.
You know what I mean?

285
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,430
Like they're playing granny fucking
water and then they wait till you get

286
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,880
something big enough that's going to
shine a light in their cars and then they

287
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,230
come back and they fucking try and
slam it down on the fucking table. Um,

288
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,970
I was out of the country,
but as far as what I read,

289
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:16,620
Ellen degenerate as cool and my book for
the rest of the fucking time, you know,

290
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,930
and I thought whatever she
was trying to do was a, is,

291
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,190
is the way to go about stuff like that
where you just don't try to fucking

292
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,440
destroy somebody. You try to
get them to see your point,

293
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,950
try to get people on your side to be,
hey, give this person another chance.

294
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,630
You have to be open like that.

295
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:40,620
You open it up to a discussion and then
people just watch it and learn some shit

296
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,360
rather than just being like, this person
said this, now they can't have that.

297
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,840
Now let's watch them fucking,
you know, lose something.

298
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,740
You know who she's just sitting there
watching it for the fucking entertainment

299
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:56,430
value. Um, this is one of
my favorite things to do.

300
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:01,431
By the way is to get on my fucking high
horse here and preach at a quarter to

301
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:06,280
four in the fucking morning, whatever
fucking time at is here. Um, all right,

302
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,120
let's talk a NFL playoffs.
I missed most of them.

303
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:13,080
I was able to watch a little bit
of that eagles bears game, um,

304
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,230
in German, which was pretty
cool. Um, cause they kept
enough for the English words,

305
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,960
um, that I was able to, you know,

306
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,280
kind of know what the fuck they
were talking about. And uh,

307
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,860
I know everybody's going
to get on the bears kicker,

308
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:32,340
but can somebody please explain to me
why the fuck you go for a two point

309
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,740
conversion?
When the bears did that,

310
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,640
why not just fucking kick the Goddamn
thing and then you end up losing by one?

311
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,020
John Madden my entire fucking
life said you take the points,

312
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,280
you take the points, you take the points,
those extra points come back to haunt.

313
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,690
Yet, I know this guy, I missed it.

314
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:53,670
I guess he hit a number of
fucking goalposts and hit
the CROC goalpost and the

315
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,500
crossbar. And the last one,
I watched the highlights,

316
00:19:55,501 --> 00:20:00,420
but why the fuck are you going for
two points there? Makes it just,

317
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,730
you know,
well choose your only up by two.

318
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,090
You're acting like it's the end of the
game with the fucking two minutes to go

319
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,370
is a whole bunch of time left.
And I forget when it happened,

320
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,270
the end of the third quarter,
beginning of fourth quarter,

321
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,330
but there was plenty of fucking time
where it's a complete non factor.

322
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
Just take that extra fucking point,

323
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,090
just take the fucking thing and then
see where the fuck you are with the last

324
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,280
five minutes.
Then you start playing that game.

325
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,370
You know everybody's going
like Patrick one now.

326
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:33,330
Like pull in the fucking goalie would
like 10 minutes left in the game,

327
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,340
which for some reason I actually worked
for him. So congratulations to uh,

328
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,490
to the eagles, to nick
falls, man. I, by the way,

329
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,500
they'll match matched
bisky man out of Trump,

330
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,890
Friskies 80 then you had a fucking break
game through for over hundred yards.

331
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,893
Um,

332
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,830
I thought he was like really accurate and
he was dealing with like the defending

333
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,720
super bowl champions that thought it
was great to Nick's falls is that guy,

334
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,260
you know, like I just
fucking delivers. Um,

335
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,610
oh my God. Pete Carroll. Jesus
Christ for fucking bastard.

336
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,100
The poor fucking bastard man.
He's getting a ton of shit in Seattle.

337
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,210
I guess they thought he ran the ball too
much and uh, I don't know what happened.

338
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,180
That field goal kicker got fucking hurts
and then they have to punch her there

339
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,290
and he has to do an onside kick. Like
why didn't he just do what they all do?

340
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,400
Just stick it on the tee
and then he kicked the ball
in a downward motion on the

341
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:32,180
upper third of the fucking ball. So it
pops up in the air. Yeah. The guy just,

342
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,210
he fucking just fucking basically
lobbed it down the field that you know

343
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:40,634
something.

344
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,480
Okay.

345
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,480
If Pete Carroll never won a Superbowl
and they were going to make a statue of

346
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:49,200
him,

347
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,150
it would be him with his hands on his
fucking knees just looking down at the

348
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:55,260
ground in pain.

349
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
He sort of the urban
Meyer of a NFL coaches,

350
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,680
you know, and that they both won,
but they just have that fucking,

351
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,230
they just have that, that's soul crushing.
Whenever I see him do that. You don't,

352
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,083
it reminds me of,

353
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,270
it reminds me of Carl
Yastrzemski when he backed me,

354
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,350
he's backing up to the wall.

355
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,860
When Bucky dent hit that three run
homer and you just saw his legs buckle.

356
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,730
It just reminds me of that every
time I see that shit. So, um,

357
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,160
I dunno, my condolences. I don't usually
have condolences to Seattle fans,

358
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:34,480
but I dunno, the rivalries kind of died
down. You football fans, I feel for you.

359
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,520
I've been there and all that
shit. Um, congratulations.

360
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,650
San Diego chargers and I forget who
played the last game or the colts.

361
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,770
I guess the colts look good
and Andrew luck is back,

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,460
which is great.
Um,

363
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,880
other than that, I haven't been
fucking doing anything here.

364
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,470
I should probably do
some of these reeds here.

365
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,420
This podcast might be a
little short because I have
to get up, go to the airport.

366
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,020
I'm already up. All right. Oh,
look who's here. I can't do this.

367
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:06,530
Read justice everybody.
I apologize. It's old zip

368
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,740
recruiter.
You know what's mad?

369
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,060
Figuring out who you need to hire to
take care of your business to take your

370
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:21,061
business to the next level in 2019 you
know what else is SMAD stat in the new

371
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,500
year, I'll have strong by
going to ziprecruiter.com/berta
hire the right fucking

372
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,170
people.
Unlike other jobs.

373
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,470
I wonder if now when you go
to hire the right people,

374
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,330
they should add to ZipRecruiter.
It also goes through all your,

375
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,460
you're always a tweets you've ever sent
out to make sure someone's not going to

376
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,640
be like, you know, I wanted to
rent a car from this person.

377
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,130
And then they'd said this,
the tweet in thousand nine,

378
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,080
making fun of people with ugly feet.
I have feet that are,

379
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,750
they wouldn't say ugly.
I would they say it,

380
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,303
I dunno.

381
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,380
Visually challenged. Um,
unlike other job sites,

382
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,130
ZipRecruiter finds qualified
candidates for you. It's powerful.

383
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:07,900
Matching technology scans thousands of
resumes to identify people with the right

384
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,210
skills, education, and experience,

385
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,000
and actively invite them
to apply to your job.

386
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,600
So you get qualified candidates fast.
That's why zip

387
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,440
what of recruiter?
Yeah,

388
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,150

one by employers in the u s this rating

pilot with over 1000 reviews.

00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,100
And right now my listeners can get zip.

391

exclusive websites, ziprecruiter.com/burr.

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,940

394
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:52,790
R r that's ziprecruiter.com/bar oh Ah,

395
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,250
sorry. My voice is going out trying to
do the German garden. Every movie, Zip

396
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,120
recruiter, the smartest way to
hire. All right. Policy genius.

397
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,270
Um,

398
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,600
getting life insurance is one of the more
intimidating parts of becoming a full

399
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,780
fledged adult.
It's not that bad if you have kids.

400
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,460
It's weird if you get it and you
just have your wife, you know,

401
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,410
cause then you're like,
is this bet you're gonna kill me?

402
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,350
Once you have the kid, you let go. I
didn't want them to be all right. Sorry.

403
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,300
I watch a lot of those fucking first
48 and it always comes down, you know,

404
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:34,390
first time murderers. So much of it
comes down to life insurance. Uh,

405
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,990
am I not selling this right? Well,
right now I don't think I am.

406
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,720
There's so many options.
It's hard to know where to start,

407
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,130
but making sure your family is financially
protected is too important to avoid.

408
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:45,960
This is what you do once
you get life insurance,

409
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,580
you just sort of monitor
your wife's laptop or your
husbands if the checking out,

410
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:55,050
like you know how to dispose of a body
or the checking out when the tides go in

411
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,550
and out,
that I think you might want to

412
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,270
put a little addendum to your policy.

413
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,930
So policy genius creates a website that
makes it easy for you to compare quotes

414
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:08,550
and get advice and get covered without
extra fees or commission. A sales agent.

415
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,150
Motivate your audience, talk about your
experience with the product. Slash.

416
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:13,320
Service.
I've never used it,

417
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:17,890
but I got life insurance and
now whenever I hit turbulence,

418
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:21,190
when I'm flying or whatever, I don't
worry about it cause I'm like, well,

419
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,970
you know what? As much as they're
going to miss me, it's you know,

420
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,210
they're going to be, they're
going to be all right. Uh,

421
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,040
and the House won't be as loud.
Uh,

422
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,910
choose one to two copy points to
rotate into your spot. All right,

423
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,870

424
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,230

436
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,680
Oh fuck. How am I going to do this?
Read justice with my voice here, honey.

437
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
Um,
you probably heard me talk about honey,

438
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,600
the free browser extension
that automatically helps
me save money on all my

439
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,460
favorite sites.
But did you do that?

440
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:31,230
Honey even makes Amazon
better with Millie attitude.

441
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,580
Fuck Amazon. Who's fucking
cons? Those assholes.

442
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,770
They throw it over the fence.
They consider it delivered.

443
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,270
There's no return address.

444
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,760
You never can figure out who
the fuck's sent it to you.

445
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,630
It's a fucking nightmare with millions
of sellers on Amazon offering the same

446
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,580
products. How do you know if you're
really getting the best price?

447
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,910
How the fuck do you know if it was
delivered? There's no fucking phone call.

448
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,310
You've got to bring it back down to a
shop and they're just little, little,

449
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,570
little flows we can tell was
delivered. We could form it. Uh,

450
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,600
that's where honey comes in. What is the
fucking driver said it was confirmed.

451
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,760
Honey automatically goes to wear to work.
Whenever I shop on Amazon,

452
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,070
I ordered this other shit on Amazon
is fucking, and I never got it.

453
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,190
I know what the fuck is.
It compares the PR.

454
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,500
This is like the worst
advertising read ever.

455
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,400
It compares the prices of every seller
that carries the item. I want honey,

456
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,660
even factors in shipping,

457
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,290
sales tax and Amazon prime status to
make sure I'm getting the lowest price.

458
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,730
It shows me the best delivery time,
even if Amazon doesn't.

459
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,030
Um, it's like having my very
own personal shopping assistant.

460
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:38,610
Of course Amazon does. If he can't
fucking get anybody on the phone,

461
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,420
more than 10 million people
are using honey to save money.

462
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,530
Honey is so has over a hundred
thousand five star reviews on Google.

463
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,340
Maybe I need honey, so Amazon
will work better for me. Um,

464
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,700
five star reviews on
the Google chrome store.

465
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,400
Time magazine says it's
basically free money.

466
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,910
So the next time you're in the
world's biggest marketplace,

467
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,910
looking for the best deals,

468
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:04,080

that makes Amazon better. Add honey for

469
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,660

join honey.com/bar. That's hilarious.

470
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,630
I'm making fun of Amazon and
everything that they don't do. Well,

471
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,730
honey actually fixes it.

472
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:18,450
So in a way I was selling it cause God
knows we're all still gonna use Amazon.

473
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:22,830

495
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,470
30 fucking minutes. Shit, I
opened up getting sick here.

496
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,820
How much you fucking vitamins
CD you have to take. You know,

497
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,330
let me grab one of these goddamn packets.
Okay. Yeah, I'll drink one now. Dude.

498
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,040
This fucking hotel,
I can't figure out.

499
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,680
I can't figure out how to turn
all the fucking heat, you know.

500
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,220
But the one of the things,

501
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,250
the only thing I hate more than not being
able to turn it on on the fucking heat

502
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:07,260
is having to call down to the front desk
and then they got to send somebody up.

503
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,760
I just, I thought I'd rather
sit here and get sick. Um,

504
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,100
yeah,

505
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,990
we go a little bit of fucking
often Bach bottled water can be,

506
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,000
I can get seltzers on my podcast
to advertise a little fun with it.

507
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,690
See packet here.
This is how you do with,

508
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,620
hey, did anybody else on Twitter see
that? Hilarious little, I don't know.

509
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,790
Is it a Gif? Is A, is a picture. I
don't know what the fuck you call it.

510
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,660
You Know Bell Biv devoe somebody made one.
That was bell,

511
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,660
Bev and Willem default.
So it was bill bib default

512
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,190
and that's the kind of shit that's
the kind of shit that I fucking love.

513
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,180
I love that silly shift.
Um, all right Dan, we go,

514
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,980
AH, Christ bill Sterman it with
your finger. You fucking animal.

515
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,410
What is wrong with you? Um, all
right, down the hatch. Here we go.

516
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,560
That is a lot of stuff
fits it. Um, all right.

517
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,180
So anyways, yeah, so we ordered
room service as far as I can tell.

518
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,250
The top three things on room
service in Germany are uh,

519
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,240
a hamburger,
the inner schnitzel or spaghetti.

520
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,340
And I actually, when I was in
Munich I got some dean or Schnitzel,

521
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,050
which I always thought was
like a fucking hot dog,

522
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,880
but he's so pork cutlet that's breaded.

523
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,030
It was fucking delicious.
Um,

524
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,920
that's what's killing me about being
here in Germany as I haven't had time to

525
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,720
get like a proper German meal.
I've just been traveling so much and uh,

526
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,500
you know,
I,

527
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,180
I'm never going to do ancestry.com but
as far as the names of my family tree,

528
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,660
I know I am mostly German.

529
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,343
MMM.

530
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,860
I love this shit. I was fucking
sausages and fucking beer and all that.

531
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,950
It kills me. I'll tell you the
next time I come here to Germany,

532
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:11,260
which I'm definitely going to do
because it's been so much fun.

533
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,730
I am going to be beyond off the wagon
and I'm trying all these fucking be,

534
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:17,860
I'm going to book myself
out here in October fest.

535
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,480
I wouldn't buy a little BMDS Oktoberfest
outfit outfit and I'm going to fucking

536
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:26,580
drink my ass off,
but not on this tour.

537
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,610
Oh, Billy. No Fun. It's coming up on 50
days. Have just been a fucking douchebag.

538
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,450
Um, anyways, so let's plow ahead here.

539
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:38,850
Let's read some of these
fucking things for the week. Uh,

540
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,670
just another one about Poland.
All right.

541
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,220
Very excited to go to Poland to very
excited to go to bottle Berlin. All that.

542
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,230
Like all the rest of this tour is
just going to be just a bunch of bar.

543
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,500
Just a bunch of shit I'd never seen.
I would speaking to that,

544
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,480
guess who came out to the show last night?
Guess who the fuck showed up?

545
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,330
One of my favorite drummers,
one of the greatest drummers in the world.

546
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,493
Benny grip.

547
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,250
Yeah.

548
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,340
Showed up with his lovely girlfriend.
I hate naming names and everything,

549
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,780
but everybody knows who the fuck he has,
right?

550
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,173
MMM.

551
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,660
He fuck, I couldn't believe, you know,
I, it's just, it's unbelievable. Uh,

552
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,850
if you're a drummer out there and you
want to see somebody who possesses one of

553
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:25,530
the rare things in drumming,

554
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,920
which is incredible feel passion,

555
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,000
playing from the heart
combined with ridiculous chops.

556
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
And the thing that I've found with,

557
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,770
with drumming is when
you get those chops guys,

558
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,340
a lot of times when they play
there between their ears,

559
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,510
like they're in their head and they
have all this really intricate shit,

560
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:50,220
but it's disconnected to
who they are as a person.

561
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,360
And then if you have like a group player,
you know,

562
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,590
if they go to take a solo,
if they even do, it's uh,

563
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,900
you know, it's still good because it's
still gurus, but it's not like the crazy,

564
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,370
uh,
I don't know.

565
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,730
I'm just saying those guys that have
those fucking insane shops where you would

566
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,470
think even buddy rich will be going like,
dude,

567
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:12,780
what the fuck are you
doing there nowadays?

568
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,970
How far drumming has come because
everybody, the Internet's,

569
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,660
but basically everybody's
watching everybody.

570
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:22,010
Everybody's jamming and
learning from each other. Uh,

571
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,880
it's just so rare to meet a guide that
has his chops and plays the way he does.

572
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:29,910
So he does clinics all
around the world and uh,

573
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,860
he's got some DVDs out there and all in
this no fucking way that you won't be

574
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,430
tremendously changed for the better
if you start watching his videos.

575
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:43,290
So it's Benny Benny,
Grip B andN Y G R E B I believe.

576
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,740
I'm not sure if this too and I
can't fucking spell anything.

577
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,630
Just check them out if you
can't. All right. Anyways,

578
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,700
just another one about Poland.
Uh,

579
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,070
Dear Mc run from the sun.

580
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,890
I like that one. Uh, I am honestly
thrilled. Done in a few days.

581
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:05,620
You're going to show up in my nuts.
So beautiful city of Warsaw.

582
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,740
Don't tell me that.
Well,

583
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,800
they live in and out so beautiful
city of La and I love it.

584
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,410
I like how it's gritty and grimy
and all that shit. You know. Sorry,

585
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,270
drinking more phone. Let me see
here. Uh, mainly because, um, okay.

586
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,240
I'm honestly thrilled that you are going
to be in a few days and you're going to

587
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:27,300
show up.
It might not so beautiful city of Warsaw,

588
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:32,570
mainly because I'm selling my house and
you are so white that you're rising the

589
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,890
property value whenever you arrive.

590
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,990
Sky's all areas or
lady, let's be fair. Um,

591
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,090
I don't want to offend shame anybody or
whatever the fuck you were talking about

592
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,240
now.
Um,

593
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,680
but since you're kind enough to do
one of those pussy ass shows of yours,

594
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,420
I will definitely come. I like this
guy. Sprake and fucking balls. Um,

595
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,820
you, you are going to
love Poland as Yossef.

596
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,230
Palecki used to say it's a great nation.

597
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,790
Only people are constant.
Whole. Wait a minute.

598
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,000
Do is everybody is funny as you in Poland,

599
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,060
is this going to be another fucking
country I go to where I'm just like,

600
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:19,290
oh my God, these guys remind
me. The people I grew up
with, I felt that in Ireland.

601
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,250
I felt it in Scotland. I felt
that in India. Just that,

602
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,280
that Boston sharps Bobrick
and Fuckin thing is mine.

603
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,510
It's my favorite thing in
the world. Um, anyways,

604
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:34,470
as for the city of Warsaw,
well she's not the prettiest of Gals,

605
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:39,270
but let's be fair. That bitch, that
bitch went through some shit. Uh,

606
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,890
we are watching American shows,

607
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,530
so don't worry about making
your pop culture references.

608
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,570
We're currently watching Alf,

609
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,620
and once we figure out
why those jokes are funny,

610
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,130
we're going to move on to Frazier.
Dude,

611
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,570
can you please start doing standup
or something? This is just the, Oh,

612
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,720
this is just written really fucking funny.
Uh,

613
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:05,721
you can also consider renting a helicopter
here since it's much cheaper than the

614
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:10,680
u s although Polish helicopter, it's
just a horse wearing a windmill hat. Ah,

615
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,630
radio had one fucking Polish joke.
Doctor,

616
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,790
best wishes to your family and break
your PC leg on this tour. Our ps, uh,

617
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,310
if you're interested
in Soviet bloc history,

618
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,280
God knows I didn't learn about
that when I was growing up.

619
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,630
Then you should check a comedian

620
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,200
freeze love F R E Z l UV,

621
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:35,380
talking about his military service
in Berlin during the Cold War.

622
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,530
Um, I will definitely check that out
and I'll send out a link to this,

623
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,990
uh, podcast episode here.
Um, Oh, speaking of which,

624
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,600
I've been having the best time
with Rosie right at, for z.

625
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,650
The one thing I love about [inaudible]
is [inaudible] is [inaudible]. Okay.

626
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,970
The Way Maddie was going to be,
Maddie poverty's Rosie,

627
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,470
he's over here wearing his Jordans.
You know,

628
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:04,210
he's got his fucking Nike tracksuit on
and we were in Cologne, Germany. Uh,

629
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,350
did I tell you this yet? I've told them
on stage so many times we're living,

630
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,120
we're walking over this fucking
bridge right from Cologne. Germany,

631
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,710
as I mentioned, was one of the
most bomb cities in world war two.

632
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:18,480
So there's not a lot of old stuff
there because it just got destroyed.

633
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,860
But they have this one beautiful church,
right? So we're walking over the bridge.

634
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,590
At first he is going like, Dude,
look at that building, man. God,

635
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,800
it's a beautiful building.

636
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:32,370
And that building beautiful and I'm
looking at is these cluster of whatever

637
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,130
buildings and in the middle
of it is this amazing church.

638
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,460
So I'm looking at the buildings
going, what the fuck is this guy? See?

639
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,180
Like what building is that
building right there? Look,

640
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,410
it's fucking the architecture's beautiful.
And finally figured out, I was like,

641
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:48,330
dude, are you talking about the fucking
church? And he's like, yeah, that data.

642
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,490
Oh No, I already told this story
till the story on Thursday.

643
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,790
I'm still giving him shit about that.
It's a great building.

644
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,330
Um, all right. Oh, by the way,

645
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,010
Versie Versie two Sicilian in Greek.
He loved the vianor Schnitzel too.

646
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,570
And he's actually really enjoying,
uh, Jeremy too, which made me happy.

647
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,550
Cause sometimes there's
Mediterranean guys, you know,

648
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,510
they get all fucking upset about the
food and there's no sunshine and shit,

649
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:19,020
you know, but he's been having a great
time. All right, Gypsies. Hey there,

650
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:24,000
Billy bloated broths. Uh, I go to Romania.

651
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,350
Oh,
this is what I was talking about.

652
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,120
We're learning that Gypsy's
considered a racial slur. All right,

653
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,530
listen to this first sentence.
He goes,

654
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:36,480
I go to Romania frequently for work and
I'm quite versed in Gypsies and why it

655
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,210
is a racial slur.
Uh,

656
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,250
in order to love about that was
he still used the word gypsy.

657
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:45,620
That's like if I was in
America being like a,

658
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,510
hey everybody, uh, for when
you traveled to America,

659
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:54,511
I've been to east St Louis and I'm
quite versed in and words and why it's a

660
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:58,740
racial slur. Like I, I wouldn't do that.
That's kind of what he just did there. Uh,

661
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,820
first Rome Romanians are not Gypsies,
Robin people,

662
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,910
Romanian people are descendants of Romans.

663
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,130
I didn't know that Gypsies are
people that came from Egypt. Uh,

664
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,640
if you want to insult a Romanian
person called him a gypsy,

665
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,270
Gypsies stick to themselves and
rob slash steal from outsiders.

666
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,840
They will fight at the drop of a hat.
I saw two old lady,

667
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,160
Gypsies fighting over which corner they
were selling flowers on in the old city

668
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:32,910
in Bucharest. I hope this
clears it up a little. No, it,

669
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,960
that didn't clear anything up.
Um,

670
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,440
now I know that Romanians are Roman
and Gypsies are people are from Egypt.

671
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,341
I do know that.

672
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:49,030
And then you went on to fucking trash
him in a way that I'm sure there were

673
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:52,120
upset about. I Dunno. Jesus Christ.

674
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,010
Did I just get in trouble
just by fucking read that.

675
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:00,040
So they've got a lot of fight
them. All right. What are
you gonna do? I mean, we've,

676
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,780
I've seen these videos have to stamp
people dressed up like Santa Claus beating

677
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:07,750
the fuck out of each other
and my country. Uh, all right.

678
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:11,410
But I didn't realize that Romanians,
but almost it says Roman in there,

679
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,280
Huh? Did Not know that. All right.
I left to look a lot of that up.

680
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,930
Double check, which means I'm not
going to do it. I'll forget about it.

681
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:24,510
And then the information you just told me,
we'll be in my head in one day.

682
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm going to spew it out, but I'm
probably gonna get in trouble. All right.

683
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:31,590
Recent breakup. Am I the
asshole? Well, firstly,

684
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,110
first of all,
first dilly.

685
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,820
What two words did I just,
first of all,

686
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,750
it's certainly, I don't know what
the fuck up. I don't know. Anyways,

687
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,390
my girlfriend of three years
broke up with me over something.

688
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:50,840
Me and my family thinks is stupid.
All right,

689
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:55,580
so right now I'm a little nervous here.
You know if families back in you,

690
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,750
you know, are you not one of those
fucking young kids that can do no wrong,

691
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,050
are you anyways? We are both 20 and
since last February we've been also,

692
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,380
what generation are you,
is that generation z?

693
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,110
We are both 20th since last February.

694
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:14,111
We've been arguing since we invited her
to my birthday dinner and she got upset

695
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:21,080
because she was expected to pay
for her own meal. All right. Who?

696
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,420
Who, who's, who's her?
Is that your girlfriend?

697
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,863
Okay.

698
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,890
I didn't tell my parents until months
later because they didn't want to start

699
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:34,020
anything. Anyway, around early December,

700
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:38,820
my family asked me to invite her to come
up with us to my dad's parents home on

701
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:42,600
the 29th because that's when we
could celebrate Christmas with them.

702
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,640
When I texted her, she said, am I
going to have to pay for my own gas?

703
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,180
I have a s d I don't know what that means.

704
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,730
So I assumed I was missing something.

705
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:02,150
So I do. Do you have like add
to the point that you have?

706
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,030
Don't have the fucking time to write
add vinegar to look up fucking ASD,

707
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,800
all saints disease a s d

708
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,700
you are not connected to the,
you are not a winner. All right.

709
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:20,280
I don't know what the fuck that is.
I don't give a shit.

710
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,720
I'll learn about it later. Um, I have
ASD, so I assumed I was missing something.

711
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,970
So I asked my dad and he said,
of course

712
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,000
she flipped out about it.
Oh, is as Berger's disease.

713
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,580
Would that be abd or is that antilock
brakes? I don't fucking know.

714
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,600
Uh, let's ABS. She flipped
out about it and became,

715
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,990
and it became the new thing we could
argue about her mom and her sister agree

716
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:50,400
with her that it's Shitty to not pay
for someone's gas when you invite them

717
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,480
someplace. But my dad's
parents didn't pay for our gas,

718
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,770
but no one we know ask for that.

719
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,940
And all of our family members,
we invite to be day dinners.

720
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,860
Never complained about
paying their own bill.

721
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,740
Should I put pun not intended,
I'd appreciate your advice or,

722
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,710
and I'm a big fan.
You seem pretty good with your response.

723
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,800
And most cases I should note that
after breaking up with me on new years

724
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,380
despite, all right, that's how we ended
it. I don't understand what's gone on it.

725
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:29,040
You guys sound like a bunch of cheap
fucking assholes greenhouse with him.

726
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,160
He takes somebody up for
their fucking birthday.

727
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:36,270
You make them pay for their birthday
dinner. That's fucking terrible.

728
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,720
It's so terrible. It's
like, it's hilarious.

729
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,860
And I'm sure she didn't give
a fuck about paying for gas.

730
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,840
She's probably alluding to the fact

731
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,740
that you that you've made or pay
for our own fucking birthday.

732
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,480
That's fucking hilarious

733
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,110
then in a lot of ways is sadder than
going out to dinner by yourself for your

734
00:45:58,111 --> 00:45:58,944
birthday.

735
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,670
Cause at least nobody there at the
restaurant knows that your birthday now,

736
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,790
you sitting there with a table full of
people that know what your birthday and

737
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,850
how you got to kick in. Wow. Yeah.

738
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,420
I should probably stop short of calling
you and your whole family a bunch of

739
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:16,240
cheap fucks, but let's just say a
little rough around the edges. Um,

740
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,620
but whatever,
that's water under the bridge.

741
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,150
I guess you need to find your soulmate,

742
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,540
the kind of woman that doesn't mind
paying for her own birthday dinner. We,

743
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,500
you know, maybe you're
a feminist, you know,

744
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,180
cause most guys who we pay for
our own shit on our birthdays,

745
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:37,050
we have to go out and go buy the big
fucking fancy gift on Valentine's Day.

746
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,060
I don't know.
I can't figure that one out.

747
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,250
And the fact that you
stopped mid sentence,

748
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:46,080
like she fucking showed up your place and
club you to death and then he had sand.

749
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,940
So the forensics couldn't figure out
what time you died while he did send an

750
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,170
email. Alright. Lesbian
dating with no spark.

751
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,790
All right. Whatever the fuck
you're dating, if there's
no spark and out of it, uh,

752
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,640
he built,
I was wondering if you were near,

753
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:05,700
could give me some dating advice to
a lady listener all, unfortunately,

754
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,773
Nia is not here,

755
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,030
so you're gonna have to deal with my
dumb fucking ideas. Uh, I've been,

756
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:17,090
I've gone out on seven really good
dates with a wonderful woman who was

757
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,140
essentially everything I've ever looked
for in a partner. She's Hilarious,

758
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,780
witty, playful, beautiful, smart.

759
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,240
And motivated and good
kind hearted person. Um,

760
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,060
are you fucking my wife? Sorry.
Uh, the way we have ridiculous,

761
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,180
Witty Banter reminds me of how you
and Nia are on the podcast. Well,

762
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:39,400
that's what reminded me when you said it.
Uh,

763
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:44,110
it turns out we even want all the same
things in life in terms of a long term

764
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:48,630
relationship. How does this go
left? Did you finally get her naked?

765
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,200
She had a dick. I mean, what is, what
is going on here? Uh, wanting a family,

766
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:57,010
living close to parents and siblings
in the same area we grew up. However,

767
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:00,880
in the past few days she's grown
a little distant. Uh, Jesus,

768
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,680
when I asked her why,

769
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,570
she explained that although she really
enjoys spending time with me and then I

770
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,440
have done nothing wrong, she's never felt
strong, passionate feelings toward me.

771
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,870
Uh, okay. This is how you
got to walk somebody through
their feelings. Oh, ahead.

772
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,140
This is never fun.

773
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,830
I responded honestly that I have not
necessarily felt that huge passive spark.

774
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,670
Oh, wait a minute. I read it wrong.

775
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,310
Oh,
okay.

776
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,490
She said she never felt strong,
passionate feelings toward me.

777
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,810
Oh, I thought you meant she's never felt
that before and she was scared that she

778
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,270
loves you. So she's saying like,
you're cool but I'm not failing.

779
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,030
I responded honestly that I have not
necessarily Sara's Sara Lee felt that huge

780
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,060
past exparte with her either.
Well congratulations.

781
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:54,590
What you guys have on your hands
is, is your your fuck buddies. Okay.

782
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:59,591
And now where you're in an area of limbo
and we don't really know where to go

783
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:00,554
from here.

784
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,630
I think it's clear that we are attracted
to each other and very compatible,

785
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,070
but there is a lack of clear
chemistry between us. Uh,

786
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,880
she has an decelerated online
class for the next two weeks,

787
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,710
so we decided to cool things down and
meet again after that is finished.

788
00:49:18,711 --> 00:49:19,850
I think that's very wise.

789
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,290
My question is if you
consider an emotional,

790
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,950
passionate drive necessarily necessary
for two people to be together

791
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:34,490
successfully long term and
how it was with you when Nia,

792
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,880
I am personally a believer in longterm
love growing over time and that put

793
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,911
passionate love and my
experience generally follows
the Newtonian rule of what

794
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:51,680
comes up. Must always come
down lovely wishes to you,

795
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,640
Nia, and that your little
one and go fuck yourself. Um,

796
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,510
I think that the fact that you guys both
had that really mature conversation,

797
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,700
neither one of you feeling a spark. It's
just like, you know, in the beginning,

798
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,500
if there's the spark,
there's that,

799
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:12,390
that's that euphoria that you kind of
chase for the rest of your relationship

800
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,980
because you know,
you just get used to each other and then

801
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,180
when the love comes out,

802
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:25,181
it's usually vacation holiday or if
you've been through something together and

803
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:29,150
you survived,
it brings you closer together.

804
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,100
And then you have like these memories.

805
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,493
MMM.

806
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,750
You know, like I've gone
through rough periods, you know,

807
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:43,751
with my wife and like having a kid
just upsets the whole apple cart and,

808
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:44,750
uh,

809
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,010
you're focusing so much on the kid that
you can kind of like forget to check in

810
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:53,730
with each other. And, um, you know,

811
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:56,640
so when I've learned with her as we
have to take like these little weekend

812
00:50:56,641 --> 00:51:01,410
vacations, you know, in town, just
go to a hotel and it's hilarious.

813
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,750
And then we instantly
fall back in love again.

814
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,170
And then spend the rest of the time
looking at pictures of our daughter,

815
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,460
seeing how we miss her and stuff.
So,

816
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,930
um, I dunno, I think

817
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,510
because you guys have, you guys seem
like you should be really good friends,

818
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,290
but the weirdest thing is you
already banged or whatever.

819
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,930
So I don't know how that
works in the lesbian world,

820
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,210
but I know in the a Hetero
world that can get weird

821
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,380
and it's kind of 50, 50,
sometimes the guy gets weird.

822
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:39,030
Sometimes the woman gets weird. It's
just kind of weird. So I don't know.

823
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,470
I think it's probably a good thing that
you guys aren't going to see each other

824
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:44,980
for a couple of weeks and you
can kind of be like, you know,

825
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,460
cause it's early on. Just see where
the fuck you are after two weeks.

826
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,123
But um,

827
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,480
I dunno, I think you're doing it right,
but like I know anything about that Shit,

828
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,343
you know?

829
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,423
Yeah.

830
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,550
Which is why he probably
asked me to chime in to, um,

831
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,501
to be honest with you,

832
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:10,501
the only way that it's
going to fucking work is a,

833
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:12,691
is it,

834
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:16,010
you do have that spark in the beginning
because that sparks is what's gonna make

835
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:16,844
you stay.

836
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,910
Cause if you don't have that spark and
you get married for the fucking reasons

837
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:22,220
or whatever, that it's
just like, you know,

838
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:24,980
you see people marry for money in this
sitting on a fucking yacht and they're

839
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:29,690
miserable. Uh, all grown
man's sitting while pissing,

840
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,220
oh Jesus Christ.

841
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:36,140
It's one of the worst images I've
ever heard dear. Oh, Billy blue hills.

842
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,480
Um, I'm a 40 year old man
with three young children.

843
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,010
I realized the other day that over the
past couple of years I've been sitting

844
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:50,390
down when I piss more off the,
the not all right.

845
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,790
Now this is funny cause if you're
doing it because you're tired,

846
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:55,530
it's just fucking hilarious.
I was worried that you were going to,

847
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:59,840
this is going to be some other
progressive thing that, you know,

848
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,860
standing, Piss, privileged, whatever the
fuck they're going to come up with next.

849
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,460
Um,
it all started when the kids were babies.

850
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:12,110
My wife would wake up to feed and I would
head down to the canned like a Zombie

851
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,870
to piss and I was too damn
tired to standard aim.

852
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,190
Now the kids are a little older and I'm
still fucking exhausted most of the time

853
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:22,700
at home that I find myself
sitting down to piss all the time.

854
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,040
I think of just tired as fuck.

855
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,970
Am I crazy to assume this is common
among thing among men my age with young

856
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:34,680
children now that you are 50, do you do
the same? I can't be the only one. Right.

857
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,560
Thanks. Love the podcast and go
fuck yourself. No, I don't do that.

858
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:43,190
The only time they ever do that is if
my wife's sleeping and where we lived in

859
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,860
smaller apartments. I didn't want to
wake her up when I was taking a Piss,

860
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:49,330
you know,

861
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,860
on a consideration I would sit down and
that would always make me laugh and I

862
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:57,910
would always picture all of my friends
making fun of me that I was sitting down.

863
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,240
Well, well piss it. Uh,

864
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,030
I think the fact that you still
say pacing rather than paying,

865
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,610
which is one of my major pet peeves.
Uh,

866
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,080
I can meet with a guy says
I have to go pee. It just,

867
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:15,970
I can't even tell you my body like
microscope of lead, like could torch.

868
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,433
MMM.

869
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,950
Oh by the way, somebody told me
it's anyway and not any ways.

870
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,580
And I have to tell you, I don't
give a shit. I like say it anyways.

871
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,540
I say the plural sense.
Uh,

872
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,160
no you probably not the
only one who does it.

873
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,613
Uh,

874
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,060
but I will tell you that

875
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,850
what I have learned just having one
kid is how important it is to get eight

876
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,380
hours of really good sleep.

877
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,920
And you shouldn't watch TV
and be on your fucking phone.

878
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,850
I've actually gone back to reading. If you
consider reading sports books, reading,

879
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,860
I try to read that my wife,

880
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:00,480
she always watches the fucking real
housewives or that tattoo parlors show,

881
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,480
you know,
any show that involves people.

882
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,300
She doesn't care about screaming
at each other for some reason.

883
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,660
She loves to watch that
before she goes to bed. Um,

884
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,210
so I just put on these, the, the,

885
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,050
the fucking same headphones
I wear when I fly in a plane,

886
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,310
so I can't hear people and I
just read the fucking book.

887
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,560
Uh, but anyways, I think maybe if
you get eight hours sleep, yeah,

888
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,360
you hit the gym a little
bit if you have time.

889
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,280
But I know how tired I am with one kid.

890
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:35,160
I can't imagine with like three and
a good friend of my life, totally.

891
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:39,790
One time when he was talking about
being a parent, his kids are older,

892
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,120
he's got like two or three kids
and three kids and he said,

893
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,300
uh, he goes, dude, he goes,
I've been tired since the 90s.

894
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:55,350
So I think that's just what it is.

895
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:56,943
Uh,

896
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,200
that's just what it is that you know what
it is because once your kids get older

897
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,740
and they can kind of take care of
themselves, meaning they can wake up,

898
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,230
brush their teeth,
get ready for school and all that,

899
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,710
you feel like you're
not going to be tired.

900
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,360
But I think the thing that makes you
tired is the worry because you constantly

901
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:18,360
fucking worried that something's going
to happen to him. But whatever. Um,

902
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,430
all right, that's the podcast. Apologize
for the low volume of talking here.

903
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,300
I really want to everybody that's
come out to my shows here in Germany,

904
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,920
I could not have had a better
time. Uh, it was fucking awesome.

905
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:34,030
And, uh, I will definitely be
back the next time. Hopefully
when I get a new hour,

906
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,360
you guys still want to come to see me?
I will definitely be back.

907
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:39,400
I think I'll come during
the summer months,

908
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:43,750
next time or Octoberfest one or the other.
All right.

909
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,320
Go fuck yourselves then. I'll
check in on yet. Thursday.
