00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.180
I told you, in the
last video, that

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.500
epoxides are very reactive.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.430
That this little triangle right
here, this equilateral

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.510
triangle, is highly strained,
highly unstable.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.950
So it makes it want to do
something, get out of this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.870
configuration.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.550
What I want to do,
in this video, is

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.180
to show you a reaction.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.960
What we have, right here, and we
saw this in the last video.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.065
I've drawn a couple
of more hydrogens.

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:22.900
And I've actually drawn a
little bit of the three

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.990
dimensional nature of the
bonds right here.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.240
Because it'll matter.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.870
This is cyclo-.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.430
And remember, you can just
pretend like this triangle

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.500
here, if it was replaced with
a double bond, this would be

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.750
cyclohexene.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.140
But because, instead of a double
bond right here, we

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.430
have these bonds to
this oxygen, this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130
is cyclohexene oxide.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.500
Let's think about what would
happen if we had some

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.380
cyclohexene oxide mixed
in with water.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.090
And we have some type of maybe
acid catalyst in there.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.260
So it will allow some
extra hydrogen

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.510
protons to float around.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.010
So we have water.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.280
But since we actually put some
acid catalyst there-- and it

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.300
could really be any acid
catalyst, anything that would

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.140
increase the hydrogen proton
concentration-- we're more

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.430
likely to have some hydronium
ions floating around.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.830
And we know what hydronium
ions look like.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.740
They look like water with an
extra proton, with an extra

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.640
hydrogen on them.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.360
So hydronium ions
look like this.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.670
This is water.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.370
Let me do it in a different
color since I already used the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.420
blue for the cyclohexene
oxide.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.380
So this is water right here.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.420
What happens to get hydronium
is the oxygen in the water

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.030
takes a proton from someplace
else, from some acid, the acid

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.480
catalyst, in this case.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.150
It would essentially give
an electron to it.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.520
If this electron gets given to
some hydrogen proton, the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.750
ending result will
look like this.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.220
You have a bond formed with
another hydrogen.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.430
And now, you have a
positive charge.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.070
You have a positive charge on
the oxygen because it gave

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.020
away an electron.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.940
This is hydronium.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.470
We've seen it many times.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830
And this is what results if
you put an acid in water.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.810
It will increase the hydronium
concentration.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.590
You'll see more and
more of this.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.110
So what's likely to happen if we
have cyclohexene oxide with

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.320
water as a solvent, but we also
have a good amount of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.670
hydronium floating around?

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.450
The more acid we put in, the
more hydronium we'll have.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.060
Well, a possible reaction is,
well let's see, this oxygen is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.230
just as likely, or it may want
to get a hydrogen proton just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.860
as much as a hydronium.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.780
So if they bump into each other
in the exact right way,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.570
this oxygen, right here, could
give an electron to that

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.670
hydrogen right there.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.560
And then the original, this
orange hydronium, or this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.590
orange oxygen right here, can
take its electron back.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.820
If that happens, what
do we end up with?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.060
Well, let's see.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.820
So if that happened, now we
have-- Let me draw this

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.720
original molecule.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.590
It will no longer be cyclohexene
oxide exactly.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.750
Because it just got
a hydrogen proton.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.090
It's an intermediary now.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.310
Let me try my best to
draw it though.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.420
All right.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.790
We have that.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.515
Then, we have the oxygen popping
out of the page.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.120
It had these two extra electron
pairs, but now it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.900
gave one of its electrons
to this proton.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.630
So now, it gave one of its
electrons to this hydrogen

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.500
right here.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.130
I call it a proton, because a
hydrogen without an electron

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.900
is just a proton.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.510
It doesn't have another neutron
inside of the nucleus.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.700
So you have the hydrogen
over there.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.870
Now, since this oxygen gave away
an electron, it now has a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.110
positive charge.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.950
Let me draw these two purple
hydrogens that

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.940
are behind the page.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.810
So that's one hydrogen there.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.230
One hydrogen there.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.040
Obviously, there's other
hydrogens on these carbons.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.380
But if I drew it, it
would take a while.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.740
It would make a whole
diagram messy.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.960
But it's always assumed
that a neutral carbon

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160
will have four bonds.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.270
And of course, this thing right
here is now just water.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.810
This thing took its
electron back.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.160
I'll draw it here.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.610
This thing took its
electron back.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.750
And now, it's water.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.490
It could be this one.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.320
But there's obviously tons
of water around.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.920
So I could even draw other
water molecules.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.660
It doesn't have to
just be that one.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.120
Now, what is a likely
to happen?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.710
And this is the fun part
of this reaction.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.030
Because it's actually something
we've seen before.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.620
It's a reaction that we've seen
many, many times already.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.660
But it's just not obvious when
you see it in this form.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.160
When you look at this molecule,
right here, what's

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.950
going on here?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.640
Well, I already told you that
I have this highly, highly

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.700
strained bond here.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.410
It's like this equilateral
triangle.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.420
The bond angles are closer
than they want to be.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.280
The electrons want to get
away from each other.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.270
If you try to do this with a
chemistry model, it would

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.800
actually strain the plastic or
the wood of the chemistry

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.510
model to actually make it.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.470
On top of that, this oxygen with
this extra hydrogen now,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.430
it is actually a good
leaving group.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.580
And so now, it's probably
triggering some things in your

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.000
brain about the type of reaction
that might occur.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.620
And think about this
carbon right here.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.470
Think about this carbon.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.850
Actually, these two carbons
are the same.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.810
So I'll just pick on this one,
the bottom one, for fun.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.810
Think about this carbon
right here.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.920
It is bonded.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.670
It's a secondary carbon.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.080
So it would not be super great
for an Sn2 reaction.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.530
But you can have an Sn2 reaction
with a secondary

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.290
carbon, especially when the
leaving group wants to leave

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.410
bad enough.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.860
So if one of these water
molecules, it didn't have to

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.820
be this first one right here,
if it just bumps into this

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.240
carbon in the exact way, it
can actually act as a

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.150
nucleophile.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.890
Water isn't, traditionally,
a very strong nucleophile.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.890
But it can be a nucleophile,
especially if the leaving

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.080
group is ready to leave
and this is a

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.780
really strained bond.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.500
So what you could imagine
is that this

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.630
water gives an electron.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.380
It loves this carbon nucleus
right there.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.050
It gives it to that carbon.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.550
And since that carbon is getting
an electron from this

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.100
water over here, then it can
release an electron back to

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.960
this oxygen, making
it neutral.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.830
So it can release this back
to this oxygen right here.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.930
What will we end up with then?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.250
Now, something interesting
has just happened.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.700
And this is typical of
all Sn2 reactions.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.740
Remember, it's Sn2.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.260
We're substituting with
a nucleophile.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.310
Water is a weak nucleophile.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.690
But, in this case, it'll stick
better than this thing that's

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.860
all strained.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.920
And we call it 2, Sn2, because
both of the reactants are

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.570
involved in the rate
determining step.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.070
This is the rate determining
step right here.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.060
So what do we end up with?

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.065
Let me just draw the hexane
ring, just like that.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.500
Now, all of a sudden, this
oxygen up here, what

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.540
will it look like?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.030
Well, this bond gets broken.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.220
It takes back an electron.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.050
So you only have this bond to
the oxygen, this top bond to

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.250
the oxygen.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.830
That's the oxygen right there.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.610
It took this electron back.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.130
So now, it has this electron
and the electron that was

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.930
bonded to the carbon.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.640
So it has a pair of electrons.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.870
And then, it's bonded to that
hydrogen that it took from the

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.130
hydronium in the first step.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.750
And then it's bonded to this
hydrogen over there.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.220
So it really is just an OH group
now, bonded right that.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.650
It's popping out of the page.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.020
You still have this hydrogen
that's going behind the page.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.380
But since we had a Sn2 reaction,
you can imagine this

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.440
came from the back.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440
And this let go from
the front.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.330
So what will now happen is, this
hydrogen that was kind of

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.870
behind the page, now
will pop forward.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.120
Because this guy went from even
behind that hydrogen.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.380
So this hydrogen, over here,
will now pop forward.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.430
So this hydrogen, now,
has popped forward.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.400
I'll circle it just so you see
it's the same hydrogen.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400
But it has popped forward,
since this guy, this

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.700
nucleophile attack, happened
from the back.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.510
And now, he is attached.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.800
He has attached down here.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.200
This water has attached.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.770
Well, it's not water anymore.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.470
So you had the oxygen.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.270
Two hydrogens.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.570
And then it had two pairs.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.350
But now, one of the pair
turns into a bond.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.600
Because it gives this
electron there.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.140
So these two guys are bonded.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.980
This electron is given
to the carbon.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.805
And the bond is behind
the page now.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.840
Just like that.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.550
And then the final step is--
now, since this guy gave an

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.900
electron, he has a positive
charge here.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.680
Just to make it nice and clean,
you can imagine another

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.370
water molecule comes and takes
one of those hydrogens away

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.090
from this guy.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.340
All these hydrogens are just
getting passed around between

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.520
these water molecules.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.450
So you can imagine this
water molecule

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.690
could take that hydrogen.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.990
This oxygen takes the
electron back, and

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.620
then becomes neutral.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.370
And then our final product--
we are now done--

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.950
will look like this.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.630
So we had cyclohexene oxide, a
reactive epoxide, in water

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.740
with some acid around.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.240
So it kind of catalyzed the
leaving group and all that.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.810
We just saw that in this.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.150
But what does the resulting
molecule look like?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:38.270
So popping out of the page
up here, we have an OH.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.160
That's this right here.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.770
I'm just simplifying
a little bit.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.340
Going behind the page, we have
a hydrogen right over there.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.770
And then, popping out of the
page we have a hydrogen.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.440
So popping out of
the page, right

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.800
here, we have a hydrogen.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.030
And then, behind the page,
we have another OH group.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.670
So we've made a diol.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.580
And, in particular, if we wanted
to name this thing

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.110
right here, we have our
cyclohexane ring.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.140
That's our main ring.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.390
We have cyclohexane.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.290
And then, we have OH
groups on the-- We

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.230
can just start numbering.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.080
We want to start numbering
where the groups are.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.460
So we call this the 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 carbon.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.540
We have OH groups at the
1 and the 2 carbons.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.460
So we have two of them.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.080
So it's a diol.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.030
So we call this, 1 comma
2-diol, because

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.930
we have two OH groups.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.260
Diol.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.870
The -ol is for alcohol when
you have these OH groups.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.840
We have two of them.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.780
And they are on opposite
sides.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.230
This alcohol, or this OH, is
popping out of the page.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.050
This OH is behind the page.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.050
So if we really wanted to be
specific about even the

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.600
stereochemistry here, we
would call this trans.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.320
They're on opposite sides.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.140
One is in front.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.930
One is behind.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.230
So this is trans.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.500
This is
trans-cyclohexane-1,2-diol.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.190
So, hopefully, you
enjoyed that.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.880
What the fun thing about this
is, one, to see that epoxides

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.750
are reactive.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.600
You just even see
a new reaction.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.210
But the really fun thing to
see is that these Sn2

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.000
reactions keep popping up.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.270
In fact, the ones we learned,
Sn2, Sn1, E1, E2, these just

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.340
keep, over and over, popping
up in chemistry in places

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.690
that, maybe it wasn't obvious
at the first glance.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.800
But then, when you actually
think about it, it's actually

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.030
perfect for that type
of reaction.
