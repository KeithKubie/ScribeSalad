00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.770
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.970
A "Forbes" article
about Meb Faber's book

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.400
begins with the question, how
does an investment manager

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.190
reconcile all of the
various prognostications

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.650
he hears on a daily basis?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.700
His curt and brief
response was, ignore them.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.590
Over 70 years ago, Ben
Graham and David Dodd

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.050
proposed valuing
stocks with earnings

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.610
smoothed across multiple years.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.680
Robert Shiller later
popularized this method

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.430
with his version of the
cyclically adjusted price

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.200
to earnings, or the cape
ratio, in the late 1990s

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.710
and correctly issued a timely
warning of poor stock returns

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.620
to follow in the coming years.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.120
Our speaker today Mr. Faber
applies this valuation metric

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.440
across his global investments.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.130
He's a co-founder and CIO of
Cambria Investment Management

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.420
and has authored numerous
white papers and three books--

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.129
"Shareholder Yield," "The Ivy
Portfolio," and "Global Value."

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.810
A frequent speaker and writer
on investment strategies

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.000
who has been featured
in the "Barons,"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.030
"The New York Times,"
and "The New Yorker,"

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.010
he is here today to speak
about his investing philosophy.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.730
So without further ado, friends,
let's welcome Mebane Faber.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.870
MEBANE FABER: It's
great to be here today.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.700
This is a nice,
intimate audience.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.920
So I usually fly through
this pretty quick.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.780
So if I'm going too
fast, I say something

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.077
you don't understand, just
raise your hand and wave at me.

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:37.910
This is interesting.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.240
Because this is probably the
first time in my entire life

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.500
I've been the most dressed
up person in the room.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.980
You know, suits for me, it's
normally weddings, funerals.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.990
I live down in So Cal.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.610
So casual is kind of our
normal entire anyway.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.760
So it's a bit humorous.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.510
Anyway, all right.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.660
So we're going to get
started real fast.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.320
Since I don't see
too many familiar

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.340
faces, quick introduction.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.220
Again, my name is Mebane
Faber, although I go by Meb.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.780
Mebs lately have had
a lot of great press.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.960
This is the Meb who just
won the Boston Marathon.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.920
And as one of my friends'
moms on social media

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.480
said when I posted
a link to this,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.230
said I didn't even know
you ran, I said, well,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.615
I know if you've
seen any photos,

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:29.750
but he's in much better shape,
much skinnier than I am.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.210
I grew up in Colorado
before spending some time

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.420
in North Carolina.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.520
I went to college at
University of Virginia.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.690
So if anybody is watching the
College World Series tonight,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.640
go Hoos.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.700
We're playing Vanderbilt.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.000
So pretty excited about that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.260
May have to make a last
minute trip to Omaha

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.170
here if we win one of
the first two games.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.977
Actually studied
engineering in biology so.

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:52.560
I feel like I'm in
good company today.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.190
Probably a lot of
engineers here.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.070
My first job out of college
was in Washington, DC.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.990
Worked as a biotech
analyst for biotech stocks

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.209
and was going to grad
school at the time

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.500
before moving to San Fransisco.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.910
So I lived in the Bay Area
for about a year and a half

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.850
and then a brief--
and actually lived

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.920
with an early Google employee.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.194
So I was gravitating more
towards the quant side

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:17.360
of the business of the time.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080
So moved away from the
bench, from the science--

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.370
I was always really
terrible at it anyway--

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.060
but more towards
quantitative investing.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.290
A brief stop in Lake
Tahoe, where I can get away

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.560
in most of the country
saying that I actually

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.890
had gainful employment there.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.930
But most to you can see
through that and say,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.050
you're probably a ski bum.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.675
As you know, there's
probably not a lot

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:41.780
of high investment
companies going on in Tahoe.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.550
But an interesting side story
was that when I did live there,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.700
I managed to sneak my way into
a really, really great Google

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.400
party.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.600
And if any of you all have
been around long enough--

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.410
this is probably
2004-- anybody here

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.760
that used to go to the parties
they had at Squaw-- wow, OK.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.570
We got a couple.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.100
So, I mean, we're
talking six stages--

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.360
this is probably pre-IPO days.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.010
You could still
get away with this.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.790
Six stages and ice
sculptures and fire.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.150
And they flew almost everybody
in from around the world.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.870
And of course, I wasn't
working at Google

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.203
but had a number of friends did.

00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:18.240
So I managed to sneak my way in.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.840
And I remembered as
I was walking today.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.340
I'd completely
forgotten about this.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.630
But they gave every Google
employee two drink tickets

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.880
and then I think you had to
buy the rest or something.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.830
But the good news is,
most of my friends

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.632
worked in travel
employment up there.

00:04:30.632 --> 00:04:32.840
So I had it from friends
working the hotel front desk

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.859
setting up the
tents with the guys.

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:37.150
One of the guy says, here,
you want some drink tickets?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.912
You know, because
we're all obviously

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:39.995
sneaking into the parties.

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:40.720
And he said, sure.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.136
You know, you only
get one or two.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:43.987
He goes, here's 50.

00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:45.820
Needless to say, I
managed to get kicked out

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.670
of the party later that
night, or the after party,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.545
but really had a
great time there.

00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:54.090
It was really a lot of fun.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.230
Moved down to LA.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.450
I guess this should
be a Kings photo now.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.350
But I've been in Manhattan
Beach for the past seven years.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.310
When I started my company
Cambria Investment Adviser,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.070
spent a lot of time
learning how to surf.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.170
But I'm pretty terrible.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.340
Look like this and this.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.220
And if you've see the
videos on YouTube lately,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.250
one of the benefits
of having technology,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.900
of course, the go
pros of the world,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.640
is you get amazing
footage, right?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.970
But also, you learn some
things you really probably

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.950
didn't want to know.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.550
So being a surfer
in Manhattan beach

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.460
and all of a sudden
realizing that, yes,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.379
underwater there's a lot
of great white sharks.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.920
So you've been seeing a lot of
these videos coming out lately

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.503
where stand up
paddleboarders are just

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:34.510
watching these great whites
swim through the line up.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.886
I would rather just
not know, of course,

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:38.010
that our friends are there.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.420
But they're harmless, right?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.490
A bit about my company--
we started in 2006.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.187
We manage about 430 million,
maybe 440 million now.

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:48.270
We do individual accounts.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.690
We manage public funds.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.320
The goal-- and I feel like this
try to include a Silicon Valley

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.805
term-- disrupt traditional
high fee investing.

00:05:57.805 --> 00:06:01.680
I have 100% of my net worth
invested in our public fund.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.527
So this isn't a
theoretical exercise

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:04.860
we're going to talk about today.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.990
But this is what I do
with all my own money.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.120
Now, before we start,
this is a fun little quiz

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.030
we're going to pass around.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.690
It's anonymous.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.315
So don't worry.

00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:16.670
Nobody's going to see
what you wrote down.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.610
But asked a simple question
is for those of you

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.520
invest in stocks--
so ignore bonds.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.720
Ignore real estate.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.560
Ignore commodities
or whatever else you

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.849
may trade-- currencies.

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.140
And you have to be US resident.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.840
Otherwise, you'll bias the data.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.450
How much do you put in the US?

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.480
So let's say you have 80%
in the US, 20% in Japan.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480
Write down 80%.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.400
So there's a little
piece of paper

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.483
that's going to go around.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.140
Just write down a number.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.230
And then when it gets to
the end, raise your hand.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.730
And we'll get back to
this a little bit later.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.395
You can find a lot of
information that we write about

00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:51.030
and publish.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.880
Again, I have a
blog-- Mebfabor.com.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.820
My company's website--
Cambria Funds.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.710
There's a third site called
The Idea Farm, but all of which

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.300
we publish.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.350
Most of it is free.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.020
There's 1,500
articles I've written

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.182
on the blog, about a dozen
white papers, three books.

00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:09.390
And as a benefit of sitting
here during a lunch break

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.740
or taking the time out today or
if you're watching the webcast,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.870
I'm more than happy to
send you a free book.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.600
You can only pick one, though.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.290
But the topic of this
one today is a book

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.270
we put out a couple months
ago called "Global Value."

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.030
But we've also
published two others.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.540
But I'll have more than
happy to send you one.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.720
Shoot me an email.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.930
My personal email
address-- mebane@gmail.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.740
I tried to get meb@gmail
in the early days,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.240
but they said, no three letter
Gmail addresses when it first

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.050
came out, sadly.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.800
But anyway, shoot me one.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.700
"Ivy Portfolio" is best
in harder paperback.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.940
It came out at a time
when the Kindle software

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.010
wasn't that great yet.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.820
So I would recommend reading
that one in a hard cover

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.690
or paper back.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.270
The other two, I would be
happy to send you a free copy.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.740
All right, so we're going to
get started on the talk now.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.650
And it's interesting.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.830
Because a lot of people, when
you talk about investing,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.330
it's an interesting science.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.520
And it's interesting
because so many people

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.040
have such widely
held beliefs, right?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.730
And so, talking about
it, in many ways,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.550
to certain people, especially
that aren't as open minded,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.660
it's like talking
about politics.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.540
It's like talking
about religion, right?

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.080
Trying to convince a
buy and hold indexer

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.280
that you should be
tactical is just

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.880
as difficult as trying to
convince a Republican to be

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.244
a Democrat or someone
to switch religions.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:31.160
It's really difficult.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.326
But we're going to talk
about some interesting stuff

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:37.070
today that probably goes against
a lot of conventional wisdom.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.240
So keep an open mind.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.350
You may agree with
some of it, may not.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.960
But it should be interesting.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.120
I was going to name
this chart or this topic

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.730
You Suck at Investing.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.180
And when I say this, I don't
mean any of you specifically.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.920
I'm not pointing out any one of
you, although most of you do.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.750
But you're terrible
at investing.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.220
This is the broad
investing public.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.160
This is an example of
a study that comes out

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.940
by Dow Bar that shows
investor returns, dollar

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.010
weighted returns.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.600
As you can see,
typically, everything

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.720
did good except for
the average investor.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.210
Morningstar replicates this
study for funds, right?

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.370
So the average investment
fund-- when the money comes in,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.700
when the money comes out.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.450
And typically, what happens--
people are emotional.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.570
They have a behavioral
bias or they

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.860
rush into stocks or performance
of a fund at the top

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.050
and then sell at the bottom.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.250
And they do it over and
over and over again.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.370
That costs you roughly about
2% a year typically, right?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.850
So all you that are getting
really excited about stocks

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.060
again after the fifth
year of this bull market

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.040
but weren't investing
in 2008 or 2009,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.010
you maybe want to take a little
bit of pause, think about it.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.170
But it's important to come up
with a systematic investment

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.430
approach to avoid some of
these genetic behavioral biases

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.720
we have.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.865
A good visual
representation of this

00:09:56.865 --> 00:09:59.870
is, there's an
American Association

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:05.290
of Individual Investors--
polls their readers and says,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.190
simple question.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.050
Are you bullish on the stock
market, bearish, or neutral?

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.940
This goes back to late '80s.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.280
So the red is kind
of average values.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.300
The green triangle
is where we are now.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.380
So kind of average.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.880
What you can see, though, is
a little bit of complacency.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.132
The neutral is a little
higher than normal, right?

00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:24.340
And that kind of reflects
what's going on the market.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.510
There's low volatility.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.460
A lot of people haven't
really participated.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.471
They got out in '08, '09, and
have never really gotten back

00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:31.970
in.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.178
Don't really know what to do.

00:10:33.178 --> 00:10:35.460
But we do see, when were
people most bullish?

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.500
The absolute worst
time in history

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.130
to be bullish-- January
of 2000, for those

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.850
of you that were investing them.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.200
When were people most bearish?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.680
The absolute best time to
be investing in my career,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.720
March, 2009.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.160
This goes to show,
the whole point

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.330
is that your emotions could
work against you, right?

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.740
And it's what has come
down on our genetics

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.330
for many millions
of years, right?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.060
What was important when
you're on the savanna

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.410
and a tiger is chasing is very
different than what the skill

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.310
set and genetics
needed to trade shares

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.650
of IBM or Google or short gold
or whatever it may be, right?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.669
But this isn't anything.

00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:16.210
This is something that's been
going on for hundreds of years.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.260
This is an example that goes
back to the early 18th century.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.200
This is in a paper we
wrote called Learning

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.720
to Love Investment Bubbles.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.460
But this is an example of one
of the most famous bubbles.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.320
And there's some great
books on this topic.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.230
"Extraordinary Popular Delusions
and the Madness of Crowds"

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.850
is a really
wonderful one-- talks

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.410
about many historical bubbles.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.870
What this shows is an example
of a stock that went parabolic

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.270
in the early 18th century.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.210
It was a [INAUDIBLE] stock.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.510
We talk about it in this paper.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.290
It's a really interesting story.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.770
It involves a lot of the
things that typically happen

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.290
in bubbles-- easy access
to money, credit, people

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:49.950
borrowing.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.550
But the most important one is
people making a lot of money.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:57.300
And a very great example is one
of the most rational, brilliant

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.730
scientists of all
times, Sir Isaac Newton,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.190
was an investor in this company.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.700
It goes to show his
experience that will probably

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.009
mimic a lot of
investors experiences

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:08.050
in stock that went parabolic
and went in bubbles.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.995
So an example-- I joke a
lot on my blog and Twitter

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:15.280
that this probably looks like
a chart of Bitcoin, to which I

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.044
get a lot of hate
mail about, strangely.

00:12:18.044 --> 00:12:19.460
I've been writing
for seven years.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.530
And all of a sudden, I
start getting hate mail.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.620
Anyway, so this example.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.170
So Neuton buys in,
doubles his money.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.801
What is that?

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:28.800
Yeah, doubles his money.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.230
Could not be happier.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.130
What's the worst
possible thing when

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.760
you've made money
and gotten out?

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.436
Well, it's that your friends
are making more money, right?

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:39.810
Someone just sold
an app company.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.340
Uber's valued at $18 billion.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.770
Someone else did this
Yo app that's getting

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.080
millions of downloads, right?

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.920
What's the worst possible
thing that could happen?

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.270
It's your friend
in the next cubicle

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.270
is making more money than you.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.546
Or your friends are all
getting rich but you're not.

00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:52.670
So what happens, of course?

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.399
Well, then he decides
to buy back in, OK?

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.690
Well, of course, he's buying
near the top, at the peak.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.231
What happens?

00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:00.220
It crashes 90%.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.670
Well, then he sells
at the bottom, OK?

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.020
Well, this is something that
happens over and over again

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.470
in investing.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.280
And so I just want to
show it's nothing new.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.850
And think about this
as we go forward.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.670
So what can you do?

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.990
Is there anything you can do to
remove this emotional decision

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.770
making to combat our
behavioral biases?

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.980
Well, so there are these
two good looking guys

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.010
you may recognize, may not.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.910
On the left is Ben
Graham, often known

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.600
as the father of
security analysis.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.490
He wrote a couple great books.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.590
He's a professor
early 20th century

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.250
called "Security Analysis--
An Intelligent Investor."

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.420
And what he proposed is,
when looking at an investment

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:46.390
to value the company and often
to smooth out the valuation

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.290
by using earnings over
a number of years.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.570
Not just looking at
one year of earnings,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.990
but his preferred metric was
smoothing it out over five

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.760
to seven years.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.010
There's a way to smooth out
the business cycle, right?

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.410
As a way to have a
fundamental anchor

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.400
to be able to compare companies
to each other on a long term

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.200
basis.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.620
Fast forward 80 years later--
so this is nothing new.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.460
This has been around
almost a century.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.800
Robert Shiller,
recent Nobel laureate,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.900
just won with Eugene
Fama, professor at Yale.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.840
He put out a white
paper in the late '90s

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.230
called "Irrational Exuberance."

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.190
Sorry, excuse me, a
white paper, then a book

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.481
called "Irrational Exuberance."

00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.930
Alan Greenspan later used
the term in Congress,

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.836
promptly sent the stock
market down quite a bit.

00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:25.460
But he says, let's
take a look at this.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.550
But let's use it on the
market-wide basis as a whole.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.310
Let's look at 10 year average
earnings across the entire US

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.570
stock market called the 10
year Cyclically Adjusted Price

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.620
Earnings ratio-- CAPE, right?

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.720
So this is an example of what
that looks like back to 1881.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.185
So that's a long time.

00:14:41.185 --> 00:14:44.170
And the problem you have with
efficient market people--

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.080
people that say, the
market's efficient.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.770
You can't predict bubbles--
or sorry, bubble don't exist.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.820
First of all, they say,
bubbles don't exist.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.500
They do exist.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.920
You can't predict them.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.734
And that doesn't make
much sense to me.

00:14:53.734 --> 00:14:55.150
If you look at
this chart, there's

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.090
an average value of around
16, 17 times earnings,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.640
right, that the US stock
market has been in.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.020
There's times when it's
been incredibly low,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.510
in the low single digits--
think 1910s as well

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.590
as post depression.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.150
But there's also times when
things get incredibly bubbly.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.889
If you look at the late '20s,
you get to a value of over 30.

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:14.930
If you look at the biggest
bubble in the US stock

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.020
market's ever seen in the late
'90s, you have a value of 45.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.100
Does it seem even
remotely reasonable

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.680
that it is a good a time to
buy stocks when they're trading

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.480
at 45 times earnings
in 1999 as it

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.790
was in the early 1980s
at a value of five?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.210
That does not pass a common
sense sniff test for me.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.170
So if you look at this, you
say that OK, does it work?

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.350
Historically, being a scientist,
an engineer, does this work?

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.100
Historically, it's worked great.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.340
If you buy stock market
when it's cheap at, say,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.800
less than a CAPE ratio of 10,
you get great future returns.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.230
These are 10 returns going
forward-- real returns.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.030
So we're netting out inflation.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.800
And it's a nice stair step down.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.076
The more you pay for stocks, the
lower your future returns are.

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.700
It is-- again, it's
not rocket science.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.860
It's simple.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.830
But this works out over
a long term time horizon.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.530
If you look at where we are now,
we're at a value of around 26.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.490
So unfortunately,
in the worst bucket

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.240
where the red line is right
now where future returns should

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.660
be pretty muted, pretty low.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.370
We don't think it's a bubble.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.450
It's not crazy.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.850
But I was talking about
this at lunch today.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.470
There's a spectrum of
future returns, right?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.729
And simply, the more
the market goes up

00:16:27.729 --> 00:16:30.020
in the meantime means the
lower your future returns are

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.110
going to be.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.350
The more the market goes
down in the meantime,

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.884
the higher your future returns
are going to be in general.

00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:37.300
The best possible
thing that could

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.799
happen, if you're a young person
in this room, is the market

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.730
could crash by 50%.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.370
Maybe the best possible thing,
but the best possible thing

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.880
for your investing career.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.796
Because you can then invest
in the US for the next 10, 20,

00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:52.250
30, 40 years at a much
cheaper valuation.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.879
That is not the opportunity
set right now, unfortunately.

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:56.670
We're going to stop on
this one real quick.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.740
It's just a scatter plot for
the nerds out there like me

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.810
that goes to show that
valuation-- it looks almost

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.079
like a shotgun blast, right?

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.800
Doesn't explain everything.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.490
We're in kind of
the yellow area.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.520
But in general, the more
expensive you pay for stocks,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.099
the worse the
future returns are.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.980
The less you pay for them, the
better the future returns are.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.619
I don't expect you
to see this chart.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.658
I don't expect you to really
even appreciate what it is.

00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:21.407
From just the colors,
it looks like a bowl

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.740
of, like, Fruity Pebbles, right?

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.410
But what this is-- this
is CAPE ratio buckets.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.860
So the dark green, or the
cheapest buckets, all the way

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.550
out to red, which are
the most expensive.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.620
And these five columns
are future annualized

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.700
10-year returns.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.200
And the only take
away from what you

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.850
should see in this chart is
that most of the green stuff

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.560
is on the right, meaning
your starting points

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.210
when they're cheap--
great future returns.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.550
And most of the red
stuff is on the left.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.310
When you pay too
much, in general,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.090
you get crappy
returns going forward.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.910
However, it's not
guaranteed, right?

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.670
You see there's three
great returning years

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.710
on the far right
when you started out

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.670
with pretty rich valuations.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.380
And on the left, there's even
a few green, light greens,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.640
when markets are cheap that
you had kind of low returns.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.720
So valuation is not-- it is what
we like to call a blunt tool.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.620
It is not an exact science,
which makes it challenging

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.200
as well as fun.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.040
But if you look at
the 10 best times

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.760
to buy stocks in
the past-- I think

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.000
this is 114 years--
awesome returns.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.230
16% a year, net of inflation.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.410
You can really compound
massively at that level.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.780
The starting valuation
was around 11.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.670
The 10 worst
possible times to be

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.000
buying stocks over
the past 114 years--

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.740
negative returns every year.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.020
Starting valuation was an
average of 23, all right?

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.180
So where do we find
ourselves today?

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.370
A secular bull market starting
point around 11 or a secular

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.280
bear market starting
point around 23.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.440
The bad news is we're on
the more expensive side.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.270
There's a caveat, of course.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.230
This is the PE ratios
versus inflation.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.590
When inflation is
low and contained--

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.480
let's call this 1% to
4% safe range which

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.580
goes to about here
to here-- people

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.590
are willing to pay
more for stocks, right?

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.200
Because the future is
slightly more certain.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.799
When inflation is really
high-- think about Argentina,

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.340
think about these
countries that have

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.315
consistent high
inflation-- Venezuela--

00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:23.690
when you're a
business and you're

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.420
trying to plan for the
future, it's really difficult.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.040
On top of that, your future
cash flows are worth less.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.250
Because every month
you're losing money

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.450
to this erosion of inflation.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.902
So you'll see a warning sign.

00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:36.860
This may never happen in
the next 10, 20 years.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.359
Who knows?

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:37.990
Maybe it will.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.700
In the '70s, the US had
double digit inflation.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.570
It's hard for many of
us to comprehend now.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.630
But thinking about
inflation going up

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.240
that much-- we
live in a world of,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.730
let's called it 1
and 1/2, 2% inflation

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.240
hopefully right now,
not even that much.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.000
But the takeaway is,
that until inflation

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.050
gets above really that 3%,
4% kind of upper level,

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.976
people are willing to pay more
for stocks for that certainty.

00:19:59.976 --> 00:20:01.350
Again, they're
not willing to pay

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.510
26, which is off this chart.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.910
But they're willing to
pay a little bit more.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.640
There's a lot of criticisms
of this valuation methodology.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.380
What I want to impress on you,
when you're valuing something,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.962
most of the valuation
indicators should agree.

00:20:16.962 --> 00:20:19.170
So it doesn't even really
matter if you're using CAPE

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.990
or you're using price
to book or you're

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.870
using cash flows or Buffett's
favorite market cap, the GDP,

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.620
in general they should
say the same thing.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.070
But, so a lot of people say the
measurement period is too long.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.610
In our book "Global
Value," we show

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.760
that the best period is
around five to seven years.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.142
So Ben Graham was right.

00:20:36.142 --> 00:20:37.600
Seven years, I
think, was the best.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.840
10 is just fine.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.660
What's the worst?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.290
One year earnings.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.370
What do most analysts
on Wall Street use?

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.820
One year earnings.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.000
So we don't know why.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.860
A lot of people say that
ignores depressions or bubbles.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.854
We're not going to get
into that because we

00:20:51.854 --> 00:20:52.770
don't have enough time today.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.020
And we certainly aren't going
to get into the accounting,

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.860
talking about reported
and operating earnings.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.943
But if you want to email
me or you have questions,

00:20:58.943 --> 00:21:00.610
I'm more than happy
to talk about it.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.845
This is a good chart from
my good friend John Housman

00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:04.220
that goes to show
it doesn't even

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.390
matter what valuation
metric you use.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.630
These are a bunch of
different models using

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.140
earnings, dividends,
Schiller CAPE.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.092
This is Buffett's favorite--
10 year market cap GDP.

00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:15.550
And then, how does
it actually work

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.989
in the future 10-year returns?

00:21:16.989 --> 00:21:18.405
And what you can
see in general is

00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:20.790
they all tend to
move together, right?

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.937
Generally.

00:21:21.937 --> 00:21:23.770
They're not going to
be incredibly specific.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.180
But what this shows is that this
is projected future returns,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.680
right?

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.912
So it's like the valuation
chart flipped upside down.

00:21:29.912 --> 00:21:31.370
But what it goes
to show-- and it's

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.700
pretty good at
this-- it says, look.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.670
When were returns
projected to be the worst?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.020
Late '90s, right?

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.950
That's a terrible time
to be buying stocks.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.260
But as the market has gone
down, stocks have gotten better.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.685
And in 2008, stocks
were supposed

00:21:44.685 --> 00:21:45.830
to return double digits.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.509
But no one wanted to be buying,
even though they were cheap.

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:50.300
But certainly not a
good buying opportunity

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.674
is the early '80s, which is
the start of the biggest bull

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:55.930
market we've ever seen in
the US, but getting better.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.965
So again, people like
to think in terms of,

00:21:57.965 --> 00:21:58.840
stocks are expensive.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.826
They're going to crash.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:00.325
Sell.

00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:02.574
When stocks are cheap,
we've got to buy them.

00:22:02.574 --> 00:22:04.240
They're going to go
up to double digits.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.530
But in reality, it's usually
somewhere in the middle.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.510
People don't like
hearing something like,

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.400
the future expected returns
are going to be about 4%,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.610
which is what we think, which
is what the model shows,

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.360
which isn't that exciting.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.820
So as you think about this,
and thinking about bubbles

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.470
and thinking about
the efficient market

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.450
and not overpaying
for something,

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.750
we think it's important
to understand risk, right?

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.860
And the risk of loss
and the very real risk

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.415
of losing a lot of money.

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:35.970
A Great Arthur Ashe quote--
either you understand the risk

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.790
or you don't play the game.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.524
And we have a picture
of the mouse who's

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.190
trying to get the
cheese but being smart

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.390
about it-- wear a helmet.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.530
And someone on Twitter the
other day said, you know,

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.055
Meb, your CAPE measure,
the Schiller CAPE measure

00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:56.480
is kind of like the difference
of chance of fatality

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.320
if you're driving a car
at 200 miles an hour

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.940
versus five miles
an hour, right?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.310
You're much more likely to
get into a big wreck fatality

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.800
at 200 miles an hour
then you are at five.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.330
So that leaves us
with the problem.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.080
Every pension fund
in the country

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.430
expect 8% returns per year.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.780
We wrote a paper called,
"What if 8% is 0%?"

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.000
Pension funds investing with
eyes closed, fingers crossed.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.400
What do you do?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.500
US bonds yield 2 and 1/2%.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.947
Stocks should return around 5%.

00:23:23.947 --> 00:23:25.280
That's not that exciting, right?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.445
Your 4% yield or
4% roughly return.

00:23:28.445 --> 00:23:29.690
The math doesn't work out.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:30.940
It doesn't work out for
a lot of institutions

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.460
that are going have really big
troubles with their pension

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.060
funds that will likely
eventually go broke

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.575
in the next 10 to 20, 30 years.

00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:38.325
So what do you do?

00:23:38.325 --> 00:23:41.080
If you're looking at
return, what do you do?

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.157
This is a chart.

00:23:42.157 --> 00:23:43.490
We've never seen anyone do this.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.110
So we had to go create this.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.450
We said, all right.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.880
We live in a global world.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.040
Let's look at 45 developed and
emerging economies, countries,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.530
and come up a CAPE ratio
for all of these, right?

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.075
And so we took this
back to the early '80s.

00:23:59.075 --> 00:24:01.700
And in general, the
takeaway of this chart

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.597
is that most things
move together, right?

00:24:03.597 --> 00:24:05.430
And generally, stocks
are correlated, right?

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.962
It's a globalized world, right?

00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:08.670
What happens in the
US is going to affect

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.204
what happens in China and
India and Japan and vice versa.

00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:13.620
So in general,
they move together.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.390
However, you can see some
pretty wide dispersion

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.200
at certain times
and over the years.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.820
And then you also
see a few things.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.634
This massive, massive outlier
over here, this bubble.

00:24:23.634 --> 00:24:25.425
There's a lot of young
faces in the crowds,

00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:27.020
so you probably
don't remember this.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.300
But Japan in the
late '80s was widely

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.500
expected to take over
the world, right?

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.550
Their companies were better.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.551
Their cars were better.

00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:37.050
There were more
efficient companies.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.690
The valuation of
their stock market

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.420
is the biggest bubble
we've ever seen.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.800
And it's not even close.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.285
They hit a valuation ratio CAPE
of like 95 or maybe it's 99.

00:24:48.285 --> 00:24:48.980
I can't see.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.510
95, it looks like.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.260
And so it's funny.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.301
Because you hear commentators
talk about the lost

00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:55.470
decades in Japan and how
terrible the stock market

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.567
returns have been in the
'90s and 2000s, right?

00:24:58.567 --> 00:25:00.400
No, it's because they
had one of the biggest

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.510
bubbles you've ever seen.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.570
And it's taken them that
long to work that off, right?

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.590
When did Japan finally get
back to a reasonable valuation?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.730
Only in the last few years.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.230
What happened?

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.820
Japan is the best
performing stock market

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.778
in the world last year.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.990
But the efficient
market person will

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:21.110
say that it was just a good a
time to buy Japan in late 1989

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.281
when the real estate
under the Imperial palace

00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:24.780
was worth more than
the entire state

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.024
of the real estate
of California.

00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:28.440
Things that just
don't make sense.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.920
But to us, coming up with
this objective measure

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.940
of a fundamental metric,
fundamental anchor,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.690
can that help you?

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.460
So we said, we
reran the same test.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.870
Does starting valuation
impact future returns?

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.530
And the answer is, it
does in the same exact way

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.939
that the US did, right?

00:25:43.939 --> 00:25:45.980
The less you pay for
something, the better it is.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.260
I don't care if it's baseball
cards, a Tesla, whatever

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:49.930
you think.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.212
The less you pay for it,
the better it's going to be.

00:25:52.212 --> 00:25:54.170
The more you pay for it,
the worse your returns

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.460
are going to be.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.560
Where are we right now?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.200
With foreign developed
markets and foreign emerging,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.930
they're both right around 15.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.689
So the two red
bars here emerging

00:26:03.689 --> 00:26:04.730
was a little bit cheaper.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.002
So this bar developed is
a little higher than 15.

00:26:09.002 --> 00:26:11.210
But much better returns than
in the far right bucket,

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.470
which is the US.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.740
So, much more opportunity.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.990
What happens if you went
back and said, you know what?

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.740
We're going to only investing
in the cheapest countries.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.990
Instead of this global
portfolio, what if we just

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.540
invested in the cheapest
25% of countries each year?

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.260
Takes five minutes
a year, rebalance.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.450
Well, that would
have done fantastic.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.170
So this is what the
global portfolio

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.820
would have looked like.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.736
The top CAPE, which is
the cheapest countries,

00:26:31.736 --> 00:26:33.730
did a much better job
than the bottom CAPE,

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.710
the expensive countries, OK?

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.980
Again, not complicated.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.640
But buying value works.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.704
It has worked over time.

00:26:39.704 --> 00:26:41.120
Enormous amount
of literature that

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.790
shows this investing
in stocks worked great.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.790
This is what the equity
curve looks like, right?

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.720
This is a logarithmic chart
to equalize returns over time.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.700
But again, yellow line, that's
investing in what's expensive.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.770
Not a bright idea.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.815
Black line, buy and hold
of all the countries.

00:26:57.815 --> 00:26:59.940
The blue and red lines are
two different variations

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.898
of buying the cheapest.

00:27:00.898 --> 00:27:03.290
One is you said, you know what?

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.682
It probably makes sense
to invest in the cheapest.

00:27:06.682 --> 00:27:09.140
But only invest in the cheapest
when they are the cheapest.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.510
What if everything is expensive?

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.290
So like, in the late
'90s, for example, right?

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.750
You don't want to be
investing in stocks

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.958
when everything is expensive.

00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:18.790
So we use the absolute
metric caps of around,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.880
I think it was 18 in the book--
maybe it was 20-- to say,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.630
you know what?

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.310
If things get that much, we'll
start to move the cash, right?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.080
And so you'll come with a little
bit less volatile portfolio.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.470
Same returns over
time, but avoid

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.500
some of the big draw downs
and losses of buy and hold.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.200
But what's really
interesting-- and this

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.860
happens a lot in various
fields-- is I have a buddy,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.350
John Bollinger
says, you know, all

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.347
the information is
in the tails, right?

00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:46.680
So the ends of the distribution.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.864
That's when things get
really interesting.

00:27:48.864 --> 00:27:51.030
And so, what we call is--
there's a famous investing

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.705
phrase that says, investing when
there's blood on the streets.

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.080
Hopefully not
literally, but when

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.980
things are really, really bad.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.860
So we call this at a
CAPE ratio below seven,

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.450
which doesn't happen that much.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.910
It's only happened in
the US a couple times.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.347
Future returns are fantastic.

00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:07.555
One, three, five years,
you're compounding your money

00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:09.917
at 20% percent a year.

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:10.750
What's the opposite?

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.710
Bubble, right?

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.670
Where the markets are
really expensive-- over 45.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.170
So that's the peak
of the US, right?

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:21.500
But anyone remembers
back to 2006, 2007,

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.160
if you were investing
then, the BRICs, right?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.817
This expression-- Brazil,
Russia, India, and China.

00:28:26.817 --> 00:28:28.150
That's where you want to invest.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.620
That's where the world's going.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.160
What they didn't mention
was that China and India

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.920
were both trading
at CAPEs above 40.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.121
I think China hit 65, right?

00:28:37.121 --> 00:28:38.870
And so China has had
horrific stock market

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.190
returns since then.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.190
Is anyone talking about
China that much anymore?

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.000
No.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.460
But China is at a
great valuation now.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.340
But this is what
happens over and over.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.120
People are much more interested
in investing here-- they're

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.080
excited because returns have
been great-- then there.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.580
It's really hard to
invest in the low markets.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.910
Part of that is simply
behavioral, right?

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.840
All the news is bad, right?

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.470
The news is usually terrible.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.110
So let's give you
some common examples.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.818
Where are we now?

00:29:07.818 --> 00:29:11.630
I just updated this at
the end of last month.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.860
You look at the left.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.360
The cheapest markets
in the world-- Greece

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.910
had the lowest valuation we've
ever seen at a value of 2

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.060
in the summer of 2012.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.740
Greece is now up 200%.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.710
Their stock market
off the bottom.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.140
Russia hit a value around
five, maybe got down to four

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.700
a couple months ago.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.310
Ireland, Hungary, Austria,
Italy, most of Europe, right?

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.280
But where the
returns are best is

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.490
when things go from truly
horrific to merely less bad.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.471
Russia is a perfect example.

00:29:42.471 --> 00:29:43.970
We've been on TV
the last few months

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.090
pounding the table
for Russia, saying

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.790
Russia is cheap on every
valuation metric we can find,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.390
to which all the TV anchors
say, well, what about Crimea?

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.420
What about Putin?

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.570
What about all these
things that are happening?

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.790
But that's when you
want to be investing.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.287
Sir [INAUDIBLE] famous quote.

00:29:59.287 --> 00:30:01.120
He says, don't ask me
where things are best.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.440
That's the wrong question.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.230
Ask me where things
are the worst.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.660
The challenge with why this
strategy works and will

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.550
continue to work--
imagine going home

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.182
to your wife, your husband,
sister, brother, neighbor,

00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:14.140
and say, you know what?

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.390
I heard this great
presentation today.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.930
I'm putting my money into
Greece and in Russia.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.760
Now, the next four-- the next--
you'll get slapped or divorced

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.650
or what not.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.480
In my industry, you'll
get fired, right,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.820
as a money manager.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:39.570
And it's funny because
the European names--

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.540
the European names don't elicit
as much hatred right now,

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.140
right?

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.350
Most people say Hungary,
Austria, Italy, OK.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.160
Interesting.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.940
You go back a couple years when
the euro was disintegrating--

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.380
no one wanted to be
investing in those countries.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.350
Italy-- second best stock
market in the world this year.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.500
It's up, I think, almost 20%.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.950
So when things-- as
the news flow recedes,

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.620
Russia from the bottom--
here's the dumb things you

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.910
here at the bottom, right?

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.940
US government press secretary
goes to Twitter and says,

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.400
someone asked him about Russia.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.860
And he says, you know what?

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.960
I would be selling Russian
stocks if I were you.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.880
In fact, I would
be shorting them.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.740
This is the press secretary
giving this advice

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.960
to the general public of not
only selling Russian stocks,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.150
but shorting them, OK?

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.450
He's suggesting, first of
all, telling the investment

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.220
public, short anything--
horrific advice.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.245
You can lose your
entire account.

00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:34.870
Talking about shorting a market
that goes up and down 5% a day,

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.515
the volatility is
off the charts.

00:31:36.515 --> 00:31:38.640
And oh, by the way, it's
the second cheapest market

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.320
in the world.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.280
What's happened since then?

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.730
I like to-- not patting
myself on the back,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.410
Russia is up, what
25% from the bottom.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.190
Press secretary no
longer has a job.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.134
I'm not saying
that's why-- related.

00:31:51.134 --> 00:31:52.550
But if you look
at the right side,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.360
these are the most expensive.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.340
I was really unpopular
in the last year.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.210
I give talks in Colombia,
in Bogota, and in Mexico.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.690
And I said, look.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.540
I love your country.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.290
I love the food.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.097
I love the people.

00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:07.680
But your stock market is one of
the most expense in the world.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.150
And Columbia at the time
was in the mid to high 30s.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.890
And their market has
got pounded since then.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.590
Again, I'm only going to
start traveling to countries

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.340
where they're really
cheap now so they'll

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.320
enjoy my message,
say that's great.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.490
Bring us good news.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.334
US is one of the most
expensive in the world, OK?

00:32:24.334 --> 00:32:26.400
The US is not in a bubble.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.320
It's nowhere close.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.320
But returns?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.574
Maybe 5% a year going forward.

00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:33.990
But what's important is even
if you invest in the indexes,

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.000
right-- the broad
foreign developed--

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.520
there's huge dispersion
within those indexes, right?

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.170
So what we talk about is buying
a basket of these countries.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.750
And here's why you need to buy
a basket instead of just one.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.200
This is Greece stock market.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.370
And the black numbers are
the CAPE ratios over time.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.540
Late '90s-- reasonable
CAPE ratio, awesome return.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.940
Market doubled.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.970
150% returns.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.030
Hits a value of 40.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.834
That's bubble territory.

00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:00.500
Massive bear market
around with the rest

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.160
of world-- 2000, 2001, 2002.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.670
Hits a low single digit value.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.170
Great time to be buying.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:07.900
Massive run up again.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.790
Hits a value where
the US is right now.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.940
Not terrible, but then the
Euro crisis 2008 happens.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.470
The challenge here
is what they call

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.220
catching a falling knife, right?

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.210
Where the market is falling.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.680
It's getting
cheaper and cheaper.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.519
But then it proceeds to
get cheaper still, right?

00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:26.560
Once this got to 10, you
would say, that's cheap.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.130
And then you bought it.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:27.840
And it goes to eight.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.510
Then it goes to six.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.385
Then it goes to four.

00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:30.560
Then it goes to two, right?

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.220
So you watched it
continue to get cheaper.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.560
There's a famous
investing joke that says,

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.910
what do you call
market that's down 90%?

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.840
That's a market
that was down 80%,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.010
and then proceeded to
go down 50% more, right?

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.264
The way the math works out.

00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:46.680
And we talked about
this at lunch.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.040
The compounding that
people talk about-- eighth

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.950
wonder the world is
compounding, right?

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.156
Where if you just
invest long enough,

00:33:55.156 --> 00:33:56.280
it works out in your favor.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.580
Well, what they don't talk
about is the opposite.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.370
The bigger hole you get in, the
compounding works against you.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.370
So the kink doesn't
really happen

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.480
until you lose about 10%
to 15% of your money.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.030
You lose 10%, it takes,
what 11 to get back to even?

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.449
You lose 20, it takes 25.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.360
You lose 50, it takes
100% to get back to even.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.909
You lose 75%, it takes
300% to get back to even.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.989
You think 75% is unrealistic?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.130
US had a 90%
drawdown in the '30s.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.610
US has had multiple
50% draw downs.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.150
Every G10 country in the
world has lost at least 2/3

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.030
of its stock market
value at one point.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.179
So go ask someone in Cyprus what
they think about buy and hold

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.184
investing.

00:34:31.184 --> 00:34:33.350
You'll get a very different
perspective than someone

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.380
in the US.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.489
We've been publishing
these values for a while.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.980
This is a good example
of 2013 and where

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.310
the values stood at the time.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.768
I don't expect you
all to see this.

00:34:43.768 --> 00:34:47.190
But again, Columbia was
up at 34, Peru at 34.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.139
Greece, Ireland-- I don't
include the frontier markets

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:50.710
usually.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.389
But we use Argentina because
they're too small to liquid.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.862
But a lot of those names.

00:34:54.862 --> 00:34:55.820
And then what happened?

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.520
Well, had you bought a basket
of the bottom five countries

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.060
or 10 20% returns in 2013.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.350
If you bought the most
expensive, minus 5%

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.000
to minus 18%, right?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.430
So buying expensive stuff--
not a great idea was.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.680
There's two outliers here.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.019
One, cheap country Russia, which
went from seven down to five,

00:35:12.019 --> 00:35:13.310
had negative returns last year?

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.510
And what's the outlier
on the opposite side?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.100
Expensive country that got
more expensive-- the US had

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.760
a monster year last year.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.475
There's nothing that
can stop-- so this

00:35:21.475 --> 00:35:22.850
is one of the
challenges of being

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.460
an investor with a
long term time horizon.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.680
You have to mentally prepare
yourself for the possibility,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.820
however small it may be, that
the US market can decline 80%

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.470
or increase in
value 100%, right?

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.990
Those valuations have
existed in the past-- so,

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.390
from where we are today.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.010
What's the only difference?

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.580
What people are
willing to pay, right?

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.580
That's it.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.140
How much are you willing to pay
for one share of the S&amp;P 500?

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.830
And so both of those
happen in the past.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.270
And most people set up
their investing program

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.199
or how they invest ignoring
both of those possibilities.

00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:56.990
Say, you know what?

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.550
If I just have a long
enough time horizon,

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.640
things are going to be OK.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.520
Can you sit through
a 50% bear market?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.420
Can you sit through an 80%?

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.430
Going back to the statistics
earlier, remember.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.330
People can't.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.230
They buy things here,
they sell things

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.850
there over and over again.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.240
The good news-- I don't want
this to be too depressing.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.890
This is the average
of global valuations.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.140
Generational lows,
single digit CAPE ratios.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.820
Early '80s-- again, best time
to buy in everyone's career.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.860
But expensive things
got expensive.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.430
Late '90s, a special bubble.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.970
Market got hammered,
went back up. '07, right?

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.950
Bubble-- bubble territory again.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.340
Huge bear market.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.990
But most of the world has
lagged the US over the past five

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.490
years.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.296
So we're down in
this cheap territory.

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:39.670
Most of the world's
pretty cheap.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.790
And going back to this
chart, many countries

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.530
are really cheap, all right?

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.840
So moving towards the
left side of this chart

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.770
away from the right side
the chart is important.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.560
Why this matters to you--
where's that piece of paper?

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.180
Did you pass it up to me?

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.530
Oh jeeze, you guys are
even worse than normal.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.100
OK, there's another bias
called over confidence.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.420
And I'm sure this
room has it in spades.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.134
This is why I became a quant
is I read a lot of literature

00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:10.550
on my suggest
behavioral-- there's

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.330
a lot of great behavioral books.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.944
James Montier writes some
of the best there are.

00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:16.860
But to take a little
time to read those books.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.734
Because you'll see a
lot of behavioral bias--

00:37:18.734 --> 00:37:20.174
overconfidence, right?

00:37:20.174 --> 00:37:22.340
More than half this room
thinks they're smarter than

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.731
the other half, better
looking, better drivers, right?

00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:26.105
Statistically,
that's impossible.

00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:29.244
And the same thing
with the population.

00:37:29.244 --> 00:37:30.160
I asked this question.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.826
I've asked it in my
last eight speeches.

00:37:31.826 --> 00:37:35.530
I've gotten the same answer
more or less at every speech.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.040
The average amount
people invest--

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.414
and I'm sure you
circled it here.

00:37:38.414 --> 00:37:40.590
This is, right?

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.100
78% in the US.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.940
That's called home country bias.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.300
That happens in every
country around the world.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.350
Americans invest all
their money in the US.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.852
Italians invest all their
money in Italian stocks.

00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.310
People in Greece
do the same thing.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.490
People in Japan.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.040
That's a terrible idea.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.980
And I'll tell you why.

00:37:58.644 --> 00:37:59.560
It can be a good year.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.930
But in gen-- It
can be a good idea.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.305
In general, it's
a terrible idea.

00:38:02.305 --> 00:38:05.110
The US-- this is global
market capitalization.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.790
What percentage of
all these countries

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.490
are they say of
the entire world?

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.860
US is half.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.324
If you're a vanguard
John Vogel devote, index

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:14.740
through and through,
buy and hold,

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.810
you should only have half
your portfolio in US stocks.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:18.590
No one does.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.350
You go to a financial
advisor, any advisor almost

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.670
on the planet and say,
what do you think?

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.003
How much should I put in the US?

00:38:23.003 --> 00:38:25.280
It's almost always 70%,
which is the broad average

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.405
for the country-- not just
retail, but professional

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:28.929
as well.

00:38:28.929 --> 00:38:30.970
Same thing happens in
every other country, right?

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.020
And it's more insidious
in other countries.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.130
Because often, they're a
tiny part of market cap.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.230
So, Canada, you're 4%.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.510
But you're putting
70% in Canada?

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.080
You're getting no exposure
to the global world.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.350
Think back to the Japan
example and why this is so bad.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.340
And this lines up
the two bubbles just

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.420
to show you how bad
the Japanese just

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.580
dwafted our cute '90s
internet bubble, right?

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.220
This is kind of months to the
peak. we just lined them up.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.010
But this goes to show that
this massive bubble-- look

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.000
how long it took Japan
to work that off, right?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.320
It only got cheap in
the 2010, 2011, 2012.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.640
Japan in the late '80s was
half of world market cap.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.180
Same as we are today, right?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.860
That's hard to think.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.930
Those negative return
for the next 20 years

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.150
were a massive drag
on your portfolio,

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.760
right, on a global
portfolio, which

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.295
is what market cap
weighting does.

00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:20.670
Market cap weighting
means you're

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.056
investing based on
the broad portfolio.

00:39:23.056 --> 00:39:24.930
You invest the most in
the biggest companies.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.300
Right now, that's what Exxon,
Apple-- certainly up there.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.474
But usually, the only metric
they're using is price.

00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:32.640
They're not using valuation.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.400
They're just, what's biggest?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.170
Well, that's a terrible thing.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.610
This is a chart of the S&amp;P 500.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.590
This is the blue line.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.970
This asks a simple question.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.670
What if you invest in the
biggest stock, biggest company

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.150
in the US when each
one held the Crown?

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.620
So, familiar names-- Apple,
Cisco, Exxon, GE, IBM,

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.950
Microsoft, Walmart.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.416
It's a horrific thing to do.

00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.040
Look at how much
worse the returns are.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.190
Let's think about why.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.150
It's simple capitalism, OK?

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.650
When you're big,
when you're Google,

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.820
you have a huge
target on your back.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.480
Why?

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.950
Well, everyone else would
like to make money too.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:06.450
And they see how
successful you are.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.380
So it's simple competition.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.985
There's a study that came
out-- some friends down

00:40:11.985 --> 00:40:13.909
in So Cal-- research
affiliates that said,

00:40:13.909 --> 00:40:15.700
what happens when you
invest in the largest

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.090
company in the market?

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.690
One of your future speakers
actually did a study on this

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.320
as well-- Munish [? Perbri. ?]
He'll be talking, I think,

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:22.820
next month.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.278
He said, what
happens if you invest

00:40:24.278 --> 00:40:25.970
in the largest
company in the market?

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.570
That company
underperforms the market

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.190
by 3% a year for the
next 10 years, all right?

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.600
Big time out-performance.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.790
Happens in every sector.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.290
The largest stock
in every sector

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.950
underperforms the market in
the next 10 years by 3% a year.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.910
So getting-- and the
reason being, again,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:43.730
going back to Japan, market cap
weighting over weights expense

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.804
countries and
companies, all right?

00:40:45.804 --> 00:40:47.470
So because the reason
they're expensive,

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.185
there's only one
variable, which is size.

00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.810
Typically, the biggest
is most expense.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.030
So it's not always the case.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.250
Right now, for
example, small caps.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.716
I would not touch them
with a 10 foot pole in US.

00:40:56.716 --> 00:40:58.340
They're the most
expensive they've ever

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.130
been relative to
large cap stocks.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.256
So I would highly avoid.

00:41:02.256 --> 00:41:04.630
But again, the US isn't always
one of the most expensive.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:05.460
This shows us right now.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.450
Black line is the US.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.390
Red line is average
CAPE valuations.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.544
Yellow is cheapest and
blue is most expensive.

00:41:11.544 --> 00:41:12.960
So there was times
when the US was

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.559
one of the cheapest
countries, right?

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:16.350
In the early '80s--
best time to be buying.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.250
And there's times when
it's been relatively

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.375
cheap to the rest of world.

00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:21.590
This, you could kind of
use this is a guide saying,

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.440
are we cheap relative to
the world or are we not?

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.940
And we're right now.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.273
We're one of the most expensive.

00:41:25.273 --> 00:41:29.310
So not-- a great time to be
getting away from the US.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.880
Some other questions
I think I'm going

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.757
to zoom through in
the next five minutes.

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.340
Does this work with
sectors in the US?

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:35.950
It does.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:39.790
Robert Shiller has published
extensively on this.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.170
Does it make sense to add
some other things like trend?

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.060
We talked at lunch about
my favorite section

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.260
is value and trend.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.190
So when something is cheap,
it's starting to go up, right?

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.320
Italy is a great example now.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.356
Brazil maybe turning
the corner here.

00:41:53.356 --> 00:41:55.200
But we're going to
shift here real quick

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.800
and talk about something because
this is a engineer focused

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.810
crowd, because you have
an appreciation for data,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.770
this is interesting
topic and probably

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.900
an area for study
for those of you

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.749
who are thus
interested in stocks.

00:42:07.749 --> 00:42:09.790
Going back to what we were
talking about earlier,

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.390
than most people stink
at stock picking.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.348
They're horrific at it.

00:42:12.348 --> 00:42:15.550
They're really, really bad for
a lot of emotional reasons.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.800
But it's a tough game you're
playing because you're up

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.820
against the smartest
investors in the world.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.320
So these hedge funds
that have staff

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.124
of 50 people that are
out there paying them

00:42:24.124 --> 00:42:25.540
the top money in
the world, that's

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.748
who you're competing against.

00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:30.460
It's not the guys on the
internet chat rooms, right?

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.464
But the math of it is difficult.

00:42:32.464 --> 00:42:34.630
There's a paper called "The
Capitalism Distribution"

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.840
published by some friends
of mine that show just how

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.240
difficult is the average stock.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.799
It's 2/3 of stocks.

00:42:40.799 --> 00:42:42.840
If you just picked it out
of a hat, 2/3 of stocks

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.230
underperform the index.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.710
Because when you
own an index, you

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.720
are guaranteed to
own the winners.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.440
The losers simply
go down to value

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.600
and they go out of business.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.850
One of the reasons why stock
investing works is you're

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:56.850
just investing in capitalism.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.370
You're investing
in business, right?

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.445
But 2/3, if you're just
picking out of a hat,

00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:02.820
if you pick the company out
of the "Wall Street Journal,"

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.986
chances are, you're going
to underperform the index.

00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:07.390
So the math is is already
working against you.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.290
Half of stocks are losers
over their lifetime, right?

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.377
But it's the tails, right?

00:43:12.377 --> 00:43:14.460
Going back to earlier,
it's the tails that matter.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.640
It's the few Googles,
Apples, Walmarts

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.880
of the world that account
for the vast majority

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.600
of your gains.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.670
So a question I asked--
when I was in college,

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.090
I said I meet all these--
there's all these hedge fund

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.390
managers, tehse interesting
guys that I said, well,

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.930
why wouldn't I just outsource
this to Warren Buffett?

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.721
He's clearly much better
at this than I am.

00:43:34.721 --> 00:43:37.265
He's been managing money
forever incredibly successfully,

00:43:37.265 --> 00:43:38.890
one of the richest
people in the world.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.680
Why wouldn't I just outsource
my stock picking to him?

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.130
And what most people don't
know is that you can.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.230
The SEC requires that any
institution over $100 million

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.110
has to publish their holdings.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.660
It's every quarter.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.450
There's a 45 day delay.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.850
But they are available
online, all right?

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.060
So I said, why wouldn't I
just invest what Buffet buys?

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.310
And being an engineering,
being a quant-- this is late

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:06.680
'90s-- I said, I can't do this
until I work with the data.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.570
And what we found
largely is you can.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.990
If you bought Buffett's top
10 stock picks, updated every

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.850
quarter when the
values are public--

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.580
and there's now an academic
paper that validates this--

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.770
you would have beaten
the market by-- well,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.360
this goes back to
'99-- 7% a year.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.430
That is a monster number.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.240
That would outperform every
possible mutual fund out there.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.060
The paper takes it
back to the '70s, finds

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.060
similar outperformance.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.800
This is a local company I helped
co-found many years ago called

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.540
Alpha Clone that does
a lot of the analytics

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.730
with these hedge fund.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.710
Now, it's important when you're
focusing on these funds--

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.860
and this requires a little
bit of demand expertise

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.360
to at least kind
of know what's some

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.852
of these funds do--
you want funds that

00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:48.560
are stock pickers,
that are not shorting,

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.990
that don't have
too much turnover.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.120
They're not active traders.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.280
They're not doing anything
weird like arbitrage.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.900
They're not doing
futures or derivatives.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.380
But in general, stock pickers
long term time horizon,

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.630
this works great.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.150
You have a lot of benefits.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:05.830
You can control the
holdings yourself.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.630
There's no fraud.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.171
You don't have to
lock up your money.

00:45:08.171 --> 00:45:10.360
And the biggest one--
there's no two in 20 fees.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.340
There's a number
of examples where

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.192
these what we call clone
portfolios just by investing

00:45:15.192 --> 00:45:17.150
in what's available
online-- you can go to SEC.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.190
There's lot of websites
that attract this-- Guru

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:24.440
Investor, Insider Monkey-- these
underlying clones will end up

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.820
beating the manager.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.020
Because the manager
is charging 2%

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.320
management fee,
20% in performance.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.370
So you actually can do
better than they can.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.510
Why any institution in
the world doesn't do this

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.980
rather than investing in
managers, I don't know.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.314
My fourth book will probably
be on this topic coming out

00:45:39.314 --> 00:45:40.271
in the next few months.

00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:40.860
So stay tuned.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.020
But another one of my
favorites to watch--

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.710
Seth [? Carmen, ?] Baupost.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.640
Any time you could watch
him, beats the market.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.635
What is that, 9%?

00:45:50.635 --> 00:45:51.880
10% a year?

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.640
And one of the nice thing
that the views are often

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.730
truly variant.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.420
Some of these names they're
picking, even if you don't

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.970
follow them blindly but use them
as what we call an idea farm--

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.990
so a place to go
look for new ideas

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.310
for stocks-- this is much
better than going and asking

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:08.774
your broker for ideas or
your next door neighbor.

00:46:08.774 --> 00:46:10.440
Appaloosa-- another
one of our favorites

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.080
has absolutely just
destroyed the market by,

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.910
what, 18% a year?

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.850
David Tepper-- that's
one of the reasons

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.250
he now owns part
of the Steelers.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.030
And then, of course, a
local shop, ValueAct,

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.330
was in the "Wall Street
Journal" last weekend.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.320
Beats the market by 14% a year.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.640
And it's something like six
of the last seven years.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.811
So these are all great
places to look for research.

00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:35.935
One last slide and then
I'm going to one this down.

00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:40.400
We talked about this
at lunch a little bit.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.670
And this is one of
the biggest challenges

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.000
of investing is that,
going back to the religion

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.380
and thinking about politics,
is that people often

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.110
have their approach, right?

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.470
How many investors do you
know say, you know what?

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.750
I'm investing for income.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.990
I'm a dividend person.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.872
This is how so
many retirees say,

00:46:54.872 --> 00:46:56.580
I'm buying high dividend
stocks because I

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.720
get these checks
I can cash, right?

00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.850
Dividend payments.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:00.570
Can't fake that.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.570
Can't fraud that.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.510
Well, dividend stocks,
what this shows

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.770
is that the blue line is
dividend high yield-- if you

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.940
bought a basket of high
yielding dividend stocks--

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.140
and it goes back to
the '60s-- the reason

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.483
investing in dividend
stocks historically works

00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:13.000
is because you're buying
value companies that

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.700
are cheaper than
the overall market.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.310
There's reasons often
because they're more leverage

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.280
and they're usually in
a little more trouble.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.790
But in general, they're
cheap stocks, right?

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.960
So historically,
high divident stocks

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.050
have traded about a 30%
discount to the overall market.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.180
So by buying dividend stocks,
you're getting value, right?

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.876
But it changes over time.

00:47:31.876 --> 00:47:34.500
This is what people call waiting
for the fat pitch in baseball,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:34.999
right?

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.034
Not swing it when things
are balls but right

00:47:37.034 --> 00:47:37.700
down the middle.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.276
Well, what happened?

00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:40.650
Dividend stocks
were the cheapest

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.790
they've ever been in
the late '90s relative

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:43.810
to the overall market.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.310
Why?

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.910
Well, everyone wanted Pets.com.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:47.790
They want all these
internet companies,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.110
these huge market cap
Ciscos of the world.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.264
They got incredibly,
incredibly expensive, right?

00:47:53.264 --> 00:47:54.680
So that was the
best possible time

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.530
to be buying dividend stocks.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.863
No one's talking about dividend
stocks in the late '90s.

00:47:57.863 --> 00:47:58.960
Massive returns.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.770
Dividend stocks didn't even
have a 2000, 2003 bear market.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.170
Sailed right through it.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.820
But what happens when you're
in an environment where bonds

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.450
yield 2 and 1/2, US stocks
are going to do maybe 4%,

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.410
people are looking for yield?

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.020
Massive amounts of money
flows into these high yielding

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:16.520
stocks.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.420
What does that do?

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.850
Well, it totally changes
their composition.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.610
High yielding
dividends stocks now

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.650
for the first time in
history traded a premium

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.210
to the overall market.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.270
They're more expensive
than the overall market.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.370
You don't have to believe me.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.700
You can go to Morningstar, type
in your favorite dividend fund,

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.080
look at all the
valuation metrics.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.288
And they're more expensive
buying the overall market.

00:48:33.288 --> 00:48:35.570
So there's an entire
group of people

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.399
that will be buying these
stock the last few years

00:48:38.399 --> 00:48:40.440
and wondering why in the
world their portfolio is

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.090
underperforming
the market so much.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.540
And it's because they're buying
something expensive, which

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.410
is an example of investor
behavior totally distorting

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:50.560
something that historically
has worked great.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.540
The new fad is low
volatility investing.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.320
People investing in
low volatile stocks

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.004
historically have
beaten the market.

00:48:56.004 --> 00:48:56.670
What's happened?

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.584
Massive amount of
money's gone into those.

00:48:59.584 --> 00:49:01.000
Those are also
more expensive now.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.499
If I had to do anything, I would
avoid high dividend stocks,

00:49:03.499 --> 00:49:05.689
small cap stocks as well.

00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:06.980
So I'm going to wind this down.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.271
Again, this wasn't theoretical.

00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:09.710
We manage public funds.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.450
I have 100% of my
net worth invested

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.860
in-- Global Value is the
one that goes and buys

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.270
these 10 countries.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.341
But we'll be launching
lots of new ideas as well.

00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:19.840
So you have some
good ideas, please,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.680
please let me know afterwards.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.330
Here's my contact information--
phone number, work.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.310
That's not cellphone.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.090
Blog, email address-- feel
free to email me for a book.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.150
And I think we got time.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.629
I'm opening it up
for questions now.

00:49:32.629 --> 00:49:33.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.570
So it seems to me that
the global CAPE ratio

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.730
is kind of correlated over time.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:44.649
So as a strategy, should you
buy low CAPE ratio countries

00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:46.565
and also short-sell high
CAPE ratio countries?

00:49:46.565 --> 00:49:47.890
MEBANE FABER: Good. question.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.080
The question is, if
you didn't hear it,

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.070
if it's a good idea
to buy the cheapest,

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:55.160
why not also short
what's most expensive?

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.490
It's really hard to do.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.880
If there is-- that
is what's essentially

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.150
called long shorter market
neutral strategy, right?

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.720
Where you want to
essentially arbitrage

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.540
the expensive stuff
and the cheap stuff.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.260
The problem is, over
time, that works.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.550
It works great.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.120
But there's almost
always large draw downs,

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.500
large losses in the meantime.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.740
And let me give
you examples why.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.920
2008, if you're doing
a market neutral

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.870
approach, the expense
of stocks just

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.190
get hammered all
the way down, right?

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.850
And what happens at the bottom?

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.490
When you have it when the rally
comes, what rallies the most?

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:33.740
It's the junk, right?

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.804
It's the junkie companies that
are now trading at $1.80 or $4.

00:50:38.804 --> 00:50:40.470
And all of a sudden,
you're short those.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.930
And then you lose
80% on the upside

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.760
even though your
longs only did 30%.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.172
So it's really, really hard.

00:50:46.172 --> 00:50:47.880
There's some things
you can do-- and this

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.340
is getting a little more
complicated-- such as,

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.850
if you're shorting,
you short less

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.380
the more the market goes down.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.800
So you take chips off the table.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.180
So you say, it
doesn't make sense

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.550
to be shorting something
if its already down 50%.

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.260
It can't go that much farther.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.810
A country's not going to go to
zero for the most part, right?

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.840
So you could have a short
exposure like right now.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.210
But as those countries go
down, reduce the short exposure

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:12.900
over time.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.420
But it's tough to do.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.660
And again, two other caviar
to what we talked about today.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.420
One, you only need to update
this about once a year.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.510
A deep value approach
needs time to work.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.670
The more you update it,
the worse it's going to do,

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.130
all right?

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:29.790
In two, going along the
lines of what you're saying,

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.290
what's important
about this strategy

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:32.910
is not just that you're
buying the cheapest.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.576
You're also avoiding
the most expensive.

00:51:34.576 --> 00:51:37.190
So avoidance, I
think, is just fine.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:40.080
Shorting, unlike
the press secretary,

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.640
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.020
OK the question is, US has
exposure to a globalize world,

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:47.740
right?

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:53.080
Roughly what, half of the US
revenues come from abroad?

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.480
But vice versa-- as the
world gets more globalized,

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.540
much of the countries abroad--
China, Mexico, Canada-- all

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.420
have exposure to
the US too, right?

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.690
So our opinion is that we
just assume correlations

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.920
of one-- very high correlation
of stock markets, right?

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.030
So in that world, it comes
to a more simple question.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.330
It's not where
revenues come from,

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.420
but where is it just cheapest?

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.400
So you're getting
foreign exposure--

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.230
so you can get foreign
exposure in the US at half.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.440
Or you can get foreign exposure
elsewhere for much cheaper.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.940
So it's more important to
us in a globalized world

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.300
just to buy what's cheapest.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.310
If the opportunity
set is similar

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.860
and they're highly correlated,
which they are-- I mean,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.401
it's not one.

00:52:33.401 --> 00:52:36.700
But global stocks in general
are up around 70%, 80%.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.280
That's great.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.610
Because then the
valuation means even more.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.880
AUDIENCE: When you're looking
at returns of global stocks,

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.510
are you taking into account
currency fluctuations?

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.010
MEBANE FABER: Oh, I knew that
question-- the question always

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.509
comes up.

00:52:49.509 --> 00:52:50.270
Good question.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.550
Question is, what
about currencies?

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.010
And this is quite
a simple sounding

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.180
question but a
much longer answer.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.600
When you're think
about currencies,

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:06.972
there's a quote that says,
currencies aren't-- currencies

00:53:06.972 --> 00:53:07.680
aren't difficult.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.160
They're just confusing.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.060
And Americans are the
worst at it, right?

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.851
Most people, when they
think of currencies,

00:53:12.851 --> 00:53:14.880
they think of, all right.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.870
The peso is going down.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.820
It's now cheaper to go
buy steaks in Argentina.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.137
Or maybe it's getting expensive
to go skiing in Europe.

00:53:21.137 --> 00:53:21.720
And that's it.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.270
They don't think about
them in terms of investing.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:25.830
They do have a very real impact.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.740
Over time, currency
real returns--

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.800
because currencies adjust
for inflation-- over time,

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.060
currency real
returns are stable,

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.167
keyword being over time.

00:53:35.167 --> 00:53:37.000
In any given year, you
could have a currency

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.260
like Japan last year move
20%, 30%, which is a lot.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.490
So I'm actually, if you
have no value added way

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.954
to predict currencies, which
I would argue most don't, I

00:53:47.954 --> 00:53:50.370
would argue you have to choose
one side or the other year.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.800
You're either agnostic and
you say, you know what?

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.424
I'm going to do it
from US dollar base.

00:53:53.424 --> 00:53:56.330
Or you hedge all your
currency exposure.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.060
But you pick one
and stick with it.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.200
And over time, they'll
have the same performance.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.590
And then a follow up
is, can you do things

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.610
in currencies the
same way you do

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.810
in stocks and bonds that
have outsized returns?

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:12.900
So yes, you can actually index
currencies with basic value

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.180
trend, momentum
carry strategies that

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.410
perform great and don't
correlate to stocks.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:21.610
But that's the point of a
whole other two hour talk.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.350
So you guys have
me back in 2015.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:25.010
We'll talk about currency.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.970
So I'm agnostic.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.640
But it makes a big
difference in the short term.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.125
AUDIENCE: In terms of
the current valuation,

00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:34.790
it seems to me that Warren
Buffett, Joe Greenblad and also

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.030
Howard [INAUDIBLE] post--
I think all of them

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.940
said it's [INAUDIBLE] right now?

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.890
And only one of
note that is kind

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:48.440
of bearish in the long
term is [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.540
So can you reconcile with them?

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.510
Because if Warren
Buffett and Joe

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:57.710
Greenblad those said that it's
[INAUDIBLE] it's hard for me

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.460
to think that it's expensive.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.840
MEBANE FABER: Well,
if you use Buffett's

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.640
own favorite valuation metric,
which is market cap to GNP,

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.970
stocks are very expensive.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.690
You also always have
to ask why people

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:13.020
have the opinion they do.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.590
If you're a money manager and
have all your money invested

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:20.600
long stocks in the US, are you
going to say they're expensive?

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.780
Probably not.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.500
So it's challenging.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.196
And going back to the
intro of the speech,

00:55:27.196 --> 00:55:29.070
I think you should ignore
all of them, right?

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.570
Everyone's going
to have an opinion.

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:31.896
Just like, you know.

00:55:31.896 --> 00:55:33.494
A guy or girl walks by.

00:55:33.494 --> 00:55:35.410
10 people are going to
have different opinions

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:38.020
and say, well, I like
him, I don't like him.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.190
He's attractive, he's not.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.982
Whatever it may be.

00:55:39.982 --> 00:55:41.564
But that's what makes
a market, right?

00:55:41.564 --> 00:55:43.330
There's someone who's
bullish on US stocks

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.410
in 1999 the same as
someone who is bearish.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.612
So that's why it's
important to me

00:55:48.612 --> 00:55:49.820
to have an objective measure.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.820
I don't care what it is.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.910
You can use price, sales price,
book price, cash flow, GDP,

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:54.860
enterprise, EBITDA.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.500
By the way, all of those
say US stocks are expensive.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.492
There's not one that doesn't.

00:55:59.492 --> 00:56:01.200
But you have to have
an objective metric.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.620
Otherwise, you're just-- what
we have found in the literature,

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.650
and this applies to
almost every field,

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.565
is experts are horrific at
forecasting, including our US

00:56:11.565 --> 00:56:13.190
government, the
Federal Reserve, right?

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.520
They are horrific at
forecasting the future.

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.500
But if you have an
objective metric and say,

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.140
all right, stocks very well
could go up 50% from here.

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.450
But all that's doing is
mortgaging the future.

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:25.025
So it's unexciting
to say, I think

00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:26.400
stocks are going
to do 4% a year.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.233
That's not terrible.

00:56:27.233 --> 00:56:29.340
It's better than
2 and 1/2% bond.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.350
But is it worth taking the risk?

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.740
I would much rather invest
in the really cheap stuff,

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.470
most of which happens to
be in Europe right now.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.890
So as I said on Twitter,
cheer for the US on Sunday,

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:40.375
but buy Portuguese stocks.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.580
AUDIENCE: So how do you
avoid the value trap?

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.650
For example, if Greece
had defaulted an exited

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:52.124
from the euro, even buying at
two might have been expensive.

00:56:52.124 --> 00:56:54.040
MEBANE FABER: How do you
avoid the value trap?

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.170
Well, question is,
how do you avoid

00:56:58.170 --> 00:56:59.670
buying a falling
knife and something

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:01.000
it's cheap getting cheaper?

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.810
And there's a couple
ways to lessen

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.580
the impact of it,
the first being,

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.470
diversify and buy a basket
of 10 countries, right?

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.210
So, we own Czechoslovakia,
lot of those countries

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.590
we talked about--
Brazil, Russia.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:14.715
One may be doing poorly,
another one's-- hopefully,

00:57:14.715 --> 00:57:16.798
that's-- same thing as you
buy a basket of stocks.

00:57:16.798 --> 00:57:17.900
Helps diversify the risk.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.330
Doesn't totally diversify it.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.621
Because right now, for example,
most of those countries

00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:23.240
are in Europe, in
emerging Europe.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:28.470
So you're getting exposure
that very well may do poorly.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:32.350
Another way to do it is
having a long enough horizon.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:36.660
Give it a number of years
to be able to recover.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.430
And that's a big key with
buying the really cheap stuff.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.600
It's hard to watch
something go down.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.940
The last way is
to-- for those who

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.370
have followed my
research for a long time,

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.850
know that we write a lot
about global maccarone trends.

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.840
And so another way is use
trend following metrics, right,

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.264
which would help you
say, all right, I'm

00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:57.680
going to buy this
something cheap,

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.960
but only once it starts going
back up and has a nice trend.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.447
And then you still have an
objective buy and sell rule.

00:58:03.447 --> 00:58:05.280
You buy when it's above
the long term trend.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.620
You sell when it's below.

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.130
Historically, that
doesn't add to returns.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:13.290
But it vastly reduces the
drawdown and volatility.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.160
So my favorite intersection
would be value and momentum.

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.080
So buying what's cheap,
but also going up.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.680
So there's a number
of ways to try

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.980
to minimize the
damage it can do.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:25.630
But it's part of
buying what's cheap

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:32.210
is you're not ever
missing all the risk.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:35.380
AUDIENCE: So say you've decided
to invest in certain countries.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.972
How do you determine what
to buy in that country?

00:58:37.972 --> 00:58:39.430
MEBANE FABER: So
the simplest would

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.410
be to buy the market
cap weighted index.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.305
Highly liquid companies.

00:58:43.305 --> 00:58:44.930
We go a step further,
which we actually

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.710
didn't publish in our book.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.310
And out of the 30 biggest
companies in that country,

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.560
we buy the 10 cheapest.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.700
Use a bunch of just
different valuation metrics.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.830
So it's almost like a
dogs of the Dow approach.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.625
So our [? ETF, ?]
for example, will

00:58:57.625 --> 00:59:00.570
own about 100 stocks
in those countries.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.540
That adds about
another percent return

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.600
on top of just buying
the market cap.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.891
Because you're getting away
from market cap in general.

00:59:07.891 --> 00:59:09.680
You're buying the
worst of the worst.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.220
But as the individual
investor, it's

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.840
really challenging to buy
individual foreign stocks

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.870
in general for a
big enough portfolio

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:19.420
to diversify 100 stocks
in all these countries

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.082
around the world.

00:59:21.082 --> 00:59:22.970
And it's a huge pain
with taxes, too.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:26.570
So one way is to buy
country funds like ETFs.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.390
Even if you don't buy
ours, you can buy-- just

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:30.840
moving away from
the US in general

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.296
I think is a great first step.

00:59:33.296 --> 00:59:34.170
Thanks for having me.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.500
I'll stick around
for a few minutes.
