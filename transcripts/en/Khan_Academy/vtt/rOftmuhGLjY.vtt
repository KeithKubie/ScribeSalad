00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.323
Voiceover: We've been given

00:00:01.323 --> 00:00:03.211
some interesting information here

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.336
about the functions f, g, and h.

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:07.874
For f, they tell us for given values of x

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.420
what f of x is equal to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.725
and what f prime of x is equal to.

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:14.074
Then they defined g of x for us

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:16.533
in terms of this kind of
absolute value expression.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.865
Then they define h of x for us,

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.832
in terms of both f of x and g of x.

00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:27.094
What we're curious about
is what is the derivative

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:35.018
with respect to x, of h of
x at x is equal to nine.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.350
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.876
and think about it on your own

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.605
before I work through it.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.739
Let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.094
Another way just to get
familiar with the notation

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.084
of writing this, the derivative of h of x

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:50.214
with respect to x at x equals nine.

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:56.243
This is equivalent to h,
we need that blue color,

00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:59.465
it is equivalent to h prime

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.595
and the prime signifies that
we're taking the derivative.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:09.200
H prime of x, when x equals nine

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.664
so h prime of nine is what this really is.

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:15.566
Actually I'm going to do
this in a different color.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:19.659
This is h prime of nine.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.683
Let's think about what that is.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.136
Let's take the derivative of both sides

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.048
of this expression

00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:27.300
to figure out what the derivative
with respect to x of h is.

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:33.198
We get a derivative, I'll
do that same white color.

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:41.287
A derivative with respect to x of h of x

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:46.389
is going to be equal to the
derivative with respect to x

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.578
of all of this business.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:50.457
I could actually just,
well I'll just rewrite it.

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:58.130
Three times f of x, plus two times g of x.

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:01.000
Now this right over here,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.609
the derivative of the sum of two terms

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.228
that's going to be the same thing

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:08.869
as the sum of the derivatives
of each of the terms.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.169
This is going to be the same thing

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.593
as the derivative with respect to x

00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:15.625
of three times, I'll write
that a little bit neater.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:22.283
Three times f of x, plus the
derivative with respect to x

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:27.584
of two times g of x.

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.538
Now the derivative of a number

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:33.489
or I guess you could say a
scaling factor times a function.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.514
The derivative of a
scalar times the function

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:37.219
is the same thing as a scalar times

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.541
the derivative of the function.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.703
What does that mean?

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:43.114
Well that just means that this
first term right over here

00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:45.083
that's going to be equivalent to

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:49.493
three times the derivative
with respect to x

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:53.803
of f, of our f of x,

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.997
plus this part over here
is the same thing as two.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:02.400
Okay, make sure I don't
run out of space here,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.251
plus two times the
derivative with respect to x.

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:13.715
The derivative with
respect to x of g of x.

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:18.440
Derivative of h with respect to x

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.987
is equal to three times the derivative

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:21.453
of f with respect to x,

00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:24.143
plus two times the derivative
of g with respect to x.

00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:27.427
If we want to write it in this
kind of prime notation here,

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:33.654
we could rewrite it as
h prime of x is equal to

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:35.616
three times f prime of x,

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:39.646
so this part right over here

00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:41.932
that is the same thing as f prime of x.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:51.655
It's three times f prime of x,
plus two times g prime of x.

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:54.726
Once you are more fluent
with this property,

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.210
the derivative of the sum of two things

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.699
is the sum of the derivatives.

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.820
The derivative of a scalar times something

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.006
is the same thing as a
scalar times the derivative

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:02.898
of that something.

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:06.543
You really could have
gone straight from here

00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:09.043
to here, pretty quickly.

00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:10.943
Now why is this interesting,

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.029
well now we can evaluate this function

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.792
when x is equal to nine.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:18.615
H prime of nine is the same thing

00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:21.020
as three times f prime of nine,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.493
plus two times g prime of nine.

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.839
Now what is f prime of nine?

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.343
The derivative of our function f

00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:29.711
when x is equal to nine.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.076
Well they tell us, when
x is equal to nine,

00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:33.610
f of nine is one

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.872
but more importantly f
prime of nine is three.

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:41.445
This part right over here
evaluates that part's three.

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.797
What's g prime of nine?

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:47.844
Let's look at this function
a little bit more closely.

00:04:47.844 --> 00:04:51.065
There's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:52.523
Actually let's try to graph it,

00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:53.945
now I think that could be interesting.

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:56.680
Just to visualize what's going on here.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.217
Let's say that's our y-axis

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:03.474
and do this right over here is our x-axis.

00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:07.131
Now when does an absolute
value function like this,

00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:09.048
when is this going to hit a minimum point?

00:05:09.048 --> 00:05:12.154
Well the absolute value of something

00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:13.969
is always going to be non-negative.

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.793
It hits a minimum point when
this thing is equal to zero.

00:05:18.793 --> 00:05:20.514
Well when is this thing equal to zero?

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:22.816
When x equals one, this
thing is equal to zero.

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:25.848
We hit a minimum point
when x is equal to one,

00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:28.602
and when x equals one, this term is zero

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.024
absolute value of zero, zero.

00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:31.857
G of one is one.

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:34.662
We have this point right over there.

00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:36.659
Now what happens after that?

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.473
What happens for x greater than one?

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:44.338
Actually let me write this down.

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:47.547
G of x is equal to,

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:50.178
and in general whenever
you have an absolute value,

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:52.642
a relatively simple absolute
value function like this

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:54.442
you could think of it,
you could break it up

00:05:54.442 --> 00:05:55.774
into two function

00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:57.392
or you could think about this function

00:05:57.392 --> 00:05:58.607
over different intervals

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:00.777
when the absolute value is non-negative

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.530
and when the absolute value is negative.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.923
When the absolute value is non-negative

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:09.614
that's when x is greater
than or equal to zero.

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.162
When the absolute value is non-negative,

00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:15.105
if you're taking the absolute
value of a non-negative number

00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:16.649
that is just going to be itself.

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:17.760
The absolute value of zero, zero.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.896
Absolute value of one is one.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.507
The absolute value of
a hundred is a hundred.

00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:23.242
Then you could ignore the absolute value

00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.276
for x is greater than or equal to,

00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:26.806
not greater than or equal to zero,

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:30.810
for x is greater than or equal to one.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.232
X is greater than or equal to one,

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:36.056
this thing right over
here is non-negative.

00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:38.777
It will just evaluate to x minus one.

00:06:38.777 --> 00:06:41.547
This is going to be x minus one plus one.

00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:44.715
Which is the same thing as just x,

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:46.694
minus one plus one, they just cancel out.

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:52.786
Now when this term right
over here is negative

00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:59.957
and that's going to happen
for x is less than one.

00:06:59.957 --> 00:07:01.822
Well then the absolute value

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:03.517
is going to be the opposite of it.

00:07:03.517 --> 00:07:05.104
You give me the absolute
value of a negative number

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:06.553
that's going to be the opposite.

00:07:06.553 --> 00:07:08.794
Absolute value of negative
eight is positive eight.

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:11.789
It's going to be that the
negative of x minus one

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.696
is one minus x, plus one.

00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:21.300
Or we could say two minus x.

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.041
For x is greater or equal to one,

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.284
we would look at this expression,

00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:27.948
now what's the slope of that?

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.959
Well the slope of that is one.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:32.166
We're going to have a
curve that looks like

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:34.414
or a line I guess we could
say that looks like this.

00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:40.013
For all x is greater than or equal to one.

00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:41.499
The important thing, remember,

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:44.606
we're going to think about
the slope of the tangent line

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:46.404
when we think about the derivative of g.

00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:47.779
Slope is equal to one.

00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:51.587
For x less than one or our slope now,

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:53.190
if we look right over here

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.682
our slope is negative one.

00:07:57.682 --> 00:07:59.373
It's going to look like this.

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:03.682
It's going to look like that.

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:05.833
For the pointing question,

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:07.848
if we're thinking about g prime of nine

00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:09.538
so nine is some place out here,

00:08:09.538 --> 00:08:11.825
so what is g prime of nine?

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.704
G prime of nine, let me make it clear,

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:15.954
this graph right over here,

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.521
this is the graph of g of x

00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:21.145
or we could say y, this is
the graph y equals g of x.

00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:24.306
Y is equal to g of x.

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:26.266
What is g prime of nine?

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:29.847
Well that's the slope
when x is equal to nine.

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:32.202
The slope is going to be equal to one.

00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:37.780
G prime of nine is one.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.725
What does this evaluate to?

00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:41.785
This is going to be three times three,

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:44.052
so this part right over here is nine

00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:51.084
plus two times one, plus
two, which is equal to 11.

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:54.384
The slope of the tangent line of h

00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.846
when x is equal to nine is 11.
