00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.170
How long was that?!

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.170
He breathers, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.830
Breathing is a reflex, and we do it about
19,000 times a day without even thinking.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.840
But when we hold our breath, or our breathing
is cut off, say by plunging a little too far

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.540
into the deep-end, a few things happen in
our body.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.590
Please, don’t try this at home.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.720
We breathe to take in oxygen, which is used
to power our cells so they get energy.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.680
In this process, the cells release carbon
dioxide, which we breath out.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.050
When you hold your breath, residual carbon
dioxide that would ordinarily be exhaled starts

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.820
to accumulate in your body.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.820
Your brain senses that it needs oxygen, and
when you can’t take it in, the buildup starts

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.820
to become painful.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.450
First, you’ll feel a burning in your lungs,
then, after more time, involuntary and unbearably

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.590
painful spasms in your diaphragm and the muscles
around your ribs, along with lightheadedness.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.829
The thing is, you won’t die just from holding
your breath alone.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.680
If you hold your breath long enough to lose
consciousness, your autonomic nervous system,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.280
which regulates your breathing, blood pressure,
and other automatic functions, would kick

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.420
back in to get you breathing again.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.179
Of course, this assumes that you aren’t
underwater and are able to breathe in.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.979
If you do hold your breath underwater, your
body also experiences what’s called the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.869
mammalian diving reflex.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.549
It tries to preserve oxygen for its most important
organs, like the brain and the heart, by slowing

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.439
down your heart rate and reducing blood flow
to the limbs.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.289
This is essentially your body’s ‘power
save mode’ to help you decrease oxygen consumption.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.639
According to a paper published by the American
Physiological Society, likely all mammals

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.859
and possibly all vertebrates have similar
diving reflexes.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.300
But the mammalian diving reflex can only be
triggered by cold water on the face, which

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.009
is why people can hold their breath longer
underwater than say, when they’re driving

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.169
through a tunnel.

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:53.130
The free diver Aleix Segura Vendrell currently
holds the world record for breath-holding

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.649
at just over 24 minutes but he achieved this
after filling his lungs with pure oxygen first.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.560
Without that, the record for longest breath
holding in freediving is Branko Petrovic at

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.289
a measly 11 minutes, 54 seconds.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.350
Which isn’t really measly at all.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.190
Seriously, don’t try this at home.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.060
It’s unclear if there’s any permanent
damage from repeatedly holding your breath.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.080
One study of divers in The Clinical Neuropsychologist
showed no long term neurological damages in

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080
divers.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.790
But another study by The American Physiological
Society did find that divers had an elevated

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
level of the protein S100B, which could be
a marker for brain damage.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.150
It’s important to note that these studies
were done on small numbers of participants,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.810
so you know the line -- more research is needed.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.510
