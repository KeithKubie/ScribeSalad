00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
- So let's do a bunch of examples

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.169
from the Khan Academy Exercises

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.191
to get comfortable with different ways

00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.705
of adding numbers.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.509
So this says, select any strategy

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.786
that can be used to add 78 plus 9.

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:13.164
Select all that apply.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:16.444
So this first choice is 77 plus 10.

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:18.284
Well, does that make sense?

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.104
So instead of 78 they wrote a number one less

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.962
which is 77, and instead of nine

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.644
they wrote a number which is one more, that's 10.

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:26.764
So that makes sense.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:30.844
If you take away one from 78 but add that one to nine,

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:32.674
and you're going to get the same sum.

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:35.443
It's still going to be the same thing as 78 plus nine.

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:39.428
So this is legitimate, this is okay right over here.

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.142
And this actually might be a good thing to do

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:43.200
because this is easier to compute

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.806
because you now are adding 77 plus a nice, round 10 here.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:49.919
So you're just going to increase your 10s by one,

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:51.415
so this is going to be 87.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:54.423
A little bit easier to compute than this, right over here.

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:57.143
Now what do they do here? Add seven and eight.

00:00:57.143 --> 00:01:00.854
So why would I add seven 10s plus eight ones?

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.744
They're treating the seven like as if it's seven ones,

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.430
so this doesn't make sense.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.474
So I would only choose this first choice.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:13.267
Let's do a few more examples.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:16.782
Select any strategy that can be used to add 35 plus 15.

00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:18.442
Select all that apply.

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:22.993
So here they say add 35 plus five then add 10,

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:26.405
so they've broken up the fifteen into five and 10

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:28.705
which makes sense, 15 is five plus 10.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.823
And this is a decent strategy because this gets us to 40,

00:01:31.823 --> 00:01:32.937
which we can do in our head,

00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:35.381
and then we add 10, that gets us to 50.

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.754
So that one definitely works out.

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:40.202
Now what are they doing over here? 30 plus 20.

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.624
So instead of writing 35 they wrote 30,

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:44.357
so this is five less,

00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:47.526
and then they increased the second number 15 by five.

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.780
So you take away five from 35, you get 30.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.120
You add that five to 15, you get 20.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.932
Yeah, that makes sense too and this is also a good strategy

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.774
because 30 plus 20, that's three 10s plus two 10s,

00:01:57.774 --> 00:01:59.957
that's going to be five 10s, or 50.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:01.673
Very easy to compute, and we got that

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:06.203
by taking a five from the 35 and giving it to the 15.

00:02:06.203 --> 00:02:07.723
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:10.672
Let's do one more.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:14.965
Select any strategy that can be used to add 41 to 52.

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.395
So, select all that apply.

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:21.299
Add 40 plus 52 then add one.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.495
So let's see, 41 plus 52,

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.180
yeah so 40,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.638
we've taken the one out of the 41,

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:30.404
so we're going to have to deal with it later.

00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.202
52 hasn't changed, so yeah,

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:34.410
41 plus 52 is the same thing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.777
as 40 plus 52, plus one.

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:38.495
We're just adding this one later,

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.936
and the reason why that might be easier

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:42.176
is you could just think in terms of the 10's place first,

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:46.300
40 plus 52 is 92, then you add one, is 93.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.170
Now let's think about this one. 43 plus 50.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.750
See, they added two to 41 and they took away two from 50.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.960
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.951
You added two here and you took away two here,

00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:00.320
so that's going to give us the same value.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.691
It's still going to get us to 93

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:05.371
and this is useful because it makes the,

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:08.331
it turns the 52 into a nice, round number of 50

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.418
by taking two away from it and giving it to the 41,

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.107
turning it into 43.
