00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:04.970
Baby Kanzi was recently adopted, and adjusting
to life in his new home.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.620
His mother was working with a language coach
to learn some English, and Kanzi usually came

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.970
along, though he didn’t appear to pay much
attention.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.430
But the language coach noticed that he seemed
to be picking up on how to communicate, just

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.210
by watching his mother’s lessons.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.160
Oddly enough, it appeared that he was picking
things up faster than his mom.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.550
For example, the phrases “you tickle”
and “tickle you” meant two different things,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.089
and Kanzi’s mom, she was having a hard time
understanding that syntax.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.510
But one day Kanzi was hanging out, playing
with stuffed animals, and the coach asked

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.050
him to make the dog bite the snake.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.780
Kanzi put the snake in the dog’s mouth,
like it was no big deal.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.600
It was a really big deal.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.260
Because Kanzi is a bonobo.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.879
He’s actually a language superstar, even
among the elite research primates, like Koko

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130
the Gorilla.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.910
Kanzi is the first ape to demonstrate that
language can be acquired spontaneously through

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.670
observation, without planned training, and
the first to show a rudimentary understanding

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.030
of grammar, syntax, and semantics.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.329
Again, really.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.329
big.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.329
deal.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.110
Especially because for years humans have proclaiming
that it’s language that sets us apart from

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.350
other animals.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.659
But are we really alone?

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.450
Turns out, that question keeps getting more
and more complicated.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.660
Technically we define language as a set of
spoken, written, or signed words and the way

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.140
we combine them to communicate meaning.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.310
If we change that definition to include the
use of complex grammar, then maybe we are

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.310
alone.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.430
But if language is simply the ability to communicate
through a meaningful sequence of symbols,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.090
as I might do while looking for a bathroom
in Sweden, or Kanzi does when she’s asking

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.299
to roast marshmallows, well then welcome to
the club, apes!

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.820
[INTRO]

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:53.759
We communicate, in part, by engaging our brains
and bodies to make sounds that let us transfer

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.049
thoughts from our brain to other people’s
brains.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.740
But of course language is more than just making
air vibrate with sound.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.189
I can communicate by moving my hands, which
you might have noticed I do pretty frequently.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.770
Or by using visual symbols.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.410
All of these forms of language allow us to
comprehend things we’ve never actually witnessed,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.410
and exchange information with each other quickly
and effectively to, you know, get a job, or

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.069
be a friend, or use a metaphor.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.900
It’s hard to imagine a fulfilling life without
some kind of language.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.150
Humans have nearly 7,000 different languages,
and no matter how different they sound, we

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.110
can break down their basic structure in the
same way, using the same three building blocks.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.170
The smallest of them are phonemes.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.720
These are very short, distinctive sound units--like
a, t, ch, sh, f.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
Like stuff like that.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.230
English uses about 40 of them.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.860
Phonemes go together to make morphemes, which
are the smallest units that carry meaning.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.090
This can be words, or parts of words, like
a prefix or suffix.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.530
For example, the word SPEECH is a morpheme
that contains four phoneme sound units-- s/puh/eee/ch.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.390
From there you can arrange morphemes into
your language’s grammar, or system of rules

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.540
allowing you to say the things that you want
to say!

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.650
So those 40 English phonemes give us over
100,000 morphemes that produce the more than

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.540
616,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary,
which can then be arranged into an infinite

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.620
number of sentences, paragraphs, Wu-Tang lyrics,
or Shakespearean plays.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.880
And just as the structure of language starts
small, so does how we learn language.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.480
And we start very young.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.910
The word infant comes from the Latin infans,
meaning “not speaking”-- but as early

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.030
as four months, they can recognize differences
in speech and start to read lips, matching

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.170
mouth movements with their corresponding sounds,
like ah ee eye oh ooo.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.240
And even at this age, you gotta watch what
you say about kids in their presence, because

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.050
this also marks the beginning of receptive
language, or the ability to understand what’s

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.710
being said both to, and about us.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.049
Soon that receptive language blooms to accommodate
productive language, when instead of just

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.220
understanding other people, babies start developing
the ability to produce words.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.459
Of course that takes a while, but in the meantime,
they get a lot of practice babbling.

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.459
Beginning at about four months they start
to make all sorts of sounds, although you

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.030
may get a da-da or ma-ma, babbling is NOT
an imitation of adult speech.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.120
In fact, it typically includes sounds from
many different languages, and a stranger couldn’t

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.170
tell if a kid was Italian, or Kenyan, or Korean,
just by the sound of her babbling.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.320
Similarly, deaf babies watch their parents
signing and start babbling with their hands.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.450
By about ten months, that babbling morphs
into something that starts to make sense,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.910
and ma-ma probably really means Mama.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.880
Now, without exposure to other languages,
a child will actually lose the ability to

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.860
both hear and create particular tones and
sounds that aren’t part of his or her household

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.860
language.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.450
So, someone who speaks English around the
house soon won’t be able to differentiate

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.640
between certain phonemes in Mandarin if they
heard them, for instance, or between aspirated

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.530
and non-aspirated consonants in Hindi.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.110
By the time they’re mowing down their first
birthday cake, most kids will be entering

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.170
the one-word stage of language development.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.080
They now know that sounds carry specific meanings,
and can connect the sound “dog” to that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.420
furry thing across the room.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.070
By around 18 months, their capacity for learning
new words jumps from about one a week to one

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.550
a day, and by the time they’re two, they’re
probably speaking in two-word statements.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.510
These choppy sentences are a kind of like
telegraphic speech -- they sound like clumsy

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.580
texts or old-school telegrams, using mostly
nouns and verbs.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.830
Want juice.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.860
No pants.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.860
That kind of stuff.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.890
These little sentences make sense, and they
follow the rules of their language’s syntax.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.250
For example, an English speaking child would
put an adjective before a noun, black cat,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.390
while a Spanish-speaker would reverse that,
gato negro.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.480
From there the average kid is soon uttering
longer phrases and complete sentences, refusing

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.460
to put pants on, and demanding more crackers.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.390
Most humans hit these same milestones during
their language development, but there are

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.230
competing theories about how our infant babbles
turn into complex sentences, and how we acquire

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.230
language.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.700
You’ll remember B.F. Skinner, the pioneering
behaviorist who brought us learning through

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.720
reinforcement.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.300
He believed language was a product of associative
principles and operant conditioning.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.900
Skinner argued that a kid learned to associate
words with meanings largely through reinforcement.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.840
So in the Skinner model, for example, if baby
Bruno says “mmmm” and his mother gives

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.410
him some milk, he’d find that the outcome--both
the milk and the attention-- rewarding, and

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.660
eventually work his way up to saying "milk"
through these learned associations and shaping

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660
processes.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.660
It’s good to be understood, right?

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.180
But as usual, not everyone was on board with
Skinner.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.960
In particular, legendary American linguist
Noam Chomsky argued that a kid like Bruno

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.530
would never reach his full, complex, sonnet-writing
potential if his learning was dependent on

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.680
conditioning alone.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.760
Chomsky instead proposed the idea of innate
learning and ubiquitous grammatical categories,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.350
pointing out that while the world’s thousands
of languages may sound wildly diverse, they’re

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.280
actually very similar, sharing some basic
elements.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.600
He called this Universal Grammar.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.410
Chomsky’s Universal Grammar posited that
all human languages contain nouns, verbs,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.900
and adjectives, and humans are born with an
innate ability to acquire language, and even

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.550
a genetic predisposition to learn grammatical
rules.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.740
Rather than being linguistic blank slates,
Chomsky suggested we’re hard-wired for it

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.740
from day one.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.880
In the end though, we’re still not sure
how we acquire language.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.640
However, developmental research and studies
of other species have given us a sense that

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.250
at least some of it is innate, while the role
of learning and exposure is also important.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.820
So if it’s true that all humans have some
innate capacity for language, where in the

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.290
brain is it sitting?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.870
We’ve talked a lot about how function is
localized in the brain, and that’s definitely

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.930
true for some aspects of language.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.400
But while speaking, reading, writing and even
singing all fall under the language umbrella,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.580
their “locations” in the brain are a little
more complicated.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.560
Consider aphasia, a neurological impairment
of language.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.000
People can experience lots of different kinds
of aphasia depending on whether they’ve

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.310
suffered an injury, or stroke, or a tumor,
or dementia.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.470
So, maybe they can speak but not read, or
sing but barely speak, or write but not read.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.190
The region of the brain known as Broca’s
area in the left frontal lobe is involved

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.720
with the production of speech.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.110
If I suffered a trauma to this area, I might
still comprehend speech, but struggle to speak

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.930
- although I might still be able to sing,
because that’s conducted elsewhere in the

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.930
brain.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.900
On the other hand, if that falling coconut
struck another region, called the Wernicke’s

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.800
area, a region in the left temporal lobe involved
in the expression and comprehension of language,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.950
I’d still be able to speak, but my language
wouldn’t make any sense.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.050
So you might find me saying something like,
“It was too pizza, but I called purple brother

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.050
on the television.”

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.950
Aphasia and other brain injuries remind us
how thinking and language are both separate

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.280
and intricately entwined.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.120
For instance, it’s hard to say if “non-verbal”
ideas come to us first, and then we think

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.420
of the words to name them, or if instead our
thoughts are born in language, or if we’d

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.590
even be unable to even think without it.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.840
And because language often helps to frame
your ideas, your thinking might actually be

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.370
influenced by which language you’re using.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.680
So what are implications of this if we expand
the definition of language to include other

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680
species?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.610
How might Kanzi’s ability to communicate
that he wants a marshmallow affect his thinking,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.011
and how might that thinking influence his
language progression, and his identity?

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:08.110
If only I had the words to describe how fascinating
it all is.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.750
If you understood the language I was using
today, you learned how languages are built

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:17.640
from phonemes, morphemes, and grammar, and
when children acquire receptive and productive

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.020
language, and pass through the babbling, one-word
and two-word phases of development.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.170
You also learned some theories on how we acquire
language, what brain areas are involved, and

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.230
how thinking and language are connected.
