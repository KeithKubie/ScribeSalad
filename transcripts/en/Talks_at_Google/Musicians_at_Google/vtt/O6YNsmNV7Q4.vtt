AVERY SUNSHINE: Dana, can
we do "Sunday Morning?"

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.970
I just want to do a little.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.284
My honey asked me to do this.

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:08.200
Y'all, I'm moving so
fast through these songs,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.325
I'm glad I had some coffee.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.547
Ryan, how much
time I got, honey?

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.044
I'm jamming on to one?

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.120
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.200
So listen, this is one
of my favorite songs,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.501
and I decided we were going
to do something different,

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:24.500
so I hope you like this.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.310
Listen.

If I could whistle, I
would whistle right here.

[WHISTLES]

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:12.350
I can't, so I'll just
introduce Dana Johnson.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.860
Y'all, this is Dana Johnson.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.832

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:15.804
This is my partner.

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:19.206
I call him Ike Turner
Rick James Joe Jackson.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.178
Yeah, OK.
