I advocate a revival of forgetting and

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630
I advocate a revival of forgetting and
 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.110
I advocate a revival of forgetting and
there's a number of ways to do that one

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120
there's a number of ways to do that one
 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.410
there's a number of ways to do that one
is expiration dates expiration dates

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420
is expiration dates expiration dates
 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.900
is expiration dates expiration dates
would be very simple to implement it's

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910
would be very simple to implement it's
 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.480
would be very simple to implement it's
just another form of metadata much like

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490
just another form of metadata much like
 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.359
just another form of metadata much like
you have file names date of creation

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369
you have file names date of creation
 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.990
you have file names date of creation
date of modification exact location of a

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000
date of modification exact location of a
 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.970
date of modification exact location of a
file on your hard disk and so forth and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980
file on your hard disk and so forth and
 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.589
file on your hard disk and so forth and
expiration dates would just add another

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599
expiration dates would just add another
 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.540
expiration dates would just add another
category of metadata to the file system

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550
category of metadata to the file system
 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.220
category of metadata to the file system
we would be able to select the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230
we would be able to select the
 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.870
we would be able to select the
expiration date in any form or shape we

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880
expiration date in any form or shape we
 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.350
expiration date in any form or shape we
want and be able to change it after the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
want and be able to change it after the
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.540
want and be able to change it after the
fact of course but once the expiration

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
fact of course but once the expiration
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.060
fact of course but once the expiration
date has been hit the file would be

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070
date has been hit the file would be
 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.480
date has been hit the file would be
deleted by the system the importance is

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490
deleted by the system the importance is
 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.600
deleted by the system the importance is
that by entering or having to enter an

that by entering or having to enter an
 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.890
that by entering or having to enter an
expiration date whenever we store

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900
expiration date whenever we store
 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.190
expiration date whenever we store
something we are reminded we are

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200
something we are reminded we are
 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.750
something we are reminded we are
reminded of the importance that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760
reminded of the importance that
 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.240
reminded of the importance that
information is not timeless but it is

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250
information is not timeless but it is
 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.400
information is not timeless but it is
connected to a particular context in

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410
connected to a particular context in
 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.560
connected to a particular context in
time a and loses its value over time

time a and loses its value over time
 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.080
time a and loses its value over time
most information does and so by setting

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
most information does and so by setting
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.540
most information does and so by setting
the expiration date we really link time

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550
the expiration date we really link time
 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.120
the expiration date we really link time
with information something that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130
with information something that
 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.930
with information something that
biologically we cannot do if I may I'd

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940
biologically we cannot do if I may I'd
 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.600
biologically we cannot do if I may I'd
like to interject something here and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610
like to interject something here and
 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.490
like to interject something here and
that is we started off and I said

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500
that is we started off and I said
 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.039
that is we started off and I said
there's two kind of dimensions the power

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049
there's two kind of dimensions the power
 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.870
there's two kind of dimensions the power
dimension that I mentioned there's a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880
dimension that I mentioned there's a
 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.210
dimension that I mentioned there's a
second dimension that gets overlooked

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220
second dimension that gets overlooked
 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.550
second dimension that gets overlooked
quite frequently which I call the time

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
quite frequently which I call the time
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.010
quite frequently which I call the time
dimension and that has to do with the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020
dimension and that has to do with the
 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.940
dimension and that has to do with the
fact that we humans are biologically

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950
fact that we humans are biologically
 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.270
fact that we humans are biologically
programmed to forget and we forget most

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
programmed to forget and we forget most
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.179
programmed to forget and we forget most
of what we experience every day that's a

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189
of what we experience every day that's a
 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.370
of what we experience every day that's a
way by which we can abstract and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
way by which we can abstract and
 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.160
way by which we can abstract and
generalize and evolve and grow and rid

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
generalize and evolve and grow and rid
 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.230
generalize and evolve and grow and rid
ourselves of stuff that is no longer

there if we can't do that then we become

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810
there if we can't do that then we become
 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.620
there if we can't do that then we become
burdened by the details of our past to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630
burdened by the details of our past to
 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.580
burdened by the details of our past to
the point that it makes us indecisive

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
the point that it makes us indecisive
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.559
the point that it makes us indecisive
and it shapes the way we decide we know

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569
and it shapes the way we decide we know
 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.180
and it shapes the way we decide we know
a little bit about that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
a little bit about that
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.500
a little bit about that
because there is a small number of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
because there is a small number of
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.050
because there is a small number of
people who cannot forget they have a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
people who cannot forget they have a
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.180
people who cannot forget they have a
biological difficulty or forgetting so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
biological difficulty or forgetting so
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.540

if you ask them about a day 30 years ago
 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.190
if you ask them about a day 30 years ago
they can tell you when they got up who

troubles them a great deal and it
inhibits their ability to decide and act

inhibits their ability to decide and act
 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.140

it might give us a sense of not

it might give us a sense of not

it might give us a sense of not
forgetting anymore and thereby

forgetting anymore and thereby

and whenever we share information we
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.500
and whenever we share information we
also add an expiration date to it and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510
also add an expiration date to it and
 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.270
also add an expiration date to it and
