00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.863
Back in the days before email campaigns,

00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:04.241
contacting a lot of people
meant stuffing envelopes.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:09.588
So, let's say that a group of volunteers
can stuff 205 envelopes in 10 hours,

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:13.071
and what I want to know is,
what is their stuffing rate?

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.021
Enter your answers as
a fraction in these boxes, and

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.570
don't forget your units.
