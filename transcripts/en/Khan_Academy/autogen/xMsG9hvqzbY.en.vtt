00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.170
 As with the previous video, I want to start with two "warm up" tasks. 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.620
 And then I will continue with the lesson. 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.050
 And you will make sure these tasks will be 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.340
 slightly more complex than the equations in the previous video. 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.190
 But we will continue to do exactly the same 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 operations, or permitted operations, 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 until we get the correct answer. 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.880
 Here we have 3 times (x - 1) is equal to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.590
 2 times (x + 3). 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.880
 Let's see what we can do here. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 The first thing I would do (and here is not the only correct way, 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.730
 there are several ways, 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.609
 on which you can decide this equation), 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.000
 but I would like to reveal the braces on both sides of the equation and multiply by 3 and 2. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.240
 So starting with 3 (x - 1) is totally the same as 3x - 3. 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.440
 I just opened the braces and multiplied by 3 ... and this is equal to ... 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.810
 reveal braces and multiply 2 on the other side of the equation. 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.570
 2 times x plus 2 by 3, which is 6. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.100
 And now I want to put all constants 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.220
 on one side of the equation and all unknown 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.390
 on the other side of the equation. 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.660
 Let's see if we can get rid of this 2x 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.580
 on the right side of the equation. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.220
 Let's get 2h. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.120
 I'll use somewhat different recording this time, 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.290
 because you can meet him recorded this way. 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.880
 Or you may find it easier to imagine it that way. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.410
 Does not matter. 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.360
 This is the same thing we did in the previous video. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.160
 But I want to get 2h on both sides of the equation. 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.960
 If I pull out 2x on this side of the equation, 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.610
 I have to pull out 2x on the other side of the equation. 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.930
 So, if we take 2h on both sides of the equation, 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.470
 what will we get? 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.810
 Here we have 3x minus 2x. 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 This is only 1h or we get x minus 3. 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.390
 When we draw 2x minus 2x, we leave x or zero. 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.130
 And then we only have 6. 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.620
 We get x minus 3 equals 6. 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.980
 This happened when we got rid of 2x on the right side for the purpose 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 we took it out on both sides of the equation. 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.140
 Now we have this -3 on the left side. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.920
 We do not need it for us. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.410
 I want to have only x there. 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.640
 So, to get rid of it, we can add 3 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.865
 on both sides of the equation. 

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:02.995
 Add 3 to both sides of the equation. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.910
 You can guess when we add 3 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.980
 to both sides of this equation, 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.570
 3 on the right side is equal to 3 on the left side. 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.250
 As -2h was obviously -2x. 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.070
 You can do it in both ways. 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.410
 But if you add 3 to either side of the equation, 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.170
 on the left we get just x because 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.080
 these two are destroyed one another. 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.650
 X equals ... 6 plus 3 equals 9. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.520
 And now we can check our answer. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.950
 3 times 9 minus 1 how much? 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.890
 This is 3 by 8. 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.450
 That's 24. 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 This is the value we get on the left side. 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.220
 What will we get on the right side? 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.890
 Two out of nine plus three. 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.390
 This is 2 in 12, it is also equal to 24. 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.790
 And so everything works properly. X equals 9. 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.430
 The next task. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.830
 Z (div) divided by 16 is equal to 2 times (3z plus 1) divided by 9. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.210
 It seems quite complicated. 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.820
 Let us multiply both sides of this equation by 9. 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.520
 So, if we multiply both sides of the equation 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.510
 9, what do we get? 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.490
 We get 9 on 16 in z is equal to ... this 9 and this 9 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.250
 will shorten one another ... 2 times 3z plus 1. 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.240
 Now let's uncover the brackets and multiply it by this. 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:38.540
 We will get 9 on 16 on Z equals ... 2 on 3z makes 6z, plus 2. 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.900
 Now let's put all z on one side of the equation. 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.070
 Let's get 6z on both sides of the equation. 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.210
 Let's get 6z here, and of course, 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.370
 we have to pull it out on the other side. 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.390
 And what do we get? 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.250
 On the left we have 9/16 minus 6. 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.640
 What is here if we have 16 as a divisor? 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.030
 Which number is equal to 6 if divided by 16? 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.956
 Let's look at it separately. 

00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:11.890
 60 plus 36. 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.980
 is equal to 96/16. 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.140
 So 9/16 minus 96/16, multiplied by z. 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.240
 That's only 6, I converted it from -6. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.360
 is equal to ... these two are destroyed. 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.985
 That's exactly why we decided to get 6z from the start. 

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.940
 And we will get equal to 2. 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.710
 So, on the left, what is that equal? 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.100
 Let me continue in orange. 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.320
 9 minus 96. 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.820
 Let's see. 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.710
 The difference between 9 and 96 is 87. 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.650
 And of course, if we get a bigger number 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.130
 from less 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.460
 we get a negative value, - 87 divided by 16 in z is equal to 2. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460
 And we're about to end. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.540
 We only need to multiply the two parts of the equation 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.730
 on the opposite of this factor. 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:10.630
 So, multiply the two parts of the equation by a negative -16 / 87. 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.750
 These shorten each other. 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.420
 87 and 87, 16 and 16. 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.660
 When we multiply two negative values, we get a positive value. 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.990
 This is where we left with z, which is equal to 2 times that thing here. 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.830
 So 2 times the 16 is negative 32/87 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.160
 And we finished the task. 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.970
 This is not a beautiful answer, but 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.620
 that's what we got. 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.460
 You can try other methods. 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.850
 Maybe at first you will multiply both sides of the equation by 16. 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.970
 Maybe you will uncover the braces and multiply by 2 and 9 first. 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.550
 You can do many things. 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.970
 You can also check that this answer is really true. 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.240
 Now let's make a text task after we're hot. 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.030
 All right. 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.190
 The condition is: Manoy and Tomar argue about a focus with numbers. 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.880
 Tomar tells Andrew to figure out a number. 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.770
 Let's assume that the number Andrew has designed is x. 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.750
 Make up a number. 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.010
 Multiply it by 5. 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.730
 That's what Tomar wants. 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.105
 Tomar tells Andrew to invent a number and multiply it by 5. 

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:11.130
 Let's show it. 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:20.125
 Multiply it by 5, subtract 3 of the result. 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.325
 Let me use a different color. 

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.280
 I'll make it blue. 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.670
 We get 3 of the result. 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.030
 Here we get 3 of the result. 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 Manoeus is on. 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.490
 This is Manoy. 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.010
 Manoy tells Andrew once more 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.820
 to figure out a number. 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.150
 And so to think of a number again. 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.600
 We will call it x. 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.250
 Both make him figure out a number. 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.780
 Add 5. 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.960
 And now he says to add 5 to the number. 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.370
 And we add it. 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.290
 And then we multiply the score by 3. 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.990
 We multiply the score by 3. 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.580
 Andrew says that every time you apply this number, 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.730
 receives the same answer. 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.100
 What is the number Andrew has designed? 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.080
 So, whether it multiplies the number by five and then exits 3, 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.170
 or adds 5 and multiplies the 3, 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.950
 he gets the same answer. 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.470
 So what can mean that these two are the same. 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.070
 He gets the same answer. 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.630
 This means that these two parts are equal. 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.540
 Let's solve this equation. 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:30.380
 We get 5x minus 3 equals 3 x x 5. 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.870
 This is a good start, we will uncover the braces and multiply by 3 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.620
 and we get 3x plus 5. 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.820
 Always remember to multiply by 3 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.330
 all values ​​in brackets. 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.020
 That's 15. 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.460
 And, of course, 5x minus 3 equals that. 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.040
 Now, I think you know what I want to do. 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.090
 I want to move all the members containing x to one side of the equation. 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.590
 Let's get them on the left side. 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.770
 Which means getting rid of them on the right side. 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.120
 So let's get 3h on both sides of the equation. 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.420
 Minus 3x and minus 3x and what will we get? 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.410
 Our equation becomes 5x minus 3x is equal to 2x ... 

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.420
 we still have minus 3 ... these two are being destroyed ... 

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.380
 is equal to 15. 

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.170
 Equal to this yellow 15 here. 

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.300
 Now we want to get rid of minus 3 

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.170
 on the left side. 

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.110
 And the best way to do it is to add 3 

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.170
 on both sides of the equation. 

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.620
 So we add 3 on both sides of the equation. 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.770
 What do we get? 

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:35.539
 Now we have 2h ... and these are destroyed ... is equal to 18. 

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.954
 And then we divide the two sides into 2. 

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.159
 And we get x is equal to 18 divided by 2. 

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.340
 Equal to 9. 

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.560
 And in both cases, Andrew thought about the number 9. 

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.430
 Let's see if it works for Tomar's method 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.720
 and Manoy. 

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.190
 If I multiply 5 by 9, 

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.350
 I get 45 minus 3. 

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.270
 We have 42. 

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.910
 That's when Tomar thinks. 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.270
 When Manoy thinks - this is 9. 

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.110
 9 plus 5 is 14. 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.990
 Thus, it becomes 14 and becomes 3 at 14. 

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.860
 3 times 14 and 30 plus 12, straight 42. 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.790
 So Andrew was right. 

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.230
 When randomly chosen the number 9, and 

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.030
 whatever method he chooses, he gets the same result. 

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.000
 He gets 42.
