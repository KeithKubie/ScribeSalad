Speaker 1:          00:00          The mistake of doing yesterday, I watch ace Ventura pet detective with my eight year old and my 10 year old

Speaker 2:          00:04          seen that in since they came out with a good still,

Speaker 1:          00:07          I didn't realize how Trans phobic that fucking movie is. Boiler alert. The whole premise is that there was a venture vegetated, I gotta split alert myself cause I forgot the whole premise was wet. This guy steals a dolphin and when he steals a dolphin, ace Ventura fines, cause he's a pet detective, finds a tiny ruby that's at the bottom of this dolphin tank that is missing from a Miami dolphins ring. And he finds out through this exhaustive search that the one guy who he couldn't account for his ring was a kicker who fucked up the world series or the Superbowl rather. Yeah. So this, this guy, this guy that they've found out is Sean Young in the movie who's gorgeous and then in the movie, take that down please. So in the movie at the end of it, the reveal is that Sean Young is really this football player who wants to get back a Dan Marino because Dan Murray, he's goes psycho because the world hates him because he blew the kick.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So He's a guy, pretended to be a woman in Ace Ventura made out with them and just like everyone, all the cops are throwing up. Everyone's throwing up. You can't own or no, it's off the charts at the end he pulls her top off and shows and she has breasts. He was like trying to show that she did well yeah, breasts. And she did and he's like, well anybody can get those in an afternoon, but what about this? And he pulls her pants down and then he goes by and then everybody sees her and she's got her legs together so you can't see your penis. And then from behind you see her junk is pressed up against their butt cheeks cause she's tucked her penis and her vagina. So the cops all start throwing up and then cops start cleaning. Cops had made out with her and start cleaning their mouth off. They start chewing giant wad there. That's her, the scene. So watch all the cops see that. And he points to the fact that Sean, you look, they all start throwing up. Look, everyone's throwing up. This is Dan Marino's throwing up. They also see, oh, he's getting his mouth because he made out with her tone. Loke the dolphins freaking out. Everyone's freaking out. It is so insanely trends.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Okay. So what the left would say is the reason that they're right is that a movie like this won't get made anymore. And isn't that a good thing? Maybe. But should they pull it should go, should it be illegal to have that on iTunes? Of course.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Maybe someone on the world cleft might disagree with you right now. Yeah, they might. You Trans phobic for defending this horrible cisgendered heteronormative shit movie.

Speaker 2:          02:43          That's horrible. And what's crazy, and I guess this is a great thing. I mean the re moralization project is working because when I saw that, I'm sure is, I don't know what year did that come out to? 95 four. Okay. So when I saw that as a 12

Speaker 1:          03:00          I don't know. I was born in 84 I can't do math. I want to say [inaudible] 93 I want to say it was before I came to Hollywood. When I saw that movie I was 10 transphobia was not a thing. No, no. It is a thing. That's good. That's good. When things are changing so rapidly, but the question is where are the lines being drawn and is the Overton window being shrunk too small? How do you feel about them pulling the dukes of Hazzard off the air for the flag? I don't know about that. You didn't know about that? No, they pulled the deuce. Do you understand? Do you understand how many of these there are a day? Yes, so no, I don't know that one. What's that one? This one. They've yanked the dukes of Hazzard off television forever because the confederate flag was on the roof of the generally did not follow that.

Speaker 1:          03:43          I didn't know that. You cannot watch the dukes of Hazzard anymore. You cannot watch it. It's not on television anymore. It used to be on TV land all the time. Can you get it on? No. Fuck no, no chance. They're not going to show that God damn awful flag. We have a poster in the bathroom over there of a Leonard Skinner from like 1970 [inaudible] and they have a giant Janis Joplin I thought in the bathroom. Other bathroom. Good jazz shopping. Oh, that's the other bathroom. Yeah, there's different boundaries. I like that one. Yeah, that's great one. That's her mugshot. I love it. Yeah, that's right. Um, but the, the Leonard Skinner one, they have a giant confederate flag on stage. Huge, enormous in the background that was there, like southern pride, this idea of southern pride. It was okay to have that flag. I'm basically for trying to, when it comes to the realm of art and movies and books, leave it alone.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Try to leave it alone as much as possible. It's generally a very good strategy. I agree. Don't want to be in the book banning movie banning TV, banning business or editing. They, they tried to mobile. I think they did successfully, at least in some venues. Edit. Uh, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn because the n word was used prolifically, you know, I mean the guy's name was nigger Jim. That was the name in, in, in the book. Cause that's how people talk back then. And I think we need to keep that stuff as a time capsule to show how racism was. So normative. Yes. Yes. It's important to, to, to show the progress like a Centura up like you, she like for Trans people, keep him for history, for Trans People. And it's amazing that no one's ever brought this up. I mean I feel like this is something that's never been discussing on from you. Joe Rogan, the time I got shit to do. I got, I got jokes right, but fuck, this is, you've got an Israel trip that I'm planning, Barry, what are you doing to be married? I'm not dragging you want to take you on an amazing trip and then we're going to go to the West Bank and you're going to see all this stuff and you're going to come away with loving certain parts of it and not liking certain parts of it. And you're going to realize it's a country

Speaker 2:          05:58          just like any other country. Right. But it is a democracy and it's trying to do its best in a really rough neighborhood and we'll go like, I want you to see what the occupation looks like. Like I think that's something that's really important to see, to get a full picture of it.

Speaker 1:          06:11          I think you're probably right. I think it is an important thing for people to see. Um, I think there's a lot of parts of the world that I need to see to really get a grasp. Where do you want to go? Where you're going next in the world? You travel a lot. Yes. Um, I don't know. I mean I'm, my family and I, we do a European vacation trip at that doesn't really count. We just loud. It's just fun. Um, went to Thailand last year. That was fascinating. Oh, cool. Thailand was fascinating because, and that was kind of a vacation trip too. But that's such a unique culture because Thailand is run by the king. Like if he even criticized the king, you're, you're fucked. Like you're in real trouble. And his pictures everywhere, everywhere. There's pictures of him and the throne, like wearing like super nice clothes and looking good.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Um, but the people are so kind. They're so friendly and they're always smiling and they have, you know, there's a lot of people that you'll run into that have very little, but yet they don't seem to be having a problem with that. They wear flip flops. You're on the highway. There's three people on a motorcycle is a baby in a basket and I'm not bullshitting. No helmet. And a friend that just went to Thailand and she was like, but the people are so nice. They're so nice. They're so kind. It's so anew. And you know, me and my family, we had, we always, whenever we go somewhere, we always have these real long conversations. Um, about like what was interesting about it for you? Like what, what did you think? Like I tried two kids, eight and 10, the young ones. And I have a 22 year old too.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Okay. Um, all girls Holla. I'm from four girls. Woo. Yeah, it's in the genes. But the um, the, the, the, what's fascinating to me about it is first of all, I love exposing these little people to different parts of the world. So they get to see like what this is like, you know, like here we are like show him on the map. This is American. We're over here. We're way the fuck to 15 hours to get here. The plane that goes 500 plus miles an hour. It's crazy. And just to realize like human beings are the same but different. We're the same everywhere, but there's a different way we choose to interact with each other. And one of the things that happens is we fall into their way when we go there. Like if we go to Italy, we say [inaudible], you know, we started, I try to, you try to start in learning, we'll just start trying to learn some of the words, you know, that, you know, these people use in their culture and then, oh, I forgot how you say it.

Speaker 1:          08:32          Cup soon. Crop. I think that's how you said it's like thing like hello, good morning. Yeah. And, but they all say that and everyone makes a lotus flower with their hands. It's so common. Everywhere you go, people greet you and they do this and it's such a warm, friendly, peaceful way of greeting each other. And so one of the things that we talked about it, I was like, you know, that's how everybody is like way more friendly and like greeting and this thing about clasping your hands together and they all agree to do it and everyone sort of, it's like this unique pattern that people can fall into and people fall into all sorts of patterns. They fall into like really aggressive patterns of honking at people on the road and driving real fast. And then they fall into these peaceful patterns. And some of it's dictated by culture, some of it's dictated by climate, some of is dictated by the economic situation in the world they're in.

Speaker 1:          09:23          But it's, it's such a weird trip to go to different places and see like, okay, yeah, if I lived over here, this is how I rock it. I'd be wearing flip flops and shorts and you know, I'd get around this way and this is the kind of food that I would eat. And real spicy because you know, you kind of have, have those spices actually protect against bacteria because they're there. They're actually antibacterial. Was the food grade fucking amazing. We took some courses, we took classes, we learned how to cook over there. Yeah. It was amazing. It was amazing. But my kid got lit up by bugs. Whew. There's a thing there called tsetse flies. I think that's what they're called. I forget what they're called, but my youngest had a horrible allergic reaction to some of the bugs over there. You get and you, you know, you think like, okay, like, uh, what about, uh, you know, there's, there's fucking diseases that kill people.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Malaria's killed malaria has killed more people than anything ever. Like more people have died from malaria than anything. Oh, I know. Yeah. Well, that's why gates made its, yeah, totally. Yeah. And so you go over there like we were going to go to Africa is one of the things that we're going to go to, but I'm not giving my fucking eight year old malaria shots. Just know, just like it's really bad dreams. I've had some friends that Dave Foley, who was like the sweetest guy on the planet earth. He was from kids in the hall who was on news radio with me. Dave Foley was on malaria medication because he was going to visit his kids in Egypt. So we had to take this stuff and he was drinking, you're not supposed to drink on it. And uh, he, he was going crazy. He doesn't even remember anything, just going crazy, taking reporters a microphone or as a tape recorder away and put it in a drink. It was like losing his marbles. Like I had to protect him yelling at a guy and like Crowl I'm like calm down. Meanwhile the sweetest, kindest, nicest guy you would ever meet. And meanwhile he was like, like super aggro was crazy. It didn't make any sense. And it's the medication.
