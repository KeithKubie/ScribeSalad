[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.600
HEATHROW: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.590
My name is Heathrow, and I'm
a research operations manager

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.560
on the Insights Lab,
part of Brand Studio,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.860
and we're here today for
a talk by Gloria Mark.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.740
Gloria Mark is a professor in
the Department of Informatics

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.470
at the University of
California in Irvine,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
and her research focuses on
how the use of technology

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
affects our lives in
real-world contexts.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.740
She received her
PhD in psychology

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.520
from Columbia University,
and before working at UCI

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.220
she worked at the German
National Research Center

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.440
for Information
Technology and has

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.050
served as a visiting
researcher at Microsoft

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.410
Research since 2012 as well
as IBM and the MIT Media Lab.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.470
Today she's going to talk
about her work using sensors,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.310
experience sampling, computer
logging, and repeated surveys

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.340
to study the
workplace experience,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.230
specifically how attention,
focus, stress, and affect are

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.040
impacted by digital media use
as well as how our attention

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.740
focus varies over the workday.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.387
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gloria Mark.

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:14.345
GLORIA MARK: Thank you.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.510
So it's a real pleasure to be
here, so far away from Irvine.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.170
So I am really interested in
understanding how digital media

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.900
affects our lives.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.970
And-- how does this clicker--

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.870
oops.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.540
OK.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.800
So my starting point
is that most people

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.480
are by nature monochronic.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.240
And what that means
is most people,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.510
like myself, prefer
to start on a task

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.730
and finish it
through to completion

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.290
before switching
to something else.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.450
But we live in a digital
age and we are required

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.910
to work in a polychronic way.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.760
So most people have
multiple devices.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.620
You work on multiple
applications.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.140
You have multiple apps open
on your laptop, desktop.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.730
Some people have iPads.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.970
And were always switching
our attention between devices

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.820
and applications,
and it forces us

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.180
to work in a polychronic
way, and that's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.540
against what our nature is.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.600
So in particular I'm very
interested in the idea

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.490
of multitasking.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.520
And people sometimes think
of multitasking as working

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.690
on two things at the same time.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.130
And that's impossible
for human beings

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.840
to literally work on two
things at the same time.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.170
You can walk and
chew gum, but this is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.600
an unconscious kind of process.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.670
But what it really refers
to is switching very rapidly

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.000
between different tasks,
between different contexts.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.630
You can think of it like
time-sharing among computers.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.140
Right?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.650
So when we talk about
multitasking, that's really

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.960
what we're referring
to, this rapid

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.630
context-shifting back and forth.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.880
Now, a lot of people have
tried to measure multitasking.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.670
And the most typical
way that it's measured

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.150
is you ask people, how
much do you multitask?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.800
Well, this is not very
fruitful because research

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.670
has shown that people
can be off by about 30%

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.650
in their estimates
of how much time they

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.850
spend on computing or just
estimating time in general.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.120
People are notoriously
bad at estimating time.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.730
You can bring people
in a laboratory

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.470
and you can give them some
kind of artificial task

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.130
and watch how fast or
how well they switch,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.990
but that's artificial
and it doesn't

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.110
begin to model all
the kinds of things

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.850
we experience in real-world
work, like career trajectories

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.720
and conflicts and social
pressures and deadlines

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.270
and how tired we feel and so on.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.530
So my perspective
is that if we really

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.770
want to study people
and understand them,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.110
we have to go where people are.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.230
So we have to create
living laboratories.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.300
And that's what I do.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.350
And if you do this
kind of approach

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.550
we can ask questions like, how
fragmented is our attention

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.770
with digital media?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.420
How can we explain distraction
with digital media?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.000
How does digital
media use affect mood?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.060
Because it does.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.570
So let me start off by
talking about the introduction

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.280
of digital media
in the workplace.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.460
So I'm very often
asked, well gee,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980
didn't people always multitask?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.230
You know, what is
new about this?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.120
So let's take a look.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.110
So unfortunately nobody
has done any study

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.880
at the level of
detail that we have

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.740
where we use sensors and track
behavior to the second, which

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.160
I'll talk about shortly.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.720
But what people have done
is they-- historically

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.570
they followed people
around in the workplace

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.745
and they've timed them to see
what their distribution of time

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:20.020
is with different activities.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.240
And if you look here at these--

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.150
all the studies that are
represented in the two

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.790
right columns
represent studies that

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.910
were done when personal
computing and email became

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.910
widespread in use
in the workplace.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.140
And the studies to the left--

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.680
they were not really
in widespread use.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.960
The study, Stevens et al,
1992, was sort of mixed.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.900
And I want you to
look in particular

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.050
at how desk work
has changed and how

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.880
scheduled meetings--
"scheduled meetings"

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.370
refers to formally-scheduled
face-to-face meetings.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.160
And I want you to look at
these two columns on the right

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.900
and contrast that with the
work done by the other studies.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.240
And the Horne and Lupton study
in 1965 with scheduled meetings

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.350
is a bit of an anomaly.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.870
And tell me if you
notice any trends here.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.650
Do you notice anything?

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.260
What do you notice?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.070
What's changed?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.070
GLORIA MARK: Huh?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.736
GLORIA MARK: OK.

00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:39.290
The amount of time spent
at the desk is increasing.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.620
And what about-- and
meetings are decreasing.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.830
So if we put these
two trends together

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.170
we see that the
proportion of time

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.020
spent at desk work
nearly doubled

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.030
with the introduction
of IT in the workplace.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.920
And people spend
a less proportion

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.040
of their time in scheduled,
face-to-face meetings.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.580
And this suggests that
work that was formerly

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.920
done in face-to-face
meetings is now

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.610
being done, to a larger extent,
at the desktop through email,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.160
through desktop conferencing,
through other kinds of means.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.370
So I'm very fortunate to
be interested in this topic

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.210
at the cusp of a revolution
in the development of sensor

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.780
technology, wearable
technologies and other kinds

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.200
of sensor technologies.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.700
And so my students and I used to
track people in the workplace.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.470
We used to shadow people.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.390
And we had these timers, and
every time people would take

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.370
a different action--
like pick up the phone,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.090
we would do start time, they'd
put the phone down, stop time--

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.940
and recorded every single
action that people did.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.440
And it was very,
very labor-intensive.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.370
But the advantage is that we
could understand the context.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.870
Right?

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.350
So as a byproduct of
measuring these activities

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.360
we got a sense of what
people's work life was like.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.180
But when you use sensors
you miss that context.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.980
Right?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.450
The sensors are just
recording bits of information.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.290
And so the grand challenge,
as I see it, is to what extent

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.930
can we automatically
capture behavior

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.640
with sensors to gain the
same level of Insights,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.289
the same level of deep knowledge
we can about human behavior

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.909
that we could with human
ethnographic observation?

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.150
Ethnographic observation is when
people actually follow people

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.740
around and observe.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.130
And I have several projects
that I've been working on.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.350
Today I will only talk
about the Health Sense

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.480
Project, which is dealing
with information workers.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.380
I have another large study,
the Millennial Project,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.270
which tracked college students
and their use of digital media.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.840
So let me go through
the measures that I use,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.050
because this is going to
help you understand the data.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.700
So we measure stress
using heart rate monitors.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.590
We measure electro
dermal activity

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.930
using these devices that are
called Affectiva Q sensors.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.190
Actually, these days we're
using other wearable devices.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.120
We measure people's mood
and focus through something

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.740
called "experience sampling."

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.260
These are probes
that people get where

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.400
they record their subjective
opinion about something.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.900
And I'm going to talk
about that later.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.200
That's in the
upper-right, as an example

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.180
of what a probe looks like.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.160
We measure face-to-face
interaction with sense cams,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.240
as this lower-right picture.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.780
It's a small little camera,
very lightweight, people wear.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.010
It takes continual photos
about every 20 or 30 seconds.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.310
And then we can apply
face detection software

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.240
to see if there was a face
present or not in the image.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.610
And it's very accurate.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.330
We log people's computer
and phone activity

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.090
we measure people's
activity using

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.440
actigraphs, which
everyone knows of Fitbit

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.630
as a common actigraph.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.700
We measure sleep, sleep rhythms.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.600
And we give a whole lot of
demographic and personality

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.455
kinds of measures.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.750
So let me start by giving
you an example of what

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.570
your digital media use
can reveal about you.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.140
Now, some people have
done this kind of work

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.510
where they mined the content.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.340
So they analyze the content.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.270
For example, in
social media they

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.970
do sentiment analysis to
see what kind of words

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.600
people are using.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.860
But if we just look
at temporal features--

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.560
no content, but
temporal features

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.870
like the average
amount of time you

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.660
spend on digital
media, the dispersion,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.740
are you using it all at one time
or using it throughout the day?

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.040
When is the device on and off?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.140
How much social
media are you using?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.420
Again, not content.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.890
What's your rhythm of usage?

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.010
Do you have a regular
pattern, or is it irregular?

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.550
What time of day is
that mostly used?

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.500
And we find that we can
predict personality.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.240
These are the big five
personality traits,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.780
if you're familiar with them.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.520
This is a commonly-used
measure of personality.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.340
We can predict these traits
from temporal features

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.250
alone with fairly high accuracy.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.580
So let's start with a
question very much related

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.550
to multitasking, which
is how fragmented

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.190
are people's attention
in the workplace?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:15.410
And by "fragmented," how much do
they actually switch contexts?

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.460
OK.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:22.940
So here is a measure from
logging people's computer

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.170
activity.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.540
This is the average
duration of time

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.360
that people spend on
any computer screen

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.860
before switching.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.650
And if you look at
all computer usage,

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.280
the median length of
time is 40 seconds.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.280
That means that every
40 seconds people

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.010
are switching on average--

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.870
well, it's actually the median--

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.130
to another screen.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.440
That's a very short
amount of time.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.730
And if we look at averages
of how often people switch

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.460
within apps-- that
means you open up Word,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.880
and then you're opening up
other documents within word

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.650
or you're surfing the internet--
people switch about 112 times

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.490
a day.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.240
And switching between apps,
which is even more of a context

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.230
shift--

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.280
going from the internet to
a Word document to email--

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.750
that's about 261 times a day.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.590
So--

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.174
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:20.840
GLORIA MARK: No.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.030
This-- sorry.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.860
That is seconds,
but the switches

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.950
within apps and
between apps actually

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.200
refer to number of instances.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.050
Sorry about that.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.540
That should be
labeled differently.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.250
So people's workday
typically is characterized

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.750
by very short durations of
attention on any computer

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.670
screen and lots of switching.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.620
There is an assumption made,
that when a computer screen is

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.460
in the forefront and active, we
make an assumption that that's

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.710
a proxy for attention.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.860
And it's not always the case.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.330
Now, we do have decision rules.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.860
So if a screen comes up really
quick and then goes off,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.720
we make this assumption
that people's

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.990
attention-- it's not long enough
for people to really focus.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.490
Right?

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.710
To have any kind of
meaningful focus.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.160
So we have decision
rules where we filter out

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.290
screens that are just up for
very brief moments of time.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.070
So, for example, sometimes
people might switch--

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.430
click on a web page and
then click immediately

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.290
to something else,
so we disregard

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:39.440
that because we can't expect
that people are actually

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.460
going to focus and spend
cognitive resources when

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.680
that shift is so fast.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.690
The median focus duration on
any computer screen, we find,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.575
is 40 seconds.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.230
Now, we wondered that maybe--

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.700
you know, not
everybody is alike.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.430
Maybe there are individual
differences that

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.895
can explain focus duration.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.250
And so we hypothesize
that the following things

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.190
would be related to
the amount of time

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.180
that people would spend
focused on any computer screen.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.540
Neuroticism is a
personality trait.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.220
It's characterized by people
who just can't suppress thoughts

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.810
that come into your head.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.700
And people who are
highly-neurotic

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.450
generally have short
attention spans.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.930
We hypothesize that
people who are impulsive

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.260
would have a shorter attention
span on the computer.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.860
There are two dimensions of
impulsivity that we checked.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.080
One is a sense of urgency.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.580
Right?

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.360
You can't hold yourself back.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.160
You just have to act.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.941
Another dimension,
lack of perseverance.

00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:53.440
Right?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.500
That people just
don't have what it

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.170
takes to persevere on a task.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.960
People who are
susceptible to stress.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.410
And we hypothesize that
people who did not sleep,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.650
did not have long sleep
durations the night

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:12.450
before would have shorter
attention durations.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.890
And we also hypothesized
that the longer the attention

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.740
duration on any
computer screen would

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.760
be associated with a higher
assessed productivity

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.160
at the end of the day.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.170
And the neuroticism and
impulsive urgency hypotheses

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.760
were supported.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.250
There was a strong trend for
the sleep and stress hypotheses

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.230
to be supported,
and productivity.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.520
This hypothesis was supported.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.600
So we also did what's called
a "factor analysis," where

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.820
we put all these
variables into a program

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.850
to see if there's a latent
structure in the variables.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.480
And indeed, we found
a latent variable

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.980
that we label "lack of control,"
which is comprised of people

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.569
that are high in neuroticism,
who are high in this impulsive

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:15.339
urgency kind of variable, and
people who are susceptible

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.720
to stress.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.760
And this is predictive.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.089
The more lack of control
people have, the shorter

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.280
is their focus duration.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.490
And I'm going to come back to
this idea of lack of control

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.490
later on.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.460
Now you might be
asking, well, so what?

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.520
So what if I switch from
Excel to Word to email?

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.340
But what if I'm working
on the same project?

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.840
Right?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.320
Maybe it doesn't
make a difference.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.820
Right?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.770
Because right now
I'm just talking--

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.590
I'm agnostic to
task and I'm just

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.960
talking about these switches
between computer screens.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.020
So let's go a little
bit deeper and let's

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.120
look at the task level.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.680
This is work that was done by a
former student of mine, Victor

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:09.520
Gonzalez, with great effort,
who categorized these smaller

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.010
actions, clustering them
into different tasks.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.540
And it took him a
great deal of time.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.820
And here's what he found.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.000
That, first of all,
people work on an average

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.010
of about 12 different projects.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.430
We call these "working
spheres," spheres of work.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.270
And people spend about
10 and a half minutes

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.170
in any of these working
spheres before switching

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.820
to something else.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.200
So 10 and a half minutes is not
a really long period of time.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.880
And I know-- you know, I'm an
academic and I write papers,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.630
and 10 and a half minutes
is not a very long time

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.860
for me to get sufficiently
deep into beginning a task,

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.830
and then I'm switching.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:04.830
So let's look at rhythms
of attention over the day.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:10.430
So I want to give you a little
bit of psychology theory.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.460
So there's a number
of researchers

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.520
who've talked about this
idea of attention focus.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.630
And it goes by different names.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.580
It goes by the term
"cognitive absorption."

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.640
Others have called it
"cognitive engagement."

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.230
How many of you have
heard of mindfulness?

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.730
OK.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.110
You're living in LA.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.820
You know about mindfulness.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.130
How many of you
have heard of flow?

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.670
OK.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.540
Flow is the idea that
you're so deeply immersed

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.180
with your attention that
you become completely

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.890
unaware of the passage of time.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.670
So all of these
ideas are related.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.830
And then in contrast
people speak about boredom.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:57.020
And the research shows that all
of these different constructs

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.630
related to attention
are associated

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.770
with positive affect.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.580
People are happy when they're
deeply immersed and engaged.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.380
And when they're bored
generally people are not happy.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.160
And that's what the
research studies show.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.840
So here's how you might
conceptualize attention,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.880
being highly engaged or not
engaged in some activity.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.480
Right?

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.460
That's a simple continuum.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.900
And so we thought about
this and we hypothesized

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.350
that there would be an
orthogonal dimension

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.630
that we call "challenge."

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.620
And we came up with this idea
because the concept of flow

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.270
involves challenge.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.550
When people are in
a state of flow,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.670
they're also challenged
to some degree.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.130
And so we came up with
this conceptual framework

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.540
and we put labels on these.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.700
And let me explain them.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.180
So people who are highly-engaged
and highly-challenged we

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.380
use a label of focus.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.920
This is when people are
in a state of focus.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.830
And if people are really
engaged in something

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.050
but they're not
at all challenged

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.230
we call this rote,
as in rote work.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.790
An example is playing solitaire.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.290
Right?

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.470
When people play solitaire
you're really engaged,

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.810
but you're not challenged.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.920
And the other label,
bored, is when

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.060
you're not at all challenged
and you're just not engaged.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.650
We label that "bored."

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.400
And the last one is being
challenged in something,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.570
but you're not engaged.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.950
We call that "frustrated."

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.440
It's just a label.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.320
An example would be a software
developer who has a bug.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.420
They're just really,
really frustrated.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.280
They're challenged
by it, and they just

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.620
can't engage themselves
into trying to work it out.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.830
I mentioned that this is
the probe that we used.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.960
So we gave people these
probes throughout the day.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.380
On the average about 18 times
a day people were asked--

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.860
the top part is called
"Russell's circumplex

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.010
model of mood."

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.820
It's a well-validated measure
of self-reported mood.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.640
And at the bottom we ask
people, how engaged were you

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.650
in the thing you
were just doing,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.860
and how challenged were you in
the thing you were just doing?

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.740
People were trained
in this, and they

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:30.320
were able to answer these
probes within a few seconds.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.500
These probes came
about 18 times a day.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.090
And the irony is not lost on
me that we're interrupting

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.280
people 18 times a day.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.980
But we got really great data.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.480
And people submit this.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.140
We get a time stamp, and we
can align the time stamp.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.760
So we see what people's
subjective moods and engagement

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.290
and challenge is in relation
to the computer activities

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.670
that they're doing.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:03.770
And we also look at stress
and we have other measures.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.520
So in contrast to what all
this other research shows,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.160
that people are happiest
when they're engaged,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.460
we actually find that the
mean level of happiness

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.510
is highest when people
are doing rote work.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.300
So when people are doing
this kind of mindless work--

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.240
you're engaged but
you're just not using

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.730
your mental resources-- that's
when people are the happiest.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:32.480
So if we slice up this idea
of engagement and attention

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.000
and we slice it up in
terms of being challenged

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.580
and not challenged, we
find there is a difference.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.390
People are least happiest
when they're bored.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.510
And you're saying, why are there
data lines with frustrated?

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.030
That's because hardly
anyone in our sample

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.580
reported being frustrated.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.840
So we didn't have enough
data to make any conclusions.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.360
This is what the
average attention

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.730
looks like over the
course of the day.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.060
The black line is
focused, and there's

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.730
a couple of interesting
things about this graph.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.350
So people are at their
peak focus in the morning--

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.410
about 11:00 AM,
so late morning--

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.220
and also roughly about 3:00 PM.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.500
And what's also interesting,
at least for me,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.660
is that people don't come
into the workplace ramped up

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.960
and ready to go, but
it takes some time

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.590
to ease into a deeper
attentional state.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.420
Let's talk about distractions.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:48.890
So first an interesting
idea about interruptions

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.660
is, we always think of
interruptions in terms

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.501
of external notification.

00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:55.000
Right?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.650
You get an email notification
or a social media notification

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.360
or a colleague comes
into the office

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.670
or you get a phone ringing.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.580
But there's this
other phenomenon

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.100
we call "internal
interruptions," or self

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.430
interruptions.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.110
The best way I can describe it
is, you're observing someone

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.010
and they're typing on a Word doc
and for no apparent reason they

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.070
suddenly stop what they're
doing and they turn

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.450
and pick up the phone.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.140
Or they stop and they check
email or social media.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.270
That's a self interruption.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.620
I know I do it.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.800
Since I've been
doing this research

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.050
I became much more aware
of how much I do it.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.410
Now we took the data
and we divided it up

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.650
into hourly segments
and we looked

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:48.040
at the proportion of external
and internal interruptions

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.310
in each of those hourly
segments throughout the day

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.580
over the course of
days, and we found

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.800
something really interesting.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.480
That when external
interruptions waned,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.020
we saw that internal
interruptions kicked in

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.420
and started to become high.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.040
It's not that when an
external interruption

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.850
stopped that people
suddenly had peace of mind

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.790
and were able to work
without interruptions.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.640
They began to
interrupt themselves.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.260
That's what the data showed.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.920
And this suggests
to me that people

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.760
are conditioned to be
interrupted to work

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.000
in very short attention spans.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.280
And if you're not
being interrupted

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.630
by external sources, then people
will interrupt themselves.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.130
And that would be a sign
of being conditioned.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:43.950
OK.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.202
Now distractions.

00:26:48.202 --> 00:26:52.080
A lot of work has been
done in interruptions.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.380
And people have
assumed in this work

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.940
that people are really
absorbed in their work,

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.120
and then along
comes a distraction

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.840
and all of a sudden
people get bored.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.340
Right?

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.100
Along comes this social
media distraction

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.180
and then it takes you away
from this deep engagement.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.030
Well, what if it's the reverse?

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.040
What if people are first
in a state of boredom,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.480
and that makes them
susceptible to a distraction?

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.670
And so that's the
question we asked.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.120
So first let me tell
you a little bit

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.030
about types of interruptions.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:38.470
So workplace communications
comprise 40% of interruptions.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.660
There's email.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.770
These are the top offenders.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:47.710
Email is primarily work-related,
at least in the workplaces

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.050
we studied they were.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:53.200
Face-to-face can be either
work-related or social.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.210
And Facebook, which was
the main social media

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.550
platform used in the
particular company we studied.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.360
That's primarily social.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.300
And to give you an idea
of the extent to how often

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.160
and how much people spend on
these types of communications,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.510
we see people in our sample
visited Facebook about 21 times

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.590
a day, email-checked
about 74 times a day.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:28.960
The high person in our sample
was about 465 times a day.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.830
But people spend relatively
short durations of time.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:38.730
They check Facebook, but then
spend about 18 seconds on it.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.930
And email-- you know,
they check it often,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.240
but spend just about 32 seconds.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.650
So they don't-- this
is the typical profile

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.550
of the information
worker who we studied.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.740
And here's what we find
when we looked at the data.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.820
We found, based on this
experience-sampling

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.590
from the probes, that when
people were in a state of focus

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.400
they spent significantly
longer on email

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.070
compared to the other states and
the other communication types.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.910
When people were either bored or
in a state of doing rote work,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.380
they spent significantly longer
doing face-to-face interaction

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.800
after.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.410
And when people were
in a state of rote work

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.110
it was followed
significantly by a longer

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.060
duration of Facebook use.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.670
And the way to
interpret this data

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:39.670
is that people first adopt
particular attentional states,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.100
particular states
of mind, which make

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.700
them susceptible to particular
kinds of interaction.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.900
Let's talk about email.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.280
So it took me six years
to find a field site that

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.820
was willing to let
itself be cut off,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.380
to have its employees be cut
off by email for a work week.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.490
And the reason we wanted
to study this was to see--

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.800
can we create an
environment where

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.080
people would have
less interruptions,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.950
could they focus longer?

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.450
Right?

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.600
And so here's what we found.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.420
We had people in this workplace.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.480
We measured them in
their baseline condition,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.250
and then we cut off their
email for a work week,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.130
and we had them wear
heart rate monitors which

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.280
provides a measure of
heart rate variability.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.080
It's the variability
of the distance

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.780
between consecutive heartbeats.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.680
And we find that
without email people

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.010
spend significantly
longer duration of focus

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.620
on any computer screen.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.990
And then the flip side-- if
you want to look at the data

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:58.250
from the flip side, you can see
that they switched about half

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.140
as often.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.660
Now, heart rate
variability revealed

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.924
that people were
significantly less stressed.

00:31:04.924 --> 00:31:06.590
You're looking at
that number and you're

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.506
saying, wait a minute.

00:31:07.506 --> 00:31:08.540
It's higher.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.680
How can that be?

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.260
That's because the higher
the variability of people's

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.610
heart rate intervals, the
intervals between the beats,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.600
the more relaxed people are.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.350
And that's because the
least little bit of stimulus

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.010
will cause you to jump.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.510
Right?

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.340
And it creates
higher variability.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.000
If you're really stressed
you're in this fight or flight

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.530
kind of syndrome.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.850
You know, the bear is chasing.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.240
You're ready to run.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.760
And your heart beats
are more irregular.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.520
So we find longer focus
and we find people are less

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.980
stressed without email.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.570
Let's talk about workplace
mood and social interactions.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:32:00.050
So there's two ways to
measure workplace mood.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.230
So first of all we
wanted to see if people's

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.340
face-to-face interaction
would produce

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.080
a different kind of
mood in the workplace

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.930
than online social interactions.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.910
And again, as I
mentioned, Facebook

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:20.480
was the most common platform
used in this company.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.990
There's two ways
of looking at this.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.060
At the time they occur,
what makes people happier?

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.300
And so let me ask you, how
many of you think of the time

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.510
they occur face-to-face
interactions make

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.330
people happier than Facebook?

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.670
How many of you think--

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:38.330
OK.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.080
How many of you think that
Facebook-- doing a Facebook

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.330
interaction makes
people happier?

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.220
OK.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.890
The answer is face-to-face.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.450
We can also look at this
at the end of the day.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.100
Because this is
really important,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.220
because the mood people
have at the end of the day

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.770
carries over into
their personal lives.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.230
So this is really
important to look at.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:07.580
How many of you think the
more time spent on Facebook

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:13.230
is associated with a happier
mood at the end of the day?

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.400
How many of you
think the more time--

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:15.900
wait.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.400
Sorry.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.140
Did I say face-to-face?

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.290
I meant to say, how many
think face-to-face--

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.500
the more time spent in
face-to-face interaction

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.100
at the workplace is
associated with a happier mood

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.218
at the end of the day?

00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:32.070
OK.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:35.790
And how many of you think the
more time spent on Facebook

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.720
is associated with a happier
mood at the end of the day?

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.310
We have one person.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:46.510
And one person, you are correct.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.560
It is Facebook.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.220
The more time people
spend on Facebook.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.200
Now, why would that be the case?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.700
Right?

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.530
It's counterintuitive.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.500
Well, we dug into
the data and we

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.070
found that when people
spent more time on Facebook

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:06.810
they were also more engaged
in their work for that day.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.030
And now it makes sense.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.830
Because if you're
really working,

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:15.340
you're really focused
and engaged in your work,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.510
the last thing you want to have
is a face-to-face interaction.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.060
Because when you have a
face-to-face interaction,

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.261
you're a prisoner
of that interaction.

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:23.760
Right?

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.750
You have the greeting ritual and
the interaction and the parting

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.020
ritual, and you can't just
break away very quickly.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.159
But with Facebook you can do
what we call grazing behavior.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:40.239
You can move in and out pretty
quickly under your control.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.050
And so that's why we think
when people were engaged

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.449
in their work
Facebook offers them

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.170
a way to do grazing
behavior, to take breaks

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.085
under their control.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.350
So what about if we
block distractions?

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.720
What happens?

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.740
Is it a good strategy
to block distractions?

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.530
Everybody complains
about distractions

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.170
from digital media.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:16.560
And there's just a
plethora of commercial apps

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.700
that are developed to enable
people to block distractions.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.060
Two basic approaches.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.190
One is you just
simply cut off sites

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.400
that people feel
would be distracting.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.500
And the other approach
is that you show people

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.320
the amount of time they spend
on different sites to increase

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.620
their awareness, with the
idea that if people become

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.440
aware how much time they
spend on social media

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.760
they might take
action to change.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.170
So we did a field study,
32 information workers.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.110
We looked around for a
commercial software to use.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.670
We found Freedom
software, which seemed

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.330
like a pretty good choice.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.435
We measured people
five days, baseline,

00:36:00.435 --> 00:36:03.810
the way they work normally,
and then five days they

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.660
worked-- but they were told to
work as they normally would,

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.360
but they used this
Freedom blocking software

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.850
to block distractions.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.390
We let people choose
what distractions

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.180
they wanted to block.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.910
It comes with a default
list of distractions,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.190
and then people
could personalize it

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.840
according to what they felt
was most distracting for them.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.340
We used a scale that's called
cognitive absorption, which

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.240
has the following dimensions.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.700
These are all related
to the idea of focusing.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.770
And we found that when
distractions were cut off

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.230
people's focused
immersion in their task

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.690
increased significantly.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:53.040
Temporal dissociation decreased.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.090
Temporal dissociation is
being unaware of time.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:03.570
People became more aware of time
when distractions were blocked.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.240
There was no difference in
people's sense of control,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.710
which totally surprised us.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.200
We thought there would be.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.090
And people's
enjoyment decreased.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.790
Well, we took away
people's social media.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.830
And there was no difference in
curiosity, another dimension.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.150
Focus increased.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.340
We interviewed everyone.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.830
Two main reasons.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.430
We removed what's called
"attention residue."

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.010
That's the idea of-- let's
say you go on Facebook.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.780
You become involved
in the content,

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.040
and that content stays with you.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.620
And when you switch
back to your task

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.150
you're still thinking
about Facebook.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.510
We took that residue away.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.340
We stopped chains
of distraction.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.040
People report just
rabbit-holing.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.750
They go on to the
internet and then they

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.555
just, before they know it
they're just kind of lost.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.260
But when we looked
at the interviews

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.030
we found there are actually two
very distinct groups of people,

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:03.370
those who reported being high
in self-control of their work

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.190
and those who
reported being low.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.950
And indeed, when we
did some more analyses

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.220
we found people who
had high self-control

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.280
were significantly
more conscientious.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.290
It's a personality trait.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:22.410
And they were significantly
less impulsive.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.780
OK.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.410
Now we went back and
we looked at the data

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.690
again in terms of these
two different groups,

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.420
and we found something
really interesting.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.110
That the low self-control
group, when their distractions

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:39.080
were blocked, there
really was no difference

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.600
in their work load, the
amount of mental expenditure

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.410
that they had.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:46.910
Yes?

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:47.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.150
GLORIA MARK: TLX is
the NASA TLX scale.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.740
It's the measure of workload.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.540
So it's a very common,
very well-validated scale

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.009
that's used for workload.

00:38:59.009 --> 00:39:00.800
However we found
something interesting with

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.930
the high self-control group.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.860
People who are very
conscientious people--

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.130
that means they're very
diligent in their work,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.430
people who feel that they're
in control of their work--

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.460
when distractions were
cut off, guess what?

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.220
Their workload
increased significantly.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:24.410
So we found this
interesting interaction.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.840
Why is that the case?

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.100
Well, the reason
is because these

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:36.200
are diligent people, work hard,
and they did not take breaks.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.180
Whereas the people who
had low self-control,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.560
they took physical breaks.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.780
They went to the
coffee room more.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.820
They interacted
with people more.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.870
But people who were very
high in self-control

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.410
continued to work straight
through without breaks.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.990
So, of course, their
workload increased.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.820
And their stress
increased significantly.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.050
One person missed her shuttle
at the end of the day.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.040
It never happened before because
she was so immersed in work

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.230
and didn't even take any breaks.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.370
So we see there is
individual differences

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:18.850
in the use of this kind of
software to block distractions.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.400
People with low
self-regulation--

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.430
we see they're more likely
to take physical breaks.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.640
We see less cognitive switching.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.290
So they did focus
significantly longer.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.610
And so we hypothesized
that the purpose

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.470
of this kind of software--

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:40.810
it's to offload this regulation
ability to the software.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:45.610
People don't have that ability,
it's not innate for them,

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.000
so they off-load it
onto the software.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.170
People who already have
high self-regulation--

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.340
well when they used this kind of
software to block distractions

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.640
they worked longer, fewer
physical breaks, and as

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.740
a result higher workload.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:07.120
And so our hypothesis is that
using this kind of software

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.660
actually interferes
with people's ability

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.111
to self-regulate.

00:41:12.111 --> 00:41:12.610
Right?

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.720
They do pretty
well on their own.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.690
And so this whole idea
of this huge business

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.250
in distraction blocking
software, that one size fits

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.450
all-- it's not true.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.090
So there's a lot
of opportunities

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:34.690
to improve work experience
based on this work.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:39.220
For example, we can think about
balancing rote and focused work

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.370
throughout the day.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.870
Right?

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.850
We don't want to
overload people.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:46.690
We want to think about
balancing people's moods.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.240
We can think about
scheduling work

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.120
based on attention
patterns, and we can also

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.300
think it's an opportunity
for interventions

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.920
that can nudge people to
increase focus, reduce

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.810
stress, and improve their mood.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.210
And this idea of
nudging is something

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.400
I've been thinking
about quite a bit.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.620
And thinking about
blocking distractions,

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:13.460
but only for those
with low control.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.030
OK.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:19.120
Now I'm going to put on my
psychologist hat to close here.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.650
OK?

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:23.140
So bear with me.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.570
Throughout the
history of psychology

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:33.190
there has always been this
idea that people take actions

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.150
in order to achieve a kind
of balanced emotional and

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.950
psychological state.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.390
It's this common thread
through eons of research.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:47.170
Hippocrates talked about this
idea of harmonious balance

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.490
with health.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.280
And Gestalt theorists, if
you're familiar with them,

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.270
talked about the
law of pragmats.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.600
Cannon talked about homeostasis.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.270
My favorite psychologist
of all is Kurt Lewin

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.760
who talked about this
idea of field theory, who

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.300
said that everything we do
in life, every action we take

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.970
is designed to reduce tension.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.370
Because tension
is uncomfortable.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.460
And you're probably familiar
with cognitive dissonance

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.890
theory, which also is this
idea of how people can reduce

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.730
this kind of imbalance
between their attitudes

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.240
and their behaviors.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.770
And so I would like to
leave you with this idea

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.940
that maybe people adjust
their use of digital media

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.670
in order to try to achieve
an internal balance.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:41.830
So because information
workers spend a good part--

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:45.190
most of their day working
with digital media,

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.030
maybe people use
it in such a way

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.090
that they're trying to
create this internal balance.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.510
So the way they
take breaks or don't

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.110
take breaks, or the
kinds of applications

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.116
they choose to work on.

00:44:02.116 --> 00:44:06.490
I want to quickly talk
about another project

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.330
that I've just been
starting, working on.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.540
This Is the largest
sensing project yet

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.430
that we have ever done
and, to my knowledge,

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.890
that anyone has ever
done in the workplace.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:23.680
And the idea here is to predict
the workplace experience.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.260
So people's health
and well-being

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.330
using unobtrusive sensors.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.770
That's really key.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.930
We can't introduce
any kind of sensors.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:37.450
That would disrupt
people's work experience.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:42.880
Our goal is to track 750
workers over one year.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.310
We have to date about
708 in the study,

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.620
and we want it to
be for a whole year

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.110
because then we can
track life events.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:57.490
We can look at what is the
effect of significant life

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:02.710
events like births and deaths
and job changes and marriages

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.120
and divorces.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.270
And we can look at seasons
and how that affects.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:12.430
And how all of this can be fed
into the sensor data to help

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:16.780
understand how it affects
people's work lives.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.800
And we will use a
robust sensing system

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.400
comprised of wearable
devices, beacons, phone agent.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.140
And we will use social media,
but not look at content.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.540
We will just look at metadata.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.050
And you can learn more here.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.550
This work could
not have been done

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.180
without the collaboration
of a number of really great

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.970
colleagues who are listed here.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:47.950
And I'd like to thank
funders and our participants.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.714
Thank you.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.054
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.980
So if anyone has any questions?

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.034
HEATHROW: We have
the question box.

00:45:59.034 --> 00:45:59.968
Questions?

00:46:03.965 --> 00:46:06.090
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between being bored

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.227
and stressed?

00:46:07.227 --> 00:46:08.310
GLORIA MARK: Between what?

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.518
AUDIENCE: Boredom and stress.

00:46:09.518 --> 00:46:10.470
Low stress.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.584
How do you distinguish
low stress from boredom?

00:46:12.584 --> 00:46:13.250
GLORIA MARK: Oh.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.040
OK.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:20.680
So they are actually related.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.160
But you can have low
stress and be happy.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.500
So there is this circumplex
model of mood where

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.820
if you have--

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:35.520
you can have low energy
and negative affect.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.570
And that's different from
having negative affect

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:43.110
and high energy.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.870
That quadrant, negative
affect, high energy,

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.060
would be defined as stress.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.450
And the quadrant of negative
affect and low energy

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.902
would be related to boredom.

00:46:54.902 --> 00:46:55.610
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:00.807 --> 00:47:02.390
AUDIENCE: So most
of your explanations

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:07.469
are in terms of mood being
affected by what work you do.

00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:09.260
To what extent do you
think your data might

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.920
be a case of what
work you choose

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.350
to do depending on your mood?

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.690
GLORIA MARK: Oh, fascinating.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:22.490
We actually can't
design causality.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:23.180
Right?

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.790
And I did not mean to
imply causality here.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.030
It's all correlation.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.310
Just like with these
huge medical studies--

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.770
you know, like smoking
and lung cancer.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.780
We can't imply causality.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.290
So we can't disentangle that.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.150
Right?

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.840
And it would be an
interesting study,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.740
but that would have to be
more of an experimental nature

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.230
to be able to induce
different kinds of moods

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.830
and then to see what kind
of work people choose.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.800
But it's hard when you're
just tracking people

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.900
in these kinds of
observational studies

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.190
to try to infer causality.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:04.737
But it's a good question.

00:48:11.122 --> 00:48:12.580
AUDIENCE: How does
this thing work?

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:16.290
So this is information
workers so it's presumably

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.350
an open office sort of a set up?

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.310
GLORIA MARK: Mixed.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.390
It's mixed.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.839
Actually, most of them were
not in open office settings.

00:48:24.839 --> 00:48:25.380
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:30.210
Do you think that has
any bearing on, like,

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.220
attention and things like that?

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.210
GLORIA MARK: Yes.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.570
So it certainly has a
bearing on interruptions.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:40.260
And so in other work we
found that, in an open office

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.500
setting, people were
more likely to be

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.160
interrupted for work that
was peripheral to what

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.280
they were doing.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:48.780
Right?

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.080
So your colleague says,
help me debug this,

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.250
or what's your opinion on this?

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.740
And it's not work for
which they are accountable.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.740
It's not tasks that
they're assigned to do.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.440
This happens more in
open office settings.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.010
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:06.180
Well, you know, if you ask
individuals they might say,

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.980
well, it's not a good thing.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.157
If you ask management
they might say, yeah.

00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:10.990
That's a good thing.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.511
We're sharing expertise.

00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:14.010
So--

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.620
AUDIENCE: What about
a sense of agency?

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.720
Like you're saying--
so it seems like it's

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720
a competition of wills.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.220
Right?

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:20.970
Who's going to win out?

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.650
Is management going to win
out or is the individual?

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.525
GLORIA MARK: [LAUGHS]

00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:26.040
AUDIENCE: So do you think
an open office deprives

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.394
workers of a sense of agency?

00:49:27.394 --> 00:49:29.810
In other words, in determining
when they'll be distracted,

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:30.270
and that kind of a thing?

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.140
GLORIA MARK: Yeah.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.640
That's really interesting.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.500
I'm not sure I would
use the word "agency."

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.680
I would-- I would
guess that people

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:46.500
who have a strong sense of
agency, high self-regulation,

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.470
should be able to
somehow create barriers.

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:54.210
But this would be at a cost
of perhaps being asocial

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.490
and not being good colleagues.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:00.180
So there is this social
trade-off as well.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.050
Right?

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.610
That it's not just
agency, it's the idea

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.660
you want to be a good
organizational citizen.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.180
Right?

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.030
And you want to expend
social capital so that you

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.859
get social benefits in
return someday, someday when

00:50:15.859 --> 00:50:17.400
you have a problem
and you want to be

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.920
able to tap into someone
else's expertise.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.660
So I think there is a lot of
interesting things at play.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.510
Agency is perhaps one
thing, but there's all kinds

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.864
of social dynamics as well.

00:50:33.182 --> 00:50:34.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.380
GLORIA MARK: Sure.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.351
AUDIENCE: So as part of
that about causation.

00:50:38.351 --> 00:50:40.100
But with the longitudinal
data that you're

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.770
planning, you will
know something

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.010
about mood before people
start work, and then can

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.361
you then look at what
they choose to do?

00:50:48.361 --> 00:50:49.110
GLORIA MARK: Yeah.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:49.820
Absolutely.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.580
So with this we can
look at time series

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.130
when we have this kind
of longitudinal data.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:59.491
I mean, we've looked
at people over weeks.

00:50:59.491 --> 00:50:59.990
Right?

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:05.870
And to some extent we can
see this kind of causality

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.250
based on time.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.290
But I would be a lot
more confident to look

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.150
at it over a much
longer period of time.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:16.200
I mean, for example, we know
that weather affects mood.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:16.970
It's causality.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.220
Because it's not the
other way around.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.122
Right?

00:51:20.122 --> 00:51:21.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.830
So we can look at
factors like that.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.910
And, you know, how does the
stock market or, you know,

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.030
factors that are really
external to the workplace

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.543
and how that's affecting people.

00:51:35.543 --> 00:51:36.450
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:38.910
GLORIA MARK: And it's also
kind of cyclic behavior.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.710
For example, I have
looked at sleep debt.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:46.580
Sleep debt is the accumulation
of loss of sleep over time.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.490
And you can-- it's kind
of a cyclic pattern

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.620
because if you don't
get a lot of sleep

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.680
we find that people spend more
time on lightweight activities

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.710
like social media,
Facebook, because it's easy.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.530
Right?

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:00.524
And then you sleep less.

00:52:00.524 --> 00:52:02.690
Oh, maybe it's because you
didn't get your work done

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:07.040
and you need to
work longer hours.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.770
So there can be these
kinds of cyclical effects.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:17.180
OK?

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:17.780
Thank you.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.530
