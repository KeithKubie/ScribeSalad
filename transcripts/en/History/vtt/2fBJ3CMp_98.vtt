00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.710
- Oh, Lord, look at that!

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.460
- In Louisiana, we have

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.250
a population explosion
in alligators.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.670
And what we seen
on the ground with our eyes

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.540
I think is a fraction
of what’s out there.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.210
But from in the air,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.790
I think we’re gonna be
a lot more accurate,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.330
especially
with the nest population.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
For every nest
you see out there,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.250
that’s a mature female.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.330
And that mature female
can have between 30 and 50 eggs.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.380
So if you got 10 nests
in an area,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.790
all of a sudden
you’re gonna have 300 to 500

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.040
new little alligators.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.210
The last few years,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.790
because of the price of gators,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.170
a lot of hunters
aren’t hunting no more.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.080
And it’s hard to believe

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.540
how much the population
has gotten out of control.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.380
And I’m scared, I’m very scared,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.790
it’s only gonna get worse.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.330
I mean, what’s gonna stop it?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.580
What’s gonna slow it down?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
- It’s not just near the water.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.330
These gators are coming into
the communities

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.460
where there’s no water at all,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.710
and everybody
in the community’s on edge.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.080
The women are scared to death
for their kids and their pets.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.500
Right now, I feel it’s like
the revenge of the alligators.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.880
It’s like
they coming for us now.
