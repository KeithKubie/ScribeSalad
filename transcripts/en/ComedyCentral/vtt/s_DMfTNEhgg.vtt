- Every comic that
y'all are gonna see tonight

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.970
has made it to a point
in their career

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.572
where you can kind of pick
and choose gigs.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.840
You do what you want.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.774
You skip
what you don't want to do.

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.176
This was one of my first shows,

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.011
and what y'all need to know
about this gig

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.115
is I was early in my career.
I was broke.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.651
This was roof money.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:29.155
This was "so rain doesn't hit
your head" money.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.425
I was gonna do this show.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.794
I was gonna do the show.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.965
So the gig was a college
in Florida.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.167
They put me up
in this really nice hotel,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.169
and there were two things
that kind of stood out

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.604
about the gig just to start.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.506
First of all,
they wanted me to wear a suit,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.974 line:92%
which, again--fine.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.509
I was gonna do the show.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.378
Second thing, the gig was
at 8:00 in the morning,

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.982
which, yeah,
good time for stand-up.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.350
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.520
You want some eggs
with those dick jokes?

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.057
So didn't matter.

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.525
I'm gonna do the show.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:11.831
No matter what,
I'm doing the show.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.165
So I'm sitting in my room.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.535
I rented a suit
from Men's Wearhouse.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.504
And I'm sitting in my room,
and it's, like, 7:40,

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.740
and I'm walking out,
'cause the gig was in the w--

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.175
it was in the downstairs,

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.542
the ballroom
where people get married.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.978
So it was inside the hotel.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.646
So I'm getting ready
to go to the gig,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.380
and I'm reaching for my door
handle, and I'm like,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.349
"Wait, let me just see
how much time they want me to do

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.552
on the show," because
sometimes you get to a gig,

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.387
and in college gigs,
they want you to do an hour.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.388
Because college gigs
are so different.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.057
They're all different.
They're not like comedy clubs.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.692
College gigs,
sometimes you'll do, like,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.160
the University of Colorado.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.396
It's already sold out,
and you kill it,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.365
and they carry you out
of that bitch like Rudy.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.735
And the next day you do
the University of Nevada,

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:52.371
and the show's at noon
in the cafeteria,

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.073
and the mic
is on the fucking floor,

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.441
and somebody just says,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.176
"Just pick the mic up
and start talking."

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.577
I'm like, "That's not
how comedy shows start.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:03.549
That's--people are
getting fish sticks."

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.252
So just remember that
all college gigs are different.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.786
So I was like,
let me just check

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.889
and see how much time
this college gig want me to do.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.224
And I looked,
and they wanted me

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.625
to do an hour,
which is fine.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.959
I can do an hour.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.529
But they didn't want me
to do stand-up.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.433
They wanted me to do
an hour speech

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.102
on note-taking
and organization.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.641
I know.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.943 line:92%
I know.

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:33.079
I know.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.316
It's, like, 7:40, and I'm,
like, this must be a mistake,

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.050
but let me just make sure,
'cause this was back--

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.452
I'll tell you
back when this was,

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.220
this is back--I had an old
Mac PowerBook,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.789
one of those big, silver Macs.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.290
And yeah,
so I just pulled up--

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.757 line:91%
I'll said just in case
they want me

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:47.293
to do some shit on note-taking,

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.828
let me just pull up--
so I pulled up an outline,

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.563
'cause I used to be a teacher,
so I was like,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.498
I could bullshit my way
through this if I have to.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.600
So I pulled up,
like, just a basic outline,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.435
so if I had to, like,
refer to a--

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:58.137
worst-case scenario,
they wanted me

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.472
to do this, I'm fine.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:03.009
So get my MacBook,
go downstairs,

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.343
get to the bottom
of the elevator,

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.145
and the elevator doors
open up,

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.447
and the liaison from the college
goes, "Are you Jackson?"

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.650
I go, "Yeah."
And she goes, "You're late."

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.685
She swings open the double doors
to this ballroom.

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:15.855
There are 750 college students

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:21.827
in suits, pantsuits,
MacBooks, iPads,

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.830
ready to hear this Negro

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.268
give a speech on something
he's never heard of.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:36.008
And I know y'all are, like,
trying to get ahead of me,

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:37.676
like y'all are smart people.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:42.347
Like, y'all are like, "But, Al,
how'd you get out of it?

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:44.183
"What's the funny part?
Get to the joke.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.685
What's the funny part?"

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:49.689
I didn't get out of it.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.191
And it wasn't funny.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:56.195
And it wasn't okay.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:58.864
I walked up there.

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.367
Got my Men's Wearhouse suit on.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:05.538
I have a giant Mac with me
for no reason.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.473
And I went up,
and it was like--

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.175
I'm a comic,
so if you give me a mic,

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.509
at least I can move around
and kinda--

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.211
but it was like
one of them podiums

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.379
that's got, like,
that Burger King microphone.

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.049
So you can't even, like, move.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:17.850
You're just, like,
behind a podium

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.752
like Napoleon Dynamite.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:23.055
So I put my MacBook down,

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.691
and this is--
this is the part that, like,

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.594
I hope y'all feel me
when I say this.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:31.497
I'm in this ballroom with all
these kids looking at me,

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.667
and people that have Macs
can feel this.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.402
I opened up my Mac,

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.905
and the battery just died,
like--

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.406
as I opened it.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:41.774
It was just, like, instant.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:42.908
It was just that grey apple.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.743
I was just like, "Oh, shit."

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:47.045
But I can't let my face say,
"Oh, shit,"

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.614
'cause I'm already gonna bomb.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.283
With the help of the computer,
I was already done.

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.753
I--this just--
I was just like, "Fuck!"

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.954
So.

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:58.090
This is happening.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.225
And, uh...

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:01.760
I know a lot of people are like,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.431
"But then what happened?
Like, how'd you get out of it?"

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:08.233
I didn't get out of it.

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.936
I stayed up there.

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:13.606
And I ate my dick for an hour.

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.945
'Cause I was gonna do this show.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:23.282
And my first manager told me,
"If you don't do your time,

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.783
that's how colleges
don't pay you."

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.718
He was like, "Stay up there
and do your time."

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:29.388
I was gonna do this show.
I was gonna do this show.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.457
And I stayed up there
for an hour.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.959
And I know, like,
this is a comedic setting,

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.461
but you have to remove yourself

00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:39.966
and think about how long
60 minutes is

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.134
in real time.

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:46.772
In real time, like,
how long 60 minutes is.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:49.909
You know how
like every third year

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.946
it's your turn to give
the Thanksgiving prayer,

00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:57.482
and it's super fucking awkward.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:00.653
And how long is that,
40 Mississippi?

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.992
Think about if you had
to give the Thanksgiving prayer

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.794
for an hour this year.

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:13.199
Only you didn't know
what a prayer was.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.169
I stayed up there
and I bombed.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.205
The college kids, they didn't
know what was going on.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.308
It was--I felt worse for them

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.942
'cause it was like
I might as well

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:27.679
have just gone up there and put
on a French film backwards.

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.715
Like, they didn't know
what was happening.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.350
I didn't know
what was happening.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.119
And I'm just bombing.
I'm sweating.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.654
And I don't sweat
at all onstage,

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.389
but when you're bombing,
like, sweat starts coming

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.459
from, like, your side
and, like, weird places.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.528
And it was
this young black dude

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.963
that booked me,
and he is, like--

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:46.965
he's got his cell phone
on that red light,

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.967
and he's waving it, giving me
the throat slash, like--

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:50.736
"Get off the stage.
Get off the stage."

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.538
And I'm like, "Nope,
you're not gonna pay me."

00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:56.375
And I stayed up there
for the whole--

00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:00.645
the whole time.

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:04.216
I get offstage,
and I have walk back through

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:05.884
the crowd of college kids

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.987
that just are stunned
at this point.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.354
Like, no one's talking,

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:12.391
and I go to get my check
from the black dude,

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.726
and he's so mad at me,

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.228
he throws my check
on the ground.

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:17.896
I needed the money.

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:21.066
I went to go pick it up,
and as I reach down to get it,

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:24.336
like, this big, 6'3",
like, 50-year-old white guy

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:26.038
brushed past me so hard--

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.840
like, if he had done it,
like, in a bar like this,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.275
it would've started a fight--
like, I mean,

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.743
he almost knocked me over.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.611
And he goes straight up
on the stage, angrily,

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:37.450
and starts giving a speech
on note-taking and organization.

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:44.023
Funny story, kids.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.094
The college fucked up
and sent me his contract.

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:52.564
[audience ohhs]

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:56.535
I was supposed to do
15 minutes of jokes

00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:01.440
to liven up his boring-ass
note-taking speech.

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:07.446
And instead,
I did his speech for him,

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:10.716
only with zero knowledge.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:13.119
'Cause I was gonna
do that show.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.954
Guys, I've been Al Jackson.
Thank y'all so much.

00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:18.424
Thank y'all.
