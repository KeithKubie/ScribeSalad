it was about the 25th anniversary of

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.550
it was about the 25th anniversary of
25th birthday of c60 and it's an

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
25th birthday of c60 and it's an
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.769
25th birthday of c60 and it's an

to 100 and 120 look to this wow this is
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.719
to 100 and 120 look to this wow this is
interesting and in fact these were

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
interesting and in fact these were
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.780
interesting and in fact these were
numbered and 40 50 60 60 was with

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
numbered and 40 50 60 60 was with

another group at Bell Labs so looks at

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880
another group at Bell Labs so looks at
 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.990
another group at Bell Labs so looks at
the same system and picked off C 60 and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
the same system and picked off C 60 and
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.060
the same system and picked off C 60 and
and they fought to fragmented it because

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070
and they fought to fragmented it because
 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.530
and they fought to fragmented it because
it was you know stronger than other

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
it was you know stronger than other
 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.030
it was you know stronger than other
things and not but they didn't seem to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
things and not but they didn't seem to
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.230
things and not but they didn't seem to
have asked the question of what it might

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
have asked the question of what it might

be so then not only that after we okay

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710
be so then not only that after we okay

be so then not only that after we okay
well let's go on because I've come back

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970
well let's go on because I've come back
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.250
well let's go on because I've come back
to this point about a year and a half

should we send you the data no there's a

little thing lesson you go and do your

little thing lesson you go and do your
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.560
little thing lesson you go and do your
own experiment because if something

what you predicted you won't be involved
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.920
what you predicted you won't be involved
you'll never be involved in the bit that

you'll never be involved in the bit that

so try when and of course we discovered

C 60 now during this experiments the we

C 60 now during this experiments the we
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.090
C 60 now during this experiments the we
saw these signals but on the fourth of

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100
saw these signals but on the fourth of
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.830

September I wrote on my printout C 60

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840
September I wrote on my printout C 60
 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.820
September I wrote on my printout C 60
question mark C 60 huge and c 70 as well

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830
question mark C 60 huge and c 70 as well
 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.370

and one of the students you Anna also

wrote on the 4th of September the same

thing that c 60 is very strong indeed

thing that c 60 is very strong indeed
 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.210

and so although C 60 had been seen

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
and so although C 60 had been seen
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.600
and so although C 60 had been seen
before I think it was the fourth of

before I think it was the fourth of
 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.270
before I think it was the fourth of
September on which we realized that it

September on which we realized that it
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.060
September on which we realized that it
was a little bit special and this is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070
was a little bit special and this is
 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.199
was a little bit special and this is
something exceptional and in fact you

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209
something exceptional and in fact you
 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.490

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470
had the brilliant idea that perhaps the
 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.490
had the brilliant idea that perhaps the
60 molecule could form be stable and he

published that in Japanese

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210

and also in a book later with his
 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.320
and also in a book later with his
professor Yoshida and so you could say

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
professor Yoshida and so you could say
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.650

the the year of conception was 1970 and

the the year of conception was 1970 and
 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.390
the the year of conception was 1970 and
it took five years to to be born also as
