00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:02.424
- [Voiceover] Let's
now introduce ourselves

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:05.656
to the idea of a differential equation.

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:06.721
And as we'll see, differential equations

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:10.688
are super useful for
modeling and simulating

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.573
phenomena and understanding
how they operate.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.038
But we'll get into that later.

00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:17.772
For now let's just think
about or at least look at

00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:20.523
what a differential equation actually is.

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:24.938
So if I were to write, so
let's see here is an example

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:27.139
of differential equation,
if I were to write that

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:31.224
the second derivative of y plus two times

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:36.007
the first derivative of y
is equal to three times y,

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.189
this right over here is
a differential equation.

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:39.722
Another way we could write it if we said

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.305
that y is a function of
x, we could write this

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:43.907
in function notation.

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:45.855
We could write the second
derivative of our function

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.920
with respect to x plus two
times the first derivative

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:54.108
of our function is equal to
three times our function.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.240
Or if we wanted to use
the Leibniz notation,

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:03.024
we could also write, the
second derivative of y

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:08.938
with respect to x plus two
times the first derivative

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:13.422
of y with respect to x is
equal to three times y.

00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:17.755
All three of these equations
are really representing

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:20.856
the same thing, they're saying
OK, can I find functions

00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:23.023
where the second
derivative of the function

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:25.025
plus two times the first
derivative of the function

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:27.937
is equal to three times
the function itself.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.339
So just to be clear,
these are all essentially

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:33.655
saying the same thing.

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:36.089
And you might have just
caught from how I described it

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:38.092
that the solution to a
differential equation

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.238
is a function, or a class of functions.

00:01:41.323 --> 00:01:44.322
It's not just a value or a set of values.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.673
So the solution here, so the solution

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:52.673
to a differential equation is a function,

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.672
or a set of functions,
or a class of functions.

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:58.805
It's important to contrast this relative

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:00.027
to a traditional equation.

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:01.421
So let me write that down.

00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:04.549
So a traditional equation,
maybe I shouldn't say

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.687
traditional equation,
differential equations

00:02:06.687 --> 00:02:08.306
have been around for a while.

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.787
So let me write this as
maybe an algebraic equation

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:13.355
that you're familiar with.

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:18.622
An algebraic equation
might look something like,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.623
and I'll just write up a simple quadratic.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:26.856
Say x squared plus three x
plus two is equal to zero.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.673
The solutions to this algebraic equation

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.255
are going to be numbers,
or a set of numbers.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.271
We can solve this, it's
going to be x plus two

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.639
times x plus one is equal to zero.

00:02:41.924 --> 00:02:45.506
So x could be equal to
negative two or x could

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:47.105
be equal to negative one.

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:52.171
The solutions here are
numbers, or a set of values

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.225
that satisfy the equation.

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:58.390
Here it's a relationship
between a function

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.286
and its derivatives.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.655
And so the solutions, or the solution,

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:03.637
is going to be a function
or a set of functions.

00:03:03.637 --> 00:03:05.456
Now let's make that a
little more tangible.

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:08.439
What would a solution to
something like any of these three,

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.072
which really represent the same thing,

00:03:10.072 --> 00:03:12.355
what would a solution actually look like?

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:16.623
Actually let me move
this over a little bit.

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:19.170
Move this over a little bit.

00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:21.508
So we can take a look at what some

00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:22.601
of these solutions could look like.

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:24.722
Let me erase this a little.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.022
This little stuff that
I have right over here.

00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:31.071
So I'm just gonna give you
examples of solutions here.

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.539
We'll verify that these
indeed are solutions

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.888
for I guess this is really
just one differential equation

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:38.190
represented in different ways.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.835
But you'll hopefully
appreciate what a solution

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.304
to a differential equation looks like.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.272
And that there is often
more than one solution.

00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:49.087
There's a whole class of functions
that could be a solution.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.556
So one solution to this
differential equation,

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:54.224
and I'll just write it as our first one.

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:57.339
So one solution, I'll call it y one.

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.523
And I could even write it as y one of x

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:01.548
to make it explicit that
it is a function of x.

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:05.364
One solutions is y one of x is equal to e

00:04:05.364 --> 00:04:08.022
to the negative three x.

00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:10.423
And I encourage you to
pause this video right now

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:13.355
and find the first derivative of y one,

00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:16.437
and the second derivative of
y one, and verify that it does

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:19.288
indeed satisfy this differential equation.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:22.455
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:23.671
So let's work through this together.

00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:25.473
So that's y one.

00:04:25.622 --> 00:04:29.555
So the first derivative of y one,

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:31.289
so we just have to do the chain rule here,

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.706
the derivative of negative
three x with respect to x

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.024
is just negative three.

00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:36.972
And the derivative of e
to the negative three x

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.975
with respect to negative three x is just e

00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:41.922
to the negative three x.

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:46.273
And if we take the second
derivative of y one,

00:04:46.273 --> 00:04:48.368
this is equal to the same exact idea,

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:50.688
the derivative of this is
three times negative three

00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:55.273
is going to be nine e
to the negative three x.

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:56.762
And now we could just
substitute these values

00:04:57.356 --> 00:04:59.223
into the differential
equation, or these expressions

00:04:59.223 --> 00:05:01.007
into the differential
equation to verify that this

00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:05.089
is indeed going to be
true for this function.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:06.372
So let's verify that.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:11.605
So we first have the
second derivative of y.

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.723
So that's that term right over there.

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:19.789
So we have nine e to the negative three x

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.789
plus two times the first derivative.

00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:29.888
So that's going to be two
times this right over here.

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:33.507
So it's going to be minus
six, I'll just write

00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:37.654
plus negative six e to
the negative three x.

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:40.256
Notice I just took this two
times the first derivative.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:44.805
Two times the first derivative
is going to be equal to,

00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:48.203
or needs to be equal to, if
this indeed does satisfy,

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:52.340
if y one does indeed satisfy
the differential equation,

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:54.682
this needs to be equal to three times y.

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:59.023
Well three times y is three
times e to the negative three x.

00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:02.189
Three e to the negative three x.

00:06:02.606 --> 00:06:04.305
Let's see if that indeed is true.

00:06:04.523 --> 00:06:07.937
So these two terms right over here,

00:06:07.937 --> 00:06:09.755
nine e to the negative three x,

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:12.788
essentially minus six e
to the negative three x,

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:15.724
that's gonna be three e
to the negative three x.

00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:20.938
Which is indeed equal to three
e to the negative three x.

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:27.923
So y one is indeed a solution
to this differential equation.

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:31.223
But as we'll see, it is
not the only solution

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:32.588
to this differential equation.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.839
For example, let's say y
two is equal to e to the x

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:46.488
is also a solution to this
differential equation.

00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:47.973
And I encourage you to
pause the video again

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:49.756
and verify that it's a solution.

00:06:50.572 --> 00:06:51.889
So assuming you've had a go at it.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.272
So the first derivative of this
is pretty straight-forward,

00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:55.521
is e to the x.

00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:58.173
Second derivative, one
of the profound things

00:06:58.173 --> 00:07:00.306
of the exponential function,
the second derivative here

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:01.773
is also e to the x.

00:07:02.224 --> 00:07:05.623
So the second derivative,
let me just do it

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:06.974
in those same colors.

00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:11.423
So the second derivative
is going to be e to the x

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:13.439
plus two times e to the x

00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:22.621
is indeed going to be equal
to three times e to the x.

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:24.522
This is absolutely going to be true.

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:27.523
E to the x plus two e to the
x is three e to the x.

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:32.170
So y two is also a solution
to this differential equation.

00:07:32.622 --> 00:07:33.855
So that's a start.

00:07:33.855 --> 00:07:35.839
In the next few videos,
we'll explore this more.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.706
We'll start to see what
the solutions look like,

00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:38.761
what classes of solutions are,

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:40.474
techniques for solving them,

00:07:40.474 --> 00:07:43.140
visualizing solutions to
differential equations,

00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:47.511
and a whole toolkit for
kind of digging in deeper.
