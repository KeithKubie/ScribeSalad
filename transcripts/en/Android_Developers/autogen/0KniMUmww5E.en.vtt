we recommend that you start with the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750
we recommend that you start with the
 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.890
we recommend that you start with the
icon our tests show showed that you

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
icon our tests show showed that you
 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.740
icon our tests show showed that you
actually will see the most impact on the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750
actually will see the most impact on the
 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.710
actually will see the most impact on the
icon so test early and make the first

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720
icon so test early and make the first
 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.030
icon so test early and make the first
thing that you really really want to

test out and so I have a so there are a
 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.580
test out and so I have a so there are a
couple of other best practices here that

with an idea in mind some hypotheses
that you want to test for only test one

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270
that you want to test for only test one
 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.300
that you want to test for only test one
thing at one time to make sure that you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
thing at one time to make sure that you
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.370

also iterate and learn from that and
 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.430
also iterate and learn from that and
then also make sure that the test that

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440
then also make sure that the test that
 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.720
then also make sure that the test that
you run is actually statistically

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730
you run is actually statistically
 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.850
you run is actually statistically
significant whenever you do so the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860
significant whenever you do so the

the developer console that shows you as
soon as the test is significant and you

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770
soon as the test is significant and you
 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.590
soon as the test is significant and you
can move on and be sure that you can

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.830
impact you can do quite quickly and no
according to the bulbs I'm assuming you

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840
according to the bulbs I'm assuming you
 

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.149
according to the bulbs I'm assuming you
don't change the appt you don't change

00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159
don't change the appt you don't change
 

00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:40.119
don't change the appt you don't change
the icon in the app itself only on the

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:40.129
the icon in the app itself only on the
 

00:21:40.129 --> 00:21:42.789
the icon in the app itself only on the
store is that something you've got to do

00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799
store is that something you've got to do
 

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:47.339
store is that something you've got to do
or so you would modify the D up I can

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:47.349
or so you would modify the D up I can
 

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:49.479
or so you would modify the D up I can
obviously that makes the most sense if

00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:49.489
obviously that makes the most sense if
 

00:21:49.489 --> 00:21:50.619
obviously that makes the most sense if
you test it actually at a very early

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:50.629
you test it actually at a very early
 

00:21:50.629 --> 00:21:53.499
you test it actually at a very early
stage of development and so that's when

00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:53.509
stage of development and so that's when
 

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:55.080
stage of development and so that's when
you actually want to test for the icon

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.090
you actually want to test for the icon
 

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.779
you actually want to test for the icon
and so you test it both on the store but

00:21:58.779 --> 00:21:58.789
and so you test it both on the store but
 

00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:01.239
and so you test it both on the store but
also for the app itself I guess what I'm

00:22:01.239 --> 00:22:01.249
also for the app itself I guess what I'm
 

00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:03.399
also for the app itself I guess what I'm
getting at if I have a different icon in

00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:03.409
getting at if I have a different icon in
 

00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:06.279
getting at if I have a different icon in
my app right I want I don't want to redo

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:06.289
my app right I want I don't want to redo
 

00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:08.259
my app right I want I don't want to redo
boiler app just to change the icon so I

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:08.269
boiler app just to change the icon so I
 

00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:10.899
boiler app just to change the icon so I
would change it on the Play Store but

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:10.909
would change it on the Play Store but
 

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:12.759
would change it on the Play Store but
then the app itself has a different icon

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:12.769
then the app itself has a different icon
 

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:16.029
then the app itself has a different icon
is that something that's okay you think

00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039
is that something that's okay you think
 

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:19.930
is that something that's okay you think
we're um I believe it's better if you

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:19.940
we're um I believe it's better if you
 

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.669
we're um I believe it's better if you
keep it consistent because it's kind of

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679
keep it consistent because it's kind of
 

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:24.460
keep it consistent because it's kind of
like your brand also but it's it's it's

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:24.470
like your brand also but it's it's it's
 

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.859
like your brand also but it's it's it's
also where any user would find your app

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:26.869
also where any user would find your app
 

00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:28.659
also where any user would find your app
begin either on the phone but also on

00:22:28.659 --> 00:22:28.669
begin either on the phone but also on
 

00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:30.099
begin either on the phone but also on
the Play Store so you want to make sure

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:30.109
the Play Store so you want to make sure
 

00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:32.440
the Play Store so you want to make sure
that it's kind of consistent but clearly

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:32.450
that it's kind of consistent but clearly
 

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.239
that it's kind of consistent but clearly
when it's actually at an early stage you

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:34.249
when it's actually at an early stage you
 

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:35.979
when it's actually at an early stage you
can easily test for it and then you can

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:35.989
can easily test for it and then you can
 

00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:37.599
can easily test for it and then you can
actually test various different

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:37.609
actually test various different
 

00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:39.249
actually test various different
iterations without having to update the

00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:39.259
iterations without having to update the
 

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:41.139
iterations without having to update the
app so if that is at an early stage I

00:22:41.139 --> 00:22:41.149
app so if that is at an early stage I
 

00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:43.180
app so if that is at an early stage I
think that's totally fine but generally

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.190
think that's totally fine but generally
 

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.859
think that's totally fine but generally
make sure to keep it consistent as well

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:44.869
make sure to keep it consistent as well
 

00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:46.509
make sure to keep it consistent as well
okay that means if i want to change back

00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:46.519
okay that means if i want to change back
 

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:48.279
okay that means if i want to change back
into the holidays i would need to deploy

00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:48.289
into the holidays i would need to deploy
 

00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:50.830
into the holidays i would need to deploy
a new APK just to change the icons in

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840
a new APK just to change the icons in
 

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.789
a new APK just to change the icons in

you don't have to actually modify or

00:22:57.129 --> 00:22:57.139
you don't have to actually modify or
 

00:22:57.139 --> 00:22:59.289
you don't have to actually modify or
adjust the APK so that's just a change

00:22:59.289 --> 00:22:59.299
adjust the APK so that's just a change
 

00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:02.080
adjust the APK so that's just a change
with and developer console okay so there

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.090
with and developer console okay so there
 

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.599
with and developer console okay so there
may be a couple more questions do you

00:23:04.599 --> 00:23:04.609
may be a couple more questions do you
 

00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:07.060
may be a couple more questions do you

translation services because i used to

00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:08.989
translation services because i used to
 

00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:11.649
translation services because i used to
have to use them and then we will decide

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:11.659
have to use them and then we will decide
 

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.810
have to use them and then we will decide
to support some Nordic languages by

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:13.820
to support some Nordic languages by
 

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.690
to support some Nordic languages by
Norwegian Swedish Finnish so on and they

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:16.700
Norwegian Swedish Finnish so on and they
 

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.519
Norwegian Swedish Finnish so on and they
were not available so i had to switch to

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:18.529
were not available so i had to switch to
 

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:20.769
were not available so i had to switch to
different service hmm so is that

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:20.779
different service hmm so is that
 

00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:22.330
different service hmm so is that
something that you guys keep changing I

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:22.340
something that you guys keep changing I
 

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.649
something that you guys keep changing I
haven't checked for a few months but

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:23.659
haven't checked for a few months but
 

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:25.539
haven't checked for a few months but
it's something that you expanding

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:25.549
it's something that you expanding
 

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:27.549
it's something that you expanding
constantly or like yeah I would check

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559
constantly or like yeah I would check
 

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:28.810
constantly or like yeah I would check
again i'm pretty sure that there are a

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:28.820
again i'm pretty sure that there are a
 

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.369
again i'm pretty sure that there are a
lot of languages that are covered right

00:23:30.369 --> 00:23:30.379
lot of languages that are covered right
 

00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:32.049
lot of languages that are covered right
now off the top of my head i don't know

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:32.059
now off the top of my head i don't know
 

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:34.659
now off the top of my head i don't know
the specific ones but again because at

00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:34.669
the specific ones but again because at
 

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:35.799
the specific ones but again because at
least if you're purchasing the

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:35.809
least if you're purchasing the
 

00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:37.089
least if you're purchasing the
translations through google it's those

00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:37.099
translations through google it's those
 

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:38.799
translations through google it's those
third-party vendors you should

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:38.809
third-party vendors you should
 

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:40.389
third-party vendors you should
be able to find someone out there who's

00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:40.399
be able to find someone out there who's
 

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:41.799
be able to find someone out there who's
been vetted by Google who's going to be

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:41.809
been vetted by Google who's going to be
 

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:43.029
been vetted by Google who's going to be
able to translate into that language

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039
able to translate into that language
 

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:45.430
able to translate into that language
that you want okay also you mentioned

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440
that you want okay also you mentioned
 

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.340
that you want okay also you mentioned
that if you don't translate the store

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:48.350
that if you don't translate the store
 

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.200
that if you don't translate the store
description is shown either in default

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.210

language or other translated do we have

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:53.090
language or other translated do we have
 

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.700
language or other translated do we have
any control or that or it's like

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:54.710
any control or that or it's like
 

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.610
any control or that or it's like
automatic user setting yeah i'm not sure

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:57.620
automatic user setting yeah i'm not sure
 

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.169
automatic user setting yeah i'm not sure
if there's any specific control that you

00:23:59.169 --> 00:23:59.179
if there's any specific control that you
 

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:01.509
if there's any specific control that you
have over saying which it is you know

00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:01.519
have over saying which it is you know
 

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.470
have over saying which it is you know
the user will have their default

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480
the user will have their default
 

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.239
the user will have their default
language and then i mean if you go on

00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:04.249
language and then i mean if you go on
 

00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:05.499
language and then i mean if you go on
the Play Store on desktop right there's

00:24:05.499 --> 00:24:05.509
the Play Store on desktop right there's
 

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:06.879
the Play Store on desktop right there's
that little thing that pops is you want

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:06.889
that little thing that pops is you want
 

00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.259
that little thing that pops is you want
Google to translate this and then they

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:08.269
Google to translate this and then they
 

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:09.730
Google to translate this and then they
can click it so I mean I guess there's

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:09.740
can click it so I mean I guess there's
 

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.200
can click it so I mean I guess there's
sort of some control the user clicks

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.210
sort of some control the user clicks
 

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.119
sort of some control the user clicks
that or not but I mean I'd say you know

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:13.129
that or not but I mean I'd say you know
 

00:24:13.129 --> 00:24:15.340
that or not but I mean I'd say you know
best practice is probably just to have a

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:15.350
best practice is probably just to have a
 

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.570
best practice is probably just to have a
translation and therefore whatever

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:16.580
translation and therefore whatever
 

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.820
translation and therefore whatever
language the users are okay and the last

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:18.830
language the users are okay and the last
 

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.299
language the users are okay and the last
question is developer page do you have

00:24:22.299 --> 00:24:22.309
question is developer page do you have
 

00:24:22.309 --> 00:24:24.970
question is developer page do you have
any data on the impact that it makes is

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:24.980
any data on the impact that it makes is
 

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.799
any data on the impact that it makes is
it the worthy investment so I actually

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:26.809
it the worthy investment so I actually
 

00:24:26.809 --> 00:24:29.590
it the worthy investment so I actually
just go do it right now you have any

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600
just go do it right now you have any
 

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.289
just go do it right now you have any
weight anything yep so nothing specific

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:32.299
weight anything yep so nothing specific
 

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:34.659
weight anything yep so nothing specific

that we were going to share yet but you
 

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:36.129
that we were going to share yet but you

between your apps it's a good way that

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:44.119
between your apps it's a good way that
 

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:45.970
between your apps it's a good way that
you can show the different featured app

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:45.980
you can show the different featured app
 

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.230
you can show the different featured app
or some of the other apps that you have

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240
or some of the other apps that you have
 

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.539
or some of the other apps that you have
but yeah I'm sure at some point that you

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:49.549
but yeah I'm sure at some point that you
 

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:51.100
but yeah I'm sure at some point that you
know what will release some information

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.110
know what will release some information
 

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.720
know what will release some information
on that okay so I'm guessing for a

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:52.730
on that okay so I'm guessing for a
 

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.789
on that okay so I'm guessing for a
single app if the developer has just

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799
single app if the developer has just
 

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:55.960
single app if the developer has just
want to happen baby it's not as

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:55.970
want to happen baby it's not as
 

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.669
want to happen baby it's not as
available but I can clearly see if you

00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679
available but I can clearly see if you
 

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.379
available but I can clearly see if you
have multiples that's a way to promote I

00:24:59.379 --> 00:24:59.389
have multiples that's a way to promote I
 

00:24:59.389 --> 00:25:01.539
have multiples that's a way to promote I
mean even if you only have one app there

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:01.549
mean even if you only have one app there
 

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:03.009
mean even if you only have one app there
you can still pin it to the top and have

00:25:03.009 --> 00:25:03.019
you can still pin it to the top and have
 

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:04.419
you can still pin it to the top and have
that as sort of your mini featured app

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:04.429
that as sort of your mini featured app
 

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:06.070
that as sort of your mini featured app
so I think it can still be a strong way

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
so I think it can still be a strong way
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.919
so I think it can still be a strong way
to promote your brand also the cost is

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:08.929
to promote your brand also the cost is
 

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:10.629
to promote your brand also the cost is
actually very low right like it's a it's

00:25:10.629 --> 00:25:10.639
actually very low right like it's a it's
 

00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:12.759
actually very low right like it's a it's
something that takes you a minute and at

00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:12.769
something that takes you a minute and at
 

00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:14.379
something that takes you a minute and at
the same time like there is no cost

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:14.389
the same time like there is no cost
 

00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:17.139
the same time like there is no cost
associated with itself so it's bright

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:17.149
associated with itself so it's bright
 

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:18.220
associated with itself so it's bright
it's pretty straightforward and pretty

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:18.230
it's pretty straightforward and pretty
 

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.419
it's pretty straightforward and pretty
easy to set up great talk thank you for

00:25:22.419 --> 00:25:22.429
easy to set up great talk thank you for
 

00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:24.070
easy to set up great talk thank you for
sharing yeah I have a question related

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080
sharing yeah I have a question related
 

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.249
sharing yeah I have a question related
to staged rollout can you elaborate a

00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:27.259
to staged rollout can you elaborate a
 

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:30.530
to staged rollout can you elaborate a
little bit more about selection of

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:30.540
little bit more about selection of
 

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.160
little bit more about selection of
you and upgrade accusers about upgrading

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.170
you and upgrade accusers about upgrading
 

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.800
you and upgrade accusers about upgrading
for the same percentage of users so when

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:39.810
for the same percentage of users so when
 

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.710
for the same percentage of users so when
once you have pushed for example we

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720
once you have pushed for example we
 

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.170
once you have pushed for example we
released it like for ten percent and we

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:45.180
released it like for ten percent and we
 

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.600
released it like for ten percent and we
found some critical issues in it and we

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:47.610
found some critical issues in it and we
 

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:51.680
found some critical issues in it and we
roll out a new apk for the same

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:51.690
roll out a new apk for the same
 

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:55.910
roll out a new apk for the same
percentage yep what will happen yeah so

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:55.920
percentage yep what will happen yeah so
 

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.150
percentage yep what will happen yeah so
it gets a little trickier so you know we

00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.160
it gets a little trickier so you know we
 

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.950
it gets a little trickier so you know we
can we can sink real quick afterwards

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960
can we can sink real quick afterwards
 

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.910
can we can sink real quick afterwards
and I can show you there's a nice

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:01.920
and I can show you there's a nice
 

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.320
and I can show you there's a nice
support page actually in the in the

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.330
support page actually in the in the
 

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.480
support page actually in the in the
develop of it that says yeah so you roll

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.490
develop of it that says yeah so you roll
 

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.980
develop of it that says yeah so you roll
out its point ten percent or something

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:06.990
out its point ten percent or something
 

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.840
out its point ten percent or something
if you find an issue and you want to

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:08.850
if you find an issue and you want to
 

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.220
if you find an issue and you want to
update it you know how do you get that

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.230
update it you know how do you get that
 

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.500
update it you know how do you get that
that update to go to the ten percent if

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.510
that update to go to the ten percent if
 

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.760
that update to go to the ten percent if
you want to keep iterating or something

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:13.770
you want to keep iterating or something
 

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.990
you want to keep iterating or something
so let's let me come over there

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000
so let's let me come over there
 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.190
so let's let me come over there
afterwards and I'll show you the page I

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200
afterwards and I'll show you the page I
 

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.080
afterwards and I'll show you the page I
believe so because again we don't you

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.090
believe so because again we don't you
 

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.550
believe so because again we don't you
know we don't want to push 10 and you've

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:22.560
know we don't want to push 10 and you've
 

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.810
know we don't want to push 10 and you've
issues with it then you're gonna push it

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820
issues with it then you're gonna push it
 

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.490
issues with it then you're gonna push it
to another ten percent or something so

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500
to another ten percent or something so
 

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.630
to another ten percent or something so
yeah that's the point of sort of this

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640
yeah that's the point of sort of this
 

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.120
yeah that's the point of sort of this
staged rollout concept but again i'll

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.130
staged rollout concept but again i'll
 

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.740
staged rollout concept but again i'll
show you guys the actual page where

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:30.750
show you guys the actual page where
 

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.660
show you guys the actual page where
outlines very very specifically how you

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:32.670
outlines very very specifically how you
 

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.850
outlines very very specifically how you
can do that actually we're quite

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860
can do that actually we're quite
 

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.140
can do that actually we're quite
familiar with this place yeah exactly

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.150
familiar with this place yeah exactly
 

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.560
familiar with this place yeah exactly
was mentioned we'll just the same ten

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:42.570
was mentioned we'll just the same ten
 

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.230
was mentioned we'll just the same ten
percent of users receive the update I

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240
percent of users receive the update I
 

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.320
percent of users receive the update I
believe so yes but if it doesn't say so

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.330
believe so yes but if it doesn't say so
 

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.720
believe so yes but if it doesn't say so
specifically on there that one staged

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:50.730
specifically on there that one staged
 

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.910
specifically on there that one staged
rollout bit then i'm not sure up top my

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:52.920
rollout bit then i'm not sure up top my
 

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.650
rollout bit then i'm not sure up top my
head but let's follow up i want to get

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:54.660
head but let's follow up i want to get
 

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.500
head but let's follow up i want to get
you the answer and another part what is

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:57.510
you the answer and another part what is
 

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.930
you the answer and another part what is
the percentage between you and upgrading

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940
the percentage between you and upgrading
 

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.140
the percentage between you and upgrading
theaters when we allowed it to the same

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.150
theaters when we allowed it to the same
 

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.540
theaters when we allowed it to the same
ten percent will it be like five percent

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.550
ten percent will it be like five percent
 

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.940
ten percent will it be like five percent
of new users and five percent of

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:07.950
of new users and five percent of
 

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.650
of new users and five percent of
upgrading upgrading to you the floor

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:09.660
upgrading upgrading to you the floor
 

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.470
upgrading upgrading to you the floor
something different in terms of who gets

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480
something different in terms of who gets
 

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.870
something different in terms of who gets
pushed that yes i don't think there's

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880
pushed that yes i don't think there's
 

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.700
pushed that yes i don't think there's
any specifics i think it's pretty pretty

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:16.710
any specifics i think it's pretty pretty
 

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.440
any specifics i think it's pretty pretty

pushes it to a subset of your user base
 

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.360
pushes it to a subset of your user base
out there so there is no guarantee that

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:24.370
out there so there is no guarantee that
 

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.640
out there so there is no guarantee that
will be any new user or any update

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:26.650

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:35.470
it's not a fair review of our app
 

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.710
it's not a fair review of our app
because you know we don't advertise that

we like we know we're giving away
 

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.130
we like we know we're giving away
anything for free so that's one issue so

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.140
anything for free so that's one issue so
 

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.200
anything for free so that's one issue so
i can take that real quick so one of the

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.210
i can take that real quick so one of the
 

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.580
i can take that real quick so one of the
cool things within the developer console

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:47.590
cool things within the developer console
 

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.960
cool things within the developer console
is you can actually respond to user

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:48.970
is you can actually respond to user
 

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.520
is you can actually respond to user
reviews so that's something that we

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:50.530
reviews so that's something that we
 

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.720
reviews so that's something that we
definitely would recommend that

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:51.730
definitely would recommend that
 

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.760
definitely would recommend that
developers do so if you get a one-star

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:53.770
developers do so if you get a one-star
 

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.020
developers do so if you get a one-star
review particularly if it's something

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.030
review particularly if it's something
 

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.490
review particularly if it's something
where you know the user should have

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:56.500
where you know the user should have
 

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.810
where you know the user should have
known they had to pay for something or

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:57.820
known they had to pay for something or
 

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.190
known they had to pay for something or
there's an issue like that you can

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200
there's an issue like that you can
 

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.630
there's an issue like that you can
respond to that user review and it's

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640
respond to that user review and it's
 

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.190
respond to that user review and it's
going to show up right below that right

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200
going to show up right below that right
 

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.840
going to show up right below that right
i mean we're definitely aware of that

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:03.850
i mean we're definitely aware of that
 

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.550
i mean we're definitely aware of that
and we've we've tried that with a very

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:05.560
and we've we've tried that with a very
 

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.820
and we've we've tried that with a very
very limited request i mean you know

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:07.830
very limited request i mean you know
 

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.620
very limited request i mean you know
just you know most users at that point

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:10.630
just you know most users at that point
 

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.900
just you know most users at that point
don't care enough to update the review

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:12.910
don't care enough to update the review
 

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.600
don't care enough to update the review
or no they're still not happy with like

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:15.610
or no they're still not happy with like
 

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.190
or no they're still not happy with like
you know what it still doesn't meet

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200
you know what it still doesn't meet
 

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.680
you know what it still doesn't meet
their expectations so that's one thing

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:19.690
their expectations so that's one thing
 

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.510
their expectations so that's one thing
that you know I don't really have a

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520
that you know I don't really have a
 

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.280
that you know I don't really have a
suggestion for like how to improve but

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:23.290
suggestion for like how to improve but
 

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:28.400
suggestion for like how to improve but
some sort of know right

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:28.410
some sort of know right
 

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.530
some sort of know right
having some sort of criteria I like

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:30.540
having some sort of criteria I like
 

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.840
having some sort of criteria I like
that's so for example that the helpful

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:32.850
that's so for example that the helpful
 

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.160
that's so for example that the helpful
reviews section sort of sorting

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.170
reviews section sort of sorting
 

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.380
reviews section sort of sorting
theoretically could help but in like

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:39.390
theoretically could help but in like
 

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.210
theoretically could help but in like
we've noticed on our app that it doesn't

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220
we've noticed on our app that it doesn't
 

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.470
we've noticed on our app that it doesn't
like some of those new reviews are

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480
like some of those new reviews are
 

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.750
like some of those new reviews are
actually ranked up a pie on the helpful

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760
actually ranked up a pie on the helpful
 

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.830
actually ranked up a pie on the helpful
when it sort of bite helpfulness so

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840
when it sort of bite helpfulness so
 

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.420
when it sort of bite helpfulness so
that's one thing if like the helpfulness

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:50.430
that's one thing if like the helpfulness
 

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.090
that's one thing if like the helpfulness
could be improved that could actually

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100
could be improved that could actually
 

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.460
could be improved that could actually
help a lesion on maybe what the average

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:55.470
help a lesion on maybe what the average
 

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.650
help a lesion on maybe what the average
score but with the with the order of the

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:57.660
score but with the with the order of the
 

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.630
score but with the with the order of the
reason so one of the things that some

00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640
reason so one of the things that some
 

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.190
reason so one of the things that some
developers do if when you're responding

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200
developers do if when you're responding
 

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.570
developers do if when you're responding
to review that's particularly negative

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580
to review that's particularly negative
 

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.850

say hey good and contact us at support

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860
say hey good and contact us at support
 

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.340
say hey good and contact us at support
at brians app com or something and then

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:07.350
at brians app com or something and then
 

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.660
at brians app com or something and then
you have a sort of different form that

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:08.670
you have a sort of different form that
 

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.980
you have a sort of different form that
you can try to resolve the issue and

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:09.990
you can try to resolve the issue and
 

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.510
you can try to resolve the issue and
then maybe that could incentivize them

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520
then maybe that could incentivize them
 

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.180
then maybe that could incentivize them
to go back later and actually you know

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.190
to go back later and actually you know
 

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.620
to go back later and actually you know
actually update the review update the

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:15.630
actually update the review update the
 

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.130
actually update the review update the

star that they put their you can also
 

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.020
star that they put their you can also
you can also really try and test various

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.030
you can also really try and test various
 

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.760
you can also really try and test various
different descriptions around it to be

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:22.770
different descriptions around it to be
 

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.350
different descriptions around it to be
very explicit about like what your app

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360
very explicit about like what your app
 

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.600
very explicit about like what your app
is all about so that users before the

downloaded really get a good
 

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.780
downloaded really get a good
understanding about like what the app is

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:29.790
understanding about like what the app is
 

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.340
understanding about like what the app is
all about and you can test various

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.350
all about and you can test various
 

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.080
all about and you can test various
different descriptions as well so that

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.090
different descriptions as well so that
 

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.030
different descriptions as well so that
lecture to my next question is there any

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.040
lecture to my next question is there any
 

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.860
lecture to my next question is there any
way it would be I there may be away I'm

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:36.870
way it would be I there may be away I'm
 

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.440
way it would be I there may be away I'm
not aware of it mr. it would be cool if

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.450
not aware of it mr. it would be cool if
 

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.760
not aware of it mr. it would be cool if
you could see the stats for how many

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:43.770
you could see the stats for how many
 

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.760
you could see the stats for how many
times and if users actually expand the

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:46.770
times and if users actually expand the
 

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.410
times and if users actually expand the
description because the description as

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:48.420
description because the description as
 

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.670
description because the description as
you see it normally is just like two

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:49.680
you see it normally is just like two
 

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.750
you see it normally is just like two
lines and then

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760
lines and then
 

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.820
lines and then
you know you can't really fit much in

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:53.830
you know you can't really fit much in
 

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.680
you know you can't really fit much in
there so it'd be interesting to see a

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:55.690
there so it'd be interesting to see a
 

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.300
there so it'd be interesting to see a
look how many of those users are

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:57.310
look how many of those users are
 

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.680
look how many of those users are
actually reading the description because

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:58.690
actually reading the description because
 

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.050
actually reading the description because
I would suspect that you know most don't

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.060
I would suspect that you know most don't
 

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.290
I would suspect that you know most don't
I mean I I typically never do myself so

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:04.300
I mean I I typically never do myself so
 

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.870
I mean I I typically never do myself so
that's that's one thing the show more or

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880
that's that's one thing the show more or
 

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.270
that's that's one thing the show more or
whatever with a tad there yeah so we

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:09.280
whatever with a tad there yeah so we
 

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.010
whatever with a tad there yeah so we
don't have any stats around it but it's

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.020
don't have any stats around it but it's
 

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.960
don't have any stats around it but it's
definitely something anything that you

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:12.970
definitely something anything that you
 

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.430
definitely something anything that you
think is really really important to

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440
think is really really important to
 

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.680
think is really really important to
communicate the users make sure to have

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:16.690
communicate the users make sure to have
 

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.930
communicate the users make sure to have
it above the fold so that most of the

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:18.940
it above the fold so that most of the
 

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.400
it above the fold so that most of the
users actually see it or all of the

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:20.410
users actually see it or all of the
 

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.160
users actually see it or all of the
users seed there's definitely a break

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:23.170
users seed there's definitely a break
 

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.630
users seed there's definitely a break
off as soon as you actually have to

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640
off as soon as you actually have to
 

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.430
off as soon as you actually have to
expel okay and and with beta testing

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440
expel okay and and with beta testing
 

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.530
expel okay and and with beta testing
again I have very limited experience but

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:31.540
again I have very limited experience but
 

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:36.200
again I have very limited experience but
I was as far as i understand through

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:36.210
I was as far as i understand through
 

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.060
I was as far as i understand through
well basically I I sort of felt like it

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.070
well basically I I sort of felt like it
 

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.860
well basically I I sort of felt like it
would be nice if there were more avenues

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:40.870
would be nice if there were more avenues
 

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.110
would be nice if there were more avenues
to get input from the beta testers for

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120
to get input from the beta testers for
 

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.590
to get input from the beta testers for
example you know if I'm like you know if

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600
example you know if I'm like you know if
 

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.150
example you know if I'm like you know if
I don't have access to a lot of devices

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:48.160
I don't have access to a lot of devices
 

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.740
I don't have access to a lot of devices
and i'm using my beta testers of sight

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.750
and i'm using my beta testers of sight
 

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.990
and i'm using my beta testers of sight
okay like you like okay like you have a

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000
okay like you like okay like you have a
 

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.690
okay like you like okay like you have a
samsung device you have a LG device and

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:54.700
samsung device you have a LG device and
 

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.060
samsung device you have a LG device and
you know one of these devices like has a

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.070
you know one of these devices like has a
 

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.210
you know one of these devices like has a
problem an easier way for that user to

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:00.220
problem an easier way for that user to
 

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.920
problem an easier way for that user to
be able to submit either screenshots or

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:01.930
be able to submit either screenshots or
 

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.720
be able to submit either screenshots or
like scream screen recording or

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:03.730
like scream screen recording or
 

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.060
like scream screen recording or
something like that to me so I can you

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.070
something like that to me so I can you
 

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.980
something like that to me so I can you
know see what the issue is it like it

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:07.990
know see what the issue is it like it
 

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.330
know see what the issue is it like it
might not be a crash just like it might

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.340
might not be a crash just like it might
 

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.770
might not be a crash just like it might
be a layout issue or something like that

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:10.780
be a layout issue or something like that
 

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.340
be a layout issue or something like that
so that would be really helpful so more

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:14.350
so that would be really helpful so more
 

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.160
so that would be really helpful so more
avenues of sort of communication and

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.170
avenues of sort of communication and
 

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.840
avenues of sort of communication and
data collection of course what the users

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:18.850
data collection of course what the users
 

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.280
data collection of course what the users
are approval in each individual case for

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:23.290
are approval in each individual case for
 

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.760
are approval in each individual case for
beta testers so there is one way that

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:26.770
beta testers so there is one way that
 

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.160
beta testers so there is one way that
you can do that so for beta testing you

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.170
you can do that so for beta testing you
 

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.620
you can do that so for beta testing you
can actually now not only use the group

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:31.630
can actually now not only use the group
 

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.840
can actually now not only use the group
but you can also actually create a link

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:33.850
but you can also actually create a link
 

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.880
but you can also actually create a link
and that link can be distributed through

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:35.890
and that link can be distributed through
 

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.310
and that link can be distributed through
whatever channel you want to and so if

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320
whatever channel you want to and so if
 

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.830
whatever channel you want to and so if
you start a campaign and I could be for

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840
you start a campaign and I could be for
 

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.660
you start a campaign and I could be for
example an AdWords campaign where you

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:42.670
example an AdWords campaign where you
 

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.940
example an AdWords campaign where you
can target a specific device then you

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:44.950
can target a specific device then you
 

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:50.010
can target a specific device then you
can push out your betta BK to a couple

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.020
can push out your betta BK to a couple
 

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.020
can push out your betta BK to a couple
of users there are all on that specific

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.030
of users there are all on that specific
 

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.430
of users there are all on that specific
device which allows you to learn much

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440
device which allows you to learn much
 

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.740
device which allows you to learn much
more about users for the specific device

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:55.750
more about users for the specific device
 

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.600
more about users for the specific device
that's one way to do it and you can

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.610
that's one way to do it and you can
 

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.030
that's one way to do it and you can
choose whichever channel use to push it

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.040
choose whichever channel use to push it
 

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.310
choose whichever channel use to push it
out but one way that I'm familiar with

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320
out but one way that I'm familiar with
 

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.779
out but one way that I'm familiar with
is actually if you use that

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:03.789
is actually if you use that
 

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:06.409
is actually if you use that
words and you just target specifically

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419
words and you just target specifically
 

00:33:06.419 --> 00:33:09.299
words and you just target specifically
users that have the specific device and

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:09.309
users that have the specific device and
 

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:10.889
users that have the specific device and
you'll get feedback from them right

00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:10.899
you'll get feedback from them right
 

00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:12.210
you'll get feedback from them right
right I'm talking about the next step

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:12.220
right I'm talking about the next step
 

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.070
right I'm talking about the next step
where is like if one of those advice has

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080
where is like if one of those advice has
 

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.749
where is like if one of those advice has
a specific issue for example a layout

00:33:15.749 --> 00:33:15.759
a specific issue for example a layout
 

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:18.810
a specific issue for example a layout
issue you know it'd be nice if I could

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:18.820
issue you know it'd be nice if I could
 

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.840
issue you know it'd be nice if I could
that the user could submit you know a

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:21.850
that the user could submit you know a
 

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.680
that the user could submit you know a
screenshot or a screen recording of that

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:25.690
screenshot or a screen recording of that

extractor feedback but you know I would
 

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.509
extractor feedback but you know I would
say just you know figure out which you

00:35:21.509 --> 00:35:21.519
say just you know figure out which you

definitely some different signals that

definitely some different signals that
 

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.150
definitely some different signals that
you could use to figure out who you

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160
you could use to figure out who you
 

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.740
you could use to figure out who you
should prompt with that rather than just

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:40.750
should prompt with that rather than just
 

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:46.730
should prompt with that rather than just
sort of spam everybody with it hey guys

having negative feedback from a
 

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.160
having negative feedback from a
developer standpoint alpha beta and

not being able to do so like say for

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240
not being able to do so like say for
 

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.170

instance adding a certain feature in a

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:01.180
instance adding a certain feature in a
 

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.039

manifest or raising target SDK and
 

00:36:04.049 --> 00:36:06.390
manifest or raising target SDK and
having that be bumped and then not being

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400
having that be bumped and then not being
 

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.670
having that be bumped and then not being
able to take a step backwards that's

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680
able to take a step backwards that's
 

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.319
able to take a step backwards that's
tough again I'm I'd say let's let's meet

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:16.329
tough again I'm I'd say let's let's meet
 

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:17.670
tough again I'm I'd say let's let's meet
afterwards and we can look at again the

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680
afterwards and we can look at again the
 

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.740
afterwards and we can look at again the
specifics of when you roll a future out

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:19.750
specifics of when you roll a future out
 

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.789
specifics of when you roll a future out
when you roll it back when you're

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:20.799
when you roll it back when you're
 

00:36:20.799 --> 00:36:22.230
when you roll it back when you're
pushing a certain percentage pushing

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240
pushing a certain percentage pushing
 

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.339
pushing a certain percentage pushing
back because I want to give any

00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:23.349
back because I want to give any
 

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:25.319
back because I want to give any
misinformation but you know the whole

00:36:25.319 --> 00:36:25.329
misinformation but you know the whole
 

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:26.370
misinformation but you know the whole
point though is right you're gonna be

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:26.380
point though is right you're gonna be
 

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.450
point though is right you're gonna be
able to push it out to certain set of

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:27.460
able to push it out to certain set of
 

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.680
able to push it out to certain set of
users you're gonna be able to iterate

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:28.690
users you're gonna be able to iterate
 

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.599
users you're gonna be able to iterate
and launch and I suppose you could

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:30.609
and launch and I suppose you could
 

00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:31.890
and launch and I suppose you could
always just if you have a previous

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:31.900
always just if you have a previous
 

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.970
always just if you have a previous
version you want to roll back to right

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:32.980
version you want to roll back to right
 

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.740
version you want to roll back to right
maybe push that one out instead but

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:34.750
maybe push that one out instead but
 

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.420
maybe push that one out instead but
again let's let's think afterwards

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:36.430
again let's let's think afterwards
 

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:37.740
again let's let's think afterwards
instead of me trying to tell you off the

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:37.750
instead of me trying to tell you off the
 

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.960
instead of me trying to tell you off the
top of my head

have you guys seen any successful

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320
have you guys seen any successful
 

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.260
have you guys seen any successful
strategies for managing it operates and

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.270
strategies for managing it operates and
 

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.480
strategies for managing it operates and
apps and are you guys working on

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:48.490
apps and are you guys working on
 

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.920
apps and are you guys working on
anything to make that easier for

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:49.930
anything to make that easier for
 

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:54.930
anything to make that easier for
developers what's the question if we

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:54.940
developers what's the question if we
 

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.450
developers what's the question if we
have seen any successful premium apps no

00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460
have seen any successful premium apps no
 

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.609
have seen any successful premium apps no
good strategies for handling up rates or

00:37:02.609 --> 00:37:02.619
good strategies for handling up rates or
 

00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:06.210
good strategies for handling up rates or
paid upgrades or updates sorry yeah you

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:06.220
paid upgrades or updates sorry yeah you
 

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.650
paid upgrades or updates sorry yeah you
do a 2 point 0 would be able to charge

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:07.660
do a 2 point 0 would be able to charge
 

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.190
do a 2 point 0 would be able to charge
for it have you seen any 16 had have any

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200
for it have you seen any 16 had have any
 

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.570
for it have you seen any 16 had have any
patterns that are successful for that

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:12.580
patterns that are successful for that
 

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.970
patterns that are successful for that
and are you guys thinking about it or

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:14.980
and are you guys thinking about it or
 

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.120
and are you guys thinking about it or
have any ideas towards that yeah

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.130
have any ideas towards that yeah
 

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.170
have any ideas towards that yeah
definitely there are a couple of

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.180
definitely there are a couple of
 

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.420
definitely there are a couple of
examples out there I really just look at

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:21.430
examples out there I really just look at
 

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.470
examples out there I really just look at
like apps or games that are there are

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480
like apps or games that are there are
 

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.420
like apps or games that are there are
doing this successfully I don't want to

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:27.430
doing this successfully I don't want to
 

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.280
doing this successfully I don't want to
actually point one or the other that is

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.290
actually point one or the other that is
 

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.020
actually point one or the other that is
actually of the partners that we work

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.030
actually of the partners that we work
 

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.390
actually of the partners that we work
with point out here but we can sync

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400
with point out here but we can sync
 

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.270
with point out here but we can sync
definitely later on it's also good

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280
definitely later on it's also good
 

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.070
definitely later on it's also good
practice to kind of like if you have the

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:38.080
practice to kind of like if you have the
 

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.020
practice to kind of like if you have the
same app right leg over think about is

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.030
same app right leg over think about is
 

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.470
same app right leg over think about is
it hard to get your uses from a paid app

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480
it hard to get your uses from a paid app
 

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.320
it hard to get your uses from a paid app
be in many cases it's probably better to

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:46.330
be in many cases it's probably better to
 

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.120
be in many cases it's probably better to
actually keep the users in there and

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.130
actually keep the users in there and
 

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.370
actually keep the users in there and
offer additional content and potentially

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.380
offer additional content and potentially
 

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.890
offer additional content and potentially
upsell your content in there there can

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:52.900
upsell your content in there there can
 

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.300
upsell your content in there there can
be a break up if you actually want to

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:54.310
be a break up if you actually want to
 

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.820
be a break up if you actually want to
push your users to another app but we

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:56.830
push your users to another app but we
 

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.320
push your users to another app but we
can talk about this in detail later on

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.330
can talk about this in detail later on
 

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:10.779
can talk about this in detail later on
at the office or if you want to

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:10.789
 
 

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.729
 
hey guys really love the new you know

00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:12.739
hey guys really love the new you know
 

00:38:12.739 --> 00:38:14.739
hey guys really love the new you know
user acquisition capability within the

00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:14.749
user acquisition capability within the
 

00:38:14.749 --> 00:38:16.029
user acquisition capability within the
developer console but I feel there's a

00:38:16.029 --> 00:38:16.039
developer console but I feel there's a
 

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:18.609
developer console but I feel there's a
bit of a feature cap right now where you

00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:18.619
bit of a feature cap right now where you
 

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:20.049
bit of a feature cap right now where you
can't really see a lot of visibility

00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:20.059
can't really see a lot of visibility
 

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:21.759
can't really see a lot of visibility
into what's happening organically within

00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:21.769
into what's happening organically within
 

00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:23.140
into what's happening organically within
the store itself so you can certainly

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:23.150
the store itself so you can certainly
 

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.729
the store itself so you can certainly
track things that happened outside the

00:38:24.729 --> 00:38:24.739
track things that happened outside the
 

00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:28.120
track things that happened outside the
store like a nag campaign but you don't

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.130
store like a nag campaign but you don't
 

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.499
store like a nag campaign but you don't
understand what the organic traffic is

00:38:29.499 --> 00:38:29.509
understand what the organic traffic is
 

00:38:29.509 --> 00:38:31.779
understand what the organic traffic is
comprised of so what keywords are people

00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:31.789
comprised of so what keywords are people
 

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:33.489
comprised of so what keywords are people
searching for which promotional

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:33.499
searching for which promotional
 

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:35.259
searching for which promotional
positions are driving traffic and so on

00:38:35.259 --> 00:38:35.269
positions are driving traffic and so on
 

00:38:35.269 --> 00:38:36.519
positions are driving traffic and so on
and so forth so that'd be a great

00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:36.529
and so forth so that'd be a great
 

00:38:36.529 --> 00:38:39.789
and so forth so that'd be a great
feature request yeah totally so at this

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:39.799
feature request yeah totally so at this
 

00:38:39.799 --> 00:38:42.789
feature request yeah totally so at this
point you can see your keyword searches

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:42.799
point you can see your keyword searches
 

00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:45.189
point you can see your keyword searches
you can see you TM attack traffic so

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:45.199
you can see you TM attack traffic so
 

00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:46.239
you can see you TM attack traffic so
that allows you to get an understanding

00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:46.249
that allows you to get an understanding
 

00:38:46.249 --> 00:38:49.299
that allows you to get an understanding
of your third party traffic but you

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:49.309
of your third party traffic but you
 

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:51.400
of your third party traffic but you
cannot dig into all of the details and

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:51.410
cannot dig into all of the details and
 

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.380
cannot dig into all of the details and
so I definitely take that feedback and

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:53.390
so I definitely take that feedback and
 

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.459
