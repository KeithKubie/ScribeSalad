00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.600
see in the process of science when you
discover something unexpected you know

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610
discover something unexpected you know
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.010
discover something unexpected you know
that really is where a lot of the joy of

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020
that really is where a lot of the joy of
 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.920
that really is where a lot of the joy of
doing science comes into it and so I got

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930
doing science comes into it and so I got
 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.300
doing science comes into it and so I got
really excited was really thrilled about

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310
really excited was really thrilled about
 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.610
really excited was really thrilled about
this and I started to then talk to some

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620
this and I started to then talk to some
 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.620
this and I started to then talk to some
of the local Tibetan villagers about how

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630
of the local Tibetan villagers about how
 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.129
of the local Tibetan villagers about how
thrilled I was to have discover

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139
thrilled I was to have discover
 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.480
thrilled I was to have discover
and that their Valley had been filled

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490
and that their Valley had been filled
 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.189
and that their Valley had been filled
with a lake at some time in the past and

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199
with a lake at some time in the past and
 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.050
with a lake at some time in the past and
that a really big flood had drained the

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060
that a really big flood had drained the
 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.540
that a really big flood had drained the
lake and essentially created the

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550
lake and essentially created the
 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.769
lake and essentially created the
landscape the topography the

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:30.779
landscape the topography the
 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.899
landscape the topography the
geomorphology that we could see today

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:32.909
geomorphology that we could see today
 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:34.489
geomorphology that we could see today
and like this sort of story was

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:34.499
and like this sort of story was
 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:35.989
and like this sort of story was
translated from English to Chinese to

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:35.999
translated from English to Chinese to
 

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.580
translated from English to Chinese to
Tibetan back to Chinese back to English

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590
Tibetan back to Chinese back to English
 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.200
Tibetan back to Chinese back to English
and the reply that I got really kind of

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210
and the reply that I got really kind of
 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.850
and the reply that I got really kind of
shocked me because it was basically

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860
shocked me because it was basically
 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.390

stories because it seemed like there's

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140
stories because it seemed like there's
 

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.509

at least a very plausible case to be

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519
at least a very plausible case to be
 

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.579
at least a very plausible case to be

roots in an actual event that may have
occurred some 1200 years ago well this

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779
occurred some 1200 years ago well this
 

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.180
occurred some 1200 years ago well this
got me into thinking about things like

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
got me into thinking about things like
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.769
got me into thinking about things like
you know the world's other flood stories

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779
you know the world's other flood stories
 

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.990
you know the world's other flood stories
as you might imagine it would and I

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000
as you might imagine it would and I
 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.009
as you might imagine it would and I
started to look at things like the

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019
started to look at things like the
 

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:20.689
started to look at things like the
global distribution of flood stories and

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:20.699
global distribution of flood stories and
 

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:21.860
global distribution of flood stories and
you know many people have done this in

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:21.870
you know many people have done this in
 

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.720
you know many people have done this in
the past but if you kind of look at it

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:23.730
the past but if you kind of look at it
 

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.000
the past but if you kind of look at it
and parse the geography and the details

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.010
and parse the geography and the details
 

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.500
and parse the geography and the details
in some of those stories you actually

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:27.510
in some of those stories you actually
 

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.840
in some of those stories you actually
can put together some fairly interesting

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:28.850
can put together some fairly interesting
 

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.759
can put together some fairly interesting
observations but the other flood stories

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:31.769
observations but the other flood stories
 

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:33.319
observations but the other flood stories
are from the surround the Pacific Rim

00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:33.329
are from the surround the Pacific Rim
 

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.280
are from the surround the Pacific Rim
sort of in this area

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.290
sort of in this area
 

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.290
sort of in this area
region there across North America

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:37.300

mulaskey across the Midwest up into
 

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.550
mulaskey across the Midwest up into
Scandinavia and of course there's a few

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560
Scandinavia and of course there's a few
 

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.740
Scandinavia and of course there's a few
very famous flood stories or one in

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:43.750
very famous flood stories or one in
 

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.769
very famous flood stories or one in
particular out of the Middle East what

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:46.779
particular out of the Middle East what
 

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:48.840
particular out of the Middle East what
about that distribution well it turned

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:48.850
about that distribution well it turned
 

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.460
about that distribution well it turned
to that in a minute but what first about

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.470
to that in a minute but what first about
 

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.199
to that in a minute but what first about
the characteristics of flood stories a

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:52.209
the characteristics of flood stories a
 

00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:53.970
the characteristics of flood stories a
lot has been made about the parallels

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:53.980
lot has been made about the parallels
 

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.439
lot has been made about the parallels
between flood stories in different parts

00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:55.449
between flood stories in different parts
 

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.150
between flood stories in different parts
of the world and the most common

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160
of the world and the most common

elements among the world's flood stories
 

00:09:58.569 --> 00:09:59.579
elements among the world's flood stories
are really that people survived

00:09:59.579 --> 00:09:59.589
are really that people survived

of Bogor arc and many of the other
 

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.550

substantially and this made big

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280
substantially and this made big
 

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.450
substantially and this made big
headlines in England back in the 1870s

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:09.460

with Smith when he was essentially
 

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.140
with Smith when he was essentially
announced his discovery of essentially

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.150
announced his discovery of essentially
 

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.279
announced his discovery of essentially
an idea of the story of Noah's Flood and

an idea of the story of Noah's Flood and
 

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:22.649
an idea of the story of Noah's Flood and
so what is it about this area in this

00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:22.659
so what is it about this area in this
 

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:25.970
so what is it about this area in this
region that may blend itself to a

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980
region that may blend itself to a
 

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.080

before Hurricane Katrina and sort of
 

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:36.299
before Hurricane Katrina and sort of
gone to the convention center and look

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:36.309
gone to the convention center and look
 

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.279
gone to the convention center and look
at the sign that's about you know four

some scientists claiming to have found
 

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.890
some scientists claiming to have found
geological evidence that might be

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:41.900
geological evidence that might be
 

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.360
geological evidence that might be
interpreted as supporting a biblical

that intrigued me because I didn't
 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.830
that intrigued me because I didn't
really understand why that would be I

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840
really understand why that would be I
 

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.480

well Ryan Pittman had discovered the

00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:56.259
well Ryan Pittman had discovered the
 

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.229
well Ryan Pittman had discovered the
wrong flood they had discovered a flood

00:22:58.229 --> 00:22:58.239

that believes that Noah's Flood that
still believes that Noah's Flood

00:23:08.129 --> 00:23:08.139
still believes that Noah's Flood
 

00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:10.109

actually covered the entire world and so

00:23:10.109 --> 00:23:10.119
actually covered the entire world and so
 

00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:11.609
actually covered the entire world and so
these guys had discovered evidence for

00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:11.619
these guys had discovered evidence for
 

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:13.289
these guys had discovered evidence for
the wrong flood so they must be wrong

00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:13.299
the wrong flood so they must be wrong
 

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:15.349
the wrong flood so they must be wrong
and therefore they should be outraged

00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:15.359
and therefore they should be outraged
 

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:16.919
and therefore they should be outraged

we're done right secondly the topography
was carved by Noah's Flood essentially

00:28:55.749 --> 00:28:55.759
was carved by Noah's Flood essentially
 

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:58.210
was carved by Noah's Flood essentially
that the world's topography was a direct

that the world's topography was a direct
 

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.580
that the world's topography was a direct
consequence of humaneness behavior and

consequence of humaneness behavior and
 

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.850
consequence of humaneness behavior and
sin and that topography was the world we

chaotic aftermath of the flood on the
 

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.210

so people Burnett came up with what was

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:12.540
so people Burnett came up with what was
 

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.210
so people Burnett came up with what was
actually a very clever solution to the

that was basically had three different
 

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.790
that was basically had three different
layers in it and that the outer layer

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:25.800
layers in it and that the outer layer
 

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.860
layers in it and that the outer layer
was a layer of rocks and stones that

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:27.870
was a layer of rocks and stones that
 

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.150
was a layer of rocks and stones that
formed the surface that we walk around

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:29.160
formed the surface that we walk around
 

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.430
formed the surface that we walk around
on there was an inner layer that was an

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440
on there was an inner layer that was an
 

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.020
on there was an inner layer that was an
interior ocean and there was a very

layer configuration allowed him to
 

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.260
layer configuration allowed him to
propose a very clever idea for how

very clever idea but he ran into a lot

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.170
very clever idea but he ran into a lot

but he also caught a lot of flack from
theologians why well imagine the

going to fail the test of
 

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.010
going to fail the test of

and good or wicked and so why put us
 

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.970

through it all in the first place

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:50.980

there's certain theological problems

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600
there's certain theological problems
 

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.030
there's certain theological problems
that come and so he got he got attacked

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.040
that come and so he got he got attacked
 

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.980
that come and so he got he got attacked
by both theologians and natural

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:55.990
by both theologians and natural
 

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.900
by both theologians and natural
philosophers and this is not one of

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:57.910
philosophers and this is not one of
 

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.460

downside is that wasn't until he was in
 

00:47:31.819 --> 00:47:34.599
downside is that wasn't until he was in
his 90s and so he didn't I think most of

his 90s and so he didn't I think most of
 

00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:35.920

00:54:55.049 --> 00:54:59.349
does it for us and finally what I think
is the perhaps the most troubling

problem with note with the with the
young earth creationist view of Noah's

00:55:02.959 --> 00:55:02.969
young earth creationist view of Noah's
 

00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:05.839

Flood are that 99% of all fossils are
 

00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:08.630
Flood are that 99% of all fossils are
from extinct species and I have yet to

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640
from extinct species and I have yet to
 

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.809
from extinct species and I have yet to
hear a fairly coherent response to this

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819
hear a fairly coherent response to this
 

00:55:11.819 --> 00:55:14.269

the world's fossils are a result of

00:55:16.459 --> 00:55:16.469
the world's fossils are a result of
 

00:55:16.469 --> 00:55:18.199
the world's fossils are a result of
Noah's Flood because what this means of

00:55:18.199 --> 00:55:18.209
Noah's Flood because what this means of
 

00:55:18.209 --> 00:55:20.779
Noah's Flood because what this means of
course is that either Noah did an

00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:20.789
course is that either Noah did an
 

00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:22.939
course is that either Noah did an
absolutely terrible job at trying to get

00:55:22.939 --> 00:55:22.949
absolutely terrible job at trying to get
 

00:55:22.949 --> 00:55:24.380
absolutely terrible job at trying to get
two of everything onto the ark and he

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:24.390
two of everything onto the ark and he
 

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:26.209
two of everything onto the ark and he
got like one he got the one-percenters

00:55:26.209 --> 00:55:26.219
got like one he got the one-percenters
 

00:55:26.219 --> 00:55:27.919
got like one he got the one-percenters
and that's it maybe there was a

00:55:27.919 --> 00:55:27.929
and that's it maybe there was a
 

00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:29.150
and that's it maybe there was a
subscription or something I don't know

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.169

how that worked

00:55:30.169 --> 00:55:30.179
how that worked
 

00:55:30.179 --> 00:55:33.410
how that worked
but either that either he did a poor job

on this book and they were very clear

00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:29.059
on this book and they were very clear
 

00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:30.099
on this book and they were very clear
that what they did is they basically

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:30.109
that what they did is they basically
 

00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:32.439
that what they did is they basically
took the biblical story as truth and

00:56:32.439 --> 00:56:32.449
took the biblical story as truth and
 

00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:33.849

support their interpretation of that
 

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:38.769
support their interpretation of that

of it we're starting to fall into place

of it we're starting to fall into place

in their day and plate tectonics is a

in their day and plate tectonics is a

in their day and plate tectonics is a
good example of one of those ideas that

good example of one of those ideas that

comes together from different

comes together from different
observations that then go put together

observations that then go put together
 

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.790
observations that then go put together
to make a theory that actually answers

questions that the developers of the

questions that the developers of the
theory never thought to posed and in my

theory never thought to posed and in my

a really good theory if you put

a really good theory if you put

a really good theory if you put
something together based on evidence you

something together based on evidence you

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:27.450
century that we're at now the 21st
 

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.900
century that we're at now the 21st
century is incredibly pivotal point in

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:29.910
century is incredibly pivotal point in
 

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.430
century is incredibly pivotal point in
the history of humanity we have some

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440
the history of humanity we have some
 

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.710
the history of humanity we have some
really big problems confronting us about

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720
really big problems confronting us about
 

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.420
really big problems confronting us about
the nature of the world our place in it

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:35.430
the nature of the world our place in it
 

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.579
the nature of the world our place in it
our stewardship of the planet we're

01:01:37.579 --> 01:01:37.589
our stewardship of the planet we're
 

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:41.630
our stewardship of the planet we're
facing crises in water soil energy the

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640
facing crises in water soil energy the
 

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.789
facing crises in water soil energy the
atmosphere in terms of climate all which

01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799
atmosphere in terms of climate all which
 

01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:45.230
atmosphere in terms of climate all which
may come to a head later this century

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240
may come to a head later this century
 

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.180
may come to a head later this century
and frankly I think it's actually really

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.190
and frankly I think it's actually really
 

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.670
and frankly I think it's actually really
counterproductive as a species for us to

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680
counterproductive as a species for us to
 

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.670
counterproductive as a species for us to
spend a lot of time debating arguments

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680
spend a lot of time debating arguments
 

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.019
spend a lot of time debating arguments
that were essentially settled a couple

01:01:54.019 --> 01:01:54.029
that were essentially settled a couple
 

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:55.630
that were essentially settled a couple
hundred years ago

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640
hundred years ago
 

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.130
hundred years ago
what does this mean essentially in my

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140
what does this mean essentially in my
 

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.079
what does this mean essentially in my
view for the the nature and the power of

01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:00.089
view for the the nature and the power of
 

01:02:00.089 --> 01:02:02.240
view for the the nature and the power of
the story of Noah's Flood oh I think it

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:02.250
the story of Noah's Flood oh I think it
 

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.099
the story of Noah's Flood oh I think it
is a very powerful story I think it's a

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:04.109
is a very powerful story I think it's a
 

01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:06.049
is a very powerful story I think it's a
very intriguing story I think it may

01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059
very intriguing story I think it may
 

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.759
very intriguing story I think it may
very well have its roots in real events

01:02:07.759 --> 01:02:07.769
very well have its roots in real events
 

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:09.410
very well have its roots in real events
but I think that the modern sort of

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420
but I think that the modern sort of
 

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.420
but I think that the modern sort of
value of the story may lie much more in

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:11.430
value of the story may lie much more in
 

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.910
value of the story may lie much more in
its nature as a as a teaching device

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920
its nature as a as a teaching device
 

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.970
its nature as a as a teaching device
about the the responsibility that

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980
about the the responsibility that
 

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.549
about the the responsibility that
humanity has to care for creation and

01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559
humanity has to care for creation and
 

01:02:19.559 --> 01:02:21.890
humanity has to care for creation and
actually carry forward all that is with

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900
actually carry forward all that is with
 

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.900
actually carry forward all that is with
us on this planet into the foreseeable

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:23.910
us on this planet into the foreseeable
 

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:25.339
us on this planet into the foreseeable
future through the kinds of crises that

01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:25.349
future through the kinds of crises that
 

01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:27.289
future through the kinds of crises that
we actually face in the coming decades

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299
we actually face in the coming decades
 

01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:29.029
we actually face in the coming decades
and I think if we view the story of

01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039
and I think if we view the story of
 

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:30.470
and I think if we view the story of
Noah's Flood through that lens it's

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480
Noah's Flood through that lens it's
 

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.289
Noah's Flood through that lens it's
actually still reads as a very powerful

01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:32.299
actually still reads as a very powerful
 

01:02:32.299 --> 01:02:34.220
actually still reads as a very powerful
very powerful

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:34.230
very powerful
 

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.930
very powerful
and very spiritual story in terms of the

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940
and very spiritual story in terms of the
 

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.840
and very spiritual story in terms of the
nature of humanity and our relationship

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:38.850
nature of humanity and our relationship
 

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:40.880
nature of humanity and our relationship
to the world now people have always

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:40.890
to the world now people have always
 

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.720
to the world now people have always
essentially used the filter of faith in

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:44.730
essentially used the filter of faith in
 

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.580
essentially used the filter of faith in
the lens of reason to try and make sense

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:46.590
the lens of reason to try and make sense
 

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.680
the lens of reason to try and make sense
of our place in the world but I think

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:48.690
of our place in the world but I think
 

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.030
of our place in the world but I think
that the story of Noah's Flood is a very

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040
that the story of Noah's Flood is a very
 

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.830
that the story of Noah's Flood is a very
interesting historical example of how we

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:51.840
interesting historical example of how we
 

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.720
interesting historical example of how we
can think through that and how we can

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:53.730
can think through that and how we can
 

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.180
can think through that and how we can
look at the way that religious stories

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:56.190
look at the way that religious stories
 

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.859
look at the way that religious stories
have actually helped shape the evolution

01:02:57.859 --> 01:02:57.869
have actually helped shape the evolution
 

01:02:57.869 --> 01:02:59.720
have actually helped shape the evolution
and development of science and how

01:02:59.720 --> 01:02:59.730
and development of science and how
 

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.270
and development of science and how
theology has actually responded involved

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280
theology has actually responded involved
 

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.210
theology has actually responded involved
in response to that to those kinds of

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220
in response to that to those kinds of
 

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.550
in response to that to those kinds of
discoveries and I'll leave the story of

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:07.560
discoveries and I'll leave the story of
 

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.410
