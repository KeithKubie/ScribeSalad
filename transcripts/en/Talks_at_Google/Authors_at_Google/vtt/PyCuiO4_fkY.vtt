00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.370
Hal Varian: Hello. I'm Hal Varian.
I'm the chief economist here at Google.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.100
And it's my great pleasure to introduce David
Wessel.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.379
We were just talking that -- a year ago, maybe
a little more than a year ago -- the end of

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.789
July 2008, he was visiting Google.
And we were talking about, "What are your

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.480
next plans?”
He says, "I'm going to take a six-month sabbatical

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.050
and write a book about Bear Stearns.”
And he says, "It would be kind of a nice way

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.390
to get some inside information on Wall Street
and describe the past and how we've averted

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.520
a catastrophe.”
Well, little did he know that this was, in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.360
fact, a very good time to take the sabbatical,
because he was in the midst of battle and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.940
could write about what was going on in a very
timely way.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.730
The result has been this book, "In Fed We
Trust," which is being offered over there

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.290
at a discounted price.
So David is going to give us a quick synopsis

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.890
of the book, and he'll also have some time
to answer questions from the audience. David.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.070
David Wessel: Thank you very much.
Hal is absolutely right.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.640
I was the idiot who decided to try and write
a book about the Great Depression in 1931.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.659
But it turned into a book about predicting
the present, and I'm taking credit for that

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.829
phrase so Hal can't take it in the future.
If you had looked back -- if you look back

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:41.200
three years ago, in September 2006, and I
told you that anything short of an asteroid

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.969
hitting the Earth could push us to the edge
of another Great Depression, you would have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.380
rightly dismissed me as some kind of kook.
And, of course, there were kooks saying that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.789
at the time.
That's one of the things.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.560
You can always go back and find somebody who
predicted disaster.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.200
The kind of people who predict disaster three
times a week, hoping that, just once, they'll

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.419
finally be right.
If you went back two years ago at this time

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:13.290
 -- so that's in September 2007, you would
have said, "Well, things look a little shaky,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.870
but the odds of repeating the Great Depression
seem somewhere around zero.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.680
We seem to have a bit of a housing bubble
bursting.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.379
But as Hank Paulson, who was then the Treasury
Secretary, and Ben Bernanke, who was then

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.650
the Fed Chairman told us in language they
chose deliberately, "This housing thing was

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.849
going to be contained," by which they meant
it would be bad for people who owned houses

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.959
 -- most of us -- and it might be bad for
people who lended money to the people who

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.799
owned houses -- which was most of the banks.
But there was enough other good stuff going

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.189
on in the economy that it wouldn't be much
of a body blow to the economy.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.910
After all, at the time, if you may remember,
oil prices were going up.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.659
And oil prices were kind of an indicator that
somebody must be buying.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.049
Somebody must have need for energy and that
suggests a growing economy.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.019
So we assumed that somehow the Chinese would
grow and it would cushion the blow of this

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.219
housing thing.
Or businesses would somehow keep investing

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.409
outside of housing and that would help support
us.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.629
And so, in August 2007 there were some signs
that this might be a little bit of an over-optimistic

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.299
forecast.
There were some signs that the housing virus

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.689
was passing into the banking system, but it
didn't seem like anything that ordinary economic

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.109
policy would be unable to handle.
You know, we set up the Federal Reserve to

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.000
provide a little bit more credit to the economy,
to be a lender of last resort when banks were

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.830
a little short of cash.
And so, they turned the spigot a little bit

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.359
there in 2007, and they thought, "Well, maybe
this will work out all right.”

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:00.610
Now, if you go back just one year from now
in the end of September 2008, you would have

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.000
discovered a nation that really was -- in
my opinion and in the opinion of people who

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.329
were trying to steer the economy -- on the
edge of the repeating the Great Depression,

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.650
something that seemed perhaps the most remote
possibility to economists seemed to be at

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.590
hand.
Not a certainty of course, but it was frighteningly

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.720
close.
When we surveyed the economists at the Wall

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.961
Street Journal, we asked them, "What are the
odds of repeating the Great Depression?”

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.521
We're talking about unemployment of 25 percent
or so.

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.100
People were telling us, "a 30 percent chance,”
or "a 35 percent chance."

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.419
Well, that's pretty big when before you thought
it was zero.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.490
So in a sense, what I wrote about in this
book is, How did we go from the period of

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.930
time when a recession seemed possible but
unlikely to one where a depression seemed

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.650
a substantial risk?
And then, How do we find ourselves today just

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.240
a year later in an economy, which is far from
healthy, but at least appears to be growing

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.780
a little bit?
If you take the metaphor of the patient -- that

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.710
patient had a heart attack, out of intensive
care, not healthy yet, but doing a lot better

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.639
than we thought the economy we'd be doing
just six months ago.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.210
Now, I think there are a number of things
we've learned.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.870
We're learning a lot as we go along here.
And one of them is how ill-prepared the U.S.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.150
Government was to fight a financial panic
like the one we just went through.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.150
You know, the President of the United States
 -- were we attacked by missiles from Iran

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.870
or North Korea, or whatever -- has the power
to push a button or make a phone call, or

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.200
whatever he does, send a Blackberry, -- I
don't actually know how it works -- go on

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.050
Google search and say "strike back." And fire
missiles back.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.830
But the president of the United States does
not have the money.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.630
Congress has not given him the money or the
power to deal with something like we just

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.370
went through.
It was in our system only the Federal Reserve

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.240
that had that authority.
This old institution created after the panic

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.630
of 1907 which was a panic that has many similarities
to this one, but at the time there was no

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.009
central bank.
It was a panic at which, the system was saved

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:17.270
by one man, J. P. Morgan, who literally sat
in his study and decided which bank would

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.400
be saved, which would be the Bear Stearns
or the AIG of his time, in order to stop the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.180
panic.
And he called the banker in, and the banker

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.950
brought securities to his office.
And he went through them one at a time until

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.599
he felt he had enough collateral to make a
loan.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:37.930
And it was after that period -- with a great
deal of political controversy and tension

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.710
between farmers and industrialists, urban
and rural interests, lenders and borrowers

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.280
 -- that the Congress and Woodrow Wilson created
the Federal Reserve precisely to deal with

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.560
a panic like the one we just have been through.
It was a role for the Fed that's kind of been

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.740
forgotten -- if we think at all about the
Fed -- about an institution that just moves

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.169
interest rates.
So one of the reasons I said I have to do

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.030
this book is, I thought that -- two things.
One, that the Fed was way under-covered by

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.740
the press given its power in our society.
I mean, we send a thousand, 2000 reporters

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.949
to political conventions where nothing happens.
It's just like theater.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.690
And you can count on the fingers of both your
hands the number of reporters in Washington

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.370
who actually cover the Fed as a full-time
beat.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.669
And as Hal said, I thought that Bear Stearns
was the most remarkable thing that would ever

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.050
happen to a reporter my age who was covering
the Federal Reserve.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.690
And so, it couldn't get any better than this,
which as I said, tells you a lot about my

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.030
foresight.
And the reason Bear Stearns was interesting

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:43.569
was, it was the first time since the Depression
that the Fed had pulled the emergency cord,

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:48.330
and said, "We're going to use our power given
to us by Congress, to lend to almost anybody

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.569
in circumstances we deem -- nobody has to
approve this; we at the Fed deem -- to be

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:55.630
unusual and exigent.
Great words of the law which are nowhere to

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.139
find.
They are whatever the Fed says they are.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.511
And they lent money to Bear Stearns.
They actually bought assets from Bear Stearns

00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:08.849
to subsidize its purchase by J. P. Morgan.
Even though Bear Stearns was an institution

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.670
the Fed had no responsibility for.
And they did it because Bernanke, the Chairman

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:21.830
 -- one of Hal's students long time ago -- realized
that this was a moment where, had Bear Stearns

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.229
gone down, the ramifications would have been
enormous, and not just to people who had invested

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:31.110
or lent money to Bear Stearns.
So, although this is very much not a story

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.880
of one man, it is a story of a surprisingly
small number of people who were called on

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.320
to be first responders to this financial panic.
And the star of my story is Ben Bernanke,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.790
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Now, Ben Bernanke was a nice Jewish boy from

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:54.490
Dillon, South Carolina, notoriously smart,
the kind of kid whose SAT scores were widely

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.220
known because they were so high, a champion
speller who actually made it to the National

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:08.380
Championships in Spelling in Washington, but
lost on the spelling of the word "edelweiss.”

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.060
There were no movie theaters in Dillon, South
Carolina, so Ben Bernanke had never seen the

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.260
movie "Sound of Music," where the flower edelweiss
is one of the star attractions.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.980
And he was probably going to go either to
the University of South Carolina, the state

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.070
where he grew up, or the University of North
Carolina, the University where his parents

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.920
had gone to college, but for the intervention
of one guy.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.339
And it is, I think, one of those truly Only-in-America
stories.

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:39.829
There was a man in Dillon, South Carolina,
named Kenneth Manning, an African-American

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:44.529
eight years older than Ben Bernanke, who had
been plucked out of a lousy, segregated high

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:50.170
school by the United Presbyterian Church -- which
was trying to help talented black kids in

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:55.100
lousy high schools in the South get ahead
 -- and taken eventually to Harvard.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.640
And Ken Manning, who later turned out to be
a professor of the history of science at MIT,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.720
thought that Ben Bernanke was the kind of
person who would benefit from a place like

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.040
Harvard and he shouldn't be going to the University
of North Carolina, as good a school as it

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.779
was.
And he went to Bernanke and talked him into

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.491
this.
And then, he went to Bernanke's parents, and

00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:15.649
Bernanke's parents thought this was a terrible
idea.

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:19.670
And his mother came up with a lot of reasons
why Bernanke shouldn't have gone to Harvard,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.920
and one of them was that she was afraid that
Bernanke would lose his Jewish identity.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.160
And Ken Manning, this African-American, assured
Ben Bernanke's mother that there were Jews

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.120
at Harvard as well.
And in fact, making good on his promise to

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.690
Mrs. Bernanke, he took young Ben Bernanke
to High Holy Day services his first year at

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.800
Harvard.
And Bernanke told me later that one of his

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.870
mother's frustrations was, this African-American
man from Dillon, South Carolina, found the

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.300
services more meaningful than Ben Bernanke
did himself.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:56.060
So he goes to Harvard, excels as a student
of economics, goes to MIT and gets a Ph.D.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.209
in economics.
And, along the way, gets fascinated by Milton

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:04.070
Friedman's book on the Great Depression.
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz famously

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.820
wrote a book that said that the problem in
the Depression was, the Fed was too stingy

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.240
with credit.
Bernanke was taken with the thesis and their

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.690
methodology and elaborated on it.
Friedman and Schwartz thought the Fed was

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:22.380
too stingy with credit, so the economy didn't
do well, and banks failed because there wasn't

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.320
enough credit.
And that was a symptom not a cause.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.079
Bernanke thought that the bank failure was
also a cause of the problem.

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:35.921
And so, he wrote a lot about how it was that
the banks failing made the Great Depression

00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:40.420
even worse than it would have been otherwise.
Now, this is kind of the economic equivalent

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.889
of being a palontologist.
You study all these dinosaur bones.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:47.330
It's very interesting.
And it is totally irrelevant.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.329
Except one day, you're standing in San Francisco
and on the Berkeley Hills you see a Tyrannosaurus

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:55.980
Rex on the horizon.
And you're one of the few people that knows

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.709
what the hell these things eat and how to
fight them.

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:03.300
And so, Bernanke was accused, at the beginning
of this crisis, of seeing the world through

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.731
this lens of the Great Depression and overreacting.
That's what people thought about Bear Stearns.

00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:11.040
They thought he had overreacted.
"He should have let Bear Stearns go, because

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.070
banks should fail and that's the way capitalism
works." But he saw it through the lens of

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.199
the Depression.
And later, I think he's been proven right.

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:24.699
And so, by this incredible -- really "accident"
of history -- a coincidence, we have this

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:30.240
guy who had been thinking about the problems
that we have just been through in historical

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.329
context in ways that most other economists
thought were largely irrelevant.

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:38.339
So Bernanke becomes Chairman of the Federal
Reserve at the beginning of 2006.

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:45.720
George Bush swears him in at the Federal Reserve
Building, and declares that his predecessor,

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.570
Alan Greenspan, was a rock star.
And Bernanke is succeeding a rock star, which

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.010
was definitely true at the time, and tells
you a little bit about how fleeting one's

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.471
reputation should be.
So one grain of salt here is that, I think

00:12:57.471 --> 00:13:00.760
Bernanke did a pretty good job.
He's pretty close to being a hero of my story.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.550
But we'll see in three years whether he goes
the way of Greenspan.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.949
So that's the trouble with writing a book
in realtime, you may prejudge the verdict

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:12.490
of history.
Bernanke came to office, promising to follow

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.110
the policies of Alan Greenspan.
He was not going to change the direction of

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.139
the Fed.
Greenspan's policies, after all, had been

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:23.040
reasonably successful.
We had a long period of low inflation and

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.240
relatively low unemployment.
We had an economy which had been extraordinarily

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.070
resilient.
Think of all the things in the 90's that we

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.410
went through, and the early 2000s, that didn't
really do much harm to the economy.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.280
We had the tech stock bubble.
It hurt out here, I know, but the rest of

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.220
the economy recovered pretty quickly.
We had a couple of wars in Iraq, spikes in

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.500
oil prices, even 9/11, which seemed the biggest
shock of my lifetime.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.580
And even that didn't do much more than a hiccup
in the economy.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.600
So he had every reason to believe that Greenspan
had the magic formula, and he was going to

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.790
continue it.
His difference with Greenspan was going to

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.209
be one largely of style.
Greenspan's Federal Reserve was something

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:02.670
like the Vatican.
He was the Pope.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.000
He was infallible, and you don't know anybody
else's names.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.759
And Bernanke thought, "This is not a good
way in a democracy to run a central bank.”

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:15.279
And so, he set out to elevate the institution
above the individuals, the committee of policymakers

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:20.550
above the chairman, and to say that he was
going to be so open about the way that the

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.040
Fed thought and what they were doing, that
when he gave a speech, there would be no new

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.550
information, and the markets wouldn't move.
And for his first year as Fed chairman, he

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.269
kind of pursued this thing.
He didn't try and outshout the other members

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:35.389
of the committee.
He worked very hard to get consensus.

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:42.570
It was not an autocratic central bank.
And then about the beginning of 2008, Bernanke

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.970
realized that, when things get bad, there's
a reason that committees have a chairman.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.600
And that it was confusing to the world to
have a dozen Fed officials talking out there,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.149
and you needed the Wall Street Journal to
tell you which two mattered and which ten

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:59.279
to ignore.
And so, he began to speak more loudly to dominate

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:03.370
the committee.
He moved very rapidly in January 2008, recognizing

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.029
that he was behind the curve to cut interest
rates by one and a half percentage points

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:10.759
in a period of weeks, which is something that
the Fed doesn't usually do.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:14.519
And now, we see he's gone well beyond what
Greenspan ever did.

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:19.181
Seeing the Fed under attack, people suspicious
of the Fed, he's gone on 60 Minutes.

00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:22.540
He's gone on PBS's Jim Lehrer Show to take
questions from people.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.680
He's gone to the National Press Club and taken
questions from reporters.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.529
He went to Morehouse College and took questions
from economic students and answered them on

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:36.350
national TV.
Because he has recognized that he now has

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.620
to defend the Federal Reserve, and people
do want to know, Why did you do what you did,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.300
and Were you trying to save Wall Street or
were you trying to save me?

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.810
And so, he's become -- even more than Greenspan
 -- associated with the Federal Reserve, one

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.610
man.
And along the way, it looks like it was a

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:56.790
pretty successful, subtle campaign for reelection,
which he of course won.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.779
Obama has appointed him to a second, four-year
term. All right.

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:07.050
So Bear Stearns comes along, they spend $30
billion of our money, buy this crap off the

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:12.420
balance sheet of Bear Stearns that J.P. Morgan
Chase doesn't want to hold, and life goes

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.790
on.
And I think there, we see -- in the six months

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:21.660
that followed -- their failure: Paulson, Bernanke,
Geithner, the Chairman, now the president

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.860
of the New York Fed, now the Secretary of
the Treasury.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.720
They did not use that time to figure out how
they were going to deal with this if it happened

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.310
again.
They didn't go to Congress and ask for money

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.990
or power.
They say if they'd gone, they would have been

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.069
shot down, and that was worse than not asking
at all maybe.

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:42.430
But also, internally, they didn't come up
with any plan, How can we create a set of

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.709
options for ourselves, so that, if we're confronted
with something like Bear Stearns again, we

00:16:46.709 --> 00:16:51.060
don't have to spend $30 billion in order to
bribe somebody else to buy them?

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:57.000
So they go into this weekend, in the middle
of September 2008, unprepared.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.589
They have the redwoods on Wall Street shaking.
Merrill Lynch is married to Bank of America.

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:06.850
They think that's a problem solved.
Lehman Brothers, they hope to sell to a British

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:11.320
bank.
They rally Wall Street at the Federal Reserve

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.550
Bank of New York Building, a very mighty fortress
that's sort of a symbol of financial.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:25.090
Solid cement concrete, it's a building built
in the 20's on the replica of a Florentine

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.920
palace.
It is such a model of stability and security,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.470
that other nations keep their gold in a vault
in the basement of the Federal Reserve on

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.280
the bedrock of Manhattan, and they did not
take out their gold even after 9/11.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.110
It was a symbol of everything that we believed
about our economy.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.380
Maybe we don't make things as well as the
Japanese.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.510
Maybe we don't make them as cheaply as the
Chinese or the Indians or the Mexicans.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.320
But the one thing America knew how to do was
run a financial system.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.270
Not! So they bring these guys together on
Wall Street, and they basically tell them,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.060
"Lehman Brothers needs your help.”
They get the guys to pitch in some money,

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.430
the government's willing to put some money
in too, if only they can sell this bank to

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.760
Barclays, the British bank.
The British regulators wisely decide not to

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.600
let it happen.
And they have no Plan B.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.890
They let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt.
They say that they expect people to be upset,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.160
but not too bad.
After all, everybody knew Lehman was in trouble.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.740
To some extent, they've been beaten up for
saving Bear Stearns, and they talk about,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.220
"It's time to teach Wall Street a lesson that
the government is not going to bail out every

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.020
big institution.”
They expect ripples; they get a tsunami.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.620
And there are two things I think that they
didn't appreciate -- call it a "failure of

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.140
imagination," if you will.
That turned out to be catastrophic.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.210
One was, we have these things called "money
market mutual funds," where people put their

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.220
money in, expect that their shares will always
be worth a dollar.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.620
They get some interest.
The money market mutual fund takes their money

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:03.790
and buys IOUs from other companies, industrial
companies -- General Electric, IBM, Caterpillar,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:09.200
places like that.
That's sort of what banks used to do.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.320
Now, a lot of it goes through money market
mutual funds.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.750
The Fed and the Treasury thought, "Well, no
money market mutual fund is stupid enough

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:20.090
to hold Lehman IOU's, hold Lehman paper.”
They were wrong -- a big one did.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.900
It was unable to pay people back a dollar
for every dollar they put in.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.960
It started a run on money market funds, people
taking their money out, just the way that

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.690
we used to have banking runs before we had
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:38.500
And that's a problem, because the industrial
economy of America relies on these funds for

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.150
their financing.
And I think what will go down in history as

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.140
one of the more successful rescues -- the
Fed and Treasury rapidly put together a system

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.500
to guarantee people's deposits in money market
mutual funds so that too many people don't

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.330
take their money out, and find a way to lend
directly to companies so that they can keep

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.910
financing, so while the housing market is
going through the floor, we can have the rest

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.250
of the economy still functioning.
And then, along comes AIG, and they say, "Oh,

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.660
my gosh.
We can't let another one go. That'll be catastrophic.”

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.440
So they find a way to save them.
And then, they're stuck with this very awkward

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.970
thing.
They told us, for the record, they couldn't

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.540
bail out Lehman Brothers, because Lehman Brothers
didn't have enough collateral to make a loan.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.830
The Federal Reserve Law says they have to
have collateral.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.500
They have to have a security, just the way
you pledge your house when you get a mortgage.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.020
Lehman Brothers didn't have enough to save
them, so they let them go down.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.090
And that story becomes the story that they
now stick with.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.811
They don't talk about, "They were trying to
teach Wall Street a lesson.

00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:37.900
It was all 'the law'.”
But they had kind of this awkwardness of,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.800
So one day in this whole crisis we decided
we couldn't stretch the law.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.020
Every other day we managed to stretch it,
but this one day, we couldn't stretch the

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.220
law.
It's kind of awkward.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.791
We surveyed economists on Wall Street a couple
of weeks ago -- at the Wall Street Journal,

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:53.670
and about three dozen economists -- and we
asked them, "Do you believe the story that

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.600
Bernanke, Paulson, and Geithner didn't have
the legal power to save Lehman Brothers?”

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.470
Three to one, they said they didn't believe
it.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.560
Basically, most people think, If there had
been a will to save Lehman, there was a way.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.710
There wasn't a will, they didn't do it, and
the rest has become history, as they say.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:15.831
So, not only was there this money market fund
problem, but this decision to let Lehman Brothers

00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:21.420
go stunned the rest of the world.
A European central banker I know said to me

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.770
a few weeks later, "In my country, we don't
let dry cleaners fail.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.010
It never occurred to us that the United States
Government would let Lehman Brothers fall.”

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.380
So, suddenly, you breed this enormous distrust
among financial institutions.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.000
They're unwilling to lend even to each other,
let alone to you and me.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.020
And that is the condition that Bernanke recognized
as risking a repeat of the Great Depression.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.730
It was -- if you will forgive the medical
metaphor -- the patient was on the table,

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.480
and the surgeons were looking at it one organ
at a time.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.170
There was Merrill Lynch, there was Lehman
Brothers, there was AIG, and suddenly, the

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.171
blood stopped circulating.
Credit is the lifeblood of the economy.

00:22:00.171 --> 00:22:04.020
It stopped circulating.
There were all these banks that were collapsing

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.061
and blocking the blood from flowing.
I'll stop the metaphor there. You don't have

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:10.020
to worry.
And so, Bernanke set out basically to say,

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.540
"I'm going to do whatever it takes to prevent
a repeat of the Great Depression.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.220
I am not going to let big financial institutions
go down one after another.”

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.321
He and Paulson, of course, go to Congress,
get $700 billion, and begin the process of

00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:27.220
trying to rebuild the financial foundations
of our banking system.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.750
And I think that we can now look back and
say that they did a lot of things.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.830
Some of them worked and some of them didn't,
but they were not constrained by the orthodoxy

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.690
of the time, of their advisors.
They did whatever it took to try and save

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.840
us, and it's -- for the bottom line verdict,
you have to say it worked.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.850
Things are a lot better today than they would
have been six months ago when you wouldn't

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.200
have thought six months ago. All right.
So, I think that raises one interesting question,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.950
"If Ben Bernanke is so smart, why the heck
didn't he see this coming?”

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.620
And I think that's a good question, and I
suspect it's one that he has done a lot of

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.950
thinking about.
And I've done some talking to him about it.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:09.420
One thing I think we know is that, the Fed
kept interest rates too low too long earlier

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.410
in this decade, and that produced an orgy
of speculation and borrowing.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.110
And that was Greenspan's decision, but Bernanke
was there helping to lay the intellectual

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.740
foundation for keeping interest rates low
to prevent us from having deflation like they

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.150
had in Japan.
The second thing was that Bernanke told us

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.510
at the time that the Fed should not raise
interest rates if it saw a bubble in the financial

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.060
markets.
That that was kind of messy and foolish, and

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.320
you might not get it right.
And Greenspan agreed with that, so he didn't

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.631
do that.
But Bernanke said that, "At times when you

00:23:38.631 --> 00:23:41.840
think there's just a bit too much borrowing
and lending going on, it's important to use

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.620
the regulatory power of the central government
of the Fed.”

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.440
And he didn't do anything to see that happen.
So the Greenspan period is one in which the

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.280
Fed does not use even the powers it's been
given by Congress to deal with mortgage lending.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.390
And then the third thing -- and the one that
I think is most interesting and most serious

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:05.630
is that Greenspan sponsored a view in Washington
 -- one that Bernanke didn't visibly object

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:11.140
to -- which was basically, "Markets generally
do a pretty good job, and financial markets

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.511
do a very good job, and there's a lot of sophisticated
investors in these markets, and they have

00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:20.020
a lot of money at risk and they're more likely
to police the poker table than any bureaucrat

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.660
or regulator.
So the best thing we can do is let them do

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.610
their stuff, because it's in their self-interest
to make sure the system is stable." Well -- as

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:33.840
Greenspan confessed in a hearing before Henry
Waxman's committee -- that worldview was wrong.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.670
And as a result, the poker table tipped over,
and it nearly took all of us with it.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:43.690
And that, I think, is the biggest sin of the
Greenspan era -- and one for which Bernanke

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.520
was present.
Now, he's tried to redress that.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.430
The Fed has passed some rules to make sure
that there will -- nobody's making mortgages

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.800
today that nobody wants to make in the first
place.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.210
They've done a great job of closing the barn
door after the horses have fled.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.510
But I think that the question going forward
is whether they've learned enough lessons

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:08.810
to help come up with some way to manage modern
democratic financial capitalism in a way that

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.530
we get the benefits of all this financial
innovation without having to go for a ride

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:19.140
that takes the economy off the cliff.
So, let me stop where we are now and then

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.150
we can go in any number of directions depending
on what your questions are.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:27.860
So Bernanke. How's he doing?
Well, he got himself reappointed, which is

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.560
I think, something that makes him quite proud
that a democratic president who had other

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.810
options chose to replace a central banker
who was appointed by a Republican.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.620
It's a kind of a reward for having done a
reasonably good job under fire.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.510
I think Obama re-appointed him for a couple
of reasons.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.690
One is that it was not convenient to change
drivers at a time when the road is still so

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.320
bumpy and windy.
And secondly, Obama is trying to declare victory

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.010
against the recession.
And it's a little hard to declare victory

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:02.170
and then fire the general.
Second thing he has to do is, figure out,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.540
"Okay. I open the spigot.
I put all this money into the economy.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.710
Now, it's a lot of money.
When Ben Bernanke became Chairman of the Federal

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:17.180
Reserve in 2006, the Fed had $800 billion
of loans and securities on its books.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.540
Today, they have $2 trillion worth.
And they did that without any okay of Congress

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.110
or the President or the Secretary of the Treasury.
They did that under the power the law gives

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.640
them all on their own.
And Bernanke has to decide, When do I take

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.670
that back?
When do I raise interest rates?

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.150
When do I pull some of this credit out?
Do it too soon? We got another recession.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.450
Do it too late? And he gets more inflation
than he thinks is welcome.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.600
It takes a great deal of luck and technical
skill.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.090
But it also -- and I think this is his third
challenge -- takes an enormous amount of political

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.820
fortitude.
Because one thing that has happened in this

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.490
crisis is, the Fed has exposed how much power
it actually has.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.210
It exposes itself as almost a fourth branch
of government.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.720
The ability to create all this money and decide
which institutions live and which ones die,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.980
and that has created a great deal of suspicion
of the Fed.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.820
Some of this is deeply rooted in American
history.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.160
There was a fight between Alexander Hamilton
and Thomas Jefferson over whether we ought

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.400
to have a central bank.
Hamilton said 'yes,' Jefferson said 'no.'

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.610
There's always been a great deal of suspicion
in the United States about concentrated financial

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.040
power, even when it's kind of half in the
government, the way the Fed is.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.380
And the second thing is that, this has angered
people, this episode.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.230
People in America think Wall Street got bailed
out and they didn't.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:39.710
So Ben Bernanke went on 60 minutes to tell
people, "I didn't want to bail out Wall Street.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.980
I wanted to bail out Main Street.
But the only way to bail out Main Street was

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.870
to bail out Wall Street.”
It's kind of a hard argument to make.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.750
Or as Barney Frank -- who's the wonderfully
clever Chairman of the House Financial Services

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:57.300
Committee, who is the source of almost all
great one-liners on everything economic said

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.400
at a hearing the other day -- he said, "The
problem we have here is that it's really hard

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.510
for a politician to get reelected with a bumper
sticker that says, It could have been worse.”

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.610
And that's basically where we are right now.
Ben Bernanke in my book is a hero, because

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.160
it could have been worse.
It's just kind of hard to convince people

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.670
of that.
Thank you very much.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.020
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.070
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:37.500
David Wessel: There's one right behind you.
Good. Please.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:44.270
Q So, as you rightly said, one of the criticisms
of the Greenspan Fed was keeping interest

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.340
rates low for so long, and perhaps Bernanke
Fed is making the same mistake or perhaps

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.051
not.
We don't know until hindsight.

00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:52.051
David Wessel: Right.

00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:57.800
Q Do you ever see a Fed chairman like, you
know, Volcker, coming back, who is much more

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.370
aggressive on pricking bubbles in their infancy?

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:05.040
David Wessel: Well, I don't think Volcker
is a good example of someone who pricks a

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.340
bubble.
Paul Volcker, who was the Chairman of the

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.290
Federal Reserve in the 1980s -- early 1980s
 -- took over at a time when we had very high

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.820
inflation in the United States.
And he had the guts to say, "I'm going to

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.150
raise interest rates so high that the economy
will go into such a deep recession that there's

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.450
no way that we can have inflation.”
And I think he set an example for central

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:31.370
bankers and both Greenspan and Bernanke have
benefited by the view that, as painful as

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:36.140
that was, that was probably the right thing
and we have a stronger economy as a result.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.960
So Bernanke says he's determined not to let
inflation get out of hand.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.880
Now, to be sure, inflation is not a problem
now.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.820
It's really hard to get a good inflation going
when you have ten percent unemployment and

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.360
more unused capacity in American factories
than we've had in decades.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.900
The question is whether he has created so
much money that he won't pull it out of the

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.880
system in time to avoid the inflation.
I can tell you that he says he will and I

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.760
believe that he intends to, but will he be
able to do it or not is not a question I can

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.490
answer.
And the people who look at history -- and

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:15.050
the wonderful thing about economics is you
can find an historical example for any case

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.840
you want to make.
The people who look at history say that, When

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.710
countries get into trouble and they borrow
lots of money, they tend to end up creating

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.910
inflation to get out of it, because it's easier
to pay back your debts with cheaper dollars.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.780
But I don't know that that -- and that's true.
That's a definite effect.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.750
But I don't know -- and if you say the opposite,
and you say, "Well, this is different.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.100
This is the United States of America, and
things are weirder here.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.760
We have some -- we have a currency that no
one else can match.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.770
And we have all sorts of things.”
So you say, "Well, this time is going to be

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.430
different.”
And then, cynical reporters like me say, "We've

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.250
heard that before.
It's always going to be different.”

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.780
So is it a risk? Yes.
Do I know what's going to happen? No.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:07.600
Q So you said that Greenspan's greatest sin
was his sort of faith in the free market,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.900
right? But I think it's not really very controversial
to say that his greatest sin was the low interest

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.900
rates.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:23.040
David Wessel: Right. Well, they're related.
Look, let me give you the answer this way.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.080
I think it's very easy to say in hindsight
that the Fed kept interest rates too low too

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:36.290
long, but that was only obvious in hindsight.
Where were we when he was doing this? We were

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.780
 -- he thought and Bernanke thought -- at
risk of having something like Japan, where

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.450
you have this deflation where prices fall
and people don't spend, and you end up in

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:50.960
a kind of a downward spiral.
And their reading of the economy and of economics

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.740
was that at times like that you cut interest
rates low and you let them stay low until

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.540
the economy gets going again.
And it wasn't so obvious at the time that

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.890
that was the wrong decision.
I think the question about relying on the

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:10.090
self-interest of markets to regulate themselves
was more evident at the time that that was

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.590
a mistake.
There was one big mistake which was, people

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.460
thought that if -- you and Greenspan had a
very good way of talking about this -- if

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.820
you made a lot of loans and turned them into
securities and sold those securities to other

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.600
people, you spread the risks throughout the
system and that that would make for a more

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.280
stable economy.
His metaphor was it was like the electronics

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.310
on an airplane.
On a sophisticated airplane, the electronics

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.980
were always adjusting so the ride could be
smoother.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.710
The financial system was these electronics,
and it was absorbing a lot of the volatility

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.220
in the economy so the economy -- the airplane
 -- could fly more smoothly.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.750
That was widely held. It turned out to be
wrong.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.850
But the second thing -- and this is where
there were lots of objections -- was this

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.810
view that, when in doubt, don't regulate.
And that was something that was challenged

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.980
at the time, but he had so much intellectual
clout.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:04.450
He had so convinced people that he knew more
than they did that they listened to him.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:09.000
And he was part of a groupthink in Washington
that led that basically we'll have a better

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.510
economy the fewer financial regulations we
have.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:16.710
And so, the reason I say that I think that
was the bigger sin was because, I think that

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.290
was more evident at the time.
Interest rates being too low for too long

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.440
is only really clear to me in hindsight.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.520
Q Another question if I may?

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520
David Wessel: Sure.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:33.240
Q Yeah. So we therefore created basically
 -- or continue to create -- moral hazard,

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.020
right?
And so, instead of asking ourselves, How do

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:42.280
we convince basically these people to say,
"Okay, take our money to bail out these players

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.730
in the financial system when they fail.”
Shouldn't we be asking, Why don't they have

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.600
the incentive?
Why doesn't it come back to them?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600
David Wessel: Yes, absolutely.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.190
Q What's wrong with the system?
And aren't a lot of the things that Bernanke

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.920
and Greenspan did -- aren't they perpetuating
the moral hazard?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.160
David Wessel: Yes. So there are two parts
to what you said.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.060
One is, there's one easy part and one hard
part.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.790
The easy part is,
"Okay. So it should have been obvious and

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.760
now we know.”
If you tell people, If you make a mortgage

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:15.380
to somebody, and then you take that mortgage
and sell it to somebody else, and if the homeowner

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.490
doesn't pay the loan, the somebody else gets
stuck with the losses, that you don't have

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.139
much incentive to be very careful about who
you lend to.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.399
Even less incentive if you're making a lot
of money by moving these mortgages.

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:29.990
So that business will probably come to an
end now.

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:33.639
And there are proposals -- which the administration
and the Fed is in favor of -- which says,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.380
If you make a mortgage to somebody, you've
got to hold a piece of it.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.399
So if they don't pay back the mortgage, you're
on the hook too, not just the poor schnook

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:44.970
who bought the loan.
So that's the easy part. We have had a system

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:45.970
that.

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.910
Q But that doesn't eliminate the poor schnooks
buying those loans though.

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:49.910
Shouldn't they watch out too?

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:53.500
David Wessel: Yes, they should. Right?
But, that's one of the things that's kind

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.110
of frustrating about this.
They were sophisticated people.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.741
The people at Bear Stearns had a lot of money
in their company, yet they did things that

00:34:59.741 --> 00:35:02.441
were risky.
But I think the bigger moral hazard question

00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:06.120
is one you alluded to.
"Moral hazard" means that if you give somebody

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.260
insurance and say, "If you do something stupid,
we'll cover your losses.”

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.880
You kind of don't have much reason to be careful.
And so, we have set up a situation where if

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.990
you lend money to a big financial institution
on Wall Street, if it's big enough, you can

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.160
be sure that, as a result of this crisis,
the Fed and the Treasury will make you whole

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.340
if they go under.
Which will lead to you lend them more money

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:32.040
at cheaper rates than is wise and will create
an incentive for them to take bigger risks

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.920
and put us through this wringer again.
And that is a huge problem that they're wrestling

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.060
with now in Washington how to solve.
It's often called "The too-big-to-fail problem.”

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.110
Now, one answer -- George Schultz, who's now
at Stanford says,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:49.110
"Too big to fail? Means you're too big.”
And that we ought not to have so many big

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.040
institutions.
The current thinking at the Fed and the Treasury

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.240
is that that's just not possible, that there
are advantages to scale, and there are particularly

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.610
lots of big banks around the world.
We have a list in the Wall Street Journal

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.340
today of the ten biggest banks and two of
them are American, eight are foreign.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.410
So if we bust up those two, we still have
a lot of big foreign banks and they could

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.610
do the same thing to us that Lehman Brothers
just did to us.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.750
So they're wrestling with ways in which you
create fewer incentives to get big, and you

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:20.060
basically tax them if they're relying on this
government insurance.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.500
So if you read the stories that are coming
out of the G-20 meeting in Pittsburg this

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.700
week, you'll see that Tim Geithner, the Treasury
Secretary, is on a kind of campaign to get

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.240
banks to hold more capital.
What that means is that, These big institutions

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.960
 -- if they're putting the whole system at
risk -- should be forced to have bigger capital

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.120
cushions, so if they have losses, they can
absorb more of the losses themselves.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.450
The bigger the capital cushion, the less leverage
they have, the less borrowing ability, the

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.560
less profitable they will be.
And so, they're trying to set up a system

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.230
where, If you are too big to fail, you have
to pay some penalty and take some safeguards

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.860
in order to make it less likely that we'll
run through this thing.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.080
But it's very difficult because, no matter
what the Treasury, the Fed, and the President

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.130
say, no one's going to believe them when they
say, "We're not going to save a big financial

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.430
institution.”
We just proved that. If things are bad enough,

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.450
we'll save them.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.820
Q And you can't really legislate success,
right?

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820
You can't say --

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.550
David Wessel: You cannot legislate success.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:17.110
Q Can you talk a little bit about where the
AIG money went?

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:21.100
David Wessel: Let's bracket that and let some
other people -- if we run out of questions,

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.670
I'll answer that.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:29.060
Q Sort of a segway from the moral hazard question.
Some of these CDOs, they're actually.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:35.800
You know, people didn't think they were taking
risks, because they were all rated as good

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.680
as U.S.
Treasuries by the rating agencies.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.980
And there was at least some recent reports
that I saw that there might be some corruption

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.460
involved in the sense that they actually give
good ratings because they thought they wouldn't

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.700
get more business if they give bad ratings
to these things.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.350
I mean, how does the regulatory agencies,
the laws, actually?

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.230
David Wessel: Right. That's a good question.
All right. So one of the things that's kind

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:08.240
of the most upsetting about this whole episode
is, How many institutions and checks on the

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.510
financial system failed here.
I mean, just think of the litany.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.380
So there were these bank risk management committees
that didn't know the risks that their banks

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.220
were taking.
There were the credit rating agencies, as

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.610
you say, which certified things as being triple
A, that was supposed to mean that there was

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.680
very little chance of default, which proved
to be wrong.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.710
They had an incentive, you're right.
They were paid by issuers, and that seems

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.510
like somewhat of a corrupt system.
They were the people who made the mortgages

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.050
that we talked about earlier.
They were the people who took the mortgages,

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:41.810
hoping that they would never have to worry
because if house prices go up, you can always

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.710
refinance.
And there was the regulators that were kind

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:51.240
of blind to the fact that -- looking at banks
one at a time didn't tell you about how much

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.390
problems at Bank A could affect Bank C, D,
and E, and how the problems at Bank E could

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.620
affect F, G, and H.
And so, they didn't look at the thing systemically.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.310
And I think there was also -- to be quite
candid -- a failure on our part in the press

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.640
that we didn't listen enough to the people
who were trying to point this out.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.650
And when we did write about problems, we didn't
do it in a way that had an impact.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:17.410
And that's a failure on our part.
So, but one of the things that -- so, and

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:21.760
we are now addressing those serially.
And people should be more skeptical about

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.210
rating agencies and I think they will be in
the future.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:30.701
The government did things to set up the rating
agencies as authorities and the government

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.961
is now going to undo that.
But there is -- part of the thing that you

00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:38.800
said, which reminds you that This is kind
of an unusual event, and people do not get

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.700
prepared for very, very improbable, unusual
events.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.300
People got mortgages, these mortgages were
put into a pool, they sliced them into ten

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.210
pieces, and they said that the first piece
you got hit by the first people who don't

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.430
pay their mortgages, and if there's not enough
money there, then the second piece will get

00:39:54.430 --> 00:40:00.280
hit, all the way through to the tenth piece.
And the tenth piece looked relatively safe.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.550
It probably wasn't triple A, but there was
good reason to believe it was safe.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.400
After all, there were nine other slices that
were going to have to get whacked before you

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.250
did.
But housing prices fell so much that the tenth

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.830
piece got whacked.
And there, I think, is where we learned just

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:18.310
how much of our financial system was built
on the jello of an assumption that housing

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.600
prices would never fall across the board in
the United States.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.470
And that really was a failure of imagination.
People just did not think that could happen.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.580
They were taking greater risks than they realized,
and we're paying the price now.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.950
Q Yeah.
I'm curious what your thoughts around just

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.200
kind of the government's decision to let Lehman
fail.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.400
And if it was based on kind of Paulson's overplaying
his hand that the government wouldn't backstop

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.880
a deal with say, Barclays, and what not.
And then, the ultimate kind of hypocrisy if

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.850
not, the way that it looks in terms of conflicts
of interest having him being the former president

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:53.030
CEO of Goldman Sachs and backing up AIG and
the whole relationship there.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.030
What are your thoughts on that?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.951
David Wessel: So it's a good question and
you hear that a lot.

00:40:55.951 --> 00:40:59.580
Just so people understand where this is coming
from.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:05.210
So Paulson is a former CEO of Goldman Sachs
and he's the Treasury Secretary.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.250
And there's a long history of people going
from Goldman Sachs to positions in Washington.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.450
We sometimes call them "Government Sachs"
for that reason.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:19.970
And it is clear that Paulson is kind of an
impulsive guy who has a visceral dislike for

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:25.280
both the people at Bear Stearns and the people
at Lehman Brothers and realizes like,

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.830
"Oh, my gosh. This could really be bad. Goldman
Sachs could be next.”

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.530
And that helps motivate him.
So I think in terms if -- So if you're asking

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.290
me, "Did that have any influence on him?"
the answer is, "Yes.”

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:40.490
Are you asking me, "Was Hank Paulson a card-carrying
member of the Wall Street establishment, who

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.510
believed that, 'Investment banks do more good
than harm'?”

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.300
The answer to that is, "Yes.”
But where I think people are just a little

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.970
too conspiratorial to me is "That he was doing
all this because it was going to line his

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:55.480
own pocket or take care of Goldman Sachs,"
and I honestly don't believe that's the case.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.240
I know it doesn't sound like the cynical reporter,
but I don't think that that's fair to him.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.770
I think he really was trying to save the system.
But there is a big question about Goldman

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.560
Sachs, which basically goes like this, "They
always seem to be on the winning side of this

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.500
thing.
So, are they smart or do they cheat?”

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.430
And honest to God, I don't know the answer.
And it's one of the reasons I'm hoping that

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:18.500
this commission that was set up that Phil
Angelides chairs, the Treasurer of California,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.820
will make that one of their questions.
Because it would be good to learn -- if they

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.250
were so smart -- what we can learn from that.
And they are pretty good at managing risks,

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.850
but if they are taking advantage of their
strength in order to do end-runs or getting

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.100
inside information from the government about
what the government's going to do, then that's

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.640
obviously not fair and something needs to
be done about it.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.240
I think the decision on Lehman -- I think
it's a muddle.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.840
We're never really going to know what motivated
them. I think -- and they've changed their

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.600
story over time, as I say.
They now build it all on this legal thing.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.070
But I think that they would have preferred
to sell it to Barclay's.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:59.660
I think Paulson was trying to do the tough-guy
thing to Wall Street.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.080
And one of Paulson's failures I think is that
he was a dealmaker.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.960
So he would say things in the process of making
a deal that, you know, when the deal's done

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.980
it doesn't really matter that I kind of exaggerated.
But when you're running a government policy,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.350
people tend to believe what you say.
And they kind of think that you're enunciating

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.370
a principle that will apply tomorrow, the
day after, the day after that.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.950
So he says things, "I am not going to buy
stock in the banks.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.730
We're only going to use this $700 billion
to buy assets.”

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:29.560
And then, Congress has barely passed the law
and he says, "We got to buy stock in the banks.”

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.381
And then he says, "Why are people so confused?”
And I've talked to him about this.

00:43:33.381 --> 00:43:37.200
He honestly thinks if he stood here before
you and he's writing a book -- we'll see if

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.320
he can pull it off -- if he could explain
to you all the things that were going through

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.400
his mind when he said something was not true,
you would be sympathetic and understand that

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.980
it's okay that he didn't say what he was really
thinking.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:53.000
The mall line to that is, "Well, what you
say -- it's what people hear that matters.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.330
And people heard you say one thing and not
another.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.640
They're confused.
And so, it makes them suspicious of everything

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640
else.”

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:05.340
Q It was my understanding that one of the
reasons for the past crisis was that the banks

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340
were over-leveraged?

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.720
David Wessel: Correct.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:14.580
Q That they essentially lent money to each
other, borrowed from each other, the monies

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.830
that they kind of printed themselves that
were not issued by the Fed.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:29.170
It was just IOUs.
So the question is, Is the economy leveraged

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:36.610
now, where we still have more this, you know,
funny money circulating in the economy and

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.440
the second crisis awaits?

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.000
David Wessel: Well, I hope the second crisis
doesn't await, but there's always a possibility.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.350
Look I don't -- it is true that the banking
system and the whole U.S. economy was leveraged

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:55.790
to a degree that now seems imprudent.
'Leveraged' meaning that they -- you have

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.310
ten dollars worth of capital.
You borrow $90 billion worth of capital, and

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.410
you invest it in something.
And then if it goes up, you make a huge return,

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.870
because you have only a little bit of capital
invested.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:11.121
But if it goes down, you're out of business.
And I don't think it's right to say that was

00:45:11.121 --> 00:45:13.540
funny money.
In fact, the problem was it wasn't so funny.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:19.470
There were people who had lent them that money.
And those people were kind of upset when it

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.620
looked like the money wouldn't get paid back.
So if you were a bondholder of Washington

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.130
Mutual up in Washington state, you didn't
get all your money back.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.160
Or if you were a preferred shareholder of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the government

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.960
sponsored mortgage entities -- you didn't
get all your money back.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:40.500
So it was not funny money.
Now, the question is, So we have too much

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.690
leverage.
We are in the process of, as they say, "de-leveraging.”

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.940
And what that means is, people are going to
have to live a little bit closer within their

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.160
means.
And what we see, if you look at the data -- what

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.420
you see is businesses, both financial and
nonfinancial, and households in particular,

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.600
are paying back their debt.
They're saving more, and the government has

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:06.000
compensated for that by borrowing tons.
And this makes a lot of sense because, if

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.860
everybody tried to pay down their debts all
at once and stop spending money, we'd have

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.970
an even worse recession than we have now.
The question is, Will the government be able

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:20.270
to restrain its borrowing and pay that back,
or are we going to end up with some other

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.960
kind of bubble that comes from having too
much government debt and that borrows too

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.420
much?
Is that responsive?

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.100
Q Not really, but go ahead.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:35.580
Q yeah, well, essentially the question was
If the economist have a formulas that can

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.990
tell them if the system is over-leveraged?

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.990
David Wessel: The answer is, "no."

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.990
Q Okay

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.990
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.241
David Wessel: -- and if they did, you shouldn't
believe it.

00:46:43.241 --> 00:46:46.880
Are there any questions from online you want
to ask?

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:53.610
Q Sure.
I think we might have touched on this briefly,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.420
but a popular question was, "Why does the
Fed continue to allow Goldman access to its

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.190
discount window and other credit facilities
at such low rates?

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.720
They're clearly very profitable and already
rarely act as a lender, especially for small

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.890
to mid-size businesses.”

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:12.280
David Wessel: Right. All right.
So what happened in this crisis was that,

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.070
There were things that were banks -- that
the Fed lent to traditionally, and there were

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:20.390
things that were not banks -- that the Fed
lent to untraditionally.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:24.630
And then, things that were not banks -- magic
formula, they call themselves 'banks,' and

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:28.220
now they can borrow from the Fed.
And Goldman is one of them.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:34.000
I suspect that Goldman is actually not borrowing
very much from the Fed right now.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.450
But it's one of these things where it's kind
of like, In order to save the system, you

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:43.869
have to save the banks on Wall Street.
And as I said, as Bernanke said, "You have

00:47:43.869 --> 00:47:46.640
to save Wall Street in order to save Main
Street.”

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.110
And if you save Wall Street, people who are
big players on Wall Street are going to get

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.421
bailed out.
And the question about AIG earlier is related

00:47:53.421 --> 00:47:55.880
to that.
Because, Why did they have to save AIG?

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.300
Why did they decide they had to save AIG?
Because AIG had deals with almost everybody

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.670
in the world.
And they were afraid that if AIG went under

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.140
in a messy way -- the same way Lehman had
gone under in a messy way -- that the system

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:12.050
would stop functioning.
So they paid off all of AIG's creditors at

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.460
a hundred cents on the dollar.
And among those creditors was Goldman Sachs

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.950
and a lot of other banks, a lot of them overseas.
And that leads people to say like, "Well,

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:23.560
what kind of a game is this, right?”
You work for Chrysler and your contract is

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.990
shredded, because the company goes bankrupt
and you have to take lower wages or less health

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:32.270
care, but you're smart enough to make bets
with some big financial institution that the

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:36.770
federal government has determined is -- we
are unable to let go, and you get paid off

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.630
a hundred cents on the dollar.
And there's a lot of logic to that thing.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:43.300
So one of the things that's going on now -- one
of the things I find most frustrating as a

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.861
citizen is that, Bernanke and Obama and Geithner
have gone to Congress and said, "We don't

00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:51.450
want to be in this position again.
If there's another Lehman or AIG that goes,

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:56.060
we want to have a choice between bankruptcy
 -- which we think is too messy, and too dangerous

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.670
 -- and bailout, which you don't like.
So give us some third way.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.760
The same way that the FDIC can go in and take
care of a failing bank.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.900
Let us decide who gets paid back or who doesn't
get paid back.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.940
Let us do the sort of rough justice thing.”
And Congress has refused to give them that

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.320
power.
Not because they're against it, but because

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.369
Congress can't seem to get anything done these
days.

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:20.040
And so, one of the things that's most frightening
is that Bernanke and Geithner and Obama have

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.210
no more authority to deal with a crisis like
Lehman Brothers today than they had a year

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.140
ago when it happened, and I think that's irresponsible.
So let's see.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.500
I see a couple of people.
Why don't we take a couple of more questions.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:37.320
And I'm happy to -- there are more online
you want to do? Okay.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:44.710
Q Okay. This is another popular one.
"Does the Fed now believe it's responsible

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:50.380
to pop bubbles? If so, how does it intend
to trade that off with other two responsibilities:

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:56.619
To keep inflation down and the economy stable?
Serving three masters is harder than serving

00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:57.619
two.”

00:49:57.619 --> 00:50:02.060
David Wessel: Yeah, but life's hard, right?
So, it's a really good question.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:06.960
So the conventional wisdom was that the Fed
should not pop bubbles.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.790
What that means is that, if the Fed is sitting
around like you and me might sit around.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:13.300
We could all agree that stock prices have
gone up too far.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:17.130
Housing prices have gone up too far.
The conventional wisdom is the Fed should

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:21.540
not raise interest rates to try and bring
down those prices of those assets.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:26.350
And the thinking was that, "Well, first of
all, you might be popping a bubble that's

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.400
not really a bubble.
You only know after the fact if it's a bubble.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.820
And you might actually do more harm than good
by popping a bubble.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.440
And our job is to clean up the mess after
the bubble bursts.”

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.240
And this theory got a great test during the
tech stock bubble where they did very little.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.500
You may remember Greenspan made that famous
speech about "Irrational Exuberance," which

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.741
everybody pretty much ignored.
And then, the bubble burst.

00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:51.580
And they did things -- lowered interest rates
 -- to keep the economy moving.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.590
We had a recession, but it was a weak one.
And so, there was a lot of applause among

00:50:55.590 --> 00:51:01.800
the economists that this was the right view.
And Bernanke was a subscriber to that view.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.980
But if you ask Bernanke now what he thinks,
he says, "We have to rethink that thing."

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.860
Because we have just seen how much damage
can be done to an economy.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.660
I mean, this is the worst recession we've
had since the Great Depression itself.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.460
We have seen how much damage can be done to
an economy when the bubble bursts.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:23.240
So I think there is a kind of -- this kind
of shakes up the intellectual underpinnings

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.450
that influenced monetary policy in the past
and they are in the process of rethinking

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.990
this.
And I think that, at least for the near term,

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.970
they will give more thought to whether they
should prick an asset bubble they think is

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.900
happening because of this.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:44.460
Q Should institutions that are "Too big to
fail" be allowed to exist?

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.890
David Wessel: Right. Well, I think I answered
that.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:49.970
The answer is, "Probably not, but we haven't
found a way to do without these big institutions.”

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:55.030
So the question is, How do we build a system
that is more insulated against the damage

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.920
done when one of these big institutions fails?

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:03.610
Q What new regulations does the Fed want to
create to dissipate the moral hazard caused

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.580
by its support for large banks?

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:10.550
David Wessel: The Fed wants to A, make these
banks hold more capital so they're less profitable.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.670
It's kind of a tax on size.
Secondly, they promise to be more vigilant

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:18.270
in the regulation and supervision, which I'm
sure they'll be for a few years until the

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.790
memories wear thin.
And thirdly, you may have seen in the papers

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:25.990
the other day, they're talking about ways
to tweak the compensation of the big banks

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.200
to create fewer incentives to take these risks.
And I felt one of the most interesting things

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.280
they were doing is, they say they're going
to take the 25 banks, and they're going to

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.380
put their compensation plans on the table.
And they're going to ask the question, If

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.720
one of the banks is being more generous or
has some kind of weird thing, why are you

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.930
an outlier?
It's kind of like what they do in major league

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:49.110
sports, to try and prevent the banks from
having a bidding war for talent.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:52.480
So it's a good thing you're here and not going
to business school and going to work in finance.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.480
We have time for one more?

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.480
&gt;&gt; One more.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.600
David Wessel: No, let's take this gentleman
behind you.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:02.160
Q Yeah. So for banks and lenders, increasing
capital requirements can kind of help them

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.310
to be more stable, but for something like
AIG where they sell insurance, right?

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:14.310
It's not clear what kind of capital they need.
It seems like it's much harder for something

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:16.660
like AIG that's buying risk rather than lending
money.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.880
David Wessel: AIG is something that should
not have been allowed to exist.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:25.230
The problem wasn't their insurance businesses.
The problem was this huge portfolio of bets

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:30.270
 -- the casino they were running on the side
 -- and they did not hold enough capital to

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:36.130
make good those risks, make those bets.
So the answer is, we know pretty much how

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:40.440
to regulate insurance companies and we have
guaranteed funds when insurance companies

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.310
fail, but if you're going to be an insurance
company, then if you're also going to be in

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:48.780
the business of running a financial casino
on the side, that you have to have substantial

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.349
capital to back that up if you're doing this
risky trading.

00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:54.430
&gt;&gt; David, thank you very much.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:55.430
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.510
David Wessel: Thank you.
