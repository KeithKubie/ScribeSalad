00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 The first thing I want to say is, if you are dealing with a depressed person, he is very depressed 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.700
 You should try giving him antidepressants. 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 Because if he dies, you can not help him 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.160
 Well, if you suffer, you're bound by some kind of thing 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.160
 Hold on to any rope someone throws to you. 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.900
 One of the things that I do with my clients (patients) all the time and especially if they are in trouble, is to tell them 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.620
 Look, "I do not know exactly what will help you" 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.020
 But do not throw away any possibility, because you may not have this luxury. " 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.540
 Antidepressants have helped many people, and there are technical reasons why. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.320
 ...So 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 This is a simple answer, which is not related to what I described earlier 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.980
 So, if you are offered a gift by your community, and effective 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 Try it. Do not care about your assumptions. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.620
 Away from that .... 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.579
 In a lot of time you see people suffering from depression, for example 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.760
 There are multiple reasons, but I will take a common reason. 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.800
 You can think of it in association with the story of Peter Mann, 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.640
 (Peter Mann) is a person who does not want to mature. True? 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.160
 Now, the problem with Peter Mann is that he can become king, but a king on the island of Neverland, and Neverland is unproductive. 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.160
 So being king on nothing is unhelpful 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.340
 One of the things you see a lot in people with depression. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.800
 (And I do not blindly explain the causes of depression, because there are many of them) 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.920
 People who do not have an adequate system in their lives often feel overwhelmed. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.980
 For example, if someone comes to see me, he says he is depressed 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.580
 They always ask their usual questions. 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.480
 "do you have a job?" 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.380
 If you do not have a job, you are really in trouble in our society. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.800
 First, your biological balances tend to drift 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 Because there is no reason to sleep at a specific time, and there is no reason to wake up. 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.320
 And for many people, if they do not wake up at the usual time, 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.200
 They dilute their vital rhythmic balance, which is enough to make them depressed immediately. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.220
 Especially if he falls asleep at noon. 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 They also do not have a goal, and people are not good without a goal 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.860
 This is not a hypothesis. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.880
 We understand circuits that control positive emotions. 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.240
 We know how to work, almost all the positive emotions you will tell. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.680
 It will not be the result of collecting things. 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.420
 The result of seeing things will be working as you move toward a goal you evaluate. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 This is completely different and you need to know it. 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.660
 Because people are often obsessed with, for example, finishing doctoral dissertations 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.920
 Their preconceived assumption is that they will rejoice for a month. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.600
 And often instead they are depressed: and they think 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.020
 Hell, I've been working on it for 7 years, and what am I doing now? 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.840
 And that makes them depressed, is the question "What do I do now ?: 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.780
 They are fine if they enjoy the goal, 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.120
 It has always been useful, they get a lot of fun and enthusiasm. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.600
 For this is how our nervous system works. 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.400
 Most of your positive emotions occur during your pursuit of a goal. 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.760
 If you take drugs, such as cocaine or steroids, cause it's fun 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.740
 Is because they do systems that enable you to continue the goal 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 This is why people love her 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.720
 So if you do not have a job, you do not have a structure. 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.800
 This is not good, too, tend not to possess too much. 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 So you are overwhelmed by chaos and lack of foundation, and you do not have positive emotions. 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.540
 2) Well, do you have any friends 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.580
 So, sometimes you see depressed people: they have no job, no friends, 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.280
 They do not have social relations, 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.780
 They have an additional health problem, and they have alcohol and drugs. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.280
 My experience was: If you have three of these problems, 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 Almost impossible to help you 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.980
 You are so steeped in anarchy that you can not go out, 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.160
 Because it is advancing on one side, and one of these problems is being dealt down. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.200
 So one of the things he told depressed people: she 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.400
 Do not sacrifice my stability, get a job. 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.000
 Even if you do not have exactly the job you want, get a job for a sample, you need a job. 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.600
 Get some friends, get into the dating circle. 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.100
 See if you can establish an intimate relationship 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.080
 Establish some of the basic things that are like columns to be based on your life. 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.960
 Well, that's a practical thing. 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.480
 This is one example of depression. 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.040
 Well 'the destination is that you do not throw them at them. 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
 You must negotiate with the person. 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.720
 You also have to teach them to negotiate with themselves, and this is useful for their knowledge. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.220
 And you can overwhelm yourself to do things, but I do not advise you. 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.940
 The one who advised him is to ask yourself what you are willing to do 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.800
 It's an effective technique, it's like meditation, for example 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.320
 You can wake up in the morning and you can think 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.780
 I want to have a good day 'so I want to go to sleep without feeling guilty. 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.080
 Because, you know I did not do some of the things that I said I would do, 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.380
 And I want to get an exciting day. 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.640
 So I have to spend my responsibilities, and I want to enjoy the day as well. 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.140
 Then you can ask yourself, OK 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.660
 What should I do, to get it, which I have the willingness to do 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.120
 And you are likely to have done it for 3 or 4 days, your brain will come back and tell you what to do. 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.180
 So you will say that there is a homework that did not end for three weeks, 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.520
 Should you finish it quickly, it will take you 10 minutes 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.040
 And you know, you avoided and tortured yourself to death, to extend 72 hours continuous 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.660
 And if you're done here, there's something else you can do. 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.700
 And you know ... and this is a small obligation that you can get rid of too 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.560
 So what you do in this situation is to teach the person to negotiate with himself. 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.760
 Well: Let's try to define your goals, because you must have goals, which are these goals 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.080
 You may say "I'm so depressed that I do not have goals" 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.300
 I say to them, "Choose the least goals that conflict 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.060
 And act accordingly and see what happens " 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.740
 Because sometimes your emotional systems are corrupt 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.580
 So much so that you have to pretend ... to act before you begin to ratify 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.820
 I mean, people assume they should ratify and then act, but that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.180
 Sometimes this is true, and many times is incorrect. 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.220
 So the trick, if you treat someone and work with him 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.100
 And help him establish a structure, is to discover what he will do 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.320
 Now if he wants to improve his condition, and this is not supposed, 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.740
 Because there are often benefits for not improving 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.160
 These benefits in order to be a martyr 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.940
 Or perhaps the benefits of doing what your sick family wants to do 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.360
 Because they actually want you to fail. 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.780
 Assuming you want to improve, there is usually something you can know, 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.060
 To contribute towards a steady goal. 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.460
 The default is essentially behavioral assumption, is 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.840
 Small gains that are repeated, are super-powerful 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.520
 So, this is another thing you should know about your life 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 Is something learned by a molecule of reading (The Quadrant Solzhenition) 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.140
 He was a Russian philosopher and novelist 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.720
 He said: You can look at your life, and you can see the imbalance in it 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.200
 I mean all you have to do is look. 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.120
 And can begin to reform 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.440
 By noting what you can actually fix. 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.560
 You know, sometimes people try to fix things they can not fix, I do not recommend you. 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.320
 Because if you try to fix something that you can not fix, you will destroy it. 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.420
 For example, you can find all kinds of university graduates, and they are ready 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.440
 To restructure the global economic system 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.420
 They can not keep their room clean 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.100
 There is a big gap, and it's amazing that people do not notice it. 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.020
 So if you focus your attention, you can see things you can fix. 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.600
 These things scream at you, they do it really, and we know how it happens. 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.640
 Let me give you an example, because the rooms are full of stories. 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.960
 Stories have an impact on you, this is a classic example. 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.740
 Take two groups of university students, put them in a lab, 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.480
 One group gives multiple test questions, 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.480
 There are words associated with old age 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.160
 The other group gives the same choice 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.120
 But the words are associated with the young 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.020
 This independent of context, experience, is only a characterization. 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.540
 And then measure the speed of university students as they walk to the elevator 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.020
 Who completed the test 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.180
 Which contained words associated with aging, walked slowly to the elevator 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.140
 They do not know they're doing it 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.240
 This study was re-tested more than once in different formats 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.600
 You are incredibly sensitive to the stories you tell your environment 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.640
 Because your environment is not made up of objects 

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.320
 This is wrong, your environment is made up of something like tools and consequences. 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.380
 You are a user object for the tool, you are an aware object 

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.340
 things that 

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.760
 For example, if I took something from the room and said, well what was in the room? 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.720
 Would not say like, random patterns in carpet. 

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.040
 But it is a fact like any other purpose. 

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.140
 You will say "chairs" because you can sit on them 

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.520
 And will say "railing" because you can use, 

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.620
 You will say "drawer" because you can walk it. 

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.060
 This is what you see this is what you interact with 

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.820
 And if you pay attention to your environment. 

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.580
 You are an extended idea, and all your experiences are you 

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.600
 It will tell you what to do all the time, and all you have to do is do it 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.640
 But then you have to decide if you want to do it. 

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.180
 One of the things I noticed in people .... 

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.960
 When I started to study these legends and stories, 

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:55.060
 And I got the idea about the fact that life can be meaningful enough to justify its suffering 

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.820
 I thought it was a great idea 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.880
 Because it's not exactly optimistic, you know, some people will tell you to be happy 

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.100
 These people are stupid, I tell you these people are stupid! 

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.980
 There will be things that come and crush you so hard you can not believe them. 

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.880
 And then you will not be happy, so if life is for happiness 

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.800
 In those situations what do you do? Why do you live? 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.440
 But life is not to be happy if you are happy you are so lucky, you should enjoy it 

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.820
 You must, for it is the grace of God, so to speak 

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.060
 As for the meaning, I thought well 

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.960
 People know when to do something meaningful, they can know that 

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.580
 So why the hell do not they do meaningful things all the time? 

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.240
 It seems obvious, you can do it, I mean it's tough 

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.680
 You know, because others want you to do other things, it's hard 

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.280
 But everything is difficult 

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.000
 I thought "Well, I understand why" it took me about 10 years to understand 

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.220
 People have a choice! 

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.420
 Check # 1: Nothing you do mean anything 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.360
 Well that's tired, healthy 

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.020
 The nihilism of life and all existential concern, you know, that kind of pain 

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.280
 But the beneficial side is "nothing you do makes sense" 

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.440
 Is that you do not have to do anything, you have no responsibility! 

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.340
 Now you will suffer because things are meaningless 

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.400
 But this is a small cost to be totally useless! 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.760
 Alternative .... is (check # 2) "Everything you do has importance" 

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.360
 Oh really! If you make a mistake it is a real mistake! 

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.920
 If someone is betrayed, the world tends little to evil, instead of good 

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.640
 What you do has importance! 

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.340
 Well if you believe it, you can have a meaningful life, but there is no disrespect 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.040
 That means responsibility, which means that the decisions you make are important 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.540
 That means when you do something wrong it is wrong! 

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.860
 Well ... do you want it?
