00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.150
In the last video we went over
the multiplication tables for 1

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.370
through 9 and I ran out of
time, and actually, it was a

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.820
good thing because 1 through 9
are kind of the core

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.270
multiplication tables.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.860
And you'll see that if you know
all your multiplication tables

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.930
from 1 to 9, so you know any
number between 1 and 9 times

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.380
any other number between 1 and
9, you can actually do

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.680
any multiplication
problem out there.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.550
But what I want to do now
is I want to complete the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.820
multiplication tables
for 10, 11, and 12.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.690
So what is 10 times--
let's just start with 0.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.990
10 times 0.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.040
Anything times 0 is 0.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.400
Ten 0's are 0.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.830
0 plus 0 plus 0 ten
times is still 0.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.246
What's 10 times 1?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.990
Well that's just 10 one time.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.750
Or 1 plus itself ten times.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.900
That's 10.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.510
I think this is second nature
to you at this point.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.980
What's 10 times 2?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.670
I meant to switch
colors, but I didn't.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.060
10 times 2?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.960
That's 10 plus 10, which is 20.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.560
Fair enough.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.660
And notice, we went up
by 10 the first time.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.220
We went up by 10
again to get to 20.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.710
What's 10 times 3?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.710
Well, that's 10 plus 10 plus
10, or we could view it as 10

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.460
times 2 plus another 10,
which is equal to 30.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.330
What's 10 times 4?

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.680
I think you start
to see a pattern.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
10 times 4 is equal to 40.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.410
Notice, 10 times 4
is equal to 40.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.040
If I were to tell you what
is 10 times-- let me

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.870
do another color-- 5?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.270
Well that's equal to 50.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.420
10 times anything is that
anything with a 0 behind it.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.020
So the 10 times tables
you almost don't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.320
have to remember it.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.390
So let's just keep going.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.000
What's 10 times 6?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.850
It's equal to 60.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.150
6 0.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.100
What's 10 times 7?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.310
70.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.350
10 times 8?

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.930
This is almost ridiculous.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.820
10 times 8 is 80.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.040
10 times 9?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.330
90.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.600
10 times 10?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.385
Now this is interesting.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.996
So it'll be a 10-- let's
see me write this.

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:32.190
Let me do it in
this orange color.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.250
10 times 10.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.550
So it'll be ten 10's or a
10 with a 0 behind it.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.000
There you go.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.860
Notice everything-- whatever
times 10 I just add a 0 and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.600
then I get the next number.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.960
So it's 100.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.530
And I think you
understand why that is.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.910
I added 10 to itself ten times.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.710
That each 10-- you
go from 10, 20, 30.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.250
30 is just three
10's or 10 times 3.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.260
90 is just nine 10's
or 9 times 10.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.460
Let's keep going.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.130
So 10 times 11 is equal to
11 with a 0 behind it.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.970
110.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.080
Finally, 10 times 12
is equal to 120.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.380
Now, just for fun, these are
kind of your 10 times tables.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.480
But now that t know the
pattern you can do anything.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.630
If I asked you what 5,732 times
10 is, what's it going to be?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.080
It's going to be this number
with just one more 0.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.660
So it's going to be-- I
won't read it out yet.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.100
5 7 3 2 with a 0 behind it.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.640
And just so you know, this
little comma that I wrote in

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.040
the number there, that's
just to make it easier for

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.990
me to read that number.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.680
And you put the comma-- you
start over here and every third

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.750
number you put the comma.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.080
So here I'm going to put
the comma right here.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.970
I'm going to put the
comma right there.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.650
So now I can read this.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.500
The comma doesn't really add
or take anything away from

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.200
the number, it just
helps me read it.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.900
Now 5,732 times 10 is 57,320.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.420
i just had to add a 0 there,
but that was a pretty

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.770
straightforward multiplication.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.670
And notice, we had 5,000 times
10 and we got to 50 something

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.080
thousand when we
multiplied them.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.960
So that's similar to 5
times 10 is equal to 50.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.520
But instead of 5 I had a 5,000,
and so I got a 50,000 and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.060
something and all
this other stuff.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.750
We're going to learn more
about how to do problems

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.950
like this in the future.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.420
But I thought I would introduce
you to the idea that just from

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.660
this little pattern of adding a
0 you already know your

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.700
10's times tables.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.855
Now let's do our 11's.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.670
Well, they start off easy, and
then they get a little more

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.150
difficult as we get
into high numbers.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.010
11 times 0.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.520
This is easy, this is 0.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.840
11 times 1.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.010
This is also easy.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.020
It's 11.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.360
11 times 2.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.280
We're going to start
seeing a pattern here.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.430
It's 11 plus 11 or we could've
added 2 to itself eleven times,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.460
but that is equal to 22.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.520
If we do 11 times 3
it is equal to 33.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.560
11 times 4 is equal to 44.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.970
I think this is becoming
obvious to you.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.990
What's 11 times 5?

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.940
11 times 5 is 55.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.010
Notice I put the 5 twice.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.940
What's 11 times 6?

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.340
It's 66.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.837
11 times 7 is 84-- no.

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:32.270
I'm kidding.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.720
I didn't want to mess
with you like that.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.250
But no.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.320
Of course, it's 77.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.090
You just repeat
the number twice.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.640
Let me switch colors.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.270
11 times 8 is equal to 88.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.420
11 times 9 is equal to 99.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.800
Now what's 11 times 12?

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.750
Oh sorry, I skipped 10.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.150
11 times 10.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.160
You might want to
say it's 1,010.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.730
No.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.410
That's wrong.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.100
It's not 1,010.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.990
So that little pattern that we
had where you just repeat the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.000
number, that only worked
for one-digit numbers.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.490
So it only worked
for 1 through 9.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.860
11 times 10?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.580
Well, we could think about
it a couple of ways.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.750
We can add 11 to 99.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.355
So we can say it's 99 plus 11.

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:21.990
And what's that?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.400
That's equal to 110.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.650
And I'm going to show you how
to do-- well, hopefully you've

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.320
already watched the video on
how to add two-digit numbers

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.220
like this, but that's 110.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.640
Or you could just use the
property from the 10's times

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.000
tables that we learned where if
you just take 11 times 10 you

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.680
add a 0 to the 11, you get 110.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.570
That's the 11 right there.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.920
Finally, let's do 11 times 12.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.480
No easy way to remember
this, you just kind of

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.090
should remember it.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.180
Or you could say look,
it's going to be 11 more

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.320
than 11 times-- sorry.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.150
I keep skipping things.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.420
We should do 11 times 11 first.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.710
Let me make sure this is clear.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.600
We're doing 11 times 11
before we go to 11 times 12.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.490
So 11 times 11 is going to be
11 more than 11 times 10.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.280
So we add 11 to this.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.130
11 plus 110 is 121.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.170
And actually, as you'll see,
there actually is an order as

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.800
we get to higher multiples of
11, but I'll leave that

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.250
to a future video.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.300
And then finally,
we're at 11 times 12.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.540
And we could add 11 to
itself twelve times.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.770
We could add 12 to
itself eleven times.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.990
Or we could just say, hey,
is going to be 11 more

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.910
than 11 times 11.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.850
So that is what?

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.810
You add 11 to this.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.350
What do you get?

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.370
You get 132.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.120
I just added 121 plus
11 and then got 132.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.605
Now the other way you could
have said it is, well,

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.900
what's 10 times 12?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.170
We already knew that.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.580
That was 120.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.980
So 11 times 12 because we're
multiplying 12 by one more

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.940
should be 12 more than that.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.710
So that should be 132.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.100
So two ways to get the
exact same answer.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.785
All right, now let's do
our 12 times tables.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.650
And once you know this you
are ready to tackle any type

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.745
of multiplication problem.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:21.995
But we'll do that
in future videos.

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:24.000
So 12 times 0.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.800
Super easy.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.350
0.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.430
12 times 1.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.335
Also super easy.

00:08:27.335 --> 00:08:28.490
Is 12.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.930
Now it gets interesting.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.510
We're going to increase
by 12 every time.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.000
12 times 2 is equal to 24.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.900
12 plus 12 is 24.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.240
12 times-- not 22.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.170
Let me rewrite that.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:50.260
12 times 3 is going to
be 12 plus 12 plus 12.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.990
Or we could write
that as 12 times 2.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.070
I see my brain is doing
the wrong things.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.680
We could rewrite that
as 12 times 2 plus 12.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.780
Or we could rewrite
that as 24 plus 12.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.040
Either way, all of
these get us to 36.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.410
And notice, that's
just that plus 12.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.250
12 times 4.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.190
12 times 4 is equal to 48.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.275
There's a lot of ways you
could think about it.

00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:19.980
You could say 11 times 4 is 44.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.030
And you go up by one more 4,
so you get to 12 times 4.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.630
Or you could say 12 times 3
is 36 and you can add one

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.950
12 to it to get to 48.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.235
Either way works and that's
because you can multiply

00:09:39.235 --> 00:09:40.310
in either direction.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.310
Let's keep going.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:47.850
12 times 5 is equal to 60.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:55.340
10 times 5 is 50, 11 times 5
is 55, so 12 times 5 is 60.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.665
12 times 6 is equal to what?

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.580
It's going to be 12
more than this.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.640
It's going to equal 72.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.520
12 times 7.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.720
12 more than this again.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.470
12 more than 72 is 84.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.890
And I'm serious, I'm probably a
lot older than you are and I

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.200
still, in my head to confirm, I
go to some 12 times tables that

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.700
I remember as definitely right.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.290
Like oh, 12 times 5-- and
sometimes in my head I say,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.100
oh, let me add another 12.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.300
Oh yeah, definitely, my
memory was correct.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.490
12 times 6 is 72.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.030
All right.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.330
Then you go to 12 times 8.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.100
Add 12 to the 12 times 7.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.410
96.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.986
12 times 9 .

00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:44.350
Well you add 12 to
this, so it's 108.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.700
And then 12 times 10.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.680
This is an easy one.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.390
We just add a 0 to
the 12 to get 120.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.210
Or we could've added 12 to 108.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.570
Either way.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.300
12 times 11.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.420
We just did this.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.000
You add 12 to this
you get to 132.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And then 12 times 12
is equal to 144.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.170
And this actually shows up.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.530
If I had a dozen of a dozen
eggs-- a dozen is 12.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.020
Or if I had, I think a gross
is actually 12 dozens.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.420
So that's 144 eggs.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.710
You'll actually end up
seeing this number a lot.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.560
More than you would
expect in life.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.720
But anyway, we've now
completed all of our

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.420
multiplication tables.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.790
And I really encourage you
to take the time now to

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.930
go and memorize them.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.600
Make some flash cards.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.100
Use the little software thing
that I wrote on my website.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.860
You could try that out.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.730
As of September
2009 it's working.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.900
I haven't touched it in a
while, but I'm actually

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.000
probably going to
rebuild it soon.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.050
So if you're watching this
video in the year 2200.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.430
Well, I would probably
not exist anymore.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.260
But hopefully you'll get
a better version of

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.360
the software app.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.030
But you should practice it.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.620
You should get your
parents to quiz you.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.090
You should get notes cards.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.540
You should just be mumbling
to yourself as you walk to

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.190
school-- what is 12 times 9?

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.750
What is 11 times 11?

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.120
And you should quiz each other
because it'll pay huge rewards

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.690
to you later on in life.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.640
See you in the next video.
