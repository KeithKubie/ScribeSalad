♪ ♪

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.754
- Hey, what's going on,
everyone?

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.424
We're here back
at Hickory, North Carolina,

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.842
back at the home forge.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.510
Let me show you around.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.180
So here on this rack we've
got plenty of extra materials.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.517
We've got some leather stuff,
leather carving tools.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.353
Of course some extra belts.
We've got an overflow

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.355
of some Micarta
handle material.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.483
And that's not all.
Things just getting started.

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.236
The saw blade is actually
a pretty cool story.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.196
They're typically made of,
like, L6 which is

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.073
a pretty good carbon steel,

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.075
but the guy I bought it from
had it in a pawn shop

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.785
and was gonna paint
a mural on it.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.038
I said, "Heck no. I'm gonna
put it to some good use."

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:42.041
So here it is making plenty
of chef's knives later,

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.043
and it's a keeper,
that's for sure.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.379

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.757
- Hi, I'm Matt Dairy,
and welcome to my shop.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.717
Here is probably the second
most important tool

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.969
in the shop.
This is my belt grinder.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.013
This is my hammer collection.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.724
When I was young,
I had a weekend job working

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:02.020
for a tool collection,
and they paid me in hammers.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.397
Probably the most important
tool in my shop--

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.107
this is my power hammer.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.901
'Cause I'm kind of old
and I don't have

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.444
[deep voice]
gigantic arms.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.197
This is my homemade forge.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.157
Gets really hot,
so that's great.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.244
This is my 365-pound
Sawyer's anvil

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.663
from France
that I just could not resist.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.791
I am an anvil-holic.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.584
This is my heat-treat setup.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.754
I'm red/green colorblind,
so I love to use kilns

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.923
because that way
I don't have to judge

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.091
red in the blades.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.594
- Next, I've got plenty
of steel to work with.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.097
1080 and even 5160.
We've got 1075 here.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.099
We've even got some 440
which is good

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.810
for a stainless San Mai.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.603
Got plenty
of handle materials here

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.938
as well as Kydex

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.981
for some quick sheaths,
things like that.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.776
We've got all the way
from burl blocks here

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.444
all the way to some
of Micarta

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.112
and even some liners as well.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.281
This is the drilling section
where I keep

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.867
the drill bits,
our drill press,

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.411
and, you know, you gotta have
holes in your knife

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.788
to hold on the handle scales.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.374
I have a variety
of respirators.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.460
We got the drill press.
We've got some rivets

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.963
and some eyelets
for the Kydex sheaths.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.424
Pretty much the general things
that you would drill holes for

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.218
is right here
at this workstation.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.929
- These are
my hot-blade gloves.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.265
I can hold blades up
to--theoretically

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.308
up to about 1,000 degrees,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:26.229
but I usually won't hold
anything over 600 degrees

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.897
for more than a few seconds.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:32.610
There's my spear
from the last episode.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.529
Figured that was the right way
to hang it.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.655
It's part of history now.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.991
That's an old Russian poster

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.702
uh, telling people
not to drink.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.829
That's actually
my cat skeleton.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.332
My dad was a biologist
at Wesleyan University.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.835
So that's my shop here
in Middlefield.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.545
It's my happy place.
