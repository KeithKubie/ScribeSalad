00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.315
OK, so the last lecture we were
talking about competition,

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.874
and the result of competition
between organisms.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:12.114
And I didn't quite finish,
so I just want to finish up on

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:14.916
that lecture,
and then will move on to

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:18.702
predation, an interaction
between two species which

00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:21.806
results in increasing the
fitness and one,

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:24.759
and decreasing the fitness in
the other.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.000
But let's just finish up with
competition.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.388
We were talking about character
displacement and beak depths.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:39.866
And we have shown that when you
have two closely related birds

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:44.087
with the same beak size,
if they live on islands

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:49.206
separate from one another,
they compete for the same food.

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:54.415
But if you live on an island
together, what happens is that

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:59.174
you have this character
displacement where the beak of

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:04.024
what will get bigger and the
beak of the other will get

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:06.000
smaller.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.241
So they can exploit different
food resources.

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:29.741
And this character displacement
is the beginning of species

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:33.000
formation.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.490
And this is very common on
islands.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.623
And these are the famous
finches from the Galapagos

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:47.269
Islands that Darwin first based
his theory of evolution,

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:52.813
or it was an important part of
his theory of evolution,

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:58.357
where he realized that there
must have been an ancestor

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:03.741
finch,
that all of these other finches

00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:09.172
that had different
representation on different

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:16.534
islands evolved from through the
slow change in traits that is

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:23.172
selected as a result of
different combination of species

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:28.482
being together or alone in
different islands.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:35.000
And this is what's called
adaptive radiation.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.038
And this is really a powerful
mechanism for evolution.

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:45.456
This is the Galapagos finches,
but you also see this in an

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:51.064
extreme form in Hawaii among the
honey creepers showing this

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:56.197
incredible diversity of beak
types that have evolved to

00:02:56.197 --> 00:03:00.000
exploit different kinds of food.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.215
OK, so before we go on to
predation, I just want to walk

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:12.544
you through an evolutionary
scenario, so that you can see

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:17.630
how this might work on an
island, Archipelago.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.619
So this is the mainland,
and we're going to start with

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:29.383
an ancestor species,
A, and our Archipelago is going

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.000
to have three islands.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.634
OK, let me draw this.

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:52.000
Here's the same three islands.
00:03:42&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So this is time passing.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.145
So as we move,
these are the same three

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:08.618
islands as a function of time
passing, OK?

00:04:08.618 --> 00:04:14.181
So at the beginning,
we're going to have our founder

00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:18.545
species flying and colonizing
the island.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:21.490
OK, so A is on this island.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.709
And so, the first thing that
happens is that A evolves and

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:30.000
becomes B.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.870
So each one of these is just
the name of the species,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.151
OK?

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.741
This is species A,
species B, through what's known

00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:41.801
as the founder effect.

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:46.765
And that is when you have a few
members of the species

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.201
colonizing on this island.

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:54.446
You have a tiny gene pool,
and the genetic composition of

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:59.316
this drifts such that it
actually becomes a different

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:04.000
species from the one on the
mainland.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.224
So, A becomes B.

00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:14.427
So the full arrow means becomes
B on the islands through the

00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:16.513
founder effect.

00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:24.021
And now, we're going to have B
migrate to a new island.

00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:30.000
So, A is now B on this island,
right?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.389
And B is going to colonize this
island.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:44.628
And through that same founder
effect, B becomes C.

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:51.690
So let me just write what's
happening here.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.707
B becomes C.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:06:02.115
I think you can see what's
happening on one island,

00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:08.000
and then it migrates back.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.508
So, let's let C migrate back to
where B is, and C also founds a

00:06:20.508 --> 00:06:22.728
new island.

00:06:22.728 --> 00:06:31.000
So, we're going to let C
migrate here.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.404
So we end up with C and B here
now able to compete with each

00:06:38.404 --> 00:06:41.542
other, C here and C here.

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:47.190
OK, so we've got a new
combination of species,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.344
and we are going to let C
become D here due to the founder

00:06:54.344 --> 00:07:02.000
effect, and D is going to
migrate over to this island.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:24.741
So, C becomes E when with B
because of character

00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:32.000
displacement.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.406
So, C becomes E here when it's
with B.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:43.397
So you end up with E and B on
this island.

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:48.657
D is going to migrate to this
island.

00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:52.310
So, we have C and D here.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.840
And, C has evolved to be D
here.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.000
So, we also have C becomes D
when alone.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.369
OK, so this is just a scenario
we are making up.

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:11.344
OK, you can make up any
scenario.

00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:16.829
But it's to give you the idea
of how this adaptive radiation

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:17.944
comes about.

00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:22.778
So, starting with one single
species on the mainland,

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:27.706
if you have an island
archipelago where species can be

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:33.469
isolated enough from each other
to restrict, but not completely

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:38.675
eliminate, the gene flow you can
have this rapid adaptive

00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:41.000
radiation.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.826
So, evolutionary biologists
often study islands in order to

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:53.173
study this phenomenon.

00:08:53.173 --> 00:09:02.000
OK, so just to summarize for
competition, interspecific

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:18.000
competition results in
00:09:08&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:31.615
either competitive coexistence,
which can be achieved either

00:09:31.615 --> 00:09:39.000
through niche differentiation.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.635
Do you remember,
what was an example of that

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:45.946
last time?

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:50.271
The barnacles and the inner
tidal.

00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:56.694
One took the high road,
and one took the low road.

00:09:56.694 --> 00:10:01.281
That's called niche
differentiation,

00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:06.000
or character displacement.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.415
And this can happen very
rapidly.

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:12.792
I hesitate to tell you about
really interesting things that

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:15.886
you don't have to know,
but I will anyway.

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:20.113
This is really interesting
study by a couple at Princeton

00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:22.000
of the Galapagos finches.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.528
And they've shown that you can
have character displacement of

00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:29.924
the islands over a period of one
or two years,

00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:34.000
just depending on the amount of
rainfall.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.870
So, it can happen very rapidly
by just selecting for different

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:47.290
character traits,
or competitive exclusion,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:54.645
which is the case where the
niche overlap is so great that

00:10:54.645 --> 00:11:02.000
one of the species completely
outcompete the other.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.733
The example from last time was
the zebra mussels and Gause's

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.503
paramecia in the test tubes
excluding the other.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:15.076
So, these are really important
ecological and evolutionary

00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:15.638
forces.

00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:19.167
The other thing I learned from
your comments,

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:23.740
which I was very heartened by,
is that at least one person

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.634
really liked the definition of
the niche, of the N-dimensional

00:11:28.634 --> 00:11:32.164
hyper volume,
which I have always loved and I

00:11:32.164 --> 00:11:36.897
think is fundamentally important
because people throw around

00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:41.470
ecological niche in everyday
language and think of it as a

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.000
place in the environment.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:56.083
And I think that a more robust
definition is so much more

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.468
useful.

00:11:57.468 --> 00:12:08.026
So, let's move onto predation,
which is a very strong

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:11.503
evolutionary force.

00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:17.725
It can control population
dynamics.

00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:23.581
It can shape community
structure.

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:32.000
We're going to talk about each
of these.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.487
It actually influences
competition, which in turn

00:12:43.487 --> 00:12:49.948
shapes community structure.

00:12:49.948 --> 00:13:00.000
And it's a powerful
evolutionary agent.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.643
In other words,
it's very important in

00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:08.658
influencing naturally selection.

00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:14.807
So, let's start with the
classic, here's a classic

00:13:14.807 --> 00:13:18.070
predator-prey interaction.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:23.843
There is two wolves and a moose
being attacked.

00:13:23.843 --> 00:13:26.854
The wolves are not evil.

00:13:26.854 --> 00:13:32.000
They're just getting their
meal.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.986
OK, this is a very famous
classic study of the snowshoe

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:38.371
hare, and lynx.

00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:42.527
Lynx is a cat:
populations in northern Canada.

00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:47.513
And these data were collected
by the Hudson Bay Company

00:13:47.513 --> 00:13:49.083
trapping records.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:54.623
So, it's really from the amount
of animals that were actually

00:13:54.623 --> 00:13:58.225
trapped that these abundances
come from.

00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:02.195
And that's where these coupled
oscillations,

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:06.351
this is the hare,
and this is the lynx showing

00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:13.000
these couples oscillations with
a roughly 11 year cycle.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.321
And people spend a lot of time
trying to understand what was

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.423
driving that oscillation.

00:14:23.423 --> 00:14:30.000
And mathematicians love these
coupled oscillators.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.984
And so, the first attempt to
model this kind of thing was

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.763
using a very simple model.

00:14:38.763 --> 00:14:42.610
Remember we said the dN/dt
equals rN?

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.671
That's our exponential growth
equation.

00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:52.870
And we also said before the
dN/dt or that r is equal to the

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:58.000
birthrate (b) minus the death
rate (d).

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.532
OK, so grossly oversimplifying
the system, the first set of

00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:11.766
equations that were used to try
to describe this,

00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:18.649
are if you use for the
predator, you call the predator

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:22.805
dN1/DT equals b1,N1 minus d1,N1.

00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:28.000
OK, so that's just this
equation.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.802
And they said,
well, how do we modify this

00:15:31.802 --> 00:15:37.368
equation so that the growth rate
of the predator is somehow a

00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:40.614
function of the density of the
prey?

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:45.994
Well, the easiest thing to do
is just make it proportional,

00:15:45.994 --> 00:15:46.550
right?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.704
So what they do is put N2 in
there.

00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:53.878
So, the prey population is
going to be dN2/dt,

00:15:53.878 --> 00:16:00.000
and we're going to the same
thing: b2,N2 minus d2,N2,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.680
and the question is how do we
modify the prey growth rate

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:14.077
equation so that it is somehow a
function of the density of the

00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:15.150
predator?

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.656
So what would you do?

00:16:17.656 --> 00:16:23.621
So here, this says the
birthrate of the predator is

00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:24.933
influenced.

00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:31.494
As prey density increases,
the birthrate of the predator

00:16:31.494 --> 00:16:34.000
increases.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.196
How would you modify this
equation so that the predator

00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:41.891
density has an effect on it?

00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:46.702
It's pretty obvious,
but I'm trying to get you with

00:16:46.702 --> 00:16:46.991
me.

00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:47.761
Exactly.

00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:50.359
It would be the death term.

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:55.460
As the predator numbers
increase, the death term would

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.000
go up.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:06.705
And it turns out that these are
two coupled differential

00:17:06.705 --> 00:17:15.529
equations that make a beautiful
oscillatory system,

00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:24.529
a couple oscillators,
perfect oscillators like that.

00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:30.000
This is predator density.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.524
So that would be N1,
N2, and this is time if you

00:17:34.524 --> 00:17:37.413
chart their density with time.

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:42.804
And how many of you have
actually had this in the course?

00:17:42.804 --> 00:17:44.729
Yeah, see?
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:48.099
And what courses have you had
in it?

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:50.795
Differential equations,
yeah.

00:17:50.795 --> 00:17:53.009
Mathematicians love it.

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:56.763
But real populations,
predator and prey,

00:17:56.763 --> 00:18:01.000
don't really operate this way.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.964
I mean, you see these
oscillations,

00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:08.847
but rarely can it be attributed
solely to the interaction

00:18:08.847 --> 00:18:11.724
between the predator and the
prey.

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:14.689
There's usually many other
factors.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:18.002
So, and I'll just give you one
example.

00:18:18.002 --> 00:18:23.321
So ecologists go ahead and say,
OK, so what's really going on?

00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:25.239
And here's an example.

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:29.948
It turns out that in many
cases, the food supply of the

00:18:29.948 --> 00:18:33.000
prey is oscillating.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.141
OK, so the availability of food
to the prey oscillates,

00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:41.513
making the prey population
oscillate, which then can drive

00:18:41.513 --> 00:18:44.657
an oscillation in the predator
population.

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:48.646
So, it's more than just the
coupling between the two.

00:18:48.646 --> 00:18:52.710
There are also an external
oscillators driving both of

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.094
them.

00:18:53.094 --> 00:18:56.775
And again, I'd like to try to
address the role of

00:18:56.775 --> 00:18:59.000
experimentation.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.420
Here is an experiment done with
rabbits.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.726
And I don't know what the
predator was.

00:19:07.726 --> 00:19:13.279
It might have been,
I'm not sure the predator was,

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:17.359
but anyway, rabbits,
in which through

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:24.160
experimentation they increased
the food supply to the rabbits

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.653
through fertilization.

00:19:26.653 --> 00:19:33.000
And they showed that,
so this is the control.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.147
And this is the phase of the
cycle in the hare population

00:19:38.147 --> 00:19:41.732
relative to the density in the
controls.

00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:46.420
So, showing that when the food
supply was increased,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.270
the oscillation was still
there.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.693
So, it wasn't only relieving
the rabbits of food limitation,

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:58.922
did not eliminate the
oscillation, but if you'd

00:19:58.922 --> 00:20:03.058
excluded the predators,
you still also had the

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.000
oscillation there.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.733
And if you did both of them,
it increased the amplitude of

00:20:11.733 --> 00:20:15.757
the oscillation,
relative to the control.

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:21.692
So the conclusion from this is
that both food supply and the

00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:25.112
predation affected the
oscillation.

00:20:25.112 --> 00:20:31.147
Another very classic experiment
is the experiment by Huffaker

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:36.479
back when people began to be
enamored of these coupled

00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:40.000
differential equations.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.491
People wanted to test the
hypothesis of those equations in

00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:48.199
the laboratory.

00:20:48.199 --> 00:20:54.120
And they tried to set up
predator-prey systems in the

00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:00.384
lab, and see if they can get
them to go in these coupled

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:03.686
oscillations for many cycles.

00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:10.291
And Huffaker set up a system of
a predatory mite and a prey

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:12.000
mite.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.905
Ecologists like to use insects
as experimental systems because

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:27.036
they're small and you can do it
in the lab.

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:32.000
And this one lived on oranges.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.402
So it was an herbivorous mite.

00:21:35.402 --> 00:21:40.053
And the predator obviously
lived on mites.

00:21:40.053 --> 00:21:46.405
And he set up a very simple
system in the lab of oranges,

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:52.985
and introduced the predator and
prey, and inevitably he got

00:21:52.985 --> 00:21:59.677
this, where prey would increase,
and then the predator would

00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:05.689
increase, and would overshoot,
and the prey would die,

00:22:05.689 --> 00:22:10.000
and the predator would die.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
So he only got one cycle,
with a simple system could not

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.490
get this to persist,
well, that doesn't even qualify

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.890
as a cycle.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:31.000
So he realized,
so this is a simple system.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.236
And he had a grid,
which is shown up here in which

00:22:35.236 --> 00:22:36.533
he had oranges.

00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:41.288
And he had them interspersed
with rubber balls to have a

00:22:41.288 --> 00:22:44.573
little bit of complexity in the
system.

00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:49.760
But he found with that design,
he could not get the system to

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.452
persist.

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:55.293
So he hypothesized that the
reason it wouldn't persist is

00:22:55.293 --> 00:23:01.000
that it's much too simple,
not close enough to nature.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.359
So he introduced all kinds of
complexity.

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:08.390
He increased the size of his
grid relative to the

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.429
populations, which would give
the prey mites more of a chance

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:15.949
to get away from the predator.

00:23:15.949 --> 00:23:20.064
He put barriers of dispersal,
like Vaseline moats,

00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:24.599
and he actually put little
launching pads for the prey.

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:28.546
I don't know what they look
like, diving boards,

00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:33.417
I don't know what they were,
but little launching pads that

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:37.869
just increased a lot of
complexity so that it gave the

00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:44.000
prey an ability to move around
relative to the predator.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.152
And he was actually able to,
this shows his results over 200

00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:49.589
days.

00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:54.043
He was actually able to get
three full cycles of the

00:23:54.043 --> 00:23:56.314
predator-prey oscillation.

00:23:56.314 --> 00:23:59.982
And up here,
it just shows you that they're

00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:04.000
sort of a cat and mouse game
going on.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.174
It shows you the location of
the prey mites relative to the

00:24:08.174 --> 00:24:12.133
predator mites at these
different points in time of this

00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:15.876
cycle, showing that they're
moving around the system,

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:19.979
and that the complexity allowed
this coupled oscillator to

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:20.555
persist.

00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:23.722
And of course,
we present this because it was

00:24:23.722 --> 00:24:25.233
a classic experiment.

00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:29.552
It was a pioneering experiment,
but I mean, there have been a

00:24:29.552 --> 00:24:32.000
lot more since then.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.049
And of course,
it has implications for

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:38.758
stability of populations in the
natural world.

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:42.879
As we make the natural world
less and less complex,

00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:47.494
it reduces the ability of
populations that are engaged in

00:24:47.494 --> 00:24:51.120
these coupled oscillatory
systems to persist.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.500
It increases the likelihood of
extinction.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.197
So this was like a tiny little
localized extinction in his

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:02.000
experimental system.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:14.093
Another classic example that's
often cited about the role of

00:25:14.093 --> 00:25:24.751
predation in regulating
population dynamics has to do

00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:35.000
with rubber plantations over
here in Malaysia.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.075
Did I spell that right?

00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:38.609
That looks wrong.

00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:40.414
Oh well, is that OK?

00:25:40.414 --> 00:25:43.392
And I don't have any data for
you.

00:25:43.392 --> 00:25:47.814
So this is just a story,
but it's very compelling,

00:25:47.814 --> 00:25:52.507
and there is data somewhere but
I don't have a slide.

00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:57.109
But, in the first half of the
century, in its rubber

00:25:57.109 --> 00:26:02.253
plantations in Malaysia they had
a tremendous diversity of

00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:07.126
insects, but didn't have any
real serious problems with

00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:12.000
insect pests in the rubber
plantations.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.267
And, in 1950,
they had a small outbreak of

00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:18.765
defoliated caterpillars.

00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:24.802
And that was right about the
time that DDT was invented and

00:26:24.802 --> 00:26:28.237
synthesized, and became
available.

00:26:28.237 --> 00:26:34.691
And so, entomologists came down
and sprayed the plantation with

00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:40.000
DDT hoping to get rid of this
caterpillar.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.027
In the next year,
the outbreak got bigger.

00:26:43.027 --> 00:26:44.356
They sprayed more.

00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:47.089
The next year the outbreak got
bigger.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:50.707
They sprayed more,
and finally the whole thing was

00:26:50.707 --> 00:26:51.815
out of control.

00:26:51.815 --> 00:26:54.326
And they said what's going on
here?

00:26:54.326 --> 00:26:58.166
We are killing these things,
and it's getting bigger.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:01.710
To make a long story short,
what they were doing,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.000
this is a cocoon.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.039
Oh boy.

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:08.603
How do you spell cocoon?

00:27:08.603 --> 00:27:11.128
That's not right.

00:27:11.128 --> 00:27:13.207
Is that right?

00:27:13.207 --> 00:27:17.514
Anyway, you know what I mean.

00:27:17.514 --> 00:27:24.198
Caterpillars live in cocoons,
and there was a,

00:27:24.198 --> 00:27:31.920
that's a wasp with a big,
long organ that it lays its

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.000
eggs.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.063
It needs some legs,
doesn't it?

00:27:36.063 --> 00:27:38.195
OK, I made some front legs too.

00:27:38.195 --> 00:27:38.608
There.

00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:42.666
OK, so that's a wasp that lays
its eggs in these caterpillar

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:45.693
cocoons, and in doing so,
kills caterpillars.

00:27:45.693 --> 00:27:49.476
And what they were doing with
the DDT, is that they were

00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:52.227
killing the natural predator of
the wasp.

00:27:52.227 --> 00:27:55.666
And the caterpillars
themselves, while they were in

00:27:55.666 --> 00:28:00.000
the cocoon, were actually
protected from the DDT.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.909
So the more they put on,
the more they killed the wasp,

00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:09.909
and the caterpillars were
released from this controlling

00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:13.363
predation, and they had huge
outbreaks.

00:28:13.363 --> 00:28:18.272
So, it's another example of in
nature it's really hard,

00:28:18.272 --> 00:28:22.454
you can't see what's
controlling what until you

00:28:22.454 --> 00:28:23.454
disrupt it.

00:28:23.454 --> 00:28:28.545
You have to experiment either
inadvertently or on purpose

00:28:28.545 --> 00:28:34.000
because everything is dynamic
and turning over.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.384
But it looks relatively stable.

00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:40.768
And that's why this is so hard.

00:28:40.768 --> 00:28:45.899
And this is one of my favorite
examples of this,

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:52.340
because it brings together a
lot of concepts that we've been

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.034
talking about,
is predation shapes community

00:28:57.034 --> 00:29:08.000
structure.
00:28:59&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.259
And this is another example of
introduced species.

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:20.094
And this is St.

00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:26.708
John's Wort,
which was introduced at

00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:32.000
California from Europe.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:44.406
And, it, so I'm going to draw a
couple of habitats here.

00:29:44.406 --> 00:29:52.977
This is a forest,
and this is a meadow.

00:29:52.977 --> 00:30:02.000
So this is grass,
OK, this is trees.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.428
And these are St.

00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:06.142
John's Wort.

00:30:06.142 --> 00:30:15.000
So, it could grow equally well
in the meadow and in the forest.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.571
And it was getting out of
control so they introduced a

00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:27.571
beetle from Europe that feeds on
St.

00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:36.000
John's Wort to try to bring it
in to under control.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:46.227
And what they found was that
the beetle, because the beetle's

00:30:46.227 --> 00:30:53.045
preferred habitat was the meadow
that St.

00:30:53.045 --> 00:31:03.102
John's Wort persisted in the
forests but was eliminated from

00:31:03.102 --> 00:31:06.000
the meadow.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.519
Now, because the beetle prefers
the sunny habitat of the meadow,

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:17.039
so if you were an ecologist and
you didn't know that this beetle

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:20.981
had been introduced,
you just walked into this

00:31:20.981 --> 00:31:26.326
state, you knew nothing about
the history, you wanted to study

00:31:26.326 --> 00:31:28.691
the ecological niche of St.

00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:30.969
John's Wort,
you would say,

00:31:30.969 --> 00:31:35.000
well, I only find it in the
forest.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.254
It must like cooler,
wetter environments because you

00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:46.848
wouldn't really know that it was
being controlled by the presence

00:31:46.848 --> 00:31:48.393
of this beetle.

00:31:48.393 --> 00:31:52.000
So, this is a perfect example.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:03.623
If we draw the niche or two
dimensions of the ecological

00:32:03.623 --> 00:32:06.159
niche of St.

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:14.824
John's Wort,
and we say that just on these

00:32:14.824 --> 00:32:26.448
two dimensions that this is the
fundamental niche on the

00:32:26.448 --> 00:32:36.272
moisture light gradient,
in the presence of this beetle,

00:32:36.272 --> 00:32:42.079
the realized niche is only this
low light, high moisture

00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:46.196
environment that you find in the
forest.

00:32:46.196 --> 00:32:51.369
OK, so in other words,
to really understand what's

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:56.331
regulating the ecology of a
particular organism,

00:32:56.331 --> 00:33:02.454
you have to understand all of
the other organisms that it's

00:33:02.454 --> 00:33:07.099
interacting with,
and what their effect is on

00:33:07.099 --> 00:33:09.000
this.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.549
And again, that's why it's so
impossible to do this without

00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:17.862
some form of experiment,
either manipulative experiments

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:21.470
like I described,
or experiments done in a lab,

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.313
or inadvertent experiments by
introducing species.

00:33:25.313 --> 00:33:29.705
OK, now let's talk about a
couple of other really classic

00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:33.000
experiments that have been done.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.325
And these are experiments that
have illustrated the concept of

00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:39.896
keystone predator.

00:33:39.896 --> 00:33:44.785
There are some predators and
ecosystems that are what are

00:33:44.785 --> 00:33:46.269
called keystones.

00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:51.333
And that is if you remove them,
the entire structure of the

00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:52.904
community changes.

00:33:52.904 --> 00:33:58.404
There are some that if you move
them, it doesn't have a dramatic

00:33:58.404 --> 00:34:03.730
effect, but there are certain
ones that are keystone predators

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.000
that it does.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.419
And these, of course,
are species that conservation

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:17.164
biologists want to first
identify, and second conserve

00:34:17.164 --> 00:34:23.884
above others because there is a
cascade of effects if something

00:34:23.884 --> 00:34:25.618
happens to them.

00:34:25.618 --> 00:34:32.447
A classic example of this was a
study by Robert Payne many years

00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:37.000
ago in the inner tidal
community.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.559
I'm not going to go into the
details of that,

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:51.310
but the rocky inner tidal
community is made up of the

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:58.614
starfish, which is called
pisaster, one of the top

00:34:58.614 --> 00:35:01.000
predators.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.186
And there are also limpets,
chitins, if you grew up in

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:14.016
California you know probably
what these are,

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:15.101
mussels.

00:35:15.101 --> 00:35:22.559
These are invertebrates-like
barnacles that stick to the

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:30.423
ground, or stick to the rocks,
and also algae that stick to

00:35:30.423 --> 00:35:33.000
the rocks.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.046
And Payne hypothesized that the
predator was maintaining this

00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:38.887
diversity.

00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:43.261
And the way to test that
hypothesis was to put a cage

00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:48.392
over everything and eliminate
the predator from certain areas.

00:35:48.392 --> 00:35:53.271
At what he showed was that
that's what that ecosystem looks

00:35:53.271 --> 00:35:56.130
like if you eliminate the
predator.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.000
You can see here,
here's the algae.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.977
Here are some articles.

00:36:01.977 --> 00:36:06.446
This is a new textbook,
see if you get the full story

00:36:06.446 --> 00:36:10.659
there, but there's a lot of
diversity of the small

00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:13.065
barnacle-like invertebrates.

00:36:13.065 --> 00:36:17.535
Then you eliminate the
predator, and the mussels just

00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:19.340
completely take over.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.263
And this is preemptive
competition.

00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:27.335
They compete with everything
else for space and nothing else

00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:30.000
can survive there.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.689
Another example of a keystone
predator is the sea otter,

00:36:35.689 --> 00:36:41.482
which keeps the sea urchins in
check in the bottom of the

00:36:41.482 --> 00:36:47.586
substrate, and if the sea otter
is not there the sea urchins

00:36:47.586 --> 00:36:53.586
takeover and they exclude the
kelp, the entire kelp forests

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:58.655
and all the fishes that lives in
the kelp forests,

00:36:58.655 --> 00:37:04.655
and all of the diversity of the
ecosystem relies on the sea

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:12.000
otter's ability to keep the sea
urchin population in check.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.813
OK, so some of the best
evidence for predation as an

00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:23.512
evolutionary agent,
or something that's driving the

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:30.238
natural selection of organisms,
are these defenses that have

00:37:30.238 --> 00:37:34.000
evolved to avoid predation.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.663
In other words,
if you're constantly under

00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:42.487
attack, your fitness will be
increased by features that

00:37:42.487 --> 00:37:45.972
reduce your susceptibility to
predation.

00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:50.171
So in this case,
there are a lot of experiments.

00:37:50.171 --> 00:37:54.728
I'm going to show you a few,
but a picture's worth a

00:37:54.728 --> 00:37:56.515
thousand words here.

00:37:56.515 --> 00:38:00.000
I'll show you some examples.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.823
Cryptic coloration is when a
prey organism has color features

00:38:05.823 --> 00:38:09.705
that make it blend in to the
environment.

00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:15.432
So here's a very famous example
that was actually in another

00:38:15.432 --> 00:38:17.664
inadvertent experiment.

00:38:17.664 --> 00:38:21.352
This is a moth that comes in
two forms.

00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:26.594
This is called the melanic
form, which is dark black or

00:38:26.594 --> 00:38:33.000
gray, and this is the other form
which is much lighter.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.510
And here it is on a birch tree.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:39.316
You can see that this one
blends it beautifully,

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:42.960
whereas this one,
if I were a predator looking

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.523
for the moth,
I would see this but I wouldn't

00:38:46.523 --> 00:38:47.252
see that.

00:38:47.252 --> 00:38:51.868
Here's the same two moths on
another tree with darker bark

00:38:51.868 --> 00:38:56.322
showing that in this case,
this one would be more fit in

00:38:56.322 --> 00:38:58.508
that one would be less fit.

00:38:58.508 --> 00:39:03.286
And there's a very famous study
that I don't have time to go

00:39:03.286 --> 00:39:07.821
into, but it's a textbook,
that showed experimentally the

00:39:07.821 --> 00:39:12.436
relative fitness between these
two forms, depending on the

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:16.000
color of the tree trunks.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.142
And this whole example is
called industrial melanism

00:39:20.142 --> 00:39:24.609
because the reason this was
noticed was that in areas of

00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:29.157
high industrialization the tree
trunks are darker colored

00:39:29.157 --> 00:39:32.000
because of the air pollution.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.665
This is back in England back in
the days when there is a lot

00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:38.168
more air pollution.

00:39:38.168 --> 00:39:42.834
So, they were able to show a
shift in the frequency of these

00:39:42.834 --> 00:39:47.025
two forms as a function of the
amount of pollution and

00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:51.454
environment because their
susceptibility to predation was

00:39:51.454 --> 00:39:53.905
reduced if this form dominated.

00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:57.622
That study is actually rather
controversial now,

00:39:57.622 --> 00:40:00.153
so I won't teach you the
details.

00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:03.000
But you get the point.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.854
But these moths exist in these
two forms.

00:40:06.854 --> 00:40:12.731
Here's another example that's
really convoluted that's in your

00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:13.598
textbook.

00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:17.549
So I'm not going to write it on
the board.

00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:20.247
You can read about it there.

00:40:20.247 --> 00:40:25.739
But it's an example of what's
called the evolutionary arms

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:26.221
race.

00:40:26.221 --> 00:40:29.882
And it has to do with
Cottonwood trees.

00:40:29.882 --> 00:40:35.664
And Cottonwood trees produce a
defense compound that the name

00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:42.356
of which is on the next slide:
Soliccorten [SP?].

00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:49.685
It doesn't matter what it's
called, it's a toxic compound

00:40:49.685 --> 00:40:55.314
that makes the tree distasteful
to predator.

00:40:55.314 --> 00:41:00.157
You don't think of predators of
trees.

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:05.000
The beaver is a tree predator.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.619
It chops it down.

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:11.285
So when a beaver chops it down,
a Cottonwood tree,

00:41:11.285 --> 00:41:15.000
the Cottonwood tree sprouts new
sprouts.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.333
And the resprouts have much
higher concentrations of this

00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:24.047
toxic compound than the parent
tree had.

00:41:24.047 --> 00:41:27.857
In other words,
the tree has a mechanism.

00:41:27.857 --> 00:41:31.761
And I'm sure we don't
understand that yet,

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:37.095
but someday we'll understand
the genetic underpinnings of

00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:43.000
this, the molecular biology of
beaver defenses.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.796
But if it's been felled by a
beaver, it increases the

00:41:46.796 --> 00:41:51.104
production of this toxin in the
shoots that come out saying,

00:41:51.104 --> 00:41:54.463
OK, fool me once,
but you're not getting to get

00:41:54.463 --> 00:41:55.704
me the next time.

00:41:55.704 --> 00:41:57.968
It means there's beavers
around.

00:41:57.968 --> 00:42:02.276
But the interesting thing is
that these shoots are much more

00:42:02.276 --> 00:42:06.000
susceptible to grazing by a leaf
beetle.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.876
In other words,
this increased toxin,

00:42:08.876 --> 00:42:12.073
the shoots that have the
increased toxin,

00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:16.627
are actually grazed more than
the parent tree by this leaf

00:42:16.627 --> 00:42:17.187
beetle.

00:42:17.187 --> 00:42:22.141
So scientists went in and said,
you know, what's going on here?

00:42:22.141 --> 00:42:23.260
This is weird.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.495
Why make a defense that makes
you more vulnerable to a

00:42:27.495 --> 00:42:29.013
different predator?

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:33.248
And what they showed by
experiment was that these leaf

00:42:33.248 --> 00:42:38.283
beetles were using that toxin as
a defense against the ants that

00:42:38.283 --> 00:42:41.000
want to eat them.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.550
So, they were less susceptible
to predation by ants because

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:50.665
they had taken in the toxin from
the shoots.

00:42:50.665 --> 00:42:55.354
So, it's called the
evolutionary arms race between

00:42:55.354 --> 00:42:57.076
predator and prey.

00:42:57.076 --> 00:43:01.000
In these systems get very
complex.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.568
So here's the data that shows
that, that the control trees,

00:43:06.568 --> 00:43:12.231
trees that haven't been felled
by a beaver compared to trees

00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:17.416
that have been felled by a
beaver, and resprouted trees

00:43:17.416 --> 00:43:21.831
have a much higher concentration
of this toxin.

00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:27.784
And this is the larval survival
time of these leaf beetles that

00:43:27.784 --> 00:43:33.831
these are from the control trees
versus the browsed trees in the

00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:37.000
presence of the ants.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.546
OK, I'm going to skip that one.

00:43:40.546 --> 00:43:46.381
That ones in your book,
too, which has an experiment

00:43:46.381 --> 00:43:52.788
showing that anti-predation
mechanisms are induced by the

00:43:52.788 --> 00:43:55.419
presence of a predator.

00:43:55.419 --> 00:44:01.597
So I would encourage you to
look at this in a textbook,

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:04.000
this example.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.318
And then finally I'm just going
to go through a series of

00:44:09.318 --> 00:44:15.111
pictures that show all of the
types of defenses that have been

00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:18.245
evolved as anti-predation
devices.

00:44:18.245 --> 00:44:22.804
They are the obvious ones like
cacti with spikes,

00:44:22.804 --> 00:44:27.553
or porcupines with spikes,
octopi with ink defense.

00:44:27.553 --> 00:44:33.156
This is a caterpillar that has
evolved to look like a snake,

00:44:33.156 --> 00:44:38.000
at least that's the way it
looks to us.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.603
I mean that's a hypothesis,
that the predation on this

00:44:41.603 --> 00:44:45.410
would be reduced because it
looks like a predator itself.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.742
These are two different ones
looking like a snake.

00:44:48.742 --> 00:44:52.889
And often, snakes have a bright
colored thing on their tail to

00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:54.725
draw attention to the tail.

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.716
If you're going to be attacked
by a predator,

00:44:57.716 --> 00:45:02.000
you'd rather have your tail
attacked than your head.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.546
So, this is a common motif in
nature.

00:45:05.546 --> 00:45:07.713
And this is an insect.

00:45:07.713 --> 00:45:09.388
This is its head.

00:45:09.388 --> 00:45:15.101
And yet, if you're a predator
you'd probably think this was

00:45:15.101 --> 00:45:15.988
its head.

00:45:15.988 --> 00:45:21.602
And again, whether that's been
established by experiments,

00:45:21.602 --> 00:45:22.883
I don't know.

00:45:22.883 --> 00:45:25.543
So these are just examples.

00:45:25.543 --> 00:45:31.453
Moths often have features that
look like eyes that what tends

00:45:31.453 --> 00:45:35.000
to ward off a predator.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.663
This is an interesting story
that is in your readings that

00:45:39.663 --> 00:45:44.818
shows that there are just a few
genes that control the phenotype

00:45:44.818 --> 00:45:47.190
of this particular butterfly.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.281
I think it's a moth,
between having these spots and

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:53.000
not having the spots.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.190
In the fall,
when it's dry and it's more

00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:02.000
selective advantage to look like
a leaf, they look like this.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.087
But at other times,
they're visible anyway so their

00:46:06.087 --> 00:46:10.992
selective advantage is to have
these eye spots that make them

00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:13.036
look like they have eyes.

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:17.614
OK, I think it's time to quit,
so we'll pick this up next

00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:19.249
time, I promise you.

00:46:19.249 --> 00:46:24.236
Their wonderful pictures of the
creatures in the deep sea that

00:46:24.236 --> 00:46:29.387
are very evil looking predators
that fish with their luminescent

00:46:29.387 --> 00:46:30.387
light organs.
