00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.580
In this lesson, we've learned about four really

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.630
interesting traits, and the concepts we've discussed can

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.745
actually be summarized into four main points. Point

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.000
one, variations in single genes are responsible for

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.650
many different kinds of traits. Point two, mutations

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.770
can be either loss of function or gain

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.490
of function alleles. That are either dominant or

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.990
recessive, depending on the molecular phenotype. Point three,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.050
an individual mutation can be dominant or recessive depending

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.218
on the trade perspective from which we're viewing it.

00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:37.000
And, point four, knowing your carrier status for a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.560
genetic trait or disease, can be a very personal decision.
