00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.710
What if the most deadly animal on the planet
could be wiped out?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.170
Hey!

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.680
This is Carin for DNews with an amazing scientific
breakthrough that has the potential to save

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.420
millions of lives.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.119
Malaria kills almost 630K people per year,
mainly in sub-saharan Africa, making anopheles

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.279
mosquitoes the deadliest animal on the planet.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.220
It's actually only the females that spread
the disease to humans because they require

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.300
a blood meal to nourish their developing eggs.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
Male mosquitoes get by on nectar or other
sugary substances and are therefore not a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.730
threat to humans.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.360
Scientists have hypothesized for decades that
creation of an extreme male-biased sex ratio

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
in natural mosquito populations could lead
to their demise.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.810
However, such a feat hasn't been physiologically
possible - until now.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.829
Researchers have just announced that a specific
endonuclease (or enzyme) has been created

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.560
to destroy the x chromosome of male mosquitoes.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.610
This means that males will only ever pass
on a Y chromosome to their progeny, making

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.130
them all male.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.049
Female mosquitoes (as with female humans)
only ever pass on an X chromosome to their

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.289
offspring, so it's actually the type of sperm
that determines the sex of the resulting babies.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:27.479
The endonuclease (I-Ppol) recognizes a specific
set of repeating sequences on the X chromosome

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.149
of the males, and shreds the DNA during the
process of spermatogenesis.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.159
This means that the only viable sperm produced
by the infected mosquitoes contain a Y chromosome.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.889
Previous trials with this same enzyme were
unsuccessful because it remained active in

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.950
the fertilized zygote long enough to also
shred the X chromosome contributed by the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.209
mother, killing all the embryos.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.759
By destabilizing the endonuclease so that
it becomes inactive after sperm generation,

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.579
scientists have allowed for the production
of healthy, fertile, ALL male populations

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.579
to thrive.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.810
This is a massive feat in both structure-based
protein engineering and molecular genetics.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.350
Experimental mosquito populations infected
with the endonuclease are up to 95% male.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.960
In research trials, these genetically modified
mosquitoes were introduced into five separate

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.640
cages filled with normal anopheles populations.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.000
In four of the five cages, the entire population
was wiped out due to a lack of females.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.670
The effects of the endonuclease on spermatogenesis
remain active in the male mosquitoes for at

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.840
least 4 generations after introduction, which
means that affected males continue to produce

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.080
mostly male offspring.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.900
This makes the technique 'self sustaining',
inexpensive, and extremely effective.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.160
So far, research has only taken place in the
lab.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.760
Future steps will be to introduce genetically
modified males into natural populations in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.360
order to look at larger scale effects.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.440
Malaria is one of the largest threats to humans
worldwide.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.290
The WHO estimates that over 3.4 billion people
are at risk for the disease each year (that's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.320
HALF of the worlds' population!!), and over
600K will die.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.670
So this is a huge development in the fields
of science and medicine.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.670
What do you think?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.060
Are humans playing with fire by introducing
genetically modified organisms into the natural

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
world or would the health benefits be worth
it?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.230
