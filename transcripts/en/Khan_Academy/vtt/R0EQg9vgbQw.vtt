00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:02.831
Voiceover: What I hope to do 
in this video is prove the

00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:05.554
angle addition formula for sine, or in

00:00:05.554 --> 00:00:10.522
particular prove that the sine of x plus y

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.332
is equal to the sine of x times

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:23.957
the cosine of -- I forgot my x.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.285
Sine of x times the cosine of y

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:35.644
plus cosine of x times the sine of y.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.315
The way I'm going to do it is

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.303
with this diagram right over here.

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:46.613
You can view it as, it has
this red right triangle.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:50.301
It has this right triangle
that has a hypotenuse of one.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.017
You could say this triangle ADC.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.882
It has it stacked on
top of, its base is the

00:00:57.131 --> 00:01:01.085
hypotenuse of triangle
ACD, which I could, I'm

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.866
going to outline it in
blue since I already

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.584
labelled the measure of
this angle as being y.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:16.649
AC which is the base
of triangle ADC is the

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.507
hypotenuse of triangle
ABC. They're stacked on

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:24.740
top of each other like
that, just like that.

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:27.275
The way I'm going to think
about it is first if you just

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:31.130
look at this what is sine
of x plus y going to be?

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.914
Well x plus y is this entire
angle right over here.

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:40.209
If you look at this right
triangle, right triangle ADF,

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.805
we know that the sine of an angle is

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.116
the opposite side over the hypotenuse.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.349
Well the hypotenuse here
is one so the sine of this

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.775
is the opposite over one,
or the sine of this angle,

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.209
the sine of x plus y is equal to

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.099
the length of this opposite side.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.538
So sine of x plus y is going to be

00:01:57.538 --> 00:02:00.662
equal to the length of segment DF.

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.623
What I'm going to try to do
is, okay, length of segment DF

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.685
is essentially what we're
looking for but we can

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:12.813
decompose the length of
segment DF into two segments.

00:02:12.813 --> 00:02:15.763
We can decompose it into length of

00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:21.295
segment DE and the length of segment EF.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.450
We can say that DF, which
is the same thing as

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.169
sine of x plus y, the length of segment DF

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.171
is the same thing, is
equal to the length of

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:36.565
segment DE plus the length of segment EF.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:44.626
EF is of course the same thing
as the length of segment CB.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:47.516
ECBF, this right over here is a

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.018
rectangle so EF is the same thing as CB.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:57.251
So this thing is going to be
equal to DE right over here,

00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:03.958
length of segment DE plus
the length of segment CB.

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:09.422
Once again the way I'm
going to address this,

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:13.094
the sine of x plus y which
is the length of DF and DF

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:17.203
can be decomposed as the
lengths of DE and CB.

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:21.531
Now with that as a hint I
encourage you to figure out what

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:27.140
the length of segment DE is
in terms of x's and y's and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.359
sines and cosines, and also
figure out what the length of

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.735
segment CB is in terms of x's
and y's and sines and cosines.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.271
Try to figure out as much as you can about

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.474
this and these two might fall out of that.

00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:43.909
I'm assuming you've given
a go at it so now that we

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.862
know that sine of x plus y
can be expressed this way,

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:48.988
let's see if we can
figure these things out.

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:50.801
I'm going to try to
address it by figuring out

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.097
as many lengths and angles here as I can.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:58.988
Let's go to this top red
triangle right over here.

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:02.176
Its hypotenuse has length one so what's

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.004
going to be the length of segment DC?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.396
That is the opposite
side of our angle x so

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:12.400
we know sine of x is equal to DC over one,

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.427
or DC over one is just DC.

00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.910
This length right over here is sine of x.

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:21.477
Segment AC, same exact logic.

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:24.801
Cosine of x is the length of AC over

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:26.144
one which is just the length of AC.

00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.441
This length right over here,

00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:33.784
segment AC its length is cosine of x.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.300
That's kind of interesting. Now
let's see what we can figure

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.817
out about this triangle,
triangle ACB right over here.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.043
How could we figure out CB?

00:04:45.732 --> 00:04:49.845
Well we know that sine of
y, let me write this here.

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:52.216
Sine of y is equal to what?

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:58.294
It's equal to the length of
segment CB over the hypotenuse.

00:04:58.294 --> 00:05:01.075
The hypotenuse here is the cosine of x,

00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:03.436
and I think you might see
where all of this is leading.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.169
At any point if you get excited pause the

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.888
video and try to finish
the proof on your own.

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:10.546
The length of segment CB if we just

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:13.689
multiply both sides by cosine of x,

00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:17.778
the length of segment CB is equal

00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:23.857
to cosine of x times sine of y.

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:32.387
Which is neat because we
just showed that this thing

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:36.154
right over here is equal to
this thing right over here.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.903
To complete our proof we
just need to prove that this

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:46.108
thing is equal to this
thing right over there.

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:47.717
If that's equal to that
and that's equal to that

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.451
well we already know that
the sum of these is equal

00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.169
to the length of DF which
is sine of x plus y.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:57.950
Let's see if we can figure out,
if we can express DE somehow.

00:05:59.122 --> 00:06:02.391
What angle would be useful?
If somehow we could figure

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.643
out this angle up here or maybe
this angle, well let's see.

00:06:06.643 --> 00:06:12.873
If we could figure out
this angle then DE we could

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.297
express in terms of this
angle and sine of x.

00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:16.638
Let's see if we can figure out that angle.

00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:21.497
We know this is angle y over here and

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:24.825
we also know that this is a right angle.

00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:30.700
EC is parallel to AB so you
could view AC as a transversal.

00:06:31.538 --> 00:06:35.166
If this is angle y right over here

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:38.493
then we know this is also angle y.

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.571
These are once again, notice.
If AC is a transversal here

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.010
and EC and AB are parallel then
if this is y then that is y.

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:51.369
If that's y then this is 90 minus y.

00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:58.838
If this is 90 degrees and
this is 90 minus y then

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:03.372
these two angles combined
add up to 180 minus y,

00:07:03.997 --> 00:07:05.761
and if all three of these add up to 180

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:08.734
then this thing up here
must be equal to y.

00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:13.122
Validate that. y plus 90 minus
y plus 90 is 180 degrees,

00:07:13.447 --> 00:07:16.510
and that is useful for
us because now we can

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.682
express segment DE in
terms of y and sine of x.

00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:24.557
What is DE to y? It's the adjacent

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:26.450
angle, so we can think of cosine.

00:07:27.088 --> 00:07:30.963
We know that the cosine
of angle y, if we look at

00:07:30.963 --> 00:07:35.733
triangle DEC right over here,
we know that the cosine of y

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:45.058
is equal to segment DE over
its hypotenuse, over sine of x.

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.432
You should be getting excited
right about now because we've

00:07:48.823 --> 00:07:53.089
just shown, if we multiply
both sides by sine of x,

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.072
we've just shown that DE is equal

00:07:56.072 --> 00:08:01.665
to sine of x times cosine of y.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:08.885
We've now shown that
this is equal to this.

00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:12.010
We already showed that CB
is equal to that, so the sum

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.809
of DE and CB which is the
same thing as the sum of DE

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:20.730
and EF is the sine of x plus
y which is that over there.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.699
We are done, we have proven the

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:25.059
angle addition formula for sine.
