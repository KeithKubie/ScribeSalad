MELISSA: Please welcome
Ken Jennings.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.170
KEN JENNINGS: Thanks, Melissa.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.300
Well, thank you all
for coming out.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.965
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.680
I flew out from Seattle
just to see you guys.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.770
It's not a big tech town.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.180
So it's exciting to be someplace
with a few software

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.430
engineers for a change.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.510
Post-Jeopardy.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.560
I'm now an author pretty
much full time.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.189
I was a software engineer
before, but

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.150
not a very good one.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.020
Unlike, I'm sure, anybody who
gets hired at Google.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.890
So I'm much happier in my second
life as a freelance

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.070
writer, where I can work from
home in my pajamas.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.320
And the book that I have out
today, I guess sort of has

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.290
something to do with the
modern information age.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.140
It's called "Because I Said So!"
The idea is to debunk or

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.160
possibly prove all these cliches
that parents are

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.620
always harassing their kids
with, don't go swimming until

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.910
half an hour after you eat; or
don't pop your knuckles,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.570
you'll get arthritis; or don't
swallow watermelon seeds,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.260
it'll sprout in your stomach
and you'll die.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.960
We don't all hear all
of these as kids.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.870
But speaking only for myself, I
know my parents were always

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.160
threatening us with dire things
that would happen if we

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.820
did any of these behaviors that
really seemed sort of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
harmless to us.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120
And I realize now that I have
kids, that I was starting to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.990
do the same thing.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
I have a 10-year-old boy and a
6-year-old girl and I realize

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.200
that when you're a parent, I
guess I'm now aware of this,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.630
you lie all the time.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.870
You have to.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.060
You have to lie all the time.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.790
And the lies are
not malicious.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.230
They're in fact, quite
the opposite.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.140
You feel like it's a benevolent
lie to tell your

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.040
kids that Santa is going to
bring them presents if they're

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.880
good, or that their hamster
actually went to live on

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.910
grandpa's farm, or that
really you love them

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.160
both exactly the same.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.280
I feel like these are pretty
useful lies actually.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.700
There's some utility to this.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.900
But often I would find myself
lying out of more

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.080
self-serving reasons.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.150
Just because I felt like
I had to be confident.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.580
I couldn't show any
sign of weakness.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.550
Kids are like bears, I guess.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.750
If your kid asks you, really?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.480
You to say yes, that's right.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.530
Do what you're told.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.780
Finish your vegetables.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.260
And more and more often
I realized--

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.590
in fact, I know when
it occurred to me.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.000
This is how the book starts.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120
My son comes careening into--
we're in my parents' house.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.810
My son comes careening around
the corner in the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.950
kitchen with a--

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.080
kids, if there's some place in
the house where they can run

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.060
in a circle, they'll do it.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.870
I don't know why.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.130
He comes running in
with a Tootsie Pop

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.410
sticking out of his mouth.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.930
And I'm like whoa, whoa,
whoa, slow down.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.440
Like what if you fell?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.970
That lollipop could like go
through the back of your soft

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.980
palate in the back of
your mouth and like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.240
jab you in the brain.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.030
And he was an eight-year-old
boy, so of course he's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.490
fascinated.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.320
Like this doesn't scare him.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.740
This is like, really?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.360
Is that true?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.680
Could that really happen?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.090
And I realized when he
asked that, I had no

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.410
idea if that was true.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.070
Like I have done research
on oral trauma?

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.530
No.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.690
Like, I have no idea.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.840
I'm just repeating some thing
that my mom randomly told me

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.820
in the late '70s, probably on
the basis of no information as

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.840
well, and assuming it's
going to be correct.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.920
And luckily, we're at
my mom's house.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.500
So I asked her.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.616
I was like, is this true?

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:26.080
You always used to
tell us that.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.990
And she was like, oh,
I don't know.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.030
That's just something grandma
used to tell us.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.775
I think it happens in
a Chaim Potok novel.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.080
So this is how I'm disappointing
my kids.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.000
Based on my mind vaguely
remembered notions of my mom's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.580
hazily remembered memory
of a Chaim Potok novel?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.610
Like I understand he's a rabbi
as well as a novelist, but

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.270
maybe this is not how I
should be choosing the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.370
things I tell my kids.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.150
And I realized these things do
sort of, just sort of turn up

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.970
cyclically.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.720
Like I'm sure when my son has
kids, now he's going to tell

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.140
them don't run with a Tootsie
Pop in your mouth.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.520
It'll give your brain
damage if you fall.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.400
And again, he will
have no idea.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.620
And I thought, well
maybe there's a--

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.500
I'm sort of a full-time
trivia author now.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.710
Somehow I'm in this weird niche,
thanks to Alex Trebek.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.500
Like maybe there's
a book in this.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.940
So I started gathering these
myths, gathering from memory

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.800
my own childhood.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.190
What did my parents tell me?

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.580
Don't eat the cookie dough.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.690
You'll get worms.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.580
Don't run outside.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.190
You'll get worms.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.190
I guess worms were very
big in the late '70s.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.840
Like no matter what it
was, we'd get worms.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.420
And every time I saw a friend,
I'd ask them, hey, what were

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.330
these cliches that your
parents were always

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.300
threatening you with?

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.640
I want to see if these things
are actually true.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.580
And one person would remember
their mom said that you lose

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.440
10% of your body heat
through your head.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.430
Or somebody else would remember
their dad saying that

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.100
if you swallow gum, it'll sit in
your stomach undigested for

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.960
seven years.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.440
And he was fascinated by that.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.700
And so I started there.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.160
I started to collect a little
spreadsheet of these things.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.350
And I was getting close
to having enough for a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.190
book, and not quite.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.960
So I did what I'm sure any of
you would do and I had Reddit

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.490
crowd-source the rest
of this for me.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.100
Hey Reddit, what are some
of the weird things your

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.270
parents told you?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.020
P.S., write my book for me.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.430
And in with all the goofy bacon
jokes and screeds about

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.290
marijuana legalization, a lot
of people suggested great

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.370
parental cliches that I had
not thought of, that were

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.220
really, really good
fits for the book.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.100
And I started to research
these things.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.010
And it turned out that
surprisingly, maybe I'm

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.830
jumping the gun a little here,
but surprisingly there's

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.180
actually a lot of
good scientific

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.430
research on some of these.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.680
I guess enough kids were told
that there's a five-second

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.080
rule between when you drop food
and when you can pick it

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.070
up in the shopping mall food
court, enough kids are told

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.191
this, that many of them
have gone to college.

00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:56.150
And there are now four or five
good academic studies on

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.820
whether or not the five-second
rule exists.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.940
Spoilers, it doesn't.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.090
Food gets contaminated when
it lands on something.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.510
So if you drop it and there
is rat poison or bleach or

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.370
salmonella or something on the
floor, it's contaminated then.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.390
You don't get some magical
window where the microbes

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.380
wait, three, four, five, go.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.960
But by the same token, they
can only get these results

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.150
when they pretreat the floor
with salmonella.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.220
When they do that, the food
comes back contaminated.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.860
Every time they run these
experiments on regular dorm

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.780
cafeteria floors, it's
perfectly fine.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.960
And in many cases, a surprising
number of these

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.560
were coming back false, which
is what I wanted.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.500
The book is no good if all
these things are true.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300
And by the same token, there
were some selection bias.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.650
Obviously if something turns out
to be surprisingly false,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.660
in the book it goes.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.020
I found out that that thing your
parents told you about

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.160
having to drink eight glasses
of water a day, it's bogus.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.410
It's actually dangerous.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.430
It's possible to over hydrate
your brain and people have

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.280
died from this.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.160
Whereas, the body's thirst
mechanism actually kicks in

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.950
long before dehydration.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.710
So you're actually good just
drinking water when you're

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.890
thirsty and not trying to get to
some number that was forced

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.530
on you by a seventh grade
home ec teacher.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.510
But there was some
selection bias.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.960
Obviously, I would pick
the ones that were

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.400
interesting to debunk.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.067
If it turns out that it really
is good advice to not play in

00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:26.630
the street, that was
a less interesting

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.600
section in the book.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.400
Here's sort of one sample entry
that I'll read, which I

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.220
already mentioned, about
swallowed gum sitting in your

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.010
stomach undigested
for seven years.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.170
It's just a threat if you
swallow your gum.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.070
Did you guys hear this as
kids or is just me?

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.620
My parents were firm
believers in this.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.820
So from the book, could
this really be true?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.600
If I swallow a piece of gum
today, will it really emerge

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.320
Rip van Winkle-like into some
futuristic Japanese-style

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.380
toilet in the year 2020?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.040
Is there a possibility that
tonight I will poop the piece

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.930
of gum that I accidentally
swallowed during "Big Momma's

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.570
House 2?"

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.980
When pondering these questions
with my friend Raj, he

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.540
remembered that as a child, he
wondered what would happen if

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.620
he swallowed two
pieces of gum?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.110
Would they be trapped for
seven years or 14?

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.140
In other words, would they
serve their sentences

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.710
consecutively or concurrently?

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.300
I hate to pop your bubble, but
the answer is neither.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.310
Swallowed gum routinely gets
furloughed within 24 hours,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.190
like a diplomat or a Kennedy.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.970
It's true that about a quarter
of chewing gum is the gum base

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.120
itself, a completely food-free
substance made up of latexes,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.450
resins, waxes, and
emulsifiers.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.635
Your gastrointestinal tract
could work on that for seven

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:37.559
years and have no luck
digesting it.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.570
But that's not what happens.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.669
Quote "That would mean that
every single person who ever

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.409
swallowed gum within the last
seven years would have

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.960
evidence of the gum in their
digestive tract," Dr. David

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.020
Milov told "Scientific
American." "On occasion, we'll

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.200
see a piece of swallowed
gum in a colonoscopy.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.140
But usually, it's not something
that's any more than

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.080
a week old." Your intestine
eliminates gum the same way it

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.560
eliminates half-chewed corn
kernels and anything else

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.520
that's too tough to digest,
out the rectum

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.500
within a day or two.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.830
I guess I didn't realize people
were going to be eating

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.270
lunch during this.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.680
I apologize in advance,
especially for the thing

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.690
that's about to happen
in two paragraphs.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.590
If you're almost there, you
may want to finish up.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.960
However, Dr. Milov also led the
team that published the

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.600
landmark study, "Chewing
Gum Bezoars of the

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.520
Gastrointestinal Tract," in a
1998 issue of the medical

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.290
journal "Pediatrics." A
"bezoar": is a clump of

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.930
undigested stuff that
gets trapped in

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.050
the stomach or intestine.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.200
The wonderful name comes from
the Persian word for antidote,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.420
since animal bezoars, sort of
like those owl pellets you had

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.570
to dissect in eighth grade, were
anciently thought to have

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.010
remarkable health properties.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.060
Most bezoars are boluses
of food or pills.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.380
Sometimes in rare cases
of Rapunzel syndrome,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.330
they're made of--

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.040
anyone?

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.450
AUDIENCE: Hair.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.350
KEN JENNINGS: Swallowed
hair, ugh.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.690
And sometimes, very rarely,
they can be

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.670
made of chewing gum.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.200
Dr. Milov's team found three
cases of young children whose,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.690
this is a quote from the report,
"means of discarding

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.260
their gum (swallowing) was well
known to the families and

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.480
was a source of levity." Well,
nobody was laughing when the

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.190
gum swallowing led to chronic
constipation and, finally,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.930
surgery when laxatives
proved powerless.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.900
If you want your kids to quit
swallowing their gum, here's

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.150
the money quote.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.645
"This clean-out regimen produced
no results after four

00:10:14.645 --> 00:10:16.680
days." In other words,
the laxatives.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.120
"On the fifth day, the child
was brought in for manual

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.330
disimpaction under conscious
sedation and rectal suction

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:28.560
biopsy." On removal of the--
here's the money quote, "On

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.930
removal of the leading edge of
the fecoma, a taffy-like trail

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.910
of fecal material remained
in the rectum.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.040
The mass was eventually manually
withdrawn and was

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.940
primarily made up
of chewing gum."

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.760
Wow, I hope these parents kept
the rectal suction biopsy

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.230
video on hand to show
future prom dates.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.790
But keep in mind, this was a kid
who was swallowing five to

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.240
seven pieces of gum per day.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.800
Other cases only got serious
when stuff like coins got

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.060
swallowed and trapping in the
Wrigley's brand butt plug.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.710
So don't worry, the occasional
accidentally swallowed piece

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.780
of gum isn't going
to do any harm.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.150
You'd have to be the Hunter S.
Thompson of gum swallowing to

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.810
get into medical trouble.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.780
But prepare to be embarrassed,
if you're caught.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.570
Dr. Milov writes that, quote,
"The rainbow of fused

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.750
multicolored gum fragments in
the removed fecoma is easily

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.090
recognized by physician and
family as old gum." In the

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.640
end, maybe I'm just weird that
that actually sounds sort of

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.250
beautiful, other than the part
where it gets pulled out of

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.480
somebody's butt.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.350
And then the verdict is false.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.840
All the myths and the cliches
in the book are given a

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.600
verdict on the scale
of true to false.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.880
And many of them do fall
somewhere in the middle.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.160
Some of them are true with a
nyeh, false with a-- but.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.370
On some of them, the research
is ongoing.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.020
For many years, for example,
researchers were pretty sure

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.000
that cold weather did nothing
to make people

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.680
susceptible to colds.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.450
They knew that there
was a cold season.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.360
But there's still not widespread
agreement on what

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.780
causes that.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.320
Is it just people packed indoors
together during the

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.650
winter, sharing germs?

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.830
Is it because school
is in session?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.020
Is it because the cold
lowers your immunity?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.120
Is it because the virus does
better in cold conditions?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.230
Nobody is 100% sure.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.500
They were pretty sure it
wasn't temperature.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.360
Because they would dab infected
mucus on people--

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.890
again, sorry if you're eating--
on people's noses, at

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.680
different temperatures.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.830
And they would find no
relationship between who got a

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.870
cold and who was cold.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.520
But there's some new research
out of a university in Wales,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.670
where they tried to model how
people catch colds in a more

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.780
organic way.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.350
During cold season, they would
have people sit in a lab, with

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.040
their feet in buckets of cold
water, and then compare who

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.050
caught a cold, just in the next
month of running around

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.310
Wales, to the control group
that was not sitting with

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.300
their feet in cold water.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.780
And they found a pretty
strong causal link.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.655
Something about having cold
feet actually made these

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:41.260
people catch colds.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.150
So as crazy as it sounds,
your mom was right.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.900
These people might be catching
cold because they didn't put

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.790
on galoshes, or because they
went outside with wet hair, or

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.290
all the things your mom
was freaked about.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.330
So I think there is some comfort
here for parents who--

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.180
there is some vindication for
parents who have been saying

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.700
that breakfast is the
most important meal

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.400
of the day or whatever.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.480
Some of these things are true.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.110
But the vast majority are not.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.920
And that's trouble
in our house.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.830
My son read a galley, an
early copy of the book.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.570
And now he is way
over-informed.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.110
It's gotten to the point where
my wife will be like, Dylan,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.100
you're sitting to
close to the TV.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.110
Get back on the couch.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.930
And he won't even look up.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.050
He'll be like, no I'm not.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.840
Dad says it's fine.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.100
It's just temporary
eye strain.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.805
I think this is hilarious.

00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:34.720
If my wife were here, I don't
think she's such a fan.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.510
And you realize what
the utility is to a

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.460
lot of these myths.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.160
Not only does it make the
parent look wise and

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.300
authoritative, oftentimes I am
sure these things arise out of

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.740
the need to--

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.260
you want to shut down some
annoying behavior.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.330
You don't want your kids
popping their knuckles,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.130
because if you hear that sound
one more time, you're going to

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.710
go crash the car or something.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.315
And so you tell your kid
that causes arthritis.

00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:01.565
And it's not really true.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.170
But kids fall for
a lot of this.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.600
And I'm sort of concerned that
one effect of this might be

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.450
that as these parental paranoias
sort of accumulate

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.440
over generations, that we sort
of forget how they started.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.720
That they started as
well-intended ways of

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.420
protecting your kids.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.880
And we start to think there is
some terrible threat if your

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.320
child swallows a watermelon
seed, or picks up a dirty

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.990
feather at the playground, or
looks at the microwave while

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.670
it's running, or whatever
these things are.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.950
Writes on his skin with
a ballpoint pen.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.380
I had a seventh grade biology
teacher freak out because I

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.770
was drawing something on my hand
with a pen and that was

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.050
going to cause cancer
or something.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.490
And over time, you get this
gradual accumulation of these

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.560
parental paranoias.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.370
And the result is our kids start
getting more and more

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.840
cushioned, more and more
bubble-wrapped for any kind of

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.710
experimentation or fun.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.560
And before long, you get the
kind of helicopter parents you

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.780
read about in scary "Time"
magazine cover packages of

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.780
these parents who never let
their kids do any of the

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.300
things that--

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.030
I got to ride my bike
to school as a kid.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.160
But no, you can't
do that today.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.550
Kids who can't climb trees.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.280
You see crazy examples.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.110
I read a "Dear Abby" column,
where she told parents to take

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.400
a picture of their kids every
day leaving the house in that

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.360
day's clothes, because that
way if they got kidnapped,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.680
she's got something to
show to the cops.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.800
This is like a serious
well-intended solution.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.050
Or--

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.540
this is great.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.810
I've actually heard about
universities that now have

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.050
sort of mommy cams in the dorms
so that your mom can

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.580
like keep an eye on what's
going on in the

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.950
old residence hall.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.960
Companies are preparing parent
packets, like big accounting

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.490
companies are now preparing
parent packets for their new

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.010
job interviews every year
because often a concerned mom

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.810
or dad will come along.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.480
And so I'm sort of worried
that in our well-intended

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.230
desire to keep our kids safe,
we're actually making kids

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.390
unhappy, unable to cope with the
modern world, unconfident

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.400
about the modern world.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.760
The perfect example is like
don't talk to strangers.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.830
What could be a less
controversial piece of advice?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.680
And of course, your kids
shouldn't talk to strangers.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.920
Actually if you talk to child
safety advocacy groups now,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.580
they say that's like the worst
thing you could say.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.150
Never tell your kid not
to talk to strangers.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.140
Kids don't understand that.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.110
It just makes them insecure
about adults.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.200
There have been cases where a
kid got lost and then tried to

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.060
hide from all the people that
were looking for him because

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.820
they were strangers.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.130
And instead, they say what
you need to do is

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.230
teach kids to be confident.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.150
If they get in that kind of
situation, they need to know

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.930
which adults they should
be looking to for help.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.450
Go to somebody in uniform.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.900
Go to somebody who works
for the store.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.950
Try to find another
mom with kids.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.770
There's actually good, practical
advice you can give

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.160
kids that doesn't scare them.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.870
And instead, we've created
this whole industry based

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.060
around stranger danger.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.680
This idea that some creepy guy
in a white van is going to

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.570
grab your kid, when really the
idea of a stranger kidnapping

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.810
a kid is something that only
happens like on the order of a

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.770
few dozen times every year
in this country.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.369
Most of the, a child vanishes
every n minutes, stats you

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:16.619
hear, it's all people the
family know, it's a

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.030
noncustodial parent
or something.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.319
But it's how we create
the method

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.819
of this random kidnapper.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.650
So hopefully, actually debunking
some of these things

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.080
will let parents breathe a
little easier and let their

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.360
kids be kids.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.220
The cool thing about writing
this book today is it's

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.260
actually possible to
be written today.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.690
We live in an age where
information is much more

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.080
available to the lay
person, public

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.730
interest writer like me.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.210
If I don't know whether or not
apple seeds are poisonous, I

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.460
can Bing it.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.030
I'm just kidding.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.980
I would google it.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.940
When I was a kid, I was sort of
a trivia nerd kid you'll be

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.510
shocked to hear, when I was
10 or 11 years old.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.770
We did not have Google.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:06.750
We lived in this strange
internet-free world where the

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.850
real scoop on myths like this,
if they got delivered at all,

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.530
came in the forms of often out
of print paperbacks that you'd

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.490
have to find in a
used bookstore.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.540
And I remember knowing, to this
day I know which of these

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.480
books held which things.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.060
I know that back before the
internet, if you wanted to

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.490
know a best guess as to what the
secret herbs and spices in

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.130
the Colonel's chicken was,
that's in a book called "Big

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.180
Secrets" by William
Poundstone.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.140
And if you want to know the
scoop about the fact that in

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.520
Columbus's day, nobody really
thought the world was flat,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.390
contrary to popular belief.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.270
That was in Tom Burnam's book,
"The Dictionary of

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.010
Misinformation."

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.790
There were all these sort of
pop reference books where

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.945
people knew this stuff.

00:18:43.945 --> 00:18:45.940
Of course today, we
don't need that.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.720
All this kind of stuff
is well handled

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.780
by Snopes, by Wikipedia.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.880
It's well-indexed by Google.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.350
All this stuff should just
be a click away.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.030
And the experience of fighting
and getting my ass kicked by

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.390
Watson sort of made me think
what are the implications of

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.410
living in this world where
our search engines or our

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.480
smartphones can do lots of our
stuff remembering stuff for

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.080
us, a lot of our stuff
remembering for us?

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.970
I realized after losing
to Google--

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.680
or to Google, Freudian slip,
after losing to Watson, I'm

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:28.070
someone who always drew a lot
of I guess self-esteem from

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.660
being the guy who's good
at remembering stuff.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.040
It used to be a valuable thing
in the workplace to know who's

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.750
the person in the office you go
to when you can't remember

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.630
the name of the bassist
of in that band?

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.530
Or what's the name of
that character actor

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.450
on that one TV show?

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.590
And I was always that guy, at
school, or in the dorms, or in

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.210
the office.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.440
And today, nobody
needs that guy.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.340
That guy is out of work.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.420
If you don't remember the name
of some guy, you look it up on

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:51.860
your phone.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.110
And it's super easy.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:02.220
And in effect, when I lost to
Watson, I sort of felt like

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.920
the first person in America
who'd lost his job to this new

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.400
generation of thinking machine,
just like a 1970s

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.640
Detroit factory worker getting
pushed off the assembly line

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.870
by the robot that can do his
job much faster and more

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.740
reliably than him.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.260
And I felt like I was the first
one of those guys for

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.110
the information age, which
was a great honor.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.230
And the more I read up on this,
I feel like I'm not

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.210
going to be the last one.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.850
There's lots of other
sort of--

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.840
I don't want say menial, but
sort of low-level information

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.600
gathering jobs where Watson or
technologies like it are

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.310
becoming very good.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.500
I'm sure there are probably
people in this room working on

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.060
these technologies.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.230
Pharmacists, almost all that
job can be automated.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.040
In fact, lots of medical kinds
of lab work and diagnosis is

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.240
now getting to the point where
it can be automated.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.070
IBM has been very clear
that Watson is going

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.670
into health care now.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.230
I assume that's less
controversial than Homeland

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.910
Security or something.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.600
Really, our mass information
collecting and processing

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.910
software, it's just going
to cure cancer.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.740
Don't worry about government
contracts at all.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.960
And paralegals, for example.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.290
There's lots of jobs where
people doing low-level

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.420
information collection that
really a pretty short Shell

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.230
script could probably do
your job now, sir.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.050
And what does that
mean for us?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.740
What does that mean in a world
where we don't have to know

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.160
stuff anymore?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.740
What's going to happen
our brains?

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.210
The book I wrote before this was
called "Maphead." It was

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.110
about my love of maps
and geography.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.410
There's a chapter on--

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.510
anybody here from Google Geo?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.420
There's like a whole chapter
on Google, ayeh.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.530
There's a whole chapter on
the new digital mapping

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.690
technologies and what
that means for us.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:52.400
And I talked to quite a few
researchers in the book, who

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.310
sort of felt like the new maps
have the potential to be a new

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.630
golden age for mapping.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.820
There's also the downside of
what GPS is doing to us.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.200
If we outsource the part of our
brain that navigates and

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.920
does sense of direction to a
little talking voice on our

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.200
dashboard, this is the reason
why you always read in the

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.290
paper about people driving into
lakes and driving onto

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.130
railroad tracks.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.070
They just obey the little
talking voice.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.650
How I was supposed to know
that was a lake?

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.750
It's like how we all used
to be able to--

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.660
15 years ago, we were all really
good at memorizing

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.960
seven digit numbers.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.800
And now like, I don't even know
my phone number because

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.190
there's no use for it anymore.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.630
So what if our phones and our
search engines can do

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.930
all this for us?

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.710
I hope that our ability to
remember facts doesn't atrophy

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.170
in the same way that our ability
to remember phone

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.470
numbers and our ability to not
drive into lakes has sort of

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.100
changed in the past few years.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.020
I believe there is still some
utility to knowing a fact off

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.270
the top of your head.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.420
We were actually talking
about this earlier.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.880
It's great that when there's
something on the tip of our

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.550
tongue that we don't know, thank
goodness we can google.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.220
And it's not just
idle curiosity.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.400
Often that Google search might
be for something more urgent.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.310
But imagine what it means to
us that we know facts.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.400
What does that do for us?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.800
In education, I guess now
there's sort of an emphasis on

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.960
knowing how to think rather than
knowing what to think.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.680
There's less of an emphasis on
making sure that kids are

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.640
chock-full of dates and
so forth, dates and

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.490
formulas, and what not.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.160
Because ahh, they can
look that up.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.310
I think there is still virtue
in knowing facts.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.120
If there are two advantages to
knowing something off the top

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.540
your head versus having to whip
out your phone or on your

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.800
console, I would say it's
probably the advantage of

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.860
scale and the advantage
of time.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.020
The first is an advantage
of volume.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.600
The fact that we live in a
information age means that

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.790
it's easier to get a hold
of information.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.210
It also means there's
exponentially more information

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.940
coming at us at all times.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.500
Sure, there have been great
Renaissance men in history,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.430
Thomas Jefferson, and Ben
Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.740
But notice how they lived sort
of close to the Renaissance.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.200
There was a lot less
to know back then.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.900
You put Jefferson on "Jeopardy"
today, and he's

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.210
really going to be struggling
at nuclear physics or '70s

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.210
sit-coms, or hip-hop.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.810
I mean he's going to get
his butt kicked.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.580
There's just more to know more,
more to know today than

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.000
there was for the guy in the
16th century or the 18th

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.970
century, who could
know everything.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.220
And it's global.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.250
My vacation plans could get
affected by a volcano in

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:34.200
Iceland, or on the darker side,
a terrorist cell in

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.430
Pakistan, or the
Greek economy.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.640
Little things happening a world
away, can really affect

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.770
my day-to-day life, in a world
that wasn't true in Leonardo's

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.340
time or in Jefferson's time.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.960
And to make good decisions based
on all these facts, we

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.790
need to synthesize them.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.030
And that only happens when we
have these facts, I believe,

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.900
at our fingertips.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.030
Let's say I'm trying
to decide--

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:55.850
we'll go back in time a month.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.100
I'll trying to decide
who to vote for.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.060
I learned already, my map work,
that less than a quarter

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.120
of Americans can find Iraq
and Afghanistan on a map.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.720
It's closer to 10%.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.310
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is who's voting on

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.770
your foreign policy.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.480
And it strikes me that for me
to even make a well-informed

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.680
decision as a citizen on which
candidate I'm going to vote

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.670
for in that arena, I should
know more than that.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.580
Not only should I know the
relative locations of Iraq and

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.090
Afghanistan, I should have some
idea of what I think the

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.030
conditions are there, what I
think the right plan is going

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.570
forward, and so forth.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.260
And that's true not just for
foreign policy, but for dozens

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.830
of other arenas as well.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.000
And if I am literally going to
sit there and have to goggle

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.640
every one of those questions
before I vote,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.500
we know what happens.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.490
People don't sit there and
google thousands of questions

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.180
before they fill out
their ballot.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.390
They just end up doing a really
half-assed job, based

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.260
on really poor knowledge.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:53.280
Whereas I believe if more of
those facts were literally in

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.290
their heads, those would be
the building block to more

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.880
informed decisions
on a daily basis.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.950
Not just voting, but better
informed decisions about where

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.320
to go to eat, or what's quickest
way to drive from

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.780
here to there, or what should
my major be, should I

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.260
interview here or there?

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.660
The decisions we make fairly
regularly, but can have a big

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.600
effect on our lives.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.920
The other advantage I would say
to knowing stuff in our

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.270
heads versus on our phones would
be an advantage of time.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.775
The story I always think of here
is a little British girl.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:27.620
She's about 10 years old.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.640
So that would be the
fourth grade.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.920
Do they have that there?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.740
Well, what would be a fourth
grader in our system, on

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.710
vacation with her parents,
in Thailand.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.160
She is at the beach one
day with her parents.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.920
And she comes running up in the
morning and says, mom and

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.820
dad, I think we should
get off the beach.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.510
And I'm like, what
do you mean?

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.550
We just got here.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.970
And she said well,
look out to sea.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.820
The level of the tide has
gone down quite a bit.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.970
The tide's gone way out
since we've been here.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.860
And now there's starting to be
like big, churning waves and

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.280
bubbles further out to sea.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.790
And their parents are like,
what does that mean?

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.940
And she said well, we just
learned two weeks ago and Mr.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.060
Kurney's geography class,
this is the

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.170
first sign of a tsunami.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.460
This is what you see before
the wave hits.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.760
And their parents are
like, are you sure?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.910
Like are you saying there's
going to be a tsunami?

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.920
And she's like, that's
what we learned.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.380
And somehow this little girl
convinces her parents that

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.820
this really is a early warning
sign of a tsunami.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.530
So they get off the beach.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.385
They tell the life guard.

00:27:22.385 --> 00:27:24.390
The life guard clears
the beach.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.156
And within less than an hour,
sure enough, the beach is

00:27:28.156 --> 00:27:28.640
under water.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.430
This was the day after
Christmas, 2006.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.300
Is that right?

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.130
The big--

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.170
2005?

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.860
When was the big Boxing Day
tsunami on the Indian Ocean?

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.920
AUDIENCE: 2004.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.250
KEN JENNINGS: 2004.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.000
And this girl literally saved a
hundred lives by remembering

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.370
the right fact from her
geography teacher, at the

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.960
right time.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.700
You know, one fact, well
deployed, in the right place

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.500
and at the right time,
was all it took.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.700
Most of the examples are not
going to be so dramatic.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.390
But I still believe that that's
true in general, that

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.580
one fact, well deployed, in the
right place, does have the

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.570
ability to change lives.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.505
And thank goodness, in our
generation we have tools that

00:28:08.505 --> 00:28:10.270
are just revolutionizing
the way we can

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.610
retrieve these facts.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.130
But I also feel like we need
to have them on hand.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.670
We need to not outsource the
part of our brain that knows

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:25.600
stuff, to our devices, no matter
how user friendly they

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.150
are, how amazing their holiday
doodles, the level of snacks

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:31.930
in their cafeteria.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.050
As much I love Google, I hope
that we still know things and

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.630
it becomes a tool and not a
replacement for our memories.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.150
I wanted to take questions
because I know we have a

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.440
little bit of time left over
and I didn't know if I was

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.560
going to cover what people
were interested in.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.740
So if you have questions about
whatever, books, information

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.720
in general, Watson, "Jeopardy,"
feel free.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.150
If you'd use one of these mics
at the side, that helps with

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.600
the sound I guess.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.755
Because this is all being taped
for posterity and Watson

00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:05.240
is watching us right now.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.790
So yes, please feel free
to step up to a mic

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:07.540
if you have a question.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.290
I feel like a shareholders'
meeting.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.570
AUDIENCE: Greetings.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.895
Do you know any cheesy computer
science jokes?

00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:15.220
KEN JENNINGS: Ha, ha, ha.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:21.170
Cheesy computer science jokes,
wow, I feel like I did.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.910
The joke I always think of now
is the joke that made me

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.260
switch to computer science.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.850
Which is, what's the difference
between an English

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.960
major and a large
pepperoni pizza?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.660
At least the pizza can feed
a family of four.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.730
I was an English major who got
a second degree in computer

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.900
science, pretty much on the
strength of that joke.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.290
And now, I'm a writer.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.070
I don't know.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.130
Do you have a great tech joke
you want to share here?

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.850
AUDIENCE: I'll share
my favorite one.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.330
Eight bytes walk into a bar.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.700
They go up to the bartender
and say, make us a double.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.950
KEN JENNINGS: Man,
that would kill.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.570
You've got to take that
to the clubs.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.430
That is a pretty good joke.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.710
Thank you.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.960
That was better than my joke.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.150
Yeah?

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.160
AUDIENCE: Given what you just
talked about in terms of like,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.190
I completely with you, you've
got to still know facts.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.320
You got to have stuff at
the tip of your tongue.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.910
Do you still think a show
like "Jeopardy" is

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.210
relevant and useful?

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:22.540
KEN JENNINGS: Yeah.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.470
I was sort of wondering if
I should get into that.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.480
Obviously, "Jeopardy" had to
answer that question many

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.020
times during the Watson games.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.530
And they would always say,
no, no, "Jeopardy," fact

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.210
remembering is still
a very human task.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.310
And people still watch the
Olympics, even though a car

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.870
can go faster than a sprinter
and has for a long

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.500
time, and so forth.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.940
And I guess it's a good point.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.090
I'm sure computers have been
able to play "Wheel of

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:52.260
Fortune" at near grandmaster
levels for many years now.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.930
And yet, we all still
love Wheel.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.300
But I actually do sort
I wonder that.

00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.130
As it becomes less remarkable
to know where it stops just

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.070
because nobody needs to
anymore, what happens?

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.460
Does it become more remarkable
that there weirdos like me who

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.290
could do know all the presidents
in order or does it

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.260
just become sort of old-timey
and weird, like those people

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.030
that watch railroad trains go
by at particular times?

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.780
Like why do you have that hobby
that my grandpa had?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.720
I honestly don't know which
way it's going to go.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.290
I hope that there remains
something heroic about the

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.450
nation's proud know-it-alls and
that you will bear us on

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.250
litters to your feasts
in an age when nobody

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.450
knows anything anymore.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.540
Yeah?

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.370
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for the talk.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.480
That was great.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.590
I have your almanac,
which I love.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.160
I actually host a quiz night
and I've ripped off or

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.160
borrowed lots of
ideas from it.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.050
Just wondering if you have any
ideas for tomorrow night's

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.850
quiz that I'm hosting?

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.100
KEN JENNINGS: Ideas for tomorrow
night's-- like you

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.570
want a question?

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.470
What have you got, rounds,
questions?

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.790
KEN JENNINGS: I have talked to
lots of pub trivia guys who

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.470
use that book.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.610
And I always sort of worried
because I'm sure somebody in

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.340
your audience might have
that book too.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:09.990
AUDIENCE: They do.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.300
But there's so much in
it, you'd never be

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.690
able memorize it all.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.880
KEN JENNINGS: It does have
over 9,000 questions.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.780
But remember who you're
dealing with.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.990
I'm trying to think if there's
something great I just heard.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.500
The funny thing is when I hear
a great piece of trivia, I

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.840
immediately have like a thing
in my phone for it because I

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.120
write a few trivia things.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.020
And I want to make
sure I use them.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.640
This was pretty good.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.320
I just heard this.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.430
In that new movie, what's
it called, "Rise of the

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.070
Guardians," where like Santa
Claus, and the Easter Bunny,

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.130
and the Tooth Fairy all gang up
to fight crime or whatever

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.310
it is they did.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.990
So Santa has two words tattooed
on his two biceps, in

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.140
the vein of the love
and hate guy.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.900
What are the two words
on Santa's biceps?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.720
AUDIENCE: Naughty and nice.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.620
KEN JENNINGS: Naughty
and nice, very good.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.310
AUDIENCE: That's a good one.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.560
KEN JENNINGS: Feel free.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.690
My question is related to what
you were talking about earlier

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.470
with knowing facts.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.840
I got into a discussion with
someone recently where they

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.900
were saying that there's no
point in us knowing, an

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.830
average person knowing about
current political affairs

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.800
going on in China or just things
like that, that aren't

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.650
directly related to
our daily life.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.840
I was wondering what your
thoughts were on that?

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.600
KEN JENNINGS: I guess I
don't really buy that

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.750
argument any more.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:27.750
Maybe that was true 50 years
ago, that nothing happening a

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.990
world away could really affect
your life that much.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.640
But I think we've seen
so many examples of

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.200
how that's not true.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.850
I had to cancel a vacation a
couple years ago because of

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.010
the volcano in Iceland.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:46.980
And we saw the price of gas
spike like $0.40 in many

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.440
states a few months ago, just
because of one refinery fire

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.370
that was, I'm sure, thousands of
miles away from most of the

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.466
people affected

00:33:52.466 --> 00:33:56.760
I think there's lots of evidence
now that the stuff

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.970
happening half a world away
really does affect your life

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.500
on a day to day basis.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.990
I guess the better question is,
is there so much happening

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.840
that there's really no hope
that the well-informed lay

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.639
person like you or me can
actually understand the

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.639
financial situation in China
well enough to make wise

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.420
decisions based on that,
so why bother?

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.790
I don't have a better
rebuttal for that.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.560
I'm afraid we're getting to the
point where that is true.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:25.250
And does democracy have less
value in a world where a voter

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.590
really can't be well informed
about all the important issues

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:27.800
that matter?

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.719
I don't know.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:29.969
It's an interesting question.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.140
Yeah, go ahead?

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.330
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for coming.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.670
I actually remember watching
your historic run on

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.739
"Jeopardy" with my roommate
at the time.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:45.179
We would tune in every day and
watch and kind of like hope

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:47.820
that we're going to watch the
day that Ken Jennings gets

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.210
defeated, finally.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.330
KEN JENNINGS: So let me
get this straight.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.526
I've got like the best
job I've ever had.

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:59.350
I'm making like $50K an
hour or something.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.240
And yet kids all over college
campuses, all over America,

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.340
are hoping I get fired.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.940
AUDIENCE: We were fascinated,
yeah every day.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.540
I remember there was like an
internet rumor that today was

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.640
the day that Ken lost.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.507
And then the H&amp;R Block question
came up and we were

00:35:12.507 --> 00:35:15.680
like no way, he knows this.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.700
KEN JENNINGS: So not only are
you hoping I lose, you thought

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.670
it was a super easy question?

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.180
AUDIENCE: Well, to
be fair, we did.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.010
Anyway my question is, I've
always wondered this, does

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.540
Alex Trebek actually know the
answers to the questions?

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:29.970
KEN JENNINGS: Alex?

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.820
You know, it's funny.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.760
I think "Jeopardy" is really,
the core viewership is college

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.183
students and old people.

00:35:40.183 --> 00:35:42.980
I get the feeling nobody with
a job actually watches

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.220
"Jeopardy." And it's great
because the fact that the

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.850
audience skews to old means
that I don't get

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.470
recognized any more.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:53.020
Most of the people who saw me
on the show are now dead or

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.400
they graduated.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.060
Alex is a smart guy.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.310
He's a big reader.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.767
I've talked to him.

00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:03.320
And he hosts the National
Geographic Bee.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.460
And that's because he's
a true believer.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.470
He's got a basement full of
"National Geographic"s going

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.290
back 50 years.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.070
And basically he's your grandpa
watching History

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.330
Channel documentaries
about World War II.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:13.970
He's a smart guy.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.280
When people ask him that, he
says back in the day I could

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.330
have run the table.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.690
I could have held my own in
"Jeopardy." But it's a young

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:21.420
man's game.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.935
And I'm past my prime now.

00:36:22.935 --> 00:36:27.150
So I think Alex feels he has
missed his chance at

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.450
"Jeopardy" starting.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.560
Instead he gets to look like
a genius and be like

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.260
oh no, no, I'm sorry.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.970
It's, what, is Tajikistan,
as if he knew?

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.470
And he'll do the phony
pronunciations too.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.940
He'll be like, what
is Nicaragua?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.440
He loves doing the foreign
pronunciations.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.690
I think he's a smart guy.

00:36:50.895 --> 00:36:51.370
Yeah?

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.780
I was curious.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.800
So I have an awful memory.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.480
I was wondering if you've got
any memorization techniques

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.170
that you use?

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.230
KEN JENNINGS: People
ask me that a lot.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.490
And I feel bad, but I
don't have a trick.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.290
But I don't have a method or
an ancient Chinese herb or

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.210
whatever it would take for me
to write a self-help book or

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.270
make a billion dollars
on this.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.920
I read a book about
trivia nerds.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.500
And what I found out is that
most of these people

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.110
apparently came out of
the box that way.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.880
There's something chromosomal
that makes some people

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.480
information sponges,
almost from birth.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.880
Nothing you can do about it.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.840
And I think it's relatable.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.070
I mean we all are this way about
the things that we love.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.480
You take some kid that's
terrible in school, but he

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.960
knows every word of every song
on his favorite album.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.350
He knows every stat of his
favorite athlete or team, even

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.810
if he doesn't know
his times tables.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.090
So it seems to me that interest
is the key thing that

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.240
makes people either able to
remember stuff or not.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.660
If you care, you'll remember
it without even trying.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.870
If you don't, almost no amount
of effort will get

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.050
it to stay in there.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.790
And these trivia people tend
to be interested in

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.180
everything.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.810
They're just curious
people by nature.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.470
And I guess this sort of goes
to what I saying about the

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:06.720
utility of information.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.710
Because they are curious about
everything, they'll find that

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.030
their knowledge has
a social utility.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.750
They find it easier to
meet new people.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.200
They'll sit next to somebody on
a plane and they'll be like

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.040
oh, you're from Fargo?

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.820
Do you know that baseball
player, Roger

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.670
Maris was from Fargo?

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.850
Have you ever been to the
Roger Maris museum?

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.140
The fact that they have this
wealth of seemingly useless

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.700
facts actually, bizarrely makes
it very easy for them to

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.170
get to know people.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.250
But getting back to your
question, I feel like when I

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.420
was studying for "Jeopardy,"
there were things I tried to

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.180
cram on and I just
did terribly.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.240
Like I had to memorize all the
presidents and their dates.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.350
That's a "Jeopardy" stand by.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.420
I had know cocktails.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.770
I don't drink.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.560
But "Jeopardy" always has
the "potent potable."

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.000
So I have all these
flashcards.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.030
I had two sets of flashcards.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.640
One have the presidents
on the front and the

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.700
dates on the back.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.260
And the other had like on the
front it would be like, Harvey

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.000
Wallbanger.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.150
And the back it would be like,
whatever is in a Harvey Wall--

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.430
I don't even know, vodka,
orange juice.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.320
It's like a screwdriver with
Galliano or something.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.250
Is that right?

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.510
Who's like a functioning
alcoholic?

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.760
Yeah, there you go.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.540
So for weeks, all we would talk
about in our house was

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.540
like the presidency and
cocktails, presidency.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.070
It's like going to college with

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.970
George W. Bush, I imagine.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:34.850
But thank you for laughing at my
very cheap political joke,

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.350
cheap and out-of-date
political joke.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.630
But I found the same
thing you did.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.020
When these things were not
interesting to me, they were

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.510
incredibly hard to remember.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.790
And I would make up a little
mnemonic stories, like I'm

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.360
sure you do for hard
to remember facts.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.726
Like I had a hard time
remembering that John Quincy

00:39:50.726 --> 00:39:54.150
Adams was elected in
1824, for example.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.290
So I had to like make up this
very circuitous story in my

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:03.290
head about Quincy, the 1970s,
late '70s, early '80s, TV

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.110
medical examiner, working
a 24 hour shift.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.060
OK, Quincy working
a 24 hour shift.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.560
I can picture that.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.310
1984, or 1824, John Quincy
Adams, for some reason that

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.830
would help me.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.300
And these things were always
more complicated than the fact

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.410
I was trying to remember.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.940
But something about them was
more helpful to me than the

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.070
fact itself.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.460
And there are techniques
that you can do.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.200
I mean have you heard about
this memory palace stuff?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.130
The part of our brain that does
geography is very good.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.440
So if you need to remember
a bunch of facts in order

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.790
quickly, you set up this mental
geography where you

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.850
wander through your childhood
house and you place the memory

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.480
sparking objects in a certain
order within the house.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.680
And there are people who can
use techniques like this to

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.480
memorize all 52 cards in a deck
as fast as a dealer can

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.720
turn them over.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.360
Like the guy will get done with
the deck and the person

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.430
can then recite the deck by
re-walking through the place

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.740
in his head.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.370
And these are people with
ordinary memories, but they've

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.560
trained themselves to do
this parlor trick.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.650
So yes, there are
parlor tricks.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.880
And I'm terrible at them, I
guess is the short answer?

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.800
Yes?

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks are coming.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.170
Like you, I grew up in a
pre-Google world of Birnbaum's

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.250
books and--

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.190
KEN JENNINGS: They're
old, huh?

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.640
AUDIENCE: And Poundstone and
the "Book of Lists." And

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.520
you've just published a book
of myths and trivia like

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.410
these, in that tradition.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:20.340
Watson clearly demonstrates
that parsing and searching

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.180
structured knowledge, that
someone has structured,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:23.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.390
has structured for them, is
possible and can be made

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.830
mechanical.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:32.150
There's still the thing that
Birnbaum does, that

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:36.510
mythologists do, that people
who discover new facts and

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.860
structure them.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.890
Given that you've just published
this book, could you

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.600
speak a bit about that
and where that's

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.190
going in the future?

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.210
Because there are more facts
being produced in

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.350
more ways every day.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.680
We all know, we work
at Google.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.280
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.660
KEN JENNINGS: I mean this book
almost is sort of a throwback.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.290
I mean a lot of this stuff in
this book, it was published in

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.300
academic journals.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.870
These questions are
less googleable

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.660
than you'd think today.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.480
But many of them, all it would
take is a parent visiting

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.920
Snopes or Wikipedia and they're
going to see the pros

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.080
and cons of all these.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.310
But it's a good point.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.150
When they talk about Watson as
a diagnostician for example,

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:24.240
in Watson's new health care
adventures, yes it's going to

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.110
be very good at recommending--

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.230
you get a list of symptoms and
it'll recommend treatments and

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.890
pharmaceutical possibilities
and suggest diagnoses.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:36.340
But it's not going to be
doing original work.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.913
It's not going to find
the new drug that

00:42:37.913 --> 00:42:39.040
will treat these things.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.470
It'll just tell a doctor which
of these three options you

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.510
already knew about, is
mathematically slightly more

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.840
likely in this case.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.480
And that's the same thing
it was doing when it was

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.460
answering "Jeopardy"
questions too.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.570
If you watched the show, you
could see the little

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.780
probability meter at the
bottom of its screen.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.310
Sometimes it would make
incredibly naive errors.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.760
In the category of US cities, it
would say, what is Toronto?

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.140
Realizing that even though
some pattern-matching had

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.890
worked, it had missed the most
important detail of all, that

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.390
a human never would have missed,
which is that Toronto

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.390
is not part of the US
until we invade it.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.400
But yeah, that distinction
still remains.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.230
I think a lot of lay people
would watch what Watson is

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.720
doing and give it a little
too much credit.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.310
Wow, it understood
the question.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.170
And it didn't really
understood.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:31.150
It just could, in parallel,
weigh billions or trillions of

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.800
textual relationships in a very
efficient and smart way.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.650
Now, what's interesting is that
it could do that and get

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.050
as good of results as a human,
doing what I would consider

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.960
high-level work.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.570
So, we'll see.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.620
But the creative part of those
jobs is still around.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.620
When Trebek got asked about
this, he'd always say I'm not

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.740
worried until Watson can host
"Jeopardy." I don't care if it

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.340
can win "Jeopardy," I just
wondering whether

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.930
or not it can host?

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.830
Do you have a question?

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.730
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about your
relationship with your

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.170
son with respect to facts
for instance.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.050
I think all of us probably
grow up pre-Wikipedia.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.400
So my relationship with my
father was very much, he was

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.970
the source of truth for many,
many years, until he stopped

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.530
being the source
for any truth.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.660
And he did a pretty good job.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.150
He's a very smart guy and
he's trivia focused.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.650
He kicked our ass in "Trivial
Pursuit" for years.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.010
And I grew up in--

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.600
KEN JENNINGS: I think you dad is
trivia focused by the way.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.740
Like, that'll be on
his grave stone.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.480
AUDIENCE: His resume, yeah.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.020
So once Wikipedia came up, I
sort of like fact-checked

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.310
things when they came up.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.130
I'm like where do I know that?

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.500
I think my dad just
made that up.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.750
And he was right.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.250
He was a pretty admirable job.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.200
But now you can do that
from the age of five.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.120
So you can't get away with just
pulling something out of

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.630
your ass when your son asks,
as my dad did fairly

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.640
successfully for 16 years.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.690
So how has that changed
for you?

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.150
You have a unique perspective.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.100
KEN JENNINGS: Are
you a parent?

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.060
AUDIENCE: No, I'm not.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.000
KEN JENNINGS: Because when you
have kids you realize it's

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.820
another volume problem.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.220
You can't keep up with the
volume of why questions.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.580
And every time you answer a why
question with a "because,"

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.390
there'll be another
well, why that?

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.045
So you just get a higher level
thing and it becomes an

00:45:21.045 --> 00:45:22.295
endless recursive.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.780
I like to think that I'm pretty
good at saying I don't

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.290
know, let's look it up, as
opposed to, I'll just make up

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.710
for you how rainbows work.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.160
Why not?

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.770
How are you going to
know any better?

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.980
But the temptation is certainly
there, because it

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.790
takes longer.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.960
It takes longer to look
it up and explain it.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.560
There's a "Calvin &amp; Hobbes"
cartoon where Calvin asks his

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.910
dad why pictures are
black and white?

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.540
And his dad says that's how
the world used to be then.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.690
Those are color photos of a
world that was black and white

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.940
before you were born.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.170
And kids would we
believe that.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.110
But at some point,
they're going to

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.110
realize that's not true.

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.550
This is the first Christmas
where neither of my kids

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.410
believes in Santa, so it's
very sad for us.

00:46:10.035 --> 00:46:11.640
But yeah, I do feel
like the right

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.890
response is, I don't know.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:13.750
Let's look it up.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.140
Rather than ahh, stop
bugging me.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.890
Let me just tell you
something short.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.310
AUDIENCE: So he still
comes to you before

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.570
seeking it out himself?

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.200
KEN JENNINGS: He
actually does.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.360
And I like to think
that's laziness.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.520
It's like the upside of the
lazy computer for our

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.160
generation, is that as easy as
it is to do something online,

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.080
like asking the person there in
front of you is easier than

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.960
going to the computer and having
to type something in.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.750
That feels like homework.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.110
In fact, it is homework because
these kids are getting

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.470
assigned to answer these
questions with Google.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.820
And so they don't see
this as fun anymore.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.890
So I guess that was very clever
of teachers to make it

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.890
seem boring to actually have to
look stuff up, so that they

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:50.760
still need their parents.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.310
That was good.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:53.480
Thank you.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.630
Do you have a question?

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.760
First of all I wanted to state
for the record, I also

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.600
followed you when you were
historical in on "Jeopardy."

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.590
And I was rooting for you.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.090
KEN JENNINGS: Well, that's
what we need.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.020
AUDIENCE: It was reassuring,
that $75K run-away at the end.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.230
So my question actually
was about the show.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.650
It seems like there are multiple
shows taped per day.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.750
So I was just curious a little
bit about that, logistics?

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.580
And given your long run, how
many times did you have to go

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.830
shopping in California?

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.160
KEN JENNINGS: The logistics in
"Jeopardy" are interesting.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.300
What's the time on these.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.630
Is this the last question or,
do this and one more?

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.900
OK.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.780
If you're a fan of the show, you
might get the wrong idea

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.120
about how it works.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.330
Alex will come out every day and
pretend it's a new show.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.020
But really, they do
five in a day.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.270
So a full week's worth of
shows is an afternoon.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.240
And that's a long afternoon.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.050
Dick Clark I understand used to
do 10 shows of "Pyramid,"

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:43.900
every day, which
blows my mind.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.930
Because I got so exhausted after
doing five "Jeopardys."

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.150
So you show up in the morning,
get an orientation.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.120
They sort of walk you through
the tricky "Jeopardy" buzzer

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.470
and what to do when you're on
stage, and don't freeze up,

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.190
and let's rehearse
your anecdotes.

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.450
Believe it or not, they do
rehearse those terrible

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.900
anecdotes they tell all
about their cats.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.790
And I guess I shouldn't say
they, we tell about our cats.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.260
But as soon as the game is over,
the contestants come

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:12.770
down stage.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:15.140
There's this little awkward
chat down stage, which is

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.260
really a terrible
social dynamic.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.610
Because two of you have
just lost, seen your

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:25.020
lifelong dream shattered.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.340
One of you has just realized he
or she is going to go back

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.560
and do the whole thing again in
like 10 minutes, as soon as

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.460
you put on your tie or skirt.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.370
And the fourth one of you just
wants to get out of there in

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.400
time because he's got
Laker tickets.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.480
Alex is always in a hurry.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.800
And as soon as they say
we're clear, you

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.745
get hustled off stage.

00:48:44.745 --> 00:48:47.100
The losers have to sign a piece
of paper accepting their

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.400
consolation prizes.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.540
The winner and Alex get hustled
off to change their

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.640
jacket, different dressing
rooms mind you.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.760
And as soon as you got a new
tie, you come right back on,

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.670
it's like, "on yesterday's
show."

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.770
The real hitch for me was they
tape like three or four months

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.980
in advance.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.160
So if you think about it, that's
not normally awkward.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.250
Somebody can be on the show,
they can either choose whether

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.460
or not to tell their friends
how they did.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.280
And then a few months later,
they have a big viewing party

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.210
and everybody cheers
or whatever.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.580
In my case, my show started
airing while I was still on.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.690
So I had 42 shows in the can
before one even aired--

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:25.796
or 38?

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:26.930
I think 38 shows in
the can before the

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.130
first one even aired.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:33.430
So I was having to keep this
ever more momentous secret.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.600
I was having to fly back
secretly from Salt Lake, where

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.290
we lived, down to LA,
twice a month.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.510
Stay there for 48 hours, win,
as it turned out, 10

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:45.060
"Jeopardy" games at a head.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:45.640
Fly back.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.875
My boss was covering
for me at work.

00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:47.630
She was only one who knew.

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.810
I hadn't told anybody else,
except my wife.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.070
My boss covered for
me at work.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:51.780
I'd fly back.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.480
And she'd tell everybody oh,
Ken's son was sick or Ken is

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.020
painting his basement
or whatever.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.860
If you think like computer
programmers are smart, yeah,

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.570
nobody ever figured it out.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.260
And I'd have to come back to
work the next day and like

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.620
pretend I cared about
the morning

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.870
staff meeting or whatever.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.330
You feel like you have
a secret identity.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.050
You're jetting off to do
something glamorous.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.050
I mean you got to come back to
the Daily Planet and be like,

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.355
Lois, Superman was here?

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.900
I can't believe I
missed it again.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.810
It really did start to become
very confusing.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:29.560
You start to have the Spiderman
problem of all the

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.130
little lies you have to tell.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.890
If your parents call, you have
to pretend you're at home and

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:37.800
not on the 405 driving to Culver
City to do a game show.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.950
And you don't have enough
changes of clothes,

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.590
so what do you do?

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.460
How do you get a sitter for the
kids, if my wife wanted to

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.310
come out and watch a show?

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.270
Do we do even have enough money
in the bank to cover

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.850
like the hotel?

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.910
Because "Jeopardy" does
not cover your travel

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:53.125
arrangements.

00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:56.130
You fly out there on
your own dime.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.780
So yeah, it got logistically,
surprisingly complicated.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.310
And it was a relief when I could
actually sort of tell

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.690
what was going on.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:07.860
I didn't have enough clothes.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.580
I was a computer programmer.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:15.100
Like I don't have like 75
changes of business casual.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.200
Like if I wore the shorts
without the ketchup stain,

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.020
that's like dressing up.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.280
So my brother is a lawyer
and he knew.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.490
He and his wife had been
in the audience on

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.160
the very first game.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.100
So they knew what
was going on.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.300
So I would just borrow-- we're
about the same size.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.980
So he would lend me clothes.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.330
And really, you can rotate the
same cheap, JC Penney's

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.070
clothes, over and over
on "Jeopardy,"

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.040
and nobody ever notices.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.926
That's what I learned.

00:51:37.926 --> 00:51:39.870
I'd like to thank you all
for coming today.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.160
It was a real pleasure.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.360
If you want a book, I'll
be happy to sign

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.500
them, up there I gather.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.750
But, thank you so much.
