00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.580
Now, let's do a quiz on
the overall cache behavior.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.970
Let's assume we have a cache
that is only 256 bytes in size,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.790
with a 32-byte line size, two way set
associative, write back, write allocate.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
Let's say that the processor is
generating 32-bit addresses and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.120
that the bits of the address
are numbered 0 through 31.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.689
So the question for you is the tag
bits are bit what through what?

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.100
The index bits in the address
are what through what?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.540
And the offset bits are which
bit through which bit?
