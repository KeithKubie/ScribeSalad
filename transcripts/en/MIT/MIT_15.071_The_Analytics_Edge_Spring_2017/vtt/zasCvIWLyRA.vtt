00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.970
The process by which
Google determines

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.220
which ads to display
for which queries

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.870
consists of three key steps.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.670
First, Google runs an auction
where advertisers place bids

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.320
for different queries that they
want to display their ads on.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.260
Next, Google uses each
bid in a metric known

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.220
as the Quality Score,
which basically measures

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.980
how well a particular ad
fits a particular query

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.060
to decide a quantity known
as the price-per-click.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.650
Google does this for each
advertiser and each query.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.070
Finally, and this is where
optimization plays a key role,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.080
Google decides how often to
display each ad for each query.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120
This problem, as
we'll see shortly,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
can be formulated as a
linear optimization model.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.010
Let's begin by
thinking about the data

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.530
that we need for this model.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.090
In particular, let's think
about the price-per-click.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.490
So as we just discussed,
Google decides

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.000
each advertiser's
price-per-click.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.470
The price-per-click is
how much each advertiser

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.800
pays Google when a user clicks
on the ad for that query.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.860
Each advertiser also
specifies a budget.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.340
This is the total
amount of money

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.650
that the advertiser
has available to pay

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.750
for all the clicks on their ad.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.320
Every time a user clicks
on the advertiser's ad,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.410
the advertiser's budget is
depleted by the price-per-click

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.510
for that ad for
that user's query.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.410
Let's illustrate this
with a small example.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.700
So suppose that we are Google,
and three of the major wireless

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700
service providers in the United
States -- AT&amp;T, T-Mobile,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.030
and Verizon -- come to us
wanting to place ads on three

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.190
different search queries: query
1, which is "4G LTE"; query 2,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.330
which is the "largest
LTE"; and query 3,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.729
which is "best LTE network".

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.509
If you're not familiar
with these terms,

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.900
4G and LTE basically refer
to different standards

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.700
of high speed wireless
data communication.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.340
The table here shows
the price-per-click

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.979
of each advertiser
in each query.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.970
So for example,
this 10 here means

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.430
that T-Mobile will
pay Google $10

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.450
every time a user
searches for query 1

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.700
and clicks on T-Mobile's
advertisement.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.380
In this example,
T-Mobile's budget is $100.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.100
If T-Mobile begins
advertising and by some point

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.810
five people have
clicked on T-Mobile's ad

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.280
when they search for
"4G LTE", then T-Mobile

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.290
will need to pay five times
$10, or a total of $50.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.150
If T-Mobile's
budget is $100, this

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.660
means that T-Mobile is
left with $100 minus $50,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.040
for a remaining budget of $50.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.320
Now, while the price-per-click
is important to know,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.820
we must remember that the
price-per-click is exactly

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.440
that, the price that
the advertiser pays

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.380
to Google for a single click of
a given ad, on a given query.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.840
This price is paid only if
the user clicks on the ad.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.880
But typically, the people who
use Google search engine, who

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.110
are you and me, will
not click on every ad

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.610
that is shown to them.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.329
Therefore, we need
a way to capture

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.030
how often users click on ads.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.260
This is where the idea
of click-through-rate

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.790
becomes useful.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.610
The click-through-rate
is the probability

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.010
that a user clicks on an
advertiser's ad for a given

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.010
query.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.160
You can also think of this as
the average number of clicks

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.520
that we expect per user.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.900
And this quantity is
defined, as we said,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.160
per advertiser and per query.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.040
So to illustrate this, for the
example that we just introduced

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.680
a few slides ago,
suppose that we

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.230
have the following
click-through-rates.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.580
The number 0.08 here means
that there is an 8% chance

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.310
that a user who searches
for best LTE network

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.140
will click on AT&amp;T's ad
if it is shown to them.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.910
In terms of the number of users
who click on an ad for a given

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.410
query, this means
that for 50 users,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.829
if the click-through-rate
is 0.08,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.580
we expect to see 4 users
clicking on the ad.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.060
Similarly, if there
are a hundred users who

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.340
view the ad and 8% of
them click on the ad,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.040
we expect to see
eight users clicking

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.360
on AT&amp;T's ad for query 3.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.360
In the next video, we'll
define additional data

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.450
that we'll need to
formulate the problem.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.400
In particular, we will see
how the click-through-rate

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.880
and the price-per-click
can be combined together

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.880
to obtain a new quantity called
the average price per display.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.390
This derived quantity
will form a crucial part

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.200
of our linear
optimization model.
