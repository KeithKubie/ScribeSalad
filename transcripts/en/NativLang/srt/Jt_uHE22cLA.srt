1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,510
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,830
you already know that the word language
refers to our ability to communicate

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,670
with speech.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,220
But we saw that what exactly that ability
is turned out to be quite a quagmire.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,300
So now let's turn to the other
thing we mean by language. You know,

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:26,020
the specific languages we
speak with their own words,

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,060
their own grammar and their
own pronunciation. I mean,
English is a language,

8
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:33,850
right? And this is English,

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,590
but so is this. And back in time,

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,820
this was English even further back,

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,960
but we call this English
to wait. I get it.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,080
This is old English and this one is
middle English and this is modern English.

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,130
So are these three languages or three
different stages of the same language?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,410
Uh, but I know history is always
messier than we want it to be.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,600
So let's just stick to the present.
Here are some basic words in English,

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,090
and these are the same words in a
totally different dialect of English.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,160
They're two dialects.

18
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,790
Because if the same language gets spoken
in different ways by different groups

19
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:26,170
of people, we call those
different dialects. Moving on,

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,520
let's translate those words into
Norwegian. The Norwegian language,

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,990
and here's how we would write
those same words in Swedish,

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,490
the Swedish language,

23
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,510
so Swedish and Norwegian
are different languages,

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,220
but British and Scottish are different
dialects of the same language.

25
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,850
Where's the line between a
dialect and a language anyway?

26
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,060
Is it just arbitrary or conventional?

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,080
Maybe in the end it really
is buttoned up by a phrase.

28
00:01:56,081 --> 00:02:01,081
Max Vine ride passed along during the
lecture series he gave in the 1940s a

29
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:06,340
member of his audience made the witty
remark a language is a dialect with an

30
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,070
army and a navy if that's so,

31
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,270
it's about politics and power just
as much as it's about grammar,

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,580
language versus languages,
languages versus dialects.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Oh, what a mess I've dragged
you into. And with that,

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,760
I welcome you to my youtube channel.
Subscribe if you want to learn more,

35
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,500
because from the looks of it,

36
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,140
we've seriously got some
stuff to sort out together.
