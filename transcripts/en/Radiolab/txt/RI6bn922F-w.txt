Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. Okay, so Robert, here's the question that I've been puzzling over, uh, for a long time. All right. Okay. What is the fruitiest fruit that you know, my fruitiest fruit is a plum. Well, no, I mean that, well that's yours and I'm not, I don't want to take that away from you. No, you shouldn't. But when you ask most people that question, they say apple or orange. No, I mean it's true. Scientists have figured out that when you make a category in your mind, you're not doing it based on like a set list of traits. You're like you. What you do is you call to mind the prototypical example of that category and then you measure this new thing against it. And for fruits, prototype is the gala. Apple. If you ask me the red, shiny, waxy apple, you say there's somebody who's decided that an apple is the fruity fruit. They've, they've done experiments, we've done experiments. You'd bananas out poll apples for consumption. Maybe that's not what makes a fruitiest fruit of fruity fruit. It's a more about like how well it represents the category. That's what it's about. Are we talking about this though? Well, because I'd been wanting to explore this in story form forever. Forever. But you never have a story so it's like a, you never find a story, but I got one now. You did what? It's not about fruit though. What is it about? It's about this.

Speaker 2:          01:22          What is the, what are you talking about? Let me explain. Hey.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Okay, so we met this Guy Andrew Morantz. I work at the New Yorker as an editor and I write stuff occasionally wandered in here one day by mistake I think. Super interesting guy, great reporter. And he ended up talking with us about this story. He was reporting for the New Yorker, but hip hop, there are all kinds of rappers who are trying to sing and how hip hop might be changing because as we all know, this was a genre of music that began really specific time and place. Bronx, seventies black and Latino kids. But it's since expanded so much.

Speaker 3:          01:59          The DS, inevitable questions pop up, you know, to really simplify it. The more white people come to the party, the more you kind of start going, okay, at what point is it? It's clearly a, it can clearly, it's clearly okay if everyone in the room is black and it's okay if everyone is black except for one guy. You know, if Rick Rubin's at the party, but it's still, you know, black people at the tunnel in 1989 or whatever, it's still okay, but at what point, okay, we have fits 50% white if it's 75% white, if all the people who own the record labels are white, if a majority of the popular rappers are white, like at what point, and that's just the racial thing. Then there's also that sonically, the way it sounds, there's the way the production is kind of merged with other forms of music. So then all of a sudden you're at a point where you get the sense that there is somehow inherently that there's something being replaced or taken over. You start to have this dilemma,

Speaker 1:          02:53          which is, you know, who owns the music now?

Speaker 3:          02:56          And the dilemma is obviously heightened by the fact everyone knew this was coming like it. There's never been a form of American popular music as far as I know that wasn't invented by black people and corrupted by white people and Andrew in his piece and in this story a focuses on a guy who sits right at the heart of that dilemma. One of the most influential Djs in hip hop today, Peter Rosenberg is his name. Yeah. Yeah. So tell me, tell me how you came to him. I mean the first thing was the most important hip hop radio station in the world listening to hot 97 because I like rap and I want to know what is popular. And I was listening and I heard this guy who they kept calling Rosenberg and I was like, is that Rosenberg? Is that like Whoopi Goldberg Rosenberg? Like what does that mean? And then I looked him up and I was like, no, it's just a guy named Peter Rosenberg. One, two, one two, one two, one, two. I mean listen, doing NPR is already pretty soft. You know what I'm saying? He actually works just down the block from us. This is going to hurt your credit and some you know, positively. So He's a guy. I'm born in 1979 he grew up in, I grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

Speaker 3:          04:11          The C h. Yes it is. Peter says when he was about nine, his brother, my brother's name is Nick Rosenberg, his brother started staying up late and making tape,

Speaker 4:          04:19          DJ, DJ red alert Marley Marl. He would start taping those guys on the radio

Speaker 3:          04:25          boy, 1987 98 and here in New York they were the only two people playing hip hop and it was late at night

Speaker 4:          04:30          and at the time I didn't consider myself a music person. I was only eight, but I really was like, oh, music's okay, but I'm really, I just obsessed with sports and then at some point I was like, oh no, no, I love this. It was punk. It was rebellious. It was interesting. It was just cool. You know now too, to be honest, it's almost cliched when people say that, like, who would ever guess you'd be into hip hop? I'm like, I don't know I would because I know a million white kids who are into hip hop. At that time though it was not common. It was very much something that was a badge of honor for both of us that we really, really loved it. And I was extra cool cause I was super young. I remember one day, here's a great thing I traded Javan my poison tape.

Speaker 4:          05:19          I had poisons album on tape. Every rose has a store, an album. I traded that poison tape for his Bismarck key thing. I was like this is the best trade ever. It was business going off like it's a classic album. And then, and then at some point my dad went out, he was coming home from work one day and he said he stopped at, nobody beats the Wiz. He asked the guy behind the counter what like the good rap albums where and the kid actually gave him a pretty good recommendation and he bought me a tape called girls. I got him locked by Super Lover C and

Speaker 5:          05:58          Cason override.

Speaker 4:          05:59          Oh am I going to make a jump sit through my beat. On a one minute father you have, I know he told me you're stupid until you entertain. Of course the new [inaudible] plus a super in rocky point without doing the chains.

Speaker 5:          06:10          So my knowledge base was always very high, very early. I had some friends in elementary school and we would talk about rap a little bit but quickly I exceeded them

Speaker 4:          06:21          and then I got to high school and I really took seriously being the rap guy. When I heard the passion in public enemy like that resonated with me. Like I say, NWA scared me,

Speaker 5:          06:43          made me interested. I just thought this is crazy. I was like, Yo, these guys are killing people. Like this is really happening. I was really happening. Are you going to the movies in song form? I was going to the movies but to me I didn't know the lines.

Speaker 4:          06:58          Chemistry.

Speaker 5:          07:01          Okay. So Peter goes off to college, mid nineties did college radio, hip hop show and then as he gets out decides he wants to do this for real. He secretly, you know, wanted to be a hip hop DJ but people were not taking him seriously. You know, white kid from the suburbs didn't compute. He couldn't get on what was then called urban radio. So I ended up doing a year on the Howard stern station and he was doing like talk radio, you know, HFS, which I was part time, whatever kind of radio. So he kept calling hot 97 and the program director then was a white guy from Utah. I gave him my schpeel. I was like, I'm super passionate about hip hop. I'm super honest. I don't think there's ever been someone who looks like me and is from my background who has his honest and loud voices. Me. I, I really think I'll be something different. And he basically said, I don't doubt you, but no, what are you talking about? I mean they had token white people on various shows, but it was either your super white, like Lisa g, she was on the morning show for a little while. I remember that she was super white and that was kind of the joke. Or you are Bobby Konders

Speaker 4:          08:03          who does the Sunday night radio reggae show who you would never know if his wife busted me. Feminine love of kindness, Java, the whole [inaudible], Kingston, Jamaica Duffel flex because he just talks like he's Jamaican and he only plays to make music. He only hangs out with your making. People

Speaker 5:          08:16          would be one of those two things where you denied your whiteness or you just were like, I'm going to, I'm going to be the butt of the joke. White bosses have often been like, you're really talented, but I don't know. When people really like you like we don't, they talk to me the way we're talking right now and think if I'm able to relate to you this way, why would our audience relate to you? If I say yes, then why would my audience say yes with me? Because, because they assume their audience is so different than them, which might've been true for a while and then 2007 Ebro Darden took over Ebro Darden in the building. What's up man? How you doing sir? I'm doing great man. This is him on air. Ebro, half

Speaker 3:          08:56          black, half Jewish guy from Oakland and he got it. Did hip hop had changed? It's no longer so small and simple and provincial that we can go on pretending this is only a black and Latino thing. So when Peter came to the station and gave him the pitch, Hey I'm PMD, which was my old name back then, cause I'm P P for Peter and MD from Maryland. You can call me PMD and Ebro was like, no, you're Rosenberg. Ebro gave me my parents name. I'm more or less,

Speaker 4:          09:20          he was like the the hook is that, that's your name. Hot 97 Peter Rosenberg and summer jam 2007 there's a video on, on youtube of a, it's called Eddie [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          09:29          Peter Rosenberg does summer jam 2007 and it was my first day on the job. Summer Jam is the biggest event of the year at hot 97 it's this big show at giant stadium. All the top acts I showed up there. And so my first day was just walking in a giant stadium, parking my car by myself, getting the backstage pass and being given a mic flag that says hot 97 the place I've always wanted to work and being told, go up to all the famous artists who are here and just getting into it.

Speaker 4:          09:58          Got It. Hat run. And if you go back and watch that video and see how much of an ass I make of myself, I say to t I think I go, is this your first summer jam for CIA? Have you done a summer down before? And he looks at whoever he's with and they both start laughing. I'm asking, have you done many summer jams? Today's your first day on the job. My first day on the job you pack it sail and I cannot believe in retrospect. I survived to this day for the sounds in Rosenberg show with Kay Fox on hot 97

Speaker 3:          10:31          not only survived, he became the host of two shows on hot 97 a late night underground show and also the big weekday morning show and Rosenberg's brand is all about realness.

Speaker 4:          10:42          So the realness, his segment in the morning is called the realness is late night show, Sunday night to Monday morning. Wait, it's called real late with Peter Rosenberg. It's all real, real, real. It's going to be real. Really Real. Keeping it real. Is it real? Because that's the, that's the central question. Can I be a real hip hop guy

Speaker 3:          11:04          even though I'm Peter Rosenberg from suburban Maryland? I think you're, I think you're raising an interesting point. Most outsiders rarely become insiders. The Peter says the key to understanding him is that he's kind of both. Like on the one hand he is this suburban white kid from Maryland. He doesn't pretend to be anything but, but on the other hand, I mean a big part of Rosenberg's job is to go to shows and blogs and get tapes from people and find the new thing. So he has a stable of like 20 or 30 underground artists who are making tapes and you know, trying to pass around beats and what's more in salary than that. Plus he is like a purist.

Speaker 4:          11:43          I've always liked there's a certain pure form of hip hop. And because you know in the kind of rap nerd community they talk about certain things that are like lyrics and listening

Speaker 1:          11:54          for the metaphors and the intricacies of the music. They talk about boom bap beats, you'll get in the trade up. That'll be big sounding. Drum wise. It's boom bap like of kicks it off yet original raps. It's just a feeling of sound of energy. This is Ali,

Speaker 5:          12:14          Ali Shaheed Muhammad, a tribe called [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:19          We called him up because he is the DJ and producer for a tribe called quest and for Peter tribe they're the prototype. I was obsessed with them. They were, they are like that shiny red apple. They defined the category and in fact I guess up until my wedding weekend, best weekend of his life he says, or I guess now it would be his second best was when he was, I was 14 you went to a tribe show. It was

Speaker 5:          12:42          everything I ever dreamed a hip hop concert experience would be. He says he spent the whole time at the front of the stage waving this hat around that said dog's d a w g S. Cause one of the lead rappers is named fife dog and I held up my dog's hat so much at the concert that eventually fife the five the five dog acknowledged me the same way I would do now if I was hosting and someone kept doing it. He just gave me the hand like I got it. You can put the hat down on that.

Speaker 1:          13:13          This was a weird moment for hip hop, not just for Peter but for hip hop in general, like the early nineties this was a moment when you had stations like hot 97 converting to all hip hop formats, playing, you know, NWA, public enemy tribe called quest groups, you know that were suddenly attracting loads of white suburban fans. Yet if you listen to their lyrics, nope, everybody for bottom line, some of them at least they were about stuff. Those fans could have never experienced

Speaker 6:          13:39          struggle, depression, lack of opportunities in the ghettos. The fact that you have young black teenagers who are living in a society where they're told that they will never amount to anything and that their lives have no value, no worth. That to me becomes the, the angsty and the frustration and the rage, which is the embodiment of the music. Music.

Speaker 5:          14:08          I wanted to be a part of this of black culture. Like I felt, I, I, I've always been very interested in loving things that required defense. And Hip hop is definitely that from the beginning. It was initially shunned by black radio because it was thought being decent. Then you had the whole Tipper Gore thing. I love things like that. I don't know why. And I think I do always see hip hop in that sort of light in the way that it needs defense. Can we talk about, um, your, your frack is with, um, Nikki Minaj? Of course. That's my paragraph two. If, God forbid I drop dead tomorrow, it's Peter Rosenberg is on holiday seven involve law. The next paragraph in 2012, Nicki Minaj,

Speaker 3:          14:52          um, is this rapper from Queens, hugely talented rapper. She, she's not the one on American idol, is she? Oh, okay. Now I have a face for the name. [inaudible] and she kind of blew everyone away on this Kanya song called monster. You know, she was with all these big rappers and Jay z was on the song and she blew everyone out of the water. Those things each year, the number start blocking called t cause that's what I thought. She was really good. I thought she was a natural and a beautiful, like I thought she was a total package.

Speaker 3:          15:33          In fact, the year before it all happened, 2011 I pulled her aside at summer jam and I said, Hey, I think you could be the greatest female artist of all time, the greatest female rap artists of all time. And I just want you to know that in thinking that I'm going to hold you to a high standard. So I probably will say things about you. You said all of that. Yeah, in a really quick moment too. It was really brief. She probably would even remember it, but it happened. We'd remember that if someone said that, I said, I think you could be the greatest. She had all this underground credit. Right? And, and then how did she spend that credit? Well, she started making poppier and poppier records culminating in the following song, which if you are me, you've not been able to get out of your head for a week. And she made this song called starships, let's go to the beach, let's go get away. Starships is a blatant pop song. Lowest common denominators. I didn't, I didn't like the song you listened to that song and you cannot tell that it's not a song by Katie Perry or pink or it could be anyone

Speaker 2:          16:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:46          so all of a sudden who is the underground cred cop? SciFest sounds in Rosenberg show, but Peter Rosenberg and I know for a second several mornings for his segment called the realness. He would get on there and play. I play a clip of starship, check out this hip hop.

Speaker 2:          17:04          Oh

Speaker 3:          17:09          that's hardcore hip hop. That would this song be considered another hardcore hip hop song?

Speaker 2:          17:19          No, stop it.

Speaker 3:          17:21          That's not fair. That's not fair. Maybe she's just, you know, there is a real question being asked at the center of this, which is what is this music? Where are the boundaries are and also is this where hip hop is going? Is it just let me cash in and just follow the trends of what white music is doing? It would be too strong to call it like you felt betrayed as a, as a music fan. Yeah. It felt like, come on we I it just in the moment it felt like you're, you're a hip hop star. Why would you, why would you do

Speaker 4:          17:50          this? This is a, and this is not for us. When core hip hop artists make pop songs, it upsets me because it's, it can be a moment that blurs and messes up hip hop. To be frank, this song right here, starship is literally one of the most sellout songs in hip hop history.

Speaker 7:          18:14          Just to put that comment in a little tiny bit more context for just a second. Now we mentioned of course the history, right? That so many forms of popular music had been invented by black people opted by white people, Jazz, blues, Rock. We all know the store. No. According to Frannie Kelly, one of the hosts of a podcast called microphone check, which is a hip hop podcast kind of NPR music according to her 2013, was the first year that no black artists had a number one song. And since 1958 since they started the hot 100 charts, this is the first year where no black artists have made it to number one. Now this may be a blip, may not be, but what's clear is that there is a new force in town, a style of music called e. D m BDM is, is uh, a meaningless acronym that stands for electronic dance music. And it's like, you know, more like speech than a bap

Speaker 3:          19:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          19:07          It's sort of an amalgam of Synthy Dancy, techno, euro poppy stuff. And it has taken over. What happened with EDM was just so glaring and fast. And then to see that sort of start to creep into hip hop was scary for people because according to Frantic Kelly would scary. Is it? EDM is a style of music that's meant to work on any dance floor with any crowd. So in a way it's like a music without history on purpose. A lot of the criticism of like EDM is that it is all about money. It is the corporatization of genre with a long history. So in some ways I think the root of the protest is don't sell our stuff to the highest better.

Speaker 3:          19:48          So a little context. So anyhow, after one of the most sellout songs in hip hop history, listen to it. After Peter Trash talks, Nicki Minaj to star ships, we arrive at that year's summer jam 2012 and that year Nikki Minaj was going to be one of the big headliners plan was for her to perform on the main stage inside giant stadium. But outside the stadium in the parking lot earlier in the day there was the festival stage, which is where the underground backpack kids hang out and that's Rosenberg's zone. So he's introducing the acts on that stage.

Speaker 4:          20:21          Now hold on, before I get to the real hip hop of the day, cause I see the real hip hop heads sprinkled in here. I see him. I said, in trying to hype up this crowd, I know there's some chicks here waiting to single star ships later. I'm not talking to y'all right now. That bull crap. I know it goes Ooh. And she a little bit like there's a cheer. Nothing crazy though. Just irregular cheer. It's not like I didn't, a bomb was dropped.

Speaker 5:          20:49          I forgot that

Speaker 3:          20:52          not only was the festival stage live streaming, but it was live streaming on her website and her core fans, her barbs as they're known, are 13 year old girls. And when they see Peter say that they go wild and they go out on the Internet saying, Oh, who is this Rosenberg guy? What is his deal? And he says, within minutes it got back to Nicki and her people before she went on stage, before she went on stage. This is interesting. So then there's this backstage conversation, Rosenberg. Basically, as soon as he gets off stage, his boss, my boss comes out, pokes his head around the curtain and goes, did you say something about Nicki Minaj? I was like, ah. And I, I legit didn't remember. I'm like, Oh yeah, I did.

Speaker 5:          21:36          And he's like, yeah, well she just canceled the show so she's not coming. And I was like, I was like, oh. And I looked at my phone and I go to Twitter sitting on the stage, the crowd's all out there. I'm at giant stadium and I look on Twitter and I go to trends and on the main trend page it just says Peter Rosenberg and I was like, oh wow, this is nuts. It is a Sunday afternoon at like five o'clock. And I was like the third most trending right,

Speaker 3:          22:07          being in the world [inaudible] I was just watching my name get bigger in a moment. 97 CJ, Peter Rosenberg, one of the big dramas that happen in New York. I was reading just my name over and over and over again. The dual roles and Vernon dual from high 37 Peter Rosenberg. All these people saying, I don't know who this guy is, but he's dissing my favorite artists. I'm just really disappointed and I don't understand how she, I was reading, who is this guy? What he said, starship songs not hitting out here Rosenberg. Man That's not real hip hop. He was the one man say one thing and everybody stopped was four then he must've gotten some serious credit from this. He, yes. Not only was his name getting out there, but it was getting out there as I'm the gatekeeper. I'm the defender. I'm the defender of the real,

Speaker 5:          22:55          the realness. I couldn't appreciate it at first because I didn't know if I was maybe going to get fired for messing up summer jam because Nikki's ain't beefing with the station. Yeah, come on. Your state will even say something to my, she's calling in, you know,

Speaker 3:          23:08          mad at the station of apologizing. Nikki Busta rhymes gets involved trying to broker a deal on master flex gets involved, change some emails. They're trying to reach a day time now it becomes a month long process. That's

Speaker 5:          23:20          nuts. If they say unanimously, no, you were wrong about that song. This is our song. We included in our map of what's going on. Stop trying to draw the map. What do you say to that in your inside of you? I think my gut reaction is you know nothing. You don't draw the map, you need people like us to draw the map or there's nothing or what is there if if we don't get to determine certain things, who, who does, we should leave that to the crazy 13 year olds who may not even like this artist and two years as well

Speaker 7:          23:56          woman hearing that. It's to Kelly again, this idea that young girls will hear starships and say, oh that's hip hop. That's what I want to hear. That's what I'm going to judge everything against is wildly unfair to the intelligence of young girls. Freddie says they can figure out the difference between hip hop and pop. They don't need help. It's insulting. And furthermore, when he chose starships to single out, it felt revealing of another layer to this debate that people weren't saying out loud, which is when people refer to things as quote real hip hop, that's usually code for aggressive street, masculine, authentic. Whereas when they say pop, that's usually code for feminine, which is a perversion of the music period. And so there is this idea that, you know, people make songs for the ladies, which implies that all the rest of them are songs that we can't hear or God forbid understand.

Speaker 5:          24:52          Okay. So all of this was swirling around months go by and then fast forward to the week before the next summer jam. This is 2014, 2013 in 2013. Yeah, the food is still going at this point. It's a year later. But going to Andrew, Nikki decides it's time to settle, maybe because she wanted to perform it that year. Summer jam or so.

Speaker 7:          25:11          Nicki Minaj sits down with radio station hot 97 to clear the air with DJ Peter Rosenberg. She comes to the station

Speaker 5:          25:20          summer jam to make her peace and they do this whole interview with Rosenberg and Nicki Minaj and Ebro the boss is moderating on the air on the air. Rosenberg. So this is all you sir. Um, where would you like this interview to go?

Speaker 8:          25:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          25:35          um, I dunno, I'm excited. I'm excited to see Nikki because uh, it's very odd to have someone that you don't know very well, who's become like such a fixture in your life. Like I've always wondered, I was always like, I wonder if Nikki knows that she's come up every day in my life for 350 days, like point that where starships got played on my wedding and it was like the biggest deal at my wedding was starships playing at my wedding after some opening remarks, Peter basically apologizes. I am sorry that things went as left as they did. I never had ill feelings about you as a human being ever basically says, I have nothing against you as a person beyond my sort of distaste for that song.

Speaker 8:          26:12          That's cool. It's one onto the branch. Do you mean that? Yeah, I mean she then goes out of her way to apologize to her fans for skipping out on the Gig. But um, then the gloves come off. You know what? Like I get it. Like that's what you do, I guess. To me, I just don't know your resume. You know what I'm saying? So I never found you funny. I never found you entertaining. I never found you smart. I just found you annoying because you know I grew up in New York. I've grown up on hot 97 like I know Angie and I know flex and Mr c and all these people, whether they like me or whether or not we get along, I just know their resume. But like with you, I was just like, who are you [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          26:58          I don't recognize you as an authority on what's authentic

Speaker 8:          27:00          to me. You don't have enough of a resume to make those comments. Who are you to tell me what to do? What people don't understand is that when I came, when I was doing this, I took a lot from people from men.

Speaker 5:          27:15          She was like my whole career, they've just been random men who have like been in a position to stop me and tell me why I'm not good enough.

Speaker 8:          27:23          I just did. I just don't want a lot of stuff from guys.

Speaker 5:          27:26          And here you are. I don't know you. You're just some random man. And then Ebro jumps in and kind of jokingly trying to lighten the mood goes and you white. I didn't even say that. I never should ever implied anything about white. She plugged them and then she jumps in and goes, no, no, no. That too.

Speaker 8:          27:42          Being white also struck a chord with me if I'm being honest, because I was like, Yo, he's on a black station dissing black people. Like I don't, I don't. I just didn't like the feel of it.

Speaker 1:          27:57          Did you get back to that idea, that category idea that like when you don't have that like set list of criteria to help you figure out who's in and who's out. It's all about a gut feeling into Nicki Minaj that moment have a white guy from the suburbs tell her a black woman from Queens that she's not hip hop enough.

Speaker 6:          28:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          28:16          just felt wrong. But then Ali Shahi Muhammad from tribe called quest, put it this way, maybe it feels wrong, but maybe this is actually evolution.

Speaker 6:          28:23          40 years into it, that's what it's supposed to be. At some point we're all going to be so far removed from the origin that no one would then qualify really. But if you're going to be the person to carry the torch, I guess so be the gatekeeper and at some point what qualifies you? It's your heart miss that feeling. You could be Bill Gates kid is still understand the struggle enough to be like, Yo, I'm riding with that. Yeah and I want to fight for that.

Speaker 8:          28:54          I was like, Yo, he's on a black station. Distinct black people. Like I don't, I don't, I just didn't like the feel of it.

Speaker 5:          29:03          Who am I going to dis if not black people. I'm on a hip hop station. I have to just blind people sometimes I if I just wipe up slowly. Now you watch your mouth, sir. You only want me to go with Mac Miller. I mean who am I going to do Macklemore's am actually plenty of artists now. I used to only just white rappers, but as I've gotten further along, I felt I earned the right to dis all things I didn't like. I was like, no, we can wait. Rosenberg to this day takes credit for her summer jam saying my next project is going to be a US hardcore hip hop album. When her album's awesome, you will see me take lots of credit for it. Absolutely. She called me the other day and I was half asleep and she's like, hello, I know you're thinking, why is this bitch calling me?

Speaker 5:          29:52          And I was like not at all what's going on? And she wanted to ask me about her new song and the amazing thing was she wanted to ask me an opinion on something and it makes me feel ultimately super special. So we s Peter Legs. So what does that mean? Like if you are now a gatekeeper, you white guy from suburban Maryland. I am very commercial radio station. What does that mean for hip hop? Does that mean that hip hop has by default been co-opted? Cause like here you are. I don't know. I mean I feel like hip hop is in a better place now than before I started doing this. I would break it down on paper and go, let me tell you where we were when I started my underground show in 2007. And let me tell you where I think we are in 2014 and let me show you how many of those artists I broke in support it and worked hard with and talked to the label about and pushed and how many I had an involvement with. I think you'd see a really high percentage. So that was part of his answer. We asked Andrew the same question. It's complicated. I mean, I, look, I, I don't think that hip hop is dead. There was some quote, um, Frank Zappa I think said jazz isn't dead. It just smells funny.

Speaker 5:          30:53          Like, I don't think hip hop is wonderful. Yeah. I mean, that's should be our title up. Isn't that funny? But I do think, I think hip hop isn't dead. It just smells funny. It would always smells a little funky.

Speaker 9:          31:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          31:18          huge thanks to Andrew Moranz, uh, and the New Yorker magazine for letting us borrow Andrew for a beat. Definitely check out his story in, uh, The New Yorker magazine. It's called an old school. It's a great story. It goes into way more detail than we can get into here. Also, big thanks to Frannie Kelly and Alicia, Ede Muhammad, uh, who together they cohost the NPR podcast. Microphone check and a well, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. Thank you for listening. Oh, and before we go, just one last thing. So lest you think that like hip hop has arrived at this new, um,

Speaker 5:          31:53          like quote, post racial situation, which, you know, we for a second we were like, maybe we're just thinking out loud with Peter. He was like, no way. No. Got It. If there's one thing I could demand that air during this piece, it would be this statement right here. Nothing has driven me more crazy over the course of my time in hip hop than white people who come up to me and go, you know, and it used to be really bad when he first came out. You know, m and m is just so talented. I don't even listen to hip hop, but M&M I mean, now he's good. Well, if you don't listen to hip hop, why the hell should I care? What your thoughts on m and m are and how do you know that he's good? No, you know that he's white. You know that he's white and is M&M Good?

Speaker 5:          32:40          Yes. It just so happens that he's as good as you as you're guessing he is. But that's random. You don't even know that m and m could be any, could've been one of the dudes for Milli Vanilli and you would've thought it was great and that drives me nuts. And so anytime I think about, oh, we're post racial, just look at what m and m concerts look like and what the sales look like. And you can be instantly reminded that even though m and m has no experience that average suburban white America could ever identify with, I mean culturally, the experience he went through is much more common with someone who went with, went through a black struggle than any sort of regular white suburban life. And this is the guy who came up in a rough situation in a million ways, um, was the odd man out all the time, never had anything, and then makes it, and all of a sudden the fact that people like, oh, I so identify with him.

Speaker 5:          33:30          What is it? Why do I identify with a guy who's from a trailer park? I'm from a history of drug abuse, who raps about things that I'd be terrified of if a black man was saying it. But I identify with him so much. And then m and m cause he's amazing raps about this same thing. He does a song called Dear White America. Ray tells them, you're an idiot. You let your kids listen to me, but you wouldn't let them listen to anyone else just because I'm white. You're an idiot. And they love it. It's unbelievable. Okay.
