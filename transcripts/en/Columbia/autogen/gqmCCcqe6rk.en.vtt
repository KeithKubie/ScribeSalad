devoted people and very interesting so I
 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.500
devoted people and very interesting so I
wanted to sort of figure out when I was

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510
wanted to sort of figure out when I was
 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.910

quantitative in the sense that there
 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.709
quantitative in the sense that there
were a lot of survey research so I mean

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719
were a lot of survey research so I mean
 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:08.910
were a lot of survey research so I mean

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
and find them by surveying then it
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.639
and find them by surveying then it
wasn't very clear since everyone assumes

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649
wasn't very clear since everyone assumes
 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.889
wasn't very clear since everyone assumes
that they're individualists that they

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899
that they're individualists that they
 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.020
that they're individualists that they
don't go participate in groups that they

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030
don't go participate in groups that they
 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.940
don't go participate in groups that they
don't have a certain kind of shared life

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950
don't have a certain kind of shared life
 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.080
don't have a certain kind of shared life
together so I had the opportunity in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090
together so I had the opportunity in
 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.349
together so I had the opportunity in
Cambridge to actually go out and figure

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359
Cambridge to actually go out and figure
 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.120
Cambridge to actually go out and figure
out whether or not this was right and I

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130
out whether or not this was right and I
 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.739
out whether or not this was right and I
decided that actually probably wasn't

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749
decided that actually probably wasn't
 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.569
decided that actually probably wasn't
because sociologists and religious

taught that we don't usually think of
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.700
taught that we don't usually think of
this as stuff that people just sort of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
this as stuff that people just sort of
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.870
this as stuff that people just sort of
experience without some kind of social

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880

so so in cambridge i went and i
 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520
so so in cambridge i went and i
discovered actually that many of the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530
discovered actually that many of the
 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.410
discovered actually that many of the
people who are spiritual not religious

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420
people who are spiritual not religious
 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.260
people who are spiritual not religious

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.169
are in fact you know very involved in
all kinds of group practices or are

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179
all kinds of group practices or are

all kinds of group practices or are
there partaking in certain kinds of

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819
there partaking in certain kinds of
 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.100
there partaking in certain kinds of
classes and so on where they actually

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110
classes and so on where they actually
 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.800
classes and so on where they actually
are learning to be spiritual so they

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
are learning to be spiritual so they
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.619
are learning to be spiritual so they
also learned to say that they aren't

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629
also learned to say that they aren't
 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.230
also learned to say that they aren't
learning

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240
learning
 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600
learning
they actually learn to say that their

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
they actually learn to say that their
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.950
they actually learn to say that their
individualists and they're following

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960
individualists and they're following
 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.810
individualists and they're following
their own path so it's really hard

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
their own path so it's really hard
 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.250
their own path so it's really hard
sometimes actually through interviews

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
sometimes actually through interviews
 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.030
sometimes actually through interviews
alone or through it are through I'm

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
alone or through it are through I'm
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
alone or through it are through I'm
surveys to actually understand where the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
surveys to actually understand where the
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.870

sort of social support for these kinds

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880

of spiritual identities are being
 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.840
of spiritual identities are being
developed and that's what ethnography

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
developed and that's what ethnography
 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.550
developed and that's what ethnography
actually allowed me to do to say okay

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
actually allowed me to do to say okay
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.510
actually allowed me to do to say okay

about prosperity and all of these things
so that's what the project was and i

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
so that's what the project was and i
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.620
so that's what the project was and i
think it was actually quite a timely

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630
think it was actually quite a timely
 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.960
think it was actually quite a timely
project in the sense that then while i

was doing the research there was in this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
was doing the research there was in this

was doing the research there was in this
ethnographic way there was a body of

ethnographic way there was a body of
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.260
ethnographic way there was a body of
research that was also building on the

research that was also building on the
 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.910
