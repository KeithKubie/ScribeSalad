00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.766
We are now entering into 1942.

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.962
And just a reminder -

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:08.936
It´s been a little over two years 
since the beginning of WW II in Europe

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:11.362
when the Nazis invaded Poland.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.387
And even before that,
as early as 1937,

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:18.492
you´ve had all-out war
between the Chinese and the Japanese.

00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:21.388
And even before that
you´ve had conflicts

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:26.054
since the Japanese invasion
of Manchuria in 1931.

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:28.374
So Asia has been in conflict
for some time.

00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:34.110
But as we go into 1942, the United States
has just entered into World War II.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.020
You might remember -

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.631
December 1941,
Japan goes on a major offensive,

00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.607
tries to knock out
the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor,

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:45.297
attacks Wake Island, attacks Guam,
attacks Hong Kong,

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:47.467
the Philippines, Singapore,
Malaya.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.964
Then shortly thereafter
goes after other possessions,

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:54.100
Burma, goes after
the Dutch-East Indies

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.171
in its quest
for natural resources.

00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.747
And so you can imagine
as we go into 1942,

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.950
the Americans are
eager to retaliate.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.929
And in these videos

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.152
- these are overview videos,

00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:07.073
I cannot talk about
every action and battle that happens.

00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:09.298
I`m just trying 
to give you the hightlights -

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:18.400
But the first notable
action in 1942 is the Doolittle Raid.

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:23.677
Named after Colonel Doolittle,
who is the architect of this raid.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.271
The idea is not so much
as a strategic victory

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:27.834
but more of a psychological one.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:31.049
If the U.S. could somehow
attack the mainland of Japan,

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.548
bomb the mainland of Japan,

00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:36.022
it would be
a huge morale booster for the Americans,

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:41.061
and it might cause the Japanese people
to question their own leadership.

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.190
And so the idea is 
sent a carrier within bomber range

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.785
roughly 1000 miles
of the coast of Japan

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.976
- and I tried to do research
on where they went

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:49.835
but I wasn`t able to find -

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:52.325
but roughly 1000 miles
of the coast of Japan

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:59.932
and then send 16 B-25 bombers
to bomb the mainland.

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.461
And they are actually able
to do this.

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:06.263
15 of the bombers, since they
can`t land back onto the carrier,

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:08.407
they are to heavy and to large
to do that,

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:12.093
they land in China

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:18.237
and one of them gets diverted
to Russia or the Soviet Union.

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.690
And out of the 80 crewman
all of planes get lost

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.793
but out of the 80 crewman

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:26.098
three are killed in action,
eight are captured,

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:30.925
and three are killed in captivity 
by the Japanese.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.730
But for the most part
a hugely successful operation.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.849
Only months after Pearl Harbor,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.295
the U.S. is able
to attack the Japanese mainland.

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:39.413
Once again,

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:41.716
more of a psychological victory
then a strategic one,

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:48.258
but a major psychological accomplishment
from the ally point of view.

00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:50.571
This was in April,

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.969
then you can fast forward to May,

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.731
where you have 
the first major naval engagement

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.038
between the
Japanese and the American navy.

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.031
And that happens 
at the Battle of Coral Sea,

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.715
or the Battle of the Coral Sea,

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:10.379
which occurs 
roughly over there.

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:19.152
And this is significant because
the U.S. loses more than the Japanese do,

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:22.822
but it is able to cripple
the Japanese navy enough

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:24.855
that as they go 
into the next major offensive,

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.822
they don´t have quite
the firepower that they need.

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:35.929
And that next major offensive
happens in June at Midway.

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:46.820
In June you have
the Battle of Midway.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.684
At the Battle of Midway
this is a Japanese offensive.

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:53.031
Their goal is to further knock
out the United States.

00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:56.422
But it ends up going the other way.

00:03:56.722 --> 00:03:59.443
And this is considered a big deal.

00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:01.995
This is the first Japanese naval loss

00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:06.639
since
the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits in 1863.

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:11.334
You have a U.S. victory here.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:17.191
Many historians consider this
one of the most significant naval battles.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.500
We have a U.S. victory here.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.020
Once again,
it´s only seven months since Pearl Harbor.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.171
You have Coral Sea
which cripples the Japanese navy.

00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:31.736
- maybe cripple is a strong word
but tears them down a little bit -

00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:35.359
Then you have Midway
which is a major U.S. victory.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:42.644
And then that takes us to August
where you have the Battle of Guadalcanal.

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:50.591
There are several islands over here,
the U.S. want to take it,

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.150
the Japanese want to retake it.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.437
But between the on-the-ground forces
and the naval forces,

00:04:55.437 --> 00:05:01.353
the U.S. is able to defeat the Japanese
and keep them from taking Guadalcanal.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:06.876
This is a big deal because
between Midway and Guadalcanal in 1942,

00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:08.399
this is the turning point.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.610
And after this point,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.969
Midway, 
the Japanese were on the offensive here,

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.449
the Japanese tried to get the U.S.
out of Guadalcanal in August.

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:21.102
But in both of those the U.S. are able
to defeat the Japanese at Midway,

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:24.008
they are able
to fend them off at Guadalcanal.

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:29.276
This is the turning point
where the U.S. is able to go on the offensive.

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:32.311
1942 is a very big deal.

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:35.872
It´s only months after Pearl Harbor,
months after the U.S. enters the war

00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:38.453
but it´s able to start turning the tide,

00:05:38.453 --> 00:05:42.228
and start to go on the offensive
against the Japanese in the Pacific.

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:43.857
And what we´ll see
in the next video

00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:48.700
is 1942 also marks
the turning of the tide in Europe.
