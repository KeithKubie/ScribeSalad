00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:03.266
- [Instructor] Let's now tackle part C

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.981
which tells us, for T is less than 10,

00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:08.317
an alternate model for
the internal temperature

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:10.988
of the potato at time T minutes

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:14.679
is the function G that satisfies
the differential equation.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.220
The derivative of G with respect to T

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.291
is equal to the negative of

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.086
G minus 27 to the two third power.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:24.784
Where G of T is measured
in degrees Celsius

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:27.489
and G of zero is equal to 91.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.396
Find an expression for G of T.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:33.976
Based on this model, what
is the internal temperature

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:37.329
of the potato at time T is equal to three?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.645
So they gave us a differential equation.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.487
They want us to find an
expression for G of T,

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:43.869
so essentially find a solution

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.304
to this differential equation.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:47.508
And then they want us to
use that solution to find

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:50.233
the internal temperature
time T equals three.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.089
So, the first thing to appreciate,

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.608
this is in an AP calculus class.

00:00:54.608 --> 00:00:56.906
And so they're asking us
to solve a differential

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.981
equation, or find a solution
to a differential equation

00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.435
it is unlikely to be a really
strange differential equation.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.464
It's likely to be a separable
differential equation.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.936
And then once we find that solution

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.308
we just have to evaluate
it at time T equals three.

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:13.130
So let's rewrite the
differential equation.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.629
And then, let's try to evaluate.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:17.163
Let's see if we can find the solution

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:18.149
and then we'll evaluate.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.610
The derivative of G

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.938
with respect to T

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:24.105
is equal to the negative of G minus 27

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.188
to the two thirds power.

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:28.784
So,

00:01:28.784 --> 00:01:30.910
if this is going to be a
separable differential equation

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.827
I want to separate the DG

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:33.744
and the DT.

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:37.964
So I'm gonna treat my
differential like numbers

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.407
so, or variables.

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:41.399
So I'm gonna multiply both sides

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.958
times the T differential.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.632
And so then I'm going to have

00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:48.641
the capital G differential

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.585
DG is equal to

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.039
negative times

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.872
G minus 27

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:56.690
to the two thirds power DT.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.341
And the whole notion
here, I'm trying to get

00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.108
all of the G things

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:02.964
on the side with the DG.

00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:04.440
And then all of the things that involve T

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.080
in the side with the DT.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.556
So we don't see any Ts here

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.161
so really, we just have to get the Gs

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.857
over on this side while
leaving the DT there.

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:14.201
And then we can integrate both sides.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.354
So let's see.

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:16.437
If we were to

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:19.146
divide

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:20.432
both sides

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.921
by

00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:22.754
G

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.910
minus 27 to the two thirds.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.743
G minus 27

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:30.862
to the two thirds.

00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:31.695
G minus 27

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:35.151
to the two thirds,

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.111
what do we have?

00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:38.643
Well, we could rewrite the left side as

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:39.476
G minus 27

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:42.875
to the negative two thirds

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.302
negative two thirds

00:02:44.302 --> 00:02:45.469
DG is equal to

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:50.297
I'm left with just this negative DT.

00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:52.134
Is equal to

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:55.021
negative DT.

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:55.872
Now let's see.

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:57.754
Now, we can, or actually just a simplify

00:02:57.754 --> 00:02:59.319
or just to make it a
little bit more obvious

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.461
I could write this as negative one DT

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:04.790
And now we just have to
integrate both sides.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.427
So, we could rewrite this as

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:09.334
let me write it on both sides.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.447
I'm going to integrate

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:14.472
I'm going to integrate both sides here.

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.688
And so what does this give me?

00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:18.230
Well, on the left side here

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.259
you could try to do some
U substitutions saying,

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:23.342
U is equal to G minus 27.

00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.425
And then DU would be DG.

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:28.618
Or, you might recognize that look,

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:31.131
the derivative of G minus 27

00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:32.048
is just DG.

00:03:35.153 --> 00:03:37.415
The derivative of G minus 27 is

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.118
just going to be equal to one.

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.148
So you could even say, look, I have my

00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:43.294
I have the derivative there.

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:46.947
So I could really integrate
with respect to G minus 27.

00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:49.414
And so really, I would just
use the reverse power rule.

00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:51.664
I would take my G minus 27.

00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:55.558
I would increment this exponent by one.

00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.369
So let's see, negative two thirds plus one

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.249
is positive one third.

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.243
So positive one third power.

00:04:01.243 --> 00:04:03.947
And then I would divide
by this new exponent.

00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:05.836
So dividing by one third
is the same thing as

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:07.304
multiplying by three.

00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:08.806
So that's the left hand side.

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.541
This is going to be equal to

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.838
the right hand side.

00:04:11.838 --> 00:04:13.479
This is just going to be negative T.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.876
And for good measure

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.773
I'm going to have A plus C.

00:04:17.773 --> 00:04:20.190
So, how could we solve for C?

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:24.600
Well they give us some
information, they say G of zero

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.850
is equal to 91.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.449
So lets write that down.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.949
So, when T is zero

00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:32.632
G is 91.

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:34.536
So we can write

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:36.174
let me write it over here.

00:04:36.174 --> 00:04:37.567
So three times

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:40.079
so when T is zero G is 91.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.662
Ninety one minus 27

00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:46.951
to the one third power
is equal to negative T.

00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:49.644
Well now we're saying T is zero.

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.785
So you can write negative zero there.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:53.288
Or we could just not write it.

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:54.712
And then plus C.

00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:57.454
So that's what C is going to be equal to.

00:04:57.454 --> 00:04:59.871
Let's see, 91 minus 27 is 64.

00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:03.534
Sixty four to the one third power

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:05.671
is positive four.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.718
And so we have C is equal to 12.

00:05:07.718 --> 00:05:09.135
C is equal to 12.

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:13.578
And let's see, we want to
write an expression for G of T.

00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:17.373
So now let's just manipulate
this and solve for G.

00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:18.206
So, if we

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.311
let me just take this

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.613
and go right over here.

00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:26.543
So if we divide both sides by three

00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:28.239
we are going to get

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:29.072
G minus 27

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.773
to the one third power is equal to

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.751
negative T over three

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:39.569
plus four.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.333
I just divided both sides by three.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:43.924
And I can take the cube of both sides

00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:46.532
and I would get G minus 27

00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:48.238
is equal to

00:05:48.238 --> 00:05:50.284
negative T over three

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.546
plus four

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:52.901
to the third power.

00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.438
And I would just have
to add 27 to both sides.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.134
And I'll make it clear,
G is a function of T

00:05:58.134 --> 00:06:00.123
is equal to negative T

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.155
over three plus four.

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.997
All of that to the third power.

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:04.830
Plus 27.

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:08.217
So I did the first part.

00:06:08.217 --> 00:06:11.427
This is, what do we got cross

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:13.255
this right over here

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:14.922
is an expression for G of T.

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:17.831
It was indeed a separable
differential equation.

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:19.181
It took a little bit of

00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:21.105
algebraic manipulation to get us there.

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.358
But we were able to do it

00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:23.709
and we were not only able to solve

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.002
for the general solution.

00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:26.583
We were able to find
the particular solution

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:29.853
using this initial condition right here

00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:32.256
the G of zero is equal to 91.

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:33.412
Now, we'll do the easy part.

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:35.557
Based on this model, what
is the internal temperature

00:06:35.557 --> 00:06:37.716
of the potato at time T equals three?

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:39.507
So G of three

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:41.294
is equal to negative three

00:06:41.294 --> 00:06:43.989
over three plus, I'll just write it out.

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:46.382
Negative three over three plus four

00:06:46.382 --> 00:06:49.281
to the third power plus 27.

00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.268
Well this is negative one.

00:06:51.268 --> 00:06:53.053
So negative one plus four is three.

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:55.785
So this is three to the
third power which is 27.

00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:58.398
Plus 27 is equal to 54

00:06:58.398 --> 00:06:59.731
degrees Celsius.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.117
And, we are done.
