00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
Google Play game services and we are
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.580
Google Play game services and we are
broadcasting actually from our advanced

yes I'm I've discovered I now have the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
yes I'm I've discovered I now have the
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.049
yes I'm I've discovered I now have the
x-ray app on my phone which is pretty

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
x-ray app on my phone which is pretty
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.700
x-ray app on my phone which is pretty
cool it looks through all sorts of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
cool it looks through all sorts of
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340
cool it looks through all sorts of
organic matter which I think they'll be

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
organic matter which I think they'll be
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.660
organic matter which I think they'll be
coming out pretty soon we're working on

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
coming out pretty soon we're working on
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369
coming out pretty soon we're working on
so as you can see there's very advanced

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
so as you can see there's very advanced
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900
so as you can see there's very advanced
and top-secret stuff that we have here

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
and top-secret stuff that we have here
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880
and top-secret stuff that we have here
yes and this is in no way a green screen

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
yes and this is in no way a green screen
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670
yes and this is in no way a green screen
not an IDE not at all I actually I did

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
not an IDE not at all I actually I did
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200
not an IDE not at all I actually I did
not realize until I was in the studio

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
not realize until I was in the studio
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.029
not realize until I was in the studio
today that this is this is fake I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
today that this is this is fake I
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920
today that this is this is fake I
thought this was a real background so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
thought this was a real background so
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709
thought this was a real background so
we're letting you in on exactly on the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
we're letting you in on exactly on the
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479
we're letting you in on exactly on the
magic and I feel the real background is

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
magic and I feel the real background is
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.110
magic and I feel the real background is
right over there

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
right over there
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580
right over there
this is just there's a camera there and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
this is just there's a camera there and
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.869
this is just there's a camera there and
then there's a green screen over here

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
then there's a green screen over here
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.160
then there's a green screen over here
projecting the background that's over

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
projecting the background that's over
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710
projecting the background that's over
there over here just so that we can have

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
there over here just so that we can have
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.330
there over here just so that we can have
this transparent Android doll it's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
this transparent Android doll it's
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.880
this transparent Android doll it's
really just for the gaming exactly so we

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
really just for the gaming exactly so we
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.200
really just for the gaming exactly so we
are here to talk to you today about

are here to talk to you today about
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539
are here to talk to you today about

talking an awful lot about Android and a
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789
talking an awful lot about Android and a
bit about iOS but you know web game

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
bit about iOS but you know web game
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859
bit about iOS but you know web game
developers you're people to reveal of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
developers you're people to reveal of
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530
developers you're people to reveal of
and we're here to give you some of that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
and we're here to give you some of that
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.679
and we're here to give you some of that
love in the form of a demo and a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
love in the form of a demo and a
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.140
love in the form of a demo and a
presentation yeah yeah talking about

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
presentation yeah yeah talking about
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.700
presentation yeah yeah talking about
advanced stuff let's switch to a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
advanced stuff let's switch to a
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550
advanced stuff let's switch to a
presentation all right I thought this is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
presentation all right I thought this is
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.410
presentation all right I thought this is
just gonna be like a casual talk but

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
just gonna be like a casual talk but
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780
just gonna be like a casual talk but
like Bruno prepared slides so uh well

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
like Bruno prepared slides so uh well
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.990
like Bruno prepared slides so uh well
slice yeah so anyway yes so let's talk

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
slice yeah so anyway yes so let's talk
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700
slice yeah so anyway yes so let's talk
about building web games using the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
about building web games using the
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649
about building web games using the
Google Play game services we're gonna

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
Google Play game services we're gonna
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300
Google Play game services we're gonna
give her just a very quick overview of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
give her just a very quick overview of
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.830
give her just a very quick overview of
how to set up your game because we're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
how to set up your game because we're
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.789
how to set up your game because we're
not gonna go through all the steps

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
not gonna go through all the steps
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.819
not gonna go through all the steps
because we wouldn't have time but let's

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
because we wouldn't have time but let's
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.319
because we wouldn't have time but let's
just give a quick overview of the steps

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
just give a quick overview of the steps
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.840
just give a quick overview of the steps
so yes we do have a Web API for Google

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
so yes we do have a Web API for Google
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459
so yes we do have a Web API for Google
Play game services and if you go to a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
Play game services and if you go to a
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410
Play game services and if you go to a
developers.google.com slash game slash

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
developers.google.com slash game slash
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270

services and look at the left side

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
services and look at the left side
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369
services and look at the left side
navigation menu you're going to find a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
navigation menu you're going to find a
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.280
navigation menu you're going to find a
whole section there about

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290
whole section there about
 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.959
whole section there about
games so we're gonna find both the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969
games so we're gonna find both the
 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.000
games so we're gonna find both the
client-side setup and the client server

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
client-side setup and the client server
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.449
client-side setup and the client server
setup so there are basically these two

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459
setup so there are basically these two
 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.160
setup so there are basically these two
options for web games you can either do

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170
options for web games you can either do
 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.630
options for web games you can either do
a client only setup where we have

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
a client only setup where we have
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.390
a client only setup where we have
essentially a client-side HTML and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
essentially a client-side HTML and
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.740
essentially a client-side HTML and
JavaScript and no server component or

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
JavaScript and no server component or
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.539
JavaScript and no server component or
you can have the client server setup

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549
you can have the client server setup
 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.970
you can have the client server setup
where your client side essentially

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
where your client side essentially
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.770
where your client side essentially
serves as an interface and then the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
serves as an interface and then the
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.240
serves as an interface and then the
server is the component that actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
server is the component that actually
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.520
server is the component that actually
makes the API calls we're gonna talk

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
makes the API calls we're gonna talk
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.960
makes the API calls we're gonna talk
about only the client side here because

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
about only the client side here because
 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.800
about only the client side here because
it's simpler

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
it's simpler
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.869
it's simpler
but the the server side is also not very

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879
but the the server side is also not very
 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.309
but the the server side is also not very
difficult and the only difference is

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319
difficult and the only difference is
 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690
difficult and the only difference is
that you have to pass your token to the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
that you have to pass your token to the
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.979
that you have to pass your token to the
server and then the server is gonna make

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
server and then the server is gonna make
 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.110
server and then the server is gonna make
the API calls but to set up the client

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
the API calls but to set up the client
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.369
the API calls but to set up the client
side so first of all you should have

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379
side so first of all you should have
 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.890
side so first of all you should have
done the the initial setup so you should

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
done the the initial setup so you should
 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.899
done the the initial setup so you should
set up your your game in the in the

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909
set up your your game in the in the
 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.819
set up your your game in the in the
developer console first once you have

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829
developer console first once you have
 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.319
developer console first once you have
that done then you can now from the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329
that done then you can now from the
 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.940
that done then you can now from the
client side you can start by loading the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
client side you can start by loading the
 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.580
client side you can start by loading the
API and then you authorize which means

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590
API and then you authorize which means
 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.409
API and then you authorize which means
showing the authorization dialogues if

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419
showing the authorization dialogues if
 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.240
showing the authorization dialogues if
they're needed and then you can start

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
they're needed and then you can start
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.039
they're needed and then you can start
making the API calls as soon as you get

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049
making the API calls as soon as you get
 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.330
making the API calls as soon as you get
the callback saying that you are signed

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
the callback saying that you are signed
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.720
the callback saying that you are signed
in so the setting up the game is

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
in so the setting up the game is
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.399
in so the setting up the game is
actually pretty easy and most of the

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409
actually pretty easy and most of the
 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.750
actually pretty easy and most of the
code is pretty much copy and paste from

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
code is pretty much copy and paste from
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.300
code is pretty much copy and paste from
boilerplate so just load the the client

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310
boilerplate so just load the the client
 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.550
boilerplate so just load the the client
jas and then you just you just write

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
jas and then you just you just write
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.280
jas and then you just you just write
that to initialize the the Google+ API

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290
that to initialize the the Google+ API
 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.920
that to initialize the the Google+ API
once you have that done you're going to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
once you have that done you're going to
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.969
once you have that done you're going to
get a callback saying you are

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979
get a callback saying you are
 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.580
get a callback saying you are
authenticated and well I mean the API

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
authenticated and well I mean the API
 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.259
authenticated and well I mean the API
are loaded and that's the point where

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269
are loaded and that's the point where
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.780
are loaded and that's the point where
you should authenticate so if you just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790
you should authenticate so if you just
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.599
you should authenticate so if you just
call a gap either alt or authorize you

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609
call a gap either alt or authorize you
 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.030
call a gap either alt or authorize you
can start this authentication process if

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040
can start this authentication process if
 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.979
can start this authentication process if
you call it with immediate equals true

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989
you call it with immediate equals true
 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.659
you call it with immediate equals true
that's that's going to mean that the API

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669
that's that's going to mean that the API
 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.969
that's that's going to mean that the API
API is not going to show any pop-ups and

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979
API is not going to show any pop-ups and
 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.039
API is not going to show any pop-ups and
then if you call with immediately calls

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049
then if you call with immediately calls
 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.839
then if you call with immediately calls
false that means that poppers pop-ups

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849
false that means that poppers pop-ups
 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.939
false that means that poppers pop-ups
may be shown which means that you should

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949
may be shown which means that you should
 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.500
may be shown which means that you should
first try to authenticate with immediate

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
first try to authenticate with immediate
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.539
first try to authenticate with immediate

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549
equals true and then if that succeeds
 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.339

well that's very good and if that fails

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349
well that's very good and if that fails
 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.710
well that's very good and if that fails
you can call again with immediate e

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720
you can call again with immediate e
 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.689
you can call again with immediate e

that's when you would make this call

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250
that's when you would make this call
 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.280
that's when you would make this call

with immediate equals false exactly and
the reason why this is not automatic is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030
the reason why this is not automatic is
 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.270
the reason why this is not automatic is
that most browsers block pop-ups so if

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
that most browsers block pop-ups so if
 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.620
that most browsers block pop-ups so if

user having clicked a button that's
 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.250
user having clicked a button that's
usually gonna get blocked so this is why

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260
usually gonna get blocked so this is why
 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.840
usually gonna get blocked so this is why
it's important to first try to call with

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850
it's important to first try to call with
 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.190
it's important to first try to call with
immediate equals true and then if that

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200
immediate equals true and then if that
 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.900
immediate equals true and then if that
fails then you wait until the user

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910
fails then you wait until the user
 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.150
fails then you wait until the user
clicks a button and only then do you

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160
clicks a button and only then do you
 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.430
clicks a button and only then do you
call with immediate equals false so that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440
call with immediate equals false so that
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.480
call with immediate equals false so that
you don't get that blocking behavior so

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
you don't get that blocking behavior so
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.030
you don't get that blocking behavior so
next once you have your authenticated

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040
next once you have your authenticated
 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.520
next once you have your authenticated
you can either use the API have a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530
you can either use the API have a
 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.260
you can either use the API have a
calling request for everything so you

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270
calling request for everything so you
 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.550
calling request for everything so you
would call request and then you have to

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560
would call request and then you have to
 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.930
would call request and then you have to
pass the parameters and so on

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
pass the parameters and so on
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.150
pass the parameters and so on
but there's actually a very very handy

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160
but there's actually a very very handy
 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.670
but there's actually a very very handy
service called discovery service and the

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680
service called discovery service and the
 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.050
service called discovery service and the
discovery service means you can actually

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060
discovery service means you can actually
 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330
discovery service means you can actually
make the REST API calls in a much more

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340
make the REST API calls in a much more
 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.730
make the REST API calls in a much more
convenient syntax and to use that if you

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
convenient syntax and to use that if you
 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.800
convenient syntax and to use that if you
have you first have to load your API

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810
have you first have to load your API
 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.690
have you first have to load your API
using that syntax which is capital

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700
using that syntax which is capital
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.969
using that syntax which is capital
client that load then in this case I'm

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979
client that load then in this case I'm
 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.460
client that load then in this case I'm
loading the games API version 1 and then

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470
loading the games API version 1 and then
 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.780
loading the games API version 1 and then
this is the callback that it's gonna get

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790
this is the callback that it's gonna get
 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.640
this is the callback that it's gonna get
called as soon as they that API is ready

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650
called as soon as they that API is ready
 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.650
called as soon as they that API is ready
so when I get a call to own API loaded I

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660
so when I get a call to own API loaded I
 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.270
so when I get a call to own API loaded I
know that I can start making the calls

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280
know that I can start making the calls
 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.120
know that I can start making the calls
and the calls look much more convenient

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130
and the calls look much more convenient
 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.800
and the calls look much more convenient
than than what you would see with

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810
than than what you would see with
 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.140
than than what you would see with
requests so for instance if I want to

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150
requests so for instance if I want to
 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.460
requests so for instance if I want to
list the player's achievements all I

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470
list the player's achievements all I
 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.020
list the player's achievements all I
have to do is call capital client that

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030
have to do is call capital client that
 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.580
have to do is call capital client that
game store achievements are list and

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590
game store achievements are list and
 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.770
game store achievements are list and
that's gonna generate a request that I

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780
that's gonna generate a request that I
 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.900
that's gonna generate a request that I
can then execute and then pass my call

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910
can then execute and then pass my call
 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.930
can then execute and then pass my call
back and once the callback gets called

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940
back and once the callback gets called
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.370
back and once the callback gets called
you're gonna get the the result of that

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
you're gonna get the the result of that
 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.840
you're gonna get the the result of that
call so you can test you can check for

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850
call so you can test you can check for
 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.670
call so you can test you can check for
errors and if there is no error then you

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680
errors and if there is no error then you
 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.110
errors and if there is no error then you
can do whatever you want with that

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120
can do whatever you want with that
 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.850
can do whatever you want with that
without results in this case I'm just

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860
without results in this case I'm just
 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.830
without results in this case I'm just
iterating through the achievements that

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840
iterating through the achievements that
 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.120
iterating through the achievements that
the user has and then doing something

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130
the user has and then doing something
 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.790
the user has and then doing something
with them so this just illustrates just

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800
with them so this just illustrates just
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.880
with them so this just illustrates just
you know in a few minutes pretty much to

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890
you know in a few minutes pretty much to
 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.290

let's show the actual gameplay hopefully

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830
let's show the actual gameplay hopefully

let's show the actual gameplay hopefully
the sounds gonna come out right let's

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:50.449
the sounds gonna come out right let's
 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.620
the sounds gonna come out right let's
see so alright so this is where I try to

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:53.630
see so alright so this is where I try to
 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.439
see so alright so this is where I try to
beat everyone's high-score so you have

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:56.449
beat everyone's high-score so you have
 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.870
beat everyone's high-score so you have
these enemies that you can shoot and

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:58.880
these enemies that you can shoot and
 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.860
these enemies that you can shoot and
then you they disappear then of course

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:05.870
then you they disappear then of course
 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.120
then you they disappear then of course
one of the challenges of the game is

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130
one of the challenges of the game is
 

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.469
one of the challenges of the game is
that there are not not only these

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479
that there are not not only these
 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.230
that there are not not only these
enemies but also these Allied packets

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240
enemies but also these Allied packets
 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240
enemies but also these Allied packets
and if you shoot them they become

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.250
and if you shoot them they become
 

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.249
and if you shoot them they become
missiles that are going to try and

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:15.259
missiles that are going to try and
 

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:17.649
missiles that are going to try and
destroy your firewall once you run out

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:17.659
destroy your firewall once you run out
 

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.330
destroy your firewall once you run out
of firewall you lose the game and that's

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:19.340
of firewall you lose the game and that's
 

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.670
of firewall you lose the game and that's
your score I just scored 500 points and

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680
your score I just scored 500 points and
 

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.730
your score I just scored 500 points and
of course if that score had been bigger

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:24.740
of course if that score had been bigger
 

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.790
of course if that score had been bigger
I would appear in the my place in the

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800
I would appear in the my place in the
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.580
I would appear in the my place in the
indie leaderboards would would change

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:29.590
indie leaderboards would would change
 

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.610
indie leaderboards would would change
but my sport was not that big but I'll

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:33.620
but my sport was not that big but I'll
 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.890

try harder there
 

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.770
try harder there
yep so that's pretty much the the demo

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:39.780
yep so that's pretty much the the demo
 

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.560
yep so that's pretty much the the demo
cool so let's bring up a few things that

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.570
cool so let's bring up a few things that
 

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.330
cool so let's bring up a few things that
people might be asking after after

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:44.340
people might be asking after after
 

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.720
people might be asking after after
seeing this demo the first is we noticed

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
seeing this demo the first is we noticed
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.790
seeing this demo the first is we noticed
that you know we were able to see a list

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800
that you know we were able to see a list
 

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.650

that all right I got a thumbs up okay so
 

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.080
that all right I got a thumbs up okay so
on Android iOS we have widgets to

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.090
on Android iOS we have widgets to
 

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.150
on Android iOS we have widgets to
display achievements and high scores did

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160
display achievements and high scores did
 

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.530
display achievements and high scores did
you have widgets that you were able to

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540
you have widgets that you were able to
 

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.050
you have widgets that you were able to
use here no come on if you're doing a

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060
use here no come on if you're doing a
 

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.880
use here no come on if you're doing a
web game since every web game is pretty

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:13.890
web game since every web game is pretty
 

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.130
web game since every web game is pretty
much different so there are no

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140
much different so there are no
 

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.140
much different so there are no
ready-to-use widgets but it turns out

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.150
ready-to-use widgets but it turns out
 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.280
ready-to-use widgets but it turns out
that the API is actually pretty

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.290
that the API is actually pretty
 

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.840
that the API is actually pretty
straightforward you have to do that or

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:20.850
straightforward you have to do that or
 

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.760
straightforward you have to do that or
they have to do is call the load api's

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:22.770
they have to do is call the load api's
 

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.080
they have to do is call the load api's
and then you got a callback whenever you

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.090
and then you got a callback whenever you
 

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.730
and then you got a callback whenever you
have the data loaded so that's pretty

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740
have the data loaded so that's pretty
 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.870
have the data loaded so that's pretty
much what I'm doing here you know in

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880
much what I'm doing here you know in
 

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.400
much what I'm doing here you know in
achievements and and the leaderboards I

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.410
achievements and and the leaderboards I
 

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.460
achievements and and the leaderboards I
just make a call to to the load API and

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.470
just make a call to to the load API and
 

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.140
just make a call to to the load API and
then when I get the callback I have the

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.150
then when I get the callback I have the
 

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.090
then when I get the callback I have the
data and then with the data just form

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.100
data and then with the data just form
 

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.090
data and then with the data just form
with my own HTML with that data and so

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100
with my own HTML with that data and so
 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.470
with my own HTML with that data and so
getting the data should be pretty

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480
getting the data should be pretty
 

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.940
getting the data should be pretty
straightforward most of the work the

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:40.950
straightforward most of the work the
 

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.470
straightforward most of the work the
developers going to need to do is any

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480
developers going to need to do is any
 

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.380
developers going to need to do is any
CSS magic that they want to you know say

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.390
CSS magic that they want to you know say
 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.600
CSS magic that they want to you know say
make an achievement look nice versus an

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.610
make an achievement look nice versus an
 

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.800
make an achievement look nice versus an
achievement they haven't earned or that

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:48.810
achievement they haven't earned or that
 

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.030
achievement they haven't earned or that
sort of thing exactly so making

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040
sort of thing exactly so making
 

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.620
sort of thing exactly so making
achievements look nice is not it's not

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:51.630
achievements look nice is not it's not
 

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.850
achievements look nice is not it's not
in the scope of the sample as you can

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860
in the scope of the sample as you can
 

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.280
in the scope of the sample as you can
see there they look pretty disastrously

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.290
see there they look pretty disastrously
 

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.810
see there they look pretty disastrously
ugly so the what I'm doing here is I'm

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820
ugly so the what I'm doing here is I'm
 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.570
ugly so the what I'm doing here is I'm
just showing the that's this is actually

00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580
just showing the that's this is actually
 

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.500
just showing the that's this is actually
one of the things I really like about

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.510
one of the things I really like about
 

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.270
one of the things I really like about
retail games is that I can use that as

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:02.280
retail games is that I can use that as
 

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.620
retail games is that I can use that as
an excuse to have very poor graphics

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.630
an excuse to have very poor graphics
 

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.350
an excuse to have very poor graphics
that is true so this is just E and I'm

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360
that is true so this is just E and I'm
 

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.540
that is true so this is just E and I'm
actually showing the the icon for each

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:08.550
actually showing the the icon for each
 

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.980
actually showing the the icon for each
achievement so when you're setting up

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:09.990
achievement so when you're setting up
 

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.450
achievement so when you're setting up
achievements on the developer console

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:11.460
achievements on the developer console
 

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.640
achievements on the developer console
you have the chance to upload an icon

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:13.650
you have the chance to upload an icon
 

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.840
you have the chance to upload an icon
for each achievement and that's the one

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:14.850
for each achievement and that's the one
 

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.490
for each achievement and that's the one
what the one that I'm showing the fact

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500
what the one that I'm showing the fact
 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.780
what the one that I'm showing the fact
that it's always the same is just

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:17.790
that it's always the same is just
 

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.310
that it's always the same is just
because of my complete lack of artistic

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320
because of my complete lack of artistic
 

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.350
because of my complete lack of artistic
ability and I'm just using the same icon

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360
ability and I'm just using the same icon
 

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.120
ability and I'm just using the same icon
for every achievement but if you had

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.130
for every achievement but if you had
 

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.770
for every achievement but if you had
different icon for different icons for

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:24.780
different icon for different icons for
 

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.210
different icon for different icons for
different achievements you would be

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220
different achievements you would be
 

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.820
different achievements you would be
seeing them here cool I'm also going to

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:28.830
seeing them here cool I'm also going to
 

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.990
seeing them here cool I'm also going to
ask about now I know that we we talked

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000
ask about now I know that we we talked
 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.370
ask about now I know that we we talked
about during your presentation we talked

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380
about during your presentation we talked
 

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.829
about during your presentation we talked
about calling gapi authorized to sign

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839
about calling gapi authorized to sign
 

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:38.680
about calling gapi authorized to sign
the user in but I know that for this

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:38.690
the user in but I know that for this
 

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.760
the user in but I know that for this
particular sample application you're

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:40.770
particular sample application you're
 

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.500
particular sample application you're
using the Google+ sign-in box that

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:42.510
using the Google+ sign-in box that
 

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.130
using the Google+ sign-in box that
that's correct

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
that's correct
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.780
that's correct
that's correct so if I sign out and

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:44.790
that's correct so if I sign out and
 

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.280
that's correct so if I sign out and
hopefully nothing will blow up if I do

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.290
hopefully nothing will blow up if I do
 

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.820
hopefully nothing will blow up if I do
there we go so I'm using the

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:48.830
there we go so I'm using the
 

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.130
there we go so I'm using the
built-in Google Plus the Google sign-in

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.140
built-in Google Plus the Google sign-in
 

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.980
built-in Google Plus the Google sign-in
button so which means that I'm this this

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:53.990
button so which means that I'm this this
 

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.350
button so which means that I'm this this
actually saves me a lot of code because

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360
actually saves me a lot of code because
 

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.580
actually saves me a lot of code because
instead of having to write gabador

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:57.590
instead of having to write gabador
 

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.530
instead of having to write gabador
authorize and all that all I have to do

00:10:59.530 --> 00:10:59.540
authorize and all that all I have to do
 

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.600
authorize and all that all I have to do
is is just place the sign-in button and

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:01.610
is is just place the sign-in button and
 

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.880
is is just place the sign-in button and
set the the properties right this is

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:03.890
set the the properties right this is
 

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.470
set the the properties right this is
about yeah the sign-in button is like

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480
about yeah the sign-in button is like
 

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.140
about yeah the sign-in button is like
you know three lines of HTML essentially

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.150
you know three lines of HTML essentially
 

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.220
you know three lines of HTML essentially
that you're putting them that kind of

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.230
that you're putting them that kind of
 

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.890
that you're putting them that kind of
does all the work for you the main

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:11.900
does all the work for you the main
 

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.570
does all the work for you the main
drawback and the the reason I think

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:13.580
drawback and the the reason I think
 

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.730
drawback and the the reason I think
we're showing use both ways of signing

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:15.740
we're showing use both ways of signing
 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.070
we're showing use both ways of signing
the user in is that this sign-in button

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.080
the user in is that this sign-in button
 

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.050
the user in is that this sign-in button
has to appear within a span or within a

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.060
has to appear within a span or within a
 

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.440
has to appear within a span or within a
div and say for an html5 game like this

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.450
div and say for an html5 game like this
 

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.930
div and say for an html5 game like this
it's not a problem but if you were for

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:25.940
it's not a problem but if you were for
 

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.030
it's not a problem but if you were for

Unity game or something or whatever your
 

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.290
Unity game or something or whatever your
game yeah we're being harder to put a

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.300
game yeah we're being harder to put a
 

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.050
game yeah we're being harder to put a
span on top of your game and you know it

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:35.060
span on top of your game and you know it
 

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.460
span on top of your game and you know it
would need to be outside the frame of

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:36.470
would need to be outside the frame of
 

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.990
would need to be outside the frame of
the game where people might miss it or

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000
the game where people might miss it or
 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.150
the game where people might miss it or
something like that you would probably

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160
something like that you would probably
 

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.910
something like that you would probably
want to go with the more you know closer

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920
want to go with the more you know closer
 

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.340
want to go with the more you know closer

authorized things are equi hall so I

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.050
authorized things are equi hall so I
 

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.320
authorized things are equi hall so I
mean both methods are both methods work

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.330
mean both methods are both methods work
 

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.450
mean both methods are both methods work
if you're able to use the sign-in button

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.460
if you're able to use the sign-in button
 

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.390
if you're able to use the sign-in button
that is the preferred way it also does a

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.400
that is the preferred way it also does a
 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.190
that is the preferred way it also does a
couple of extra things behind the scenes

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200
couple of extra things behind the scenes
 

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.410
couple of extra things behind the scenes
I think it makes you know loading the +1

00:11:59.410 --> 00:11:59.420
I think it makes you know loading the +1
 

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.840
I think it makes you know loading the +1
button faster and and some other stuff

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:01.850
button faster and and some other stuff
 

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.570
button faster and and some other stuff
like that so I know that on behalf of

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:04.580
like that so I know that on behalf of
 

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.640
like that so I know that on behalf of
the Google+ team they would prefer that

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:06.650

you use this if possible if however you

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:09.980
you use this if possible if however you
 

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.320
you use this if possible if however you
know your game engine simply can't

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.330
know your game engine simply can't
 

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.600
know your game engine simply can't
render a div on top of it or it has

forgot I was recording so we should also

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:50.490
forgot I was recording so we should also
 

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.720
forgot I was recording so we should also
ask what about what about cheating so

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:52.730
ask what about what about cheating so
 

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.100

this is all the high scores are being

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.110
this is all the high scores are being
 

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.660
this is all the high scores are being
essentially generated and set up by the

what strategies would you recommend well

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820
what strategies would you recommend well
 

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.760
what strategies would you recommend well
actually on this sample that we we don't

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:07.770
actually on this sample that we we don't
 

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.050
actually on this sample that we we don't
know much to prevent cheating at all

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060
know much to prevent cheating at all
 

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.280
know much to prevent cheating at all
because we want the source code to be

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:10.290
because we want the source code to be
 

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.930
because we want the source code to be
readable so we're not doing anything

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940
readable so we're not doing anything
 

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.360

you want to take every possible measure

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:17.280
you want to take every possible measure
 

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.160
you want to take every possible measure
to make sure that people don't cheat and

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.170
to make sure that people don't cheat and
 

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.780
to make sure that people don't cheat and
that goes that starts with maybe

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:20.790
that goes that starts with maybe
 

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.400
that goes that starts with maybe
obfuscating your code and making sure

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.410
obfuscating your code and making sure
 

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.530
obfuscating your code and making sure
that it's not that easy to tamper with

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540
that it's not that easy to tamper with
 

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.580
that it's not that easy to tamper with
it and so on

it and so on
 

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.560
it and so on
but of course people maybe people are

but of course people maybe people are
 

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.690
but of course people maybe people are
gonna find ways to cheat anyway maybe

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:29.700
gonna find ways to cheat anyway maybe

your game logic that allows people to

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:33.450
your game logic that allows people to
 

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.880
your game logic that allows people to
get an infinite score or something like

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:34.890
get an infinite score or something like
 

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.000
get an infinite score or something like
that and what you can do of course is

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.010
that and what you can do of course is
 

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.220
that and what you can do of course is
you can manage that from the server side

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.230
you can manage that from the server side
 

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.470
you can manage that from the server side

you can do is call the management API so

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.310
you can do is call the management API so
 

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.980
you can do is call the management API so
the management and api's are also

you can authenticate as the the owner of
 

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.680
you can authenticate as the the owner of

the game so this means the user who
 

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.840

created that client ID and once you are

00:16:59.840 --> 00:16:59.850
created that client ID and once you are
 

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.340

you can hide a player score hide a means

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:04.350
you can hide a player score hide a means
 

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.380
you can hide a player score hide a means
the that player that the other cheater

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.390

who has 1 million points they're still

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:08.670
who has 1 million points they're still
 

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.770
who has 1 million points they're still
gonna see that they have 1 million

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780
gonna see that they have 1 million
 

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.420
gonna see that they have 1 million
points but after a high you hide their

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:11.430
points but after a high you hide their
 

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.280
points but after a high you hide their
score nobody else is going to be able to

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:13.290
score nobody else is going to be able to
 

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.170
score nobody else is going to be able to
see that they have that score so they

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:15.180
see that they have that score so they
 

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.540
see that they have that score so they
can go on and be happy that they have 1

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:17.550
can go on and be happy that they have 1
 

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.860
can go on and be happy that they have 1
million points but then nobody else

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:18.870
million points but then nobody else
 

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:19.880
million points but then nobody else
plays the game

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:19.890
plays the game
 

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.290

is gonna see this sport anymore so he

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:21.300
is gonna see this sport anymore so he
 

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.720
is gonna see this sport anymore so he
can be happy alone and that's much nicer

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:23.730
can be happy alone and that's much nicer
 

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.760
can be happy alone and that's much nicer
than deleting the score cuz if it turns

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:25.770
than deleting the score cuz if it turns
 

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.890
than deleting the score cuz if it turns
out this was actually a fantastic player

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900
out this was actually a fantastic player

them later exam we should also point out

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:33.420
them later exam we should also point out
 

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.440
them later exam we should also point out
these management api's work for mobile

games as well so you would need to build

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.370
games as well so you would need to build
 

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.340
games as well so you would need to build
a little web client to make these calls

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:40.350
a little web client to make these calls
 

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.500
a little web client to make these calls
but if you notice say you're building a

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:42.510
but if you notice say you're building a
 

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.000
but if you notice say you're building a
mobile game and there's some people on

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.010
mobile game and there's some people on
 

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.920
mobile game and there's some people on
the high score list that maybe shouldn't

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:45.930
the high score list that maybe shouldn't
 

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.020
the high score list that maybe shouldn't
be at the level they're at you can hide

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.030
be at the level they're at you can hide
 

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.850
be at the level they're at you can hide
those scores as well just by building a

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860
those scores as well just by building a
 

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.500
those scores as well just by building a
little little web app that that would

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:51.510
little little web app that that would
 

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.780
little little web app that that would
make these calls exactly but of course

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:53.790
make these calls exactly but of course
 

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.270
make these calls exactly but of course
the the burden is upon you to make good

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280
the the burden is upon you to make good
 

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.100
the the burden is upon you to make good
judgments of what is a plausible score

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.110
judgments of what is a plausible score
 

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.320
judgments of what is a plausible score
and what's not so what you don't want to

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.330
and what's not so what you don't want to
 

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.630
and what's not so what you don't want to
do is get you know I mean it's hide the

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640
do is get you know I mean it's hide the
 

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.560
do is get you know I mean it's hide the
score from player who actually

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:03.570
score from player who actually
 

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.990
score from player who actually
legitimately has that score yeah so this

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000
legitimately has that score yeah so this
 

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.520
legitimately has that score yeah so this
this is pretty much up to you so you

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.530
this is pretty much up to you so you
 

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.070
this is pretty much up to you so you
have to be very careful to detect when

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080
have to be very careful to detect when
 

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.750
have to be very careful to detect when
cheating is actually happening and when

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760
cheating is actually happening and when
 

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.700
cheating is actually happening and when
it's not I'd also probably point out one

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:13.710
it's not I'd also probably point out one
 

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.830
it's not I'd also probably point out one
of the best ways to deter cheating is

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840
of the best ways to deter cheating is
 

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.320
of the best ways to deter cheating is
just focus on the social source like if

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.330
just focus on the social source like if
 

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.480
just focus on the social source like if
if I'm cheating on a public leaderboard

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.490
if I'm cheating on a public leaderboard
 

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.640
if I'm cheating on a public leaderboard
maybe I you know feel like I'm a bad ass

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:22.650
maybe I you know feel like I'm a bad ass
 

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.080
maybe I you know feel like I'm a bad ass
hacker because I hacked Google or

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.090
hacker because I hacked Google or
 

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.640
hacker because I hacked Google or
something but like if it's a social

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:25.650
something but like if it's a social
 

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.930
something but like if it's a social
leaderboard I've cheated my way to the

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940
leaderboard I've cheated my way to the
 

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.540
leaderboard I've cheated my way to the
top you know I'm just a jerk like my

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:29.550
top you know I'm just a jerk like my
 

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.600
top you know I'm just a jerk like my
friends will exactly it's yeah exactly

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:32.610
friends will exactly it's yeah exactly
 

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.930
friends will exactly it's yeah exactly
all social leaderboards are they have

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940
all social leaderboards are they have
 

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.480
all social leaderboards are they have
this automatic control which is nice

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.490
this automatic control which is nice
 

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.180
this automatic control which is nice
yeah which is nice hey okay

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.190
yeah which is nice hey okay
 

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.850
yeah which is nice hey okay
did my microphone just jump it's part of

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860
did my microphone just jump it's part of
 

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.470
did my microphone just jump it's part of
our advanced technology how is laughs

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480
our advanced technology how is laughs
 

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.440
our advanced technology how is laughs
awesome yes we should also probably

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:48.450
awesome yes we should also probably
 

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.570
awesome yes we should also probably
point out that if you're a flash

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580
point out that if you're a flash
 

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.780
point out that if you're a flash
developer or a unity developer and run

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:53.790
developer or a unity developer and run
 

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.550
developer or a unity developer and run
or anything else developer practices

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:55.560
or anything else developer practices
 

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.860
or anything else developer practices
yeah anything else and you are looking

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:57.870
yeah anything else and you are looking
 

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.160
yeah anything else and you are looking
to make a web game like this as far as I

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.170
to make a web game like this as far as I
 

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.430
to make a web game like this as far as I
know you know on flash probably the best

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440
know you know on flash probably the best
 

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.440
know you know on flash probably the best
strategy I would recommend would be to

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:06.450
strategy I would recommend would be to
 

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.080
strategy I would recommend would be to
make external interface calls this is

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.090
make external interface calls this is
 

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.030
make external interface calls this is
something that ActionScript has that

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.040
something that ActionScript has that
 

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.490
something that ActionScript has that
essentially allows you to make calls to

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500
essentially allows you to make calls to
 

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.860
essentially allows you to make calls to
JavaScript from flash and then

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:15.870
JavaScript from flash and then
 

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.780
JavaScript from flash and then
JavaScript also has a way that you can

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:17.790
JavaScript also has a way that you can
 

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.400
JavaScript also has a way that you can
find your Flash object and make calls

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.410
find your Flash object and make calls
 

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.700
find your Flash object and make calls
into it yeah I think most browser-based

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:22.710
into it yeah I think most browser-based
 

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.490
into it yeah I think most browser-based
plugins or or technologies have a way in

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500
plugins or or technologies have a way in
 

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.360
plugins or or technologies have a way in
which you can communicate with

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:26.370
which you can communicate with
 

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.340
which you can communicate with
JavaScript yeah and if you can do that

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:28.350
JavaScript yeah and if you can do that
 

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.600
JavaScript yeah and if you can do that
then you can call the api's from

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:29.610
then you can call the api's from
 

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.700
then you can call the api's from
JavaScript even if it's just a wrapper

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:31.710
JavaScript even if it's just a wrapper
 

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.379
JavaScript even if it's just a wrapper
you just write like it

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:33.389
you just write like it
 

00:19:33.389 --> 00:19:34.879
you just write like it
wrapper over to the api's and JavaScript

00:19:34.879 --> 00:19:34.889
wrapper over to the api's and JavaScript
 

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:36.379
wrapper over to the api's and JavaScript
and then call it from your wrong engine

00:19:36.379 --> 00:19:36.389
and then call it from your wrong engine
 

00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:38.659
and then call it from your wrong engine
yeah we really I really need to make a

00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:38.669
yeah we really I really need to make a
 

00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:41.060
yeah we really I really need to make a
sample flash game it's a I don't know if

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.070
sample flash game it's a I don't know if
 

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.359
sample flash game it's a I don't know if
I still have it installed to find out in

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:44.369
I still have it installed to find out in
 

00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:46.399
I still have it installed to find out in
a while but uh but yeah I think it

00:19:46.399 --> 00:19:46.409
a while but uh but yeah I think it
 

00:19:46.409 --> 00:19:47.899
a while but uh but yeah I think it
sample might be good for for the flash

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:47.909
sample might be good for for the flash
 

00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:49.819
sample might be good for for the flash
developers out there yeah and if you're

00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:49.829
developers out there yeah and if you're
 

00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:51.769
developers out there yeah and if you're
using anything else that's not web I

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:51.779
using anything else that's not web I
 

00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:54.049
using anything else that's not web I
mean the the good thing about it being a

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059
mean the the good thing about it being a
 

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.940
mean the the good thing about it being a
REST API is that it pretty much everyone

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:55.950
REST API is that it pretty much everyone
 

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.649
REST API is that it pretty much everyone
can use it as long as your language

00:19:57.649 --> 00:19:57.659
can use it as long as your language
 

00:19:57.659 --> 00:19:59.269
can use it as long as your language
platform or whatever has a way to

00:19:59.269 --> 00:19:59.279
platform or whatever has a way to
 

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:01.369
platform or whatever has a way to
communicate with the interwebs you can

00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:01.379
communicate with the interwebs you can
 

00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:03.229
communicate with the interwebs you can
make REST API calls so like I mean what

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:03.239
make REST API calls so like I mean what
 

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:05.119
make REST API calls so like I mean what
if what if I make in a downloadable you

00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:05.129
if what if I make in a downloadable you
 

00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:07.310
if what if I make in a downloadable you
know exe game can I can I still do it

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320
know exe game can I can I still do it
 

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.999
know exe game can I can I still do it
absolutely

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:08.009
absolutely
 

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.589
absolutely
hell you know well yeah you have to go

00:20:09.589 --> 00:20:09.599
hell you know well yeah you have to go
 

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.389
hell you know well yeah you have to go
through the OAuth flow for for

00:20:11.389 --> 00:20:11.399
through the OAuth flow for for
 

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:12.829
through the OAuth flow for for
downloading applications which is not as

00:20:12.829 --> 00:20:12.839
downloading applications which is not as
 

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:14.899
downloading applications which is not as
fun as the one for web because you might

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:14.909
fun as the one for web because you might
 

00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:16.909
fun as the one for web because you might
have to pop up a browser where the user

00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919
have to pop up a browser where the user
 

00:20:16.919 --> 00:20:18.799
have to pop up a browser where the user
has to log in and authorize your token

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:18.809
has to log in and authorize your token
 

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:20.659
has to log in and authorize your token
but then users are pretty much used to

00:20:20.659 --> 00:20:20.669
but then users are pretty much used to
 

00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:22.339
but then users are pretty much used to
that on downloaded application so it

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:22.349
that on downloaded application so it
 

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:24.349
that on downloaded application so it
shouldn't be anything you so with it if

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:24.359
shouldn't be anything you so with it if
 

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:26.359
shouldn't be anything you so with it if
would I be able to like display a

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:26.369
would I be able to like display a
 

00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:28.940
would I be able to like display a
browser like a browser window within my

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:28.950
browser like a browser window within my
 

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.529
browser like a browser window within my
game or would I be essentially kind of

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539
game or would I be essentially kind of
 

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:33.049
game or would I be essentially kind of
tabbing out all tabbing out to like my

00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059
tabbing out all tabbing out to like my
 

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:34.969
tabbing out all tabbing out to like my
browser you know having the user go

00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:34.979
browser you know having the user go
 

00:20:34.979 --> 00:20:36.799
browser you know having the user go
through click clicking okay and then

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:36.809
through click clicking okay and then
 

00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:38.359
through click clicking okay and then
going back into the game it's pretty

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:38.369
going back into the game it's pretty
 

00:20:38.369 --> 00:20:39.829
going back into the game it's pretty
much I think up to every game but the

00:20:39.829 --> 00:20:39.839
much I think up to every game but the
 

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:41.479
much I think up to every game but the
preferred flow is if you launch the

00:20:41.479 --> 00:20:41.489
preferred flow is if you launch the
 

00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:44.599
preferred flow is if you launch the
actual browser because I mean this would

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:44.609
actual browser because I mean this would
 

00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:46.190
actual browser because I mean this would
only work so it works with an embedded

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200
only work so it works with an embedded
 

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.989
only work so it works with an embedded
browser but the the users gonna feel

00:20:47.989 --> 00:20:47.999
browser but the the users gonna feel
 

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:49.339
browser but the the users gonna feel
much more comfortable if you pop up an

00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:49.349
much more comfortable if you pop up an
 

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:51.560
much more comfortable if you pop up an
actual browser because the whole point

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.570
actual browser because the whole point
 

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.849
actual browser because the whole point
of auth is that users feel very

00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:52.859
of auth is that users feel very
 

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:54.199
of auth is that users feel very
comfortable typing their password

00:20:54.199 --> 00:20:54.209
comfortable typing their password
 

00:20:54.209 --> 00:20:55.549
comfortable typing their password
whenever they know that they are

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559
whenever they know that they are
 

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.919
whenever they know that they are
actually talking to the to the owner of

00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:57.929
actually talking to the to the owner of
 

00:20:57.929 --> 00:20:59.869
actually talking to the to the owner of
that password okay they should be able

00:20:59.869 --> 00:20:59.879
that password okay they should be able
 

00:20:59.879 --> 00:21:02.509
that password okay they should be able
to look at the adat URL bar and know

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:02.519
to look at the adat URL bar and know
 

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:03.680
to look at the adat URL bar and know
that they're talking they are typing

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:03.690
that they're talking they are typing
 

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.269
that they're talking they are typing
their Google password into Google server

00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:05.279
their Google password into Google server
 

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:07.459
their Google password into Google server
so that's the whole point of so

00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:07.469
so that's the whole point of so
 

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:09.979
so that's the whole point of so
definitely prefer using an actual an

00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:09.989
definitely prefer using an actual an
 

00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:12.049
definitely prefer using an actual an
actual browser in their case all right

00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059
actual browser in their case all right
 

00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:13.969
actual browser in their case all right
yeah and then from that point on I mean

00:21:13.969 --> 00:21:13.979
yeah and then from that point on I mean
 

00:21:13.979 --> 00:21:15.619
yeah and then from that point on I mean
once once you're you're over that

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:15.629
once once you're you're over that
 

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.239
once once you're you're over that
authentication part it's pretty much

00:21:17.239 --> 00:21:17.249
authentication part it's pretty much
 

00:21:17.249 --> 00:21:18.409
authentication part it's pretty much
very easy because then you have the

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419
very easy because then you have the
 

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:20.419
very easy because then you have the
token and you can make REST API calls

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:20.429
token and you can make REST API calls
 

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:22.909
token and you can make REST API calls
using that token until it expires

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919
using that token until it expires
 

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:24.529
using that token until it expires
I'll get my to have to renew it but then

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539
I'll get my to have to renew it but then
 

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:27.039
I'll get my to have to renew it but then
it's pretty much straightforward cool

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:27.049
it's pretty much straightforward cool
 

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:29.869
it's pretty much straightforward cool
well all right I think do we have

00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:29.879
well all right I think do we have
 

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:31.219
well all right I think do we have
anything else we're gonna talk about for

00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:31.229
anything else we're gonna talk about for
 

00:21:31.229 --> 00:21:34.579
anything else we're gonna talk about for
this session mmm I guess that's about it

00:21:34.579 --> 00:21:34.589
this session mmm I guess that's about it
 

00:21:34.589 --> 00:21:36.019
this session mmm I guess that's about it
all right well if you are a web

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:36.029
