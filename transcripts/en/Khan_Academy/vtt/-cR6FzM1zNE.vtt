00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.472
- So this darker curve in blue

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:07.552
is the graph of r is equal
to 1 minus cosine of theta,

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.848
of course we're dealing
in polar coordinates here.

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:13.121
And what I'm interested in is
to see if we can figure out

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:17.344
the area enclosed by this curve.

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:19.135
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.247
and try it on your own.

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:23.592
Alright, let's work through it together.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:26.424
So we've already seen, we've
already given ourselves

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:28.416
the intuition for the formula,

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:33.400
that the area enclosed by a polar graph

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.631
is going to be equal to one
half the definite integral

00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:42.631
from our starting theta
to our ending theta,

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:48.135
from alpha to beta, of r
of theta squared d theta.

00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:55.328
And so we, essentially,
just have to apply this

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:58.103
to this function right over here.

00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:01.143
So in this case, the area
is going to be equal to

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:03.871
one half the definite integral.

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.551
Now what's our alpha and what's our beta?

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.127
Well, we're going from theta
is equal to zero radians,

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:11.551
and we're essentially going all the way--

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:13.824
When theta is equal to
zero radians is 1 minus 1

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:15.471
we're right over there.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.335
And then we go all the way around

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.647
to theta is equal to two pi radians.

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:24.768
Notice when we're back at two
pi, cosine of two pi is one,

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:26.542
one minus one is zero again.

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.118
So we get back to that point.

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:30.478
So we're going from theta
is equal to zero radians

00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:34.671
to theta is equal to two pi radians.

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.470
Now what's r of theta squared?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.069
Maybe I'll color code this a little bit.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.190
R of theta squared.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.831
Well it's just going to be
one minus cosine of theta.

00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:49.135
One minus cosine theta squared.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.782
And of course we have our d theta.

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:54.222
We have our d theta.

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:56.535
And now we just have to
evaluate this integral.

00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:58.750
So once again, at any
point you feel inspired,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.230
try to evaluate this.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.046
So let's do this, alright.

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:06.182
So what I would do...

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.166
So this is going to be equal to one half

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.706
times the definite integral
from zero to two pi.

00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:12.144
And let me expand this out.

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:17.144
This is going to be one
minus two cosine theta

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:24.368
plus cosine squared theta, d theta.

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:26.368
D theta.

00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:28.072
Now I know how to take the
anti-derivative of one,

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:29.230
I know how to take the anti-derivitive of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.238
negative cosine of theta,
but cosine squared theta,

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:33.390
this is a little bit...

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.605
It doesn't jump out at you
that you can just do this,

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.979
use u-substitution or something like that,

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.220
but lucky for us, we have
our trigonometric identities,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.995
and so we know.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.306
We know that cosine squared of theta

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:49.963
is just the same thing
as one half times one

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:53.283
plus cosine of two theta.

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:55.011
You learned this in trigonometry class.

00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.324
If you didn't, we'll,
you've learned it just now.

00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.770
And that's why this is
one of the more useful

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.544
trigonometric identities if
you're finding any type of

00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:06.381
anti-derivative or if
you're integrating anything.

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:07.334
And so let's do that.

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:10.846
Let's rewrite this right over here as

00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:15.846
one half times one plus
cosine of two theta.

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.461
And let's see, and maybe we could...

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:23.469
Yeah, let's just do it like that.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.252
I guess we could, if we wanted...

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:26.928
Well, we'll just do it like that.

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:31.928
So this is going to be equal to one half,

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.865
and then we are going to...

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:37.545
One half, now let's just
start taking anti-derivatives.

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:38.979
One half.

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.572
Now the anti-derivative of
one, with respect to theta,

00:03:43.572 --> 00:03:45.896
is just going to be theta.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:49.104
The anti-derivative of
negative two cosine of theta,

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.793
well that's just going to be
negative two sine of theta.

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:54.225
Negative two sine theta.

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:55.057
You can take the derivative,

00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:56.415
the derivative of sine is cosine

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:58.903
and the negative two,
it'll just multiple it

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:00.624
times the derivative of sine of theta

00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:02.545
so it's negative two cosine of theta.

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:05.233
And then we're going to have, let's see...

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:06.348
So let me distribute this.

00:04:06.348 --> 00:04:11.260
This is the same thing
as one half plus one half

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.830
cosine of two theta.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.516
So let's just assume it's this way.

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:19.380
So the anti-derivative of one half,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.677
so the anti-derivative of one-half.

00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:23.100
So I'm really looking at
that right over there.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.693
It's going to be one half theta.

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.084
One half theta.

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:29.659
And then the anti-derivative of one half

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.705
cosine of two theta, let's see...

00:04:33.612 --> 00:04:35.470
The derivative of sine of two theta

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.629
is two cosine of two theta.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.274
So the anti-derivative of this is...

00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:44.979
The anti-derivative of
cosine of two theta,

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.779
and you can do u-substitution if you like,

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.128
but you might be able
to do this in your head,

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:51.848
the anti-derivative of cosine
of two theta is going to be

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:53.848
one half sine of two theta.

00:04:53.848 --> 00:04:56.071
And then you have this
one half right over here.

00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:58.061
So this is going to be...

00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:00.549
Let me show you what I'm
finding the anti-derivative of.

00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:02.868
Of that right over there, of this,

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.437
and I guess this right over here.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:09.437
So this is going to be plus
one fourth sine of two theta.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:14.218
And I encourage you to
find the derivative here

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.447
if that last part was
a little bit confusing.

00:05:16.447 --> 00:05:17.855
The derivative of sine of two theta

00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:19.607
is two cosine of two theta,

00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:21.934
two over one fourth is one half,

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.406
you get to one half cosine of two theta.

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:27.174
And we're going to
evaluate that at two pi,

00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:30.343
at two pi, and at zero.

00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:32.726
So when you evaluate
it, one thing that might

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.377
jump out at you is when
you evaluate this at zero,

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.257
this whole thing,
everything, every term here

00:05:37.257 --> 00:05:39.734
is just going to be zero, so
that simplifies things nicely.

00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:42.843
So we really just have
to take one half of...

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.179
It evaluated at two pi.

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:48.789
So this is going to be
one half times two pi,

00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:53.329
two pi, and then sine of two pi is zero,

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:55.104
so that's just going to be zero.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.199
And then plus one half times two pi,

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.588
so that's going to be plus pi.

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:03.997
And then sign of two times
two pi sine of four pi,

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.494
that's still going to be zero.

00:06:05.494 --> 00:06:08.110
So this is going to be zero as well,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.397
and we are almost done.

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:13.318
So this is going to be
one half times three pi

00:06:13.318 --> 00:06:18.318
or three halves, three
halves pi is the area,

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:23.514
is the area of this region.
