00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.260
So, Charles, what did we learn about regression?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt; well, we learned a bunch of interesting historical facts about

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.570
where the word came from, which I thought was interesting anyway.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.672
&gt;&gt; Oh good.

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:16.930
&gt;&gt; We learned about model selection and overfitting.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.300
And underfitting. And fitting in general, cross validation.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.920
&gt;&gt; Talked about, how to do linear and polynomial regression.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.888
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:32.119
&gt;&gt; That the best constant, that the best

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.195
constant in terms of squared error is the mean.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:36.828
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.599
&gt;&gt; These little cocktails for that.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.285
&gt;&gt; Well we also did the same thing for well we talked about

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:49.050
the process for how you do it in genreral for any polynomial function.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.300
&gt;&gt; I think that's everything.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.710
&gt;&gt; Well one more thing, and we talked a little

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.875
bit about representation, and how to make that work in regression.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.460
&gt;&gt; Great, we talked about input representations

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610
and what some of the issues are. There.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.930
&gt;&gt; Great, I think that's, I think that's a good amount.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.450
&gt;&gt; I think so, too.
