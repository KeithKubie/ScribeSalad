00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.600
If we were to rewind the clock
back about 70 million years,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.690
you would see dinosaurs
roaming the Earth.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.520
And this is a very nice picture
here of a dinosaur enjoying

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.230
a sunset at the beach.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.790
But unfortunately
for the dinosaurs,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.750
about 65 million years ago, we
believe that a huge meteorite

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.770
struck the earth and essentially
wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.256
And it probably wiped out a
bunch of other species with it.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.880
Because you can
imagine, the shock wave

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.210
itself would just
exterminate tons of species.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.830
Then you would have the
tsunami of unimaginable size

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.470
that would just
envelop the continents

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.497
for some period of time.

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:39.330
And then you would have
all of the soot that

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.684
would go into the air and maybe
make it impossible for most

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:44.350
of the plant species
to live, because it

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.660
would be blocking out
all of the sunlight.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.250
And so in an
environment like that,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.020
we could imagine that
an animal like this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.860
would be well suited to survive.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380
It's sitting there underground.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.100
Maybe it can
hibernate in some way,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.600
so it doesn't need food
for long periods of time.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.070
Maybe it has its own food
stash under there someplace.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
And so we believe that our
ancient, ancient, ancient,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.450
ancient, ancient ancestors,
after this mass extinction

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.980
event, might have been
something like this-- kind

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.210
of a mole-looking, rodent animal
that was protected from all

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.590
of this craziness that was
happening on the surface,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.560
because they like to hang
out underground and have

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.790
all their food nearby them.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.440
And maybe they could
hibernate in some way.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.155
So you could imagine, once
everything settled down--

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:28.530
and now we're
talking, who knows,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.282
hundreds of years, thousands of
years, even millions of years--

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:34.740
some of this guy's descendants
start to poke their head out

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.180
of the ground.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.150
And they're like, you know what?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.209
There's food in trees.

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.750
And there's no one
else in the trees.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.900
And trees are a good
place to maybe get away

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.500
from some of the
other predators that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.250
have managed to survive
this mass extinction event.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.730
And some of its
descendants, I should say,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.770
that were good at climbing
trees decide, hey, let's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.420
try this tree thing out.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.390
And so you started to have some
selection for the descendants

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.410
of this rodent that
could climb trees well.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.160
They were able to find
food where their ancestors

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.660
couldn't .

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.201
They could find protection in
the trees where their ancestors

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:04.870
couldn't.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.280
And so you could imagine that
some subset of this guy's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.960
descendants evolved
into something

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.679
that might have
looked like this guy.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.220
And all the pictures
I'm showing you,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.020
these are of modern
animals, except for,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.019
of course, the dinosaur.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.280
I'm sure this was kind of
Photoshopped in some way.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.610
This is a modern bush baby.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.026
But I show this
picture because it

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:22.820
could have been what some
of these primitive primates

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.660
looked like.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.410
Because a bush baby, it
kind of a climbs trees.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.660
It kind of looks like it's
starting to get a hand here

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.270
to start climbing the trees.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.142
But it also has
rodent-like qualities.

00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:34.100
But this is, of course,
a modern version of it.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.710
So this bush baby's ancient,
ancient, ancient ancestor

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.710
might have been that
primitive primate

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.280
or that species of
primitive primate

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.905
that was a descendant of rodents
that starts to say, hey, let's

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.710
see if we can climb these
trees and find some food.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.590
And then some of its
descendants might

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.870
have had just the right
adaptations, found

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.090
their own little niche
in the right ecosystems.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.471
And they would have
evolved into monkeys.

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:57.970
Once again, this
is a modern monkey,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.750
but you could imagine some
type of primitive monkey.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.440
And then some of those
primitive monkeys' descendants,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.820
they turn into these
modern monkeys eventually.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.500
But some of them, they
grow larger in size.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.960
They spend more time
outside of trees.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.945
They lose their tail.

00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:13.570
They don't need it
as much for balance.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.220
Maybe it's actually
a bad thing to have,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.636
because someone
else could grab it

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.610
when you're in a fight
or something like that.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.530
And they evolve into apes, and
in particular, the great apes.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.390
So one of the great apes.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.140
The great apes involve
gorillas and chimpanzees

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.020
and the ancestor.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.020
Or really, the great apes
also include humanity.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.360
So let me just review
back on this timeline,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.930
just so that we
don't get confused.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.280
I'll review what we
just talked about.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.590
So before this mass
extinction event,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.160
65 million years ago, you had
all these types of species

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.950
here.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.785
Maybe this right up here.

00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:54.410
Actually, if I'm
talking about species,

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.832
maybe this was
Tyrannosaurus Rex,

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:57.540
because the dinosaurs
involve whole bunch

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.160
of-- so this might
have been T Rex.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.050
And there's a bunch of species
that we could list over here.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.370
But after that mass
extinction event,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.950
that was an endpoint
for a ton of species,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.790
except for maybe this primitive
rodent mole-like thing.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.899
Maybe a lot of them
died in this event.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.519
But just enough of them survived
because they were underground

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.939
or just in the
right place or they

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.147
were in a mountain someplace.

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:24.610
Who knows where they were?

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.480
And some of them were able to
evolve into primitive primates.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.580
And once again, these are
pictures of primitive primates.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.080
And when I say primitive, these
are modern versions of them.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.040
So primitive doesn't necessarily
mean worse, because obviously,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.325
these guys, even
in today's world,

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.700
they have a niche
for themselves.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.980
They're able to find
food and reproduce

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.690
in ways that don't get in
the way of other people

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.690
and the way people don't
get in the way of them.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.290
When I talk about
primitive primate,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.706
I'm just talking about kind
of an ancestral primate, maybe

00:04:55.706 --> 00:04:57.999
something that's
not there today.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.290
Although maybe some of those
descendents look very much

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.420
like it.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.710
But anyway, some
of those primates

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.500
evolve into primitive monkeys.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.720
Some of those primitive
monkeys' descendants

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.000
become modern monkeys.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.600
So I'll call it M monkeys,
for Modern monkeys.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.250
And some of them evolve
into primitive apes.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.670
And apes, their
distinctive characteristic

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.160
is that they're like monkeys,
but they don't have tails,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.860
and they're larger
than most monkeys.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.580
And so these primitive apes,
some of their descendants

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.340
are modern gorillas.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.100
At some point, they break off.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.930
Some of these descendants
are an ancestor

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.210
of both modern chimpanzees
and of human beings.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.360
And we think, just looking
at the DNA evidence,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.830
we think that this
departure right

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.329
here-- and the
fossil evidence-- was

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.940
about seven million years ago.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.500
That's our best guess for
when we, as human beings,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.180
had a common ancestor
with the chimpanzees.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.840
Now, you have that
common ancestor.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.900
Some of that common
ancestor's descendants

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.890
became modern chimpanzees.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.790
And some of them-- maybe they
explored the right ecosystem,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.870
where it was more
advantageous to do so--

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.580
started to walk on two legs.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.330
And the most famous
fossil of this

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.840
is the australopithicine
fossil of Lucy

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.210
that was discovered
3.2 million years-- it

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.540
was discovered more recently.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.340
It's 3.2 million years old.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.910
So the whole
genus-- and genus is

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.880
kind of one level of
categorization above species.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.970
The whole genus of
australopithecine, these

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.330
were four to two
million years ago.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.080
And we never know.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.320
You could always
find a fossil that's

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.945
older than this,
maybe newer than this.

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:42.930
I read one account that says,
maybe one million years ago.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.470
But give or take,
the Lucy fossil,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.780
which is the most
well established

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.160
australopithecine fossil, is
about three million years old.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.190
And this is a reconstruction
I have over here of Lucy.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.540
So this is probably
what Lucy looked like.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.150
And once again, there
were many Lucys.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.566
It wasn't just
there was one Lucy.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.100
And we're all
descended from Lucys.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.150
And it's actually not
even clear that we're even

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.670
descended directly
from australopithecine.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.340
We might be a cousin species or
a cousin genus, I should say.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.804
Genus is the category
right above species.

00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:15.720
So if you fast forward
a little bit more-- you

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.840
go to about 2.3 to 1.4
million years ago--

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.660
we see fossils that
they're standing upright.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.230
The brain size is bigger.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.840
Because if you look at the
australopithecine fossils,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.090
they are standing upright.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.840
But they're cranial
capacity isn't

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.040
that different than chimpanzees.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.180
You fast forward to 2.3 million
to 1.4 million years ago,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.930
we start to see fossils where
they're standing upright still.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.620
And the cranial
capacity has grown.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.240
And you're starting
to see primitive stone

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.120
tools around the bone fossils.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.650
And so we believe that
these are one of the first.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.720
And this is really just
how we categorize it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.700
But these are some of the first
fossils that we categorize

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.750
as belonging to the
same genus as ours.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.390
And the genus is Homo.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.950
And Homo just means man.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.549
So it's the group right
above species of man.

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:15.340
And we call them similar
to man, because it

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.360
looks like they're starting
to make primitive stone tools.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.370
And they stand upright like us.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.550
And they have larger
cranial capacities

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.060
than the australopithecine
fossils or modern chimpanzees.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.382
And once again, we don't know
if Homo habilis, which literally

00:08:31.382 --> 00:08:32.840
means-- so the Homo
part means man.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.520
Habilis means handy, because he
liked to, I guess, make tools

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.419
or whatever else.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.840
We don't know if Homo habilis is
a descendant of Lucy's species

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.140
of Australopithecus or
maybe a cousin species.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.160
Maybe they're both descendents
from some common ancestor.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.920
We're not quite sure.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.830
Then you fast forward
a little bit more.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:09:00.200
We're talking now about 1.8
to 1.38 million years ago.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.880
And we start seeing fossils
where the cranial capacity

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.360
larger than Homo habilis,
getting closer in size

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.530
to what our notion is of
kind of a modern person's

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.820
cranial capacity, at least
relative to body size.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.225
And this is Homo erectus.

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.100
And once again, we don't
know if Homo erectus

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.920
is the descendant
of Homo habilis.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.050
Maybe they have a
common ancestor.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.640
Who knows?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.280
And it looks from
the fossil evidence

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.990
that there was, especially when
you look at this range here,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.180
some overlap where you had
both Homo erectus and Homo

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.210
habilis living on the same
planet at the same time.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.340
Now, you fast forward even more.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.570
And we think about 600,000
to 300,000-- once again,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.890
all of these are
constantly being modified,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.370
as we get better at
finding new fossils

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.880
or interpreting
the fossils we have

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.920
or we look at DNA
evidence or whatever.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.980
About 600,000 to 300,000 years
ago, the Neanderthals appear.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.340
And Neanderthals are in
the same genus as humans.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.534
So it's really Homo
neanderthalensis.

00:10:03.534 --> 00:10:04.950
I always have
trouble saying this.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.330
So this is still part of Homo.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.890
And a common misconception
is that the Neanderthals are

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.405
somehow a more primitive
version of humans,

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.530
that they're somehow cavemen,
and we're modern men.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.210
That's not the case.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.960
The belief is that
Neanderthals are either

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.730
cousin species-- we
have a common ancestor--

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.670
or that they're actually a
sub-species of human beings.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.380
And there's some
belief that they

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.690
might have interbred
with Homo sapiens.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.900
And maybe some or a good number
of us have a Neanderthal genes.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.090
And it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.260
It's just something,
unfortunately,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.080
that Neanderthals just get a
bad name, because of, I guess,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.710
our popular culture.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.297
So this is a drawing
of a Neanderthal brain.

00:10:47.297 --> 00:10:49.380
They actually had a fairly
large cranial capacity.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.215
Although scientists, they kind
of make one reason or another

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:53.590
why we think that
they might have

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.270
been more primitive
than Homo sapiens.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.040
But who knows?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.750
We don't know.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.430
We're constantly learning
things every day.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.080
But of course, the
whole point of this

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.470
is to talk about how humans
showed up on this planet.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.480
And the first
really human fossils

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.020
we find about 200,000 years ago.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.120
And remember, we're
in the genus Homo.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.920
And now, we've finally found
something that looks just

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.590
like us, anatomically, at least.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.790
We can't study its
behavior and all the rest.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.800
And now we get to Homo sapiens.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.150
The Homo part, once
again, means man.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.640
And the sapiens means thinking.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.400
So we can debate whether
it's an appropriate title

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.160
for our species, but
it's "thinking man."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.800
So once again, the
Neanderthals, they

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.776
were either a cousin species
for a lot of this time,

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:43.400
especially once Homo
sapiens showed up.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.440
And maybe Homo sapiens
showed up before this.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.150
We just haven't found
the fossils yet.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.440
They were maybe both
inhabiting the same planet.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.360
Maybe there was
some interbreeding.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.810
But the Neanderthals disappeared
about 30,000 years ago.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.550
30,000 years ago,
these guys disappeared.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.550
Maybe some of them
kind of got mixed

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.000
in with the Homo
sapiens, started

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.020
to interbreed with them.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.300
Or they might have
just been killed off,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.910
because they were fighting
over the same ecosystems.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.230
And I've made a little
sample here of Homo sapiens.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.000
Well, I'm assuming most of you
watching this video are one.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.140
But just in case,
here's my little sample.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.840
We can debate how representative
a sample of our species

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.950
this really is.
