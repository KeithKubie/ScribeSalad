YUJIN NAGASAWA:
Thank you very much.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.420
Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.340
So according to recent
surveys, over 80%

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.240
of people in the US and
the UK believe in miracles.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.650
And I think that's very
astonishing because now we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400
rely on all sorts of
scientific technology

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.560
like smartphones, computers,
and other scientific tools.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.070
So why do we still
believe in miracles?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.340
So first of all,
I'd like to find out

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.410
why we still
believe in miracles,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.990
and whether it is rational
to believe in miracles.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.930
So let me start
with some examples.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.500
So this woman was making
a toasted cheese sandwich.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.120
And then she realized
that there was

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.800
a burn pattern on a slice
of toast which looked,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.850
according to her, just
like the Virgin Mary.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.890
And she thought that
this was a miracle

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.530
so she kept it in
a plastic container

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.810
for more than 10 years.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.950
And meanwhile, she won a
lot of money at the casino.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.180
So she thought that this
is a miraculous object.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.230
But for some reason, she
decided to sell it on eBay.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.880
And she managed to
earn $28,000, which

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
is probably more miraculous
than this object itself.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.130
Should we say that
this is a miracle?

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.250
I think the answer is
no, because this is just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.870
a coincidence.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.020
Given that millions
of slices of toast

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.000
are made around the
world, it's not a surprise

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.080
that occasionally we see
this kind of strange pattern.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.650
What about this case?

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.360
This is another example
of a coincidence.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.680
So in 1950, there was a massive
explosion at the local church

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.460
in Nebraska.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.500
And when the
explosion took place,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.630
everyone thought
that a lot of people

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.230
were killed because they
were supposed to have

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.420
a meeting of the church choir.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.640
But surprisingly,
every single member

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.670
had a trivial reason to
be late for the meeting

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.110
only on that day.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.510
So these members are
always very punctual.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.990
But only on this day
everyone had a trivial reason

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.620
to be late for the meeting.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.580
So for example, one of
them was on the phone

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.490
and she just forgot
about the meeting.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.060
Another one was
listening to the radio

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.690
and she couldn't turn it off.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.970
Another one was writing
an important letter

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.310
and she forgot about
the meeting as well.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.740
So they had all sorts
of silly reasons

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.630
to be late for the meeting.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.100
And then there was
this massive explosion.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.590
And of course, they
thought this is a miracle,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.170
because no one was hurt.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.150
So they thought that God saved
them from this explosion.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.670
But I would still say
that this is not exactly

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.900
a miracle, at least in
a philosophical sense,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.080
because given that there
are billions of people

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.200
on this planet doing all
sorts of things every day,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.095
occasionally we encounter this
kind of unusual coincidence.

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:30.470
But it is difficult
for us to say

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.070
that this is a miracle in the
philosophical or theological

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.350
sense.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.130
So here I would like to
introduce three different types

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.440
of impossibility.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.430
So certain events are
probabilistically impossible.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.130
So these coincidences
are probabilistically

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.870
impossible or unlikely.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.040
But these events can take
place, unless the probability

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.550
of these events taking
place is exactly zero.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.550
So again, given that there are
so many people around the world

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.250
doing so many different
things, occasionally

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.970
these probabilistically
unlikely or impossible events

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.060
can take place.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.150
So I think miracles cannot be
probabilistically impossible.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.660
Miracles have to involve
some kind of impossibility,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.379
but it cannot be a
probabilistic impossibility.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.260
It has to be something
stronger than

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.750
probabilistic impossibility.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.550
So what about logical
impossibility?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.410
So certain acts are logically
impossible to perform.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.150
So for example, it is
logically impossible to draw

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.990
a square circle or
create a married bachelor

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.240
or make one plus one five.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.550
So they are logically
impossible tasks.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.600
So it is necessarily impossible
to perform these tasks.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.930
Now, I think this is a
little bit too strong.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.400
We cannot say that miracles
are logically impossible tasks,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.820
because miracles are
supposed to happen.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.870
But if it is necessarily
impossible as a matter of logic

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.390
to perform these tasks, then
they cannot be performed.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.140
So even theistic philosophers
often claim that God cannot

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.330
perform logically
impossible tasks,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.350
because these logically
impossible tasks are not real

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.980
tasks.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.350
They sound like tasks,
but actually no one

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.200
can perform it in any
possible situation.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.210
So that means that they
are not authentic tasks.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.510
So what we need is
something between

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.130
probabilistic impossibility
and logical impossibility.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.570
So my suggestion is that
miracles are nomologically

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.300
impossible events, which means
that miracles cannot take place

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.790
given the laws of nature.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.750
So our universe is governed
by the laws of nature.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.210
And when they are violated,
these miracle workers

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.665
can perform miracles.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.630
So this is a typical
philosophical definition

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.100
of a miracle.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.160
A miracle is a violation
of the laws of nature

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.100
that is caused by
an intentional agent

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.220
and it has religious
significance.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.140
So a miracle has to be
caused by some agent like God

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.450
or an angel who have
free will and intention.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.260
And also they have to have
some religious significance.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.010
So normally, miracles
have positive outcomes.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.400
It would be a little bit odd to
say a miracle has taken place,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.990
but it's really bad.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.490
So normally, miracles
have some positive impact.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.890
And most importantly,
miracles have

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.000
to violate the laws of nature.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.170
So this is the key
feature of miracles.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.770
So if you look at many examples
in religious scriptures,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.850
then you can see that they all
violate the laws of nature.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.820
So for example,
Jesus is reported

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.280
to have resurrected Lazarus, who
had been dead for several days.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.380
And we cannot resurrect someone
who had been dead for many days

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.500
without violating
the laws of nature.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.190
Or Jesus is reported
to have walked on water

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.550
or transformed water into wine.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.080
And they all require violations
of the laws of nature.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.930
And miracles are also reported
in religious scriptures

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.640
in the East.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.760
So for example, the
Buddha, when he was born,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.710
he immediately walked
seven steps north.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.950
And then he said, I
am chief of the world.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.010
And again, without violating
the laws of nature,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.890
it is impossible
for a newborn baby

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.850
to walk and speak like this.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.740
So that's why we can say
that this is a miracle.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.500
Now, there are many
different types of miracles.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.290
So there are so many, but I'd
like to introduce some of them.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.870
Producing substances.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.240
So for instance,
Mohammad is believed

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.310
to have filled an empty well or
filled an empty bag of barley

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.050
for a hungry man.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.170
Controlling weather.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.100
So Jesus, according
to the New Testament,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.900
Jesus rebuked a fierce
rainstorm on the Sea of Galilee.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.880
Controlling the
sun and the moon.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.600
Mohammad for
example, is believed

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.050
to have changed the
movement of the sun

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.230
or split the moon in two.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.170
Controlling
geographical features.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.830
So according to
the Old Testament,

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.350
in response to
Moses' request, God

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.580
parted the Red Sea so
that Moses and his people

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.410
can escape from
the Egyptian army.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.480
Teleportation and bilocation.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.690
Many Hindu saints and
gurus are reported

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.350
to have appeared in two
places at the same time

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.600
or teleported from one
location to another instantly.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.310
Transfiguration.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.350
According to the New Testament,
Jesus transfigured himself

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.640
on a mountain.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.390
So he suddenly became
a very strong light,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:46.050
which is understood to
represent his heavenly glory.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.680
Stigmata is well known in
the Catholic tradition.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.030
So this includes
all sorts of scars

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.500
that appear on people's bodies
that correspond to the wounds

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.420
that Jesus had.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.690
So this is a symbolic miracle.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.510
Healing is also very
widely reported in almost

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.850
in all religious traditions.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.360
So Jesus, Mohammad, and
the Buddha and so on,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.100
all of these leaders of
the world's great religion

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.220
are believed to have healed
sick people, often instantly.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.315
Raising the dead.

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:27.210
So as I mentioned,
Jesus is believed

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.030
to have resurrected dead people.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:35.430
And there are similar episodes
in the Old Testament as well.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.950
Supernatural perception includes
precognition, retro-cognition,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.780
and mind reading.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.720
So these miracle
workers, they can

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.900
predict what will happen
in future exactly,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.680
or they can immediately grasp
what happened in the past.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.470
Or they can read people's
minds accurately.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.590
Controlling immaterial spirits.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.960
Probably the best
example is exorcism.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.640
So exorcism is a
religious practice

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.125
to evict an evil spirit
that is possessing a human.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:13.050
So if you remember the
film "The Exorcist,"

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.330
the priest tries to evict
an evil spirit from a girl.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.440
Spiritual communication
includes all sorts of ways

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.220
for a supernatural being,
supernatural beings

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.390
to communicate with people.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.800
So sometimes these
beings appear in dreams,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.750
and sometimes they appear
in religious experiences,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.875
and sometimes they appear
as apparitions, as ghosts.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.180
Now, what I find very
interesting is that many

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.430
of these leaders of the world's
great religions-- like Jesus,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.740
the Buddha,
Mohammad, and so on--

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.694
they are reported to have
performed miracles themselves.

00:11:57.694 --> 00:11:59.110
But at the same
time, they are not

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.520
particularly enthusiastic
about miracles.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.890
So they warn against
dependence on miracles,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.050
which I find very puzzling.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.450
So for example, the
Buddha met a yogi one day

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.590
who was trying to walk on
water for several years.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.827
And then the Buddha
said, why do you do this?

00:12:18.827 --> 00:12:20.910
This is just a waste of
time, because you can just

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.130
take a ferry for a
small change to go

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.620
to the other side of the river.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.670
So you are just
wasting your time.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:34.210
Or in the New Testament, Jesus
was challenged by the devil.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.880
And the devil says that you
have to turn rocks into bread

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.570
or jump off from a high
temple without getting hurt.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.840
And then Jesus simply refused.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.950
If Jesus was a miracle
worker, then of course,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.110
he could have performed
these miracles.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.520
But he simply refused, which
is quite interesting and also

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.330
puzzling.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.750
But I would like to come back to
this point a little bit later.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.350
So as I said earlier, according
to recent surveys, many people,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.140
the majority of people
still believe in miracles.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.280
And I would like to explain why.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.410
Because again, we rely
on scientific knowledge

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.650
and technology, but still
we believe in something

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.710
beyond science.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.400
And why is that?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.020
My hypothesis is that there
are some psychological reasons

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.920
that people tend to
form belief in miracles.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.000
So there are some cognitive
and developmental reasons

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.540
that people form
belief in miracles.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.210
So let me introduce some
psychological studies

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.360
that are relevant here.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.000
So according to some
developmental psychologists,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.390
even infants can
detect violations

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.130
of the laws of nature.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.120
So again, miracles have
to involve violations

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.090
of the laws of nature.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.880
This means that in order to
detect a miracle, first of all,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.360
you have to know what
the laws of nature are,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.770
how nature is operated
according to the laws,

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.920
and also you have to be
able to grasp it immediately

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.630
when they are violated.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.680
And this sounds like a very
sophisticated cognitive

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.800
process, but according
to some psychologists,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.050
even 2.5-month-old babies can
detect violations of the laws

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.130
of nature.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.350
So for example,
they show a toy lion

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:44.010
to children-- babies-- that
appear to vanish suddenly,

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.820
or a toy car that appears
to hover in the air.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.230
And then these babies,
they express surprise.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.210
And sometimes they
bang these toys

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.090
to see how that could happen.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.270
Or sometimes they try to
duplicate these violations

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.210
of the laws of nature.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.050
So this suggests that
they have innate knowledge

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.960
of the laws of nature, and
when they are violated,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.570
they can immediately grasp it.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.540
So it looks like we have
this natural tendency

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:19.950
to see violations of
the laws of nature.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.140
And these developmental
psychologists,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.530
they say that this
element of surprise

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.265
is very important for
children's learning process.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.880
Another relevant
psychological study

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.660
here is a detection of
agents, faces, and voices.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.520
So some psychologists
claim that we

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.760
are good at scanning
our environment

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.930
and then find agency there.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:56.520
So relevant concept here is the
hyperactive agency detection

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.340
device.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.410
So this is a cognitive device.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.190
It's not a material device,
but it's a cognitive device

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.940
that everyone has.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.350
So when we see the
clouds in the sky,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.650
we might see strange
faces or animals.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.190
And that's because we all
have the hyperactive agency

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.510
detection device.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.200
So we are good at
finding agency in nature.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.790
So here's an example.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.590
So this is the face on Mars.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.860
This is a geological
structure on Mars,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.280
which appears to be a face.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.890
It's very difficult for
us not to see a face,

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.500
even though this
structure looks quite

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.960
different from different angles.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.810
And sometimes this
kind of phenomenon

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.040
is called pareidolia, which is
a psychological phenomenon where

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.917
we see something meaningful
in random information.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.880
According to
psychologists, we also

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.120
detect the intention
of agents in nature.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.880
So if you ask small children
why rocks are pointy

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.670
or why the sunlight
is warm, they

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.700
tend to provide
teleological explanations.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.609
They tend to explain
these natural phenomena

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.440
in terms of purpose.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.710
So they might say rocks are
pointy so that the birds cannot

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:27.200
sit down on them, or, the
sunlight is warm so that it can

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.990
warm up animals.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.080
So they appeal to
purpose when they try

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.570
to explain natural phenomena.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.240
And adults have this
kind of tendency as well.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.870
So maybe that's why when we
encounter unusual events,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.890
we might intuitively
think that this

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.960
is caused by God or
some supernatural

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.740
being with intention.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.480
Children are also good at
detecting supernatural beings.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.260
So they tend to attribute
supernatural properties

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.490
to humans as well.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.890
So the Swiss psychologist
Piaget, Jean Piaget,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.870
he interviewed many children.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.530
And he discovered that
they tend to attribute

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.080
these unusual supernatural
properties to adults.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.940
So for example, he talks about
a girl who asked her aunt

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.900
to make it rain,
or a boy who was

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.140
puzzled when his father
didn't know something.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.250
So children tend to attribute
the properties of omniscience

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.710
or omnipotence to adults.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.400
Maybe that's another
indirect reason

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.490
that people and
especially children

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.310
tend to see something
supernatural in nature.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.220
Minimally
counterintuitive concepts.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:55.350
This is also relevant to the
psychological work related

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.270
to supernatural beliefs.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.970
According to some psychologists,
well-known miracle stories,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.890
they involve so-called minimally
counterintuitive concepts.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.370
So these are concepts
that are somewhat

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.460
surprising and counterintuitive
and contradictory,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.610
but they are not
overly contradictory.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.220
And this concept
spreads very well,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.980
because it's very easy to
remember these stories,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.884
because they have some
counterintuitive elements.

00:19:29.884 --> 00:19:31.300
But at the same
time, they are not

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.670
difficult to remember
because these stories are

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.980
pretty straightforward, only
minimally counterintuitive.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.000
So here's an example.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.530
So about 100 years ago
there was a girl called

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.300
Okiku in Hokkaido, Japan.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.590
And one day, her father
bought her this little doll.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.930
And Okiku loved
the doll very much.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.340
And she played with it every day
and slept with it every night.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.810
But sadly, Okiku passed away
after a couple of years.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.960
And after her death,
people realized

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.910
that the hair of
the doll had grown.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.890
And they thought that
this is because Okiku

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.290
loved the doll so much that
her spirit possessed this doll.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.800
That's why the hair had grown.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.460
And this is a good example of
a minimally counterintuitive

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.420
concept.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.970
The whole story is pretty
straightforward and easy

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.050
to remember.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.500
But at the same time, there's
one catchy counterintuitive

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.070
element, which is the
growing hair of the doll.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.890
And according to
psychologists, stories

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.610
like this spread very
well and they last

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.200
for a long time over
many generations.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.650
And if you see many
miracle episodes

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.910
in religious scriptures, such as
Jesus turning water into wine,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.060
or walking on water, or
resurrecting the dead,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.405
they all involve minimally
counterintuitive concepts.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.250
So we have seen various
psychological studies

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.710
that seem to suggest
that we are cognitively

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.070
biased towards forming
belief in miracles.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.500
But that doesn't necessarily
mean that it's always

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.780
irrational to
believe in miracles,

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.790
or miracles can
never take place.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.170
Here is a parallel example.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.370
So suppose that
psychologists discover

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:42.580
that I tend to see an illusion
of a can of beer in my fridge

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.500
when I'm very thirsty.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.230
Now I go home and
open my fridge,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.940
and I see a can of beer.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.850
Does that mean that
I'm seeing an illusion?

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.840
That's not so obvious.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.910
Maybe I bought a can
of beer last night

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.440
and that's why it's there.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.350
So even if we have
this natural tendency

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.200
to form belief in miracles,
that doesn't necessarily

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.300
mean that miracles
can never take place,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.230
or every time when we encounter
miracles, they are illusions.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.710
That's why I'd like to
address this question next.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.320
Is it rational to
believe in miracles?

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.000
Carl Sagan was an American
astronomer and science fiction

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.840
writer.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.570
And he introduced
this famous slogan,

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.970
"Extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence."

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.160
So he says that in
order to establish

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.230
something
extraordinary, you have

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.110
to have extraordinary evidence.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.750
So suppose that my friend says
that he saw a fox in his garden

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.420
last night.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.780
Now, I know that this
friend is very trustworthy,

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.060
and he almost never lies.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.860
And also I know that foxes have
been observed in his village.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.860
And I have pretty good reason
to believe that he has actually

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.420
seen a fox in his garden.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.920
But suppose instead, he
says that he saw a Martian

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.260
in his garden last night.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.840
Can we believe that on the
basis of similar evidence?

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.010
No, because now his new
claim is extraordinary.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.930
He says that he saw a Martian.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.200
That's an extraordinary
claim, so we

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.440
need extraordinary
evidence to believe him.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:41.270
David Hume is a Scottish
philosopher, the 18th century

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.380
Scottish philosopher.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.670
And he appealed to
a similar reasoning

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.880
to show that it is always
unreasonable to believe

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.610
in miracles, or we
can never be justified

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.550
in believing in miracles.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.100
So here is a summary
of his argument.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.700
So he says, gather as
much evidence as possible

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.340
for a miracle.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.840
It can never be strong enough
to establish your belief,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.190
because evidence
against a miracle

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.820
is always much, much
bigger, because again,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.130
according to our
definition, a miracle

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.900
is a violation of
the laws of nature,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.610
which means that any
evidence against a miracle

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.352
includes the entire
laws of nature.

00:24:27.352 --> 00:24:29.310
But there is nothing more
certain than the laws

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.900
of nature, because
the laws of nature

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.550
are based on constant
observations of how

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.630
nature operates.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.770
So no matter how much evidence
we gather for a miracle,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:45.060
that's never strong enough
to establish our belief

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.110
in miracles.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.750
That's Hume's argument.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.510
So he says that that is
always unreasonable to believe

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.540
in miracles, or it is we
can never be justified

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.410
in believing in miracles.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.320
But again, I want to emphasize
that this does not necessarily

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.660
mean that miracles
can never take place.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.770
All he says is that even if
a miracle can take place,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.360
there is no situation in which
we are justified in believing

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.770
that it has taken place.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.900
So at this point, I
would like to consider

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.870
if there can be a
miracle that doesn't

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.030
involve a violation
of the laws of nature.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:36.110
So I want to focus on what I
call extremely altruistic act.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.720
An extremely altruistic
act is an act

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.196
to sacrifice one's own life
to save a stranger's life.

00:25:44.196 --> 00:25:47.720
So let me introduce
some examples.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.920
So in 1982, Florida
Air Flight 90

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.820
took off from Washington
National Airport,

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.800
and the weather was
really terrible.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.930
There was a snowstorm.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.760
And then the aircraft
couldn't gain altitude,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.970
and it smashed into
a frozen river there.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.000
And most of the
passengers were killed,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.640
and only a very small
number of them survived.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.320
And a rescue helicopter came
and they threw a life ring.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.360
And you can find footage of
this incident on the web.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.610
And it's really heartbreaking.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.400
It's very difficult
to rescue them

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.220
because they are so cold
that they even struggled

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.650
to grab the life ring.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:41.150
And at one point, a bystander
jumped into the frozen river

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.350
to rescue one of the passengers.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.920
That's also an act of altruism.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.620
And then one of the
passengers who survived

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:54.290
was Arland D. Williams Jr.
And every time a life ring was

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.700
thrown, he grabbed
it, and then hand it

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.220
to a different passenger
instead of using it for himself.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.020
And eventually these
passengers were rescued.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.030
And then the
helicopter went back

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:14.540
to rescue finally Williams,
but he was already gone.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.300
So this is an act of what I call
extreme altruism because this

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.670
is an act to prioritize other
people's lives, stranger's

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.490
lives, and sacrifice
one's own life.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.850
Here's another example.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.480
Maximilian Kolbe
was a Polish priest

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.860
in the first half
of the 20th century.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.180
He was sent to the
Auschwitz death camp.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.610
And one day,
another prisoner was

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.280
selected to be sent to
a starvation bunker.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.080
And he cried and
screamed, saying,

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.930
I have a wife and a
child and I cannot die.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.010
I don't want to be sent
to a starvation bunker.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.680
And then Kolbe came
in and he said,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.090
I'd like to replace this man.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.180
I would like to substitute
him, because I'm a priest

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.690
and I don't have a family.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.820
So send me instead of him
to the starvation bunker.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.680
And he survived in
the starvation bunker

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.530
for a long time.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.710
But eventually he
was killed there.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:24.470
And this is another example of
an extremely altruistic act.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.140
And I talk about
extremely altruistic acts

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.140
because they are not
exactly miracles,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.920
but they do something
similar to that.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.700
Extremely altruist acts
evoke awe and surprise

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.000
because they violate, through
the altruistic person's

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.390
own willpower, a
strong behavioral trait

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.900
that humans have acquired
through the long process

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.540
of evolution.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.600
So these acts don't
violate the laws of nature,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.610
but they still violate
our behavioral trait

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.860
to prioritize our own survival.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.910
So we have developed
this kind of trait

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.790
through the long
process of evolution

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:07.910
and natural selection.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.810
So our biological
interest should

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.680
be to survive and
propagate our own genes.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.820
But these altruists, they
sacrifice their own survival

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.750
to save others.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.890
So there is something
contradictory.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.690
It's not exactly a violation
of the laws of nature,

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.100
but something
comparable to that.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.000
Now, there are many
scientific theories

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.910
to explain away altruism.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:44.030
So there are animals
that act altruistically.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.440
And biologists try to explain
how that could happen.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.040
So for example, group
selection theory

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.440
says that natural
selection can take place

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.470
at the level of a group
instead of individuals.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.680
Or kin selection theory
says that sometimes it

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.210
is genetically beneficial
to act altruistically

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:12.880
towards genetically
related individuals.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.180
Or reciprocation theory
says that some animals,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.730
even if they are in
different species,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:24.520
they act altruistically because
these altruistic acts are

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.980
mutually beneficial, and so on.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.100
But none of these
theories can explain away

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.640
extremely altruistic acts
because these acts are

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.760
one-off events where there
is no evolutionary or genetic

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.520
advantage for the altruists.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.260
Shusaku Endo was a
Japanese Christian author.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.150
And he wrote a novel
called "Silence."

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:58.320
And Martin Scorsese made a film
based on this novel recently.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.040
And Endo talks about Kolbe.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.770
And I think his remark is quite
interesting and relevant here.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.260
So he says, "I would
not think of it

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.100
as a miracle if bread had
suddenly fallen from heaven

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.850
or lights from heaven had
blinded the Nazi officials when

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.740
the priest was sent to
a starvation bunker.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.680
What is important
is the fact that

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.890
to save the crying young
man in front of him,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.650
Kolbe said without
a sense of despair,

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.620
'I don't have a wife or
a child as I'm a priest.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.790
Let me substitute him,'
and voluntarily went

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.850
to the starvation
bunker only to die.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.390
I want to say that this
fact is a miracle."

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.580
So Endo is not a
philosopher, so he

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:50.140
doesn't know the philosophical
definition of a miracle.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.270
But what he says is this.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.350
So Kolbe couldn't violate
the laws of nature

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.330
because he was an
ordinary human.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:04.480
But because of that, he
acted altruistically.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.630
So if he had a
supernatural power,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.720
then maybe he could have just
produced food in the starvation

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.040
bunker, or he could have
just killed Nazi officials

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.980
to save other prisoners.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.090
But he couldn't do that.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.020
And because he couldn't do
that, he sacrificed his own life

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.940
to save a stranger's life.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.130
And that is what's
remarkable about his act.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.400
So somewhat
paradoxically, Kolbe's act

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.420
is religiously significant
because he couldn't violate

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.840
the laws of nature, because he
wasn't a supernatural being who

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.920
can go beyond the
laws of nature.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.950
So extremely
altruistic acts could

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:55.350
be considered as miraculous
as, or possibly even more so

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.400
than what we have defined as
miracles, because they do not

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.000
violate the laws of nature.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.760
So Hume's argument
against the reasonableness

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.270
of believing in
miracles, that's based

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:13.200
on the idea that miracles always
violate the laws of nature.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.400
But extremely
altruistic acts are not

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.400
vulnerable to Hume's
argument because they don't

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.320
violate the laws of nature.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.240
Now, earlier I said that
the leaders of the world's

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.050
great religions, they warned
against dependence on miracles.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.110
So they are not very
enthusiastic about people

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.650
trying to perform miracles.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.920
And I think now the
reason is pretty clear.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.470
Violating the laws of
nature is impressive,

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.640
but it does not in itself
make one's act worthwhile.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.500
So it's very easy
to impress people

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.560
by violating the laws of nature,
because they are like magic.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.410
It's very easy to
impress people.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.850
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.280
that your act is
meaningful because you

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.810
violate the laws of nature.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:06.390
There are many other acts, such
as Kolbe's and Williams's, that

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.120
do not violate the
laws of nature,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.090
but they do something
comparable to that,

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.150
and these acts are
more worthwhile.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.000
So I think these
religious leaders,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.420
they wanted people to focus
on these worthwhile acts.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:24.580
And they didn't want to focus
on a unique feature of a miracle

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.826
as a violation of
the laws of nature.

00:34:27.826 --> 00:34:30.291
Thank you.

00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:33.735
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:34.235 --> 00:34:37.193
MODERATOR: Thank you, Yujin.

00:34:37.193 --> 00:34:39.165
We've got a few
minutes for questions

00:34:39.165 --> 00:34:40.644
if anyone has any questions.

00:34:40.644 --> 00:34:43.602
You'll have to give me a minute
to get to you with the mic.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.239
AUDIENCE: I'll start.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.340
I have a question.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.900
Do you think it's possible to
predict when miracles might

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.429
be perceived, say,
when people are

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.770
in a particular state
of consciousness

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.630
or their circumstances,
such they

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.801
might want to see miracles?

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:06.454
YUJIN NAGASAWA: So when
people want to see miracles--

00:35:06.454 --> 00:35:08.570
are you just asking
that they tend

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.830
to see miracles because they
expect for a miracle to happen?

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.360
Yeah, I think that kind of
bias can play an important role

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.780
in people's formation
of belief in miracles.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.950
So yes, according to
psychology, people

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.350
tend to have certain
expectations,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.110
such as confirmation bias.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:37.100
So suppose that I say that
these days, a lot of people

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.050
wear red shirts.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.150
And then you tend to
confirm a lot of examples.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.621
Because now you focus on
people wearing a red shirt.

00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:48.870
And then you think it's, oh,
actually, your hypothesis

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:49.790
is right.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.100
Everyone wears a red shirt now.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.950
And that's an example
of cognitive bias.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.620
And I think that kind of thing
can happen when people form

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.090
a belief in miracle as well.

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:10.440
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.440
think there is any difficulty
around labeling somebody else's

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.310
act as being an altruistic
act without being

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.229
privy to kind of the inside
of that person's head?

00:36:22.229 --> 00:36:23.770
I guess there could
be any reason why

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.180
they decide to perform this
action that objectively

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.460
is altruistic.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.400
YUJIN NAGASAWA: Right.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.010
Altruism is a very tricky notion
because whatever altruists do,

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.190
you can always provide an
ad hoc explanation of why

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.330
they perform in that way.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.070
So in the case of
Kolbe, for example,

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:47.250
you could say that he just
wanted to sacrifice his life so

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.590
that he can go to heaven.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:53.010
Or he had some interest
to act out altruistically,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.760
so he's not a genuine altruist.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.580
So I think for any
altruistic act,

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.570
we can always provide
an ad hoc explanation.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.970
So it's very difficult
to establish.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.950
Unless you act
altruistically, it's

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.230
very difficult to show
that people's acts are

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.980
truly altruistic.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.880
So some people say that the
notion of altruism itself

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.640
is somehow self-contradictory.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.210
And I think it's true
that Kolbe, in one sense,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.490
he wanted to sacrifice his life.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.070
So in a way his
wish was granted.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.320
But that doesn't
really undermine

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.480
his altruistic intention.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.310
Because it's not as if he
wanted to sacrifice himself

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.490
because that's pleasurable for
him, or anything like that.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.390
I think he wanted to
sacrifice his life so

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.880
that the other prisoner
would be saved.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.320
So I think we could still say
that his act was altruistic.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.360
But as you suggested, unless you
can see the inside of his head,

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.460
it's quite difficult to say what
kind of exact intention he had.

00:38:02.582 --> 00:38:04.720
AUDIENCE: You said at the
beginning of the lecture

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.420
that about 80% of people in this
country believe in miracles.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.674
But I think only about 49%
of people believe in God.

00:38:11.674 --> 00:38:13.090
So do you think
that says anything

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.890
interesting about
whatever it is,

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.480
the 30-odd percent
of people that

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.247
don't believe in any
divine agency, but do

00:38:19.247 --> 00:38:20.080
believe in miracles?

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.600
YUJIN NAGASAWA: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.350
So often belief in
miracles is more

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.830
widespread than belief in God.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.260
But normally, we assume
that only religious people

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.920
believe in miracles.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.920
And I think maybe
one of the reasons

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.990
is that the concept of a miracle
is not defined precisely.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.950
So these surveys,
when they ask people

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.340
if they believe
in miracles, they

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.370
don't provide a specific
definition of a miracle.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.670
So sometimes people have in
mind some unusual coincidences

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.590
or some amazing events.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.060
So they might not
necessarily have

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.760
in mind a violation of
the laws of nature that

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.432
can be only performed by God
or some supernatural beings.

00:39:01.432 --> 00:39:02.890
So I think maybe
one of the reasons

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:07.150
is that the term miracle
can be quite vague.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.850
So I think if you want
to conduct a survey,

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:14.380
I think it's quite important
to specify exactly what you

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.520
mean by a miracle.

00:39:18.852 --> 00:39:23.136
MODERATOR: Any more questions?

00:39:23.136 --> 00:39:28.240
AUDIENCE: I'm interested to know
if the incidence of miracles

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.180
is declining, or is
it remains static?

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.640
And if there are any kind of
more recent examples which

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.552
you've looked up and
have you stumped?

00:39:39.552 --> 00:39:44.080
YUJIN NAGASAWA: Yes, according
to one survey that I read,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.650
actually younger people
believe in miracles

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.420
more than older people.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.010
And many of them
claim that they know

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.690
someone who has experienced
a miracle, which

00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.890
I find quite surprising.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.760
Because if you are old,
then you have more time

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.990
to experience a miracle.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.440
But actually younger people,
they believe in miracles

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.977
more than the older people.

00:40:11.977 --> 00:40:13.810
And if you look at
newspapers and magazines,

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.100
there are a lot of
examples of miracles,

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.490
but often they are
just coincidences

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.340
or some unexpected events.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.010
Even in sports, people
talk about miracles.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:28.420
And they are not miracles
in the religious sense.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.580
And these days, we don't really
see amazing religious miracles

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.910
that are reported in the
religious scriptures.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.280
But maybe they are still
taking place somewhere,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.960
and we just don't
know about them.

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:46.800
AUDIENCE: It's more of
an observation, really.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.091
I'll probably make more sense
after I've read the book.

00:40:49.091 --> 00:40:51.330
But I think we've almost
lost the vocabulary

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:55.470
for looking into and expressing
anything that's a little bit

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.030
strange, outside the remit of
faith or logic or whatever.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.360
If weird things happen to
you, it's probably best

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.460
not to talk about them.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.860
And I think maybe we've kind
of lost that collectively.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.060
Virgin Mary on toast aside.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.195
So I'm looking forward
to reading this.

00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:16.860
YUJIN NAGASAWA:
So many people who

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.470
have religious
experiences, they tend

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:23.770
not to tell about it to anyone.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:29.130
They tend to be quite reserved
about their experiences, which

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:30.420
is quite interesting.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.170
Because when you have a
strange experience, normally,

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.700
you would want to tell someone.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.240
But when it comes to religious
or mystical experiences,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.020
they tend to keep them secret,
which is quite interesting.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.254
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.552
But in your case, it's
just a bit [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:48.552 --> 00:41:49.677
it's a bit weird in person.

00:41:49.677 --> 00:41:54.090
It's kind of [INAUDIBLE]
right, I'm sure.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.690
YUJIN NAGASAWA: So do you
think that if you experience

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.360
a miracle, you might think that
this is a little bit crazy.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.536
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't
experience a miracle,

00:42:00.536 --> 00:42:01.905
but I think that's probably
healthy [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:01.905 --> 00:42:03.800
but something strange
and inexplicable,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.776
and if you consider yourself
to be a very rational person,

00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:09.256
and something strange
happens [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:11.240
AUDIENCE: Do you
consider [INAUDIBLE]??

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.510
YUJIN NAGASAWA: So miracles are
by definition, weird events.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.470
And if you experience
something really,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.440
really weird,
actually you might not

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.290
want to tell anyone
because it's so strange,

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.700
and you don't want people
to think that you're crazy.

00:42:45.714 --> 00:42:46.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.180
Thanks for your talk.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.010
So you mentioned earlier
that young people

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:54.340
would be more inclined
to believe in miracles.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:59.040
And actually, it's an easier
way to explain things to them.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.729
So is that a good
thing, or should we--

00:43:01.729 --> 00:43:04.020
how do you strike the balance
between explaining things

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:10.695
with miracles and then versus
explaining rational things?

00:43:10.695 --> 00:43:15.190
It's mentioned the ant
could make rain happen.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.750
So how do we start to strike
the balance between where

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.350
I tell them, oh yeah,
actually someone

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.580
decides to make it rain.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.200
Or we say, actually, no.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.260
This is how it works.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.900
This is how the weather works?

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.960
YUJIN NAGASAWA: So when I say
that the belief in miracles

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.760
is more common
among young people,

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.010
I didn't mean small children.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.070
I meant young adults.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.760
Obviously, if you ask
children, probably many of them

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.880
believe in what
we call a miracle.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.930
Because according to some
cognitive scientists,

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.330
children naturally
form religious beliefs.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.340
So they even say that if
you put a group of children

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.160
on a remote island, they will
start their own religion.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.280
They form religious
beliefs naturally

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.430
because there are some cognitive
and evolutionary reasons

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.390
to form these beliefs.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:10.050
But the survey that I read
was about young adults.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.950
And then they seemed
to believe in miracles

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:20.740
more than older people, which
I find quite puzzling, I think.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.490
But you could say that
young people, maybe they

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.400
haven't had a lot of
experience in life,

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.130
so maybe when they
encounter unusual events,

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:33.030
they just attribute it to
something beyond nature.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.320
Thanks.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.570
So you talked about how
there's religious significance

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.370
with a miracle.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.270
So I presume with
most known religions,

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.410
there's some sort
of governing group

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:55.250
that observe evidence,
or at least the stories

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:59.490
behind miracles, and then
decides as a collective group

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.530
whether that's a miracle or not.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.430
I presume that's a common
function of every religion,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.180
and I'd love to know if not.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.790
And are there sort of common
behaviors within these groups

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.920
that observe the evidence
and decide whether they

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.070
are miracles or not, are
there sometimes interesting

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.210
divergence in approaches?

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.040
YUJIN NAGASAWA: Yeah,
so obviously, miracles

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.930
are very important
in Christianity

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:28.710
because Jesus' birth was
miraculous and after his death,

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:30.570
there was the
Resurrection, which

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:32.910
is a very important
part of Christianity.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.020
And in the Catholic
tradition, there

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:40.745
is a very rigorous process
of proving whether miracles

00:45:40.745 --> 00:45:42.750
have taken place.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:48.690
And that's important for
the process of canonization.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.830
So Mother Teresa was canonized
a couple of years ago.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.890
And that was based on
her posthumous miracles

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.700
that allegedly she performed.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.150
So she cured a Brazilian
man who had brain tumors.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.370
And another person-- I
forgot what kind of condition

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:13.020
she had-- but arguably,
she cured two people

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.660
and healed two people.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.590
And on the basis of these
miracles, she was canonized.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.990
So in the Catholic
tradition especially,

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.490
miracles are very important.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.140
But my impression is that in
the Eastern tradition, Buddhism

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:33.930
and Hinduism and so on,
miracles are not that important,

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.091
at least not as important
as in Christianity.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.536
MODERATOR: Any more questions?

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:46.660
Thank you very much, Yujin.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:47.290
That was very interesting.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.373
YUJIN NAGASAWA: Thank you.

00:46:48.373 --> 00:46:51.210
