00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.470
- ...family of means,
and she used her power

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.830
to set up a facility
that served, initially,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.020
people with developmental disabilities.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.550
I'm gonna show you, oh
first I have to say,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.550
I have nothing to disclose,
this is a legal thing here,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
but this is a, what you
see here is a photo,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.860
it's kinda hard to make
out, but down at the bottom,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.610
this is a photo of the
coast at San Francisco

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.050
many years ago, and there was a pool.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.770
It was at that time, and probably,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.610
if it was still in
existence, would still be

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.640
the largest outdoor pool in the world.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.870
It was, it used ocean water.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.950
If you could imagine
the coast of this city

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.910
pumping ocean water into a pool,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.800
that was more than three
football fields long.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.800
The lifeguards had to sit in
canoes to patrol the pool.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.850
But the Pomeroy Center was founded,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.050
as was mentioned, as the
rec center initially.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.630
And right behind the pool
was the San Francisco Zoo,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.670
so I guess at that time, where did

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.930
people with disabilities go?

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.049
Well they went to right behind the zoo

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.820
and into a building at a
pool that was very cold,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.450
and they were on an upper
floor of the rec center.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.270
So, you know, if you had mobility issues,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.530
you, I guess you were
carried up the stairs,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.530
there was no way to get up there.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.638
But, nonetheless, Janet
Pomeroy used her position

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:44.420
to wrangle from the city the space

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.480
to open up a rec center,
and the purpose was

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.630
so that families did not have to leave

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.850
children that had
developmental disabilities

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.440
at home all day, but instead had a place

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.510
where they could go, and at least

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.693
have recreational activities.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.490
Later on, and there's
piece of land towards

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.710
the back of that picture,
it's just all wooded,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.790
the city agreed to give
her that space too.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.180
It's about a five acre plot of land,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.550
which we are still on,
as long as she could

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.000
come up with the money to develop it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.100
You know at that time, it would be really

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.010
hard to get five acres
from the city today,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.493
but at that time, she was able to do it.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.690
And what's really
interesting about that is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.190
her, in her mind, when she set that up,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.470
she didn't want it to be just a place for

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.510
people with disabilities,
but she wanted it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.790
to be a community center.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.960
A place where people could come

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.120
and people who don't have
disabilities could come as well.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.030
And you're gonna see
in the next few slides,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.030
some of what's going on
in Pomeroy Center today.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.980
I do want to let everybody know that,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.610
like any other day program that serves

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.310
people with disabilities, we are licensed.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.200
We do hold a platinum seal of transparency

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.305
from GuideStar, and we also recently

00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:10.240
received another three year accreditation

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:12.150
from the Commission on Accreditation

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.643
and Rehabilitation Facilities.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.480
Right now, and I'm gonna talk about

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.470
the current goals at the Pomeroy Center,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.530
and then I'm gonna talk a little bit

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.530
about what we aspire to
be in the future as well.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.010
So right now we are continuing to strive

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.780
to become a compelling community center

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.950
that serves a diverse population.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.750
This is a part of our population.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.430
Every day, we have a program for children,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.810
the only after school program for kids

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.200
with special needs in the
city of San Francisco.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.420
And although it looks
like the buses never end,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.740
I mean some days it feels like that,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.990
every day we get about 80 kids

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.333
that come from the school district,

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:07.570
public schools into our
center between 2:30 and 3:00,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.960
and at just about the time
when most of the staff's

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.500
sort of winding down, looking
for that last cup of coffee,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.150
all these kids come in and the
energy level really goes up.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.450
We, here's just a picture of two people

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.630
who happen to be sitting at the center,

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.970
just enjoying conversation outside,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.920
with their hats and coats, probably means

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.857
it was in the summer
here (audience laughing),

00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:37.200
and, you know, enjoying, this
is a part of our property

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.710
where we celebrate some of the individuals

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.800
and their accomplishments,
and that you see

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.450
some of the photos in the rear.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.460
Here's a van that goes out.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.460
We have, we like to celebrate
the abilities of our people.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.080
I'm not a big fan of the word disability,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.370
I always think in terms of people

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.520
that have differing abilities,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.340
and this is a van that
takes some our people out

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.760
that actually work in the community

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.770
and do some landscaping for

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.863
private homeowners and businesses.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.020
We, it's a very welcoming
sign in our lobby.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.650
Usually the clouds are not there,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.130
but that was the beauty
of technology at work.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.793
This is just a view of our lobby.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.330
Frances, who has been in
our program, and I know

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.150
our guest here in the very front,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.750
who also spent his
childhood at our program,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.020
probably knows Frances.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.950
She came to the program in 1954,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.363
and is still with us today.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.970
Just a picture of our main hall,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.570
this is where a lot of gatherings go on.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.490
Not just for our participants,
but we have music,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.870
we bring in, today there was a band there

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.200
called Bread and Roses, they
play a lot in the Bay Area.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.550
So there are days when
we bring in entertainment

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.837
just for the people
that are at our center,

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:04.720
but also on Friday nights
or Saturday nights,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.820
we have music and the public comes in

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.510
and we, our participants might be there

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.320
to, you know, serve drinks or take tickets

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.623
or show people to their seats.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.260
Our stage, Paul Giannini Stage, that's

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.810
named after Paul had been with us,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.940
he passed away, he was
one of our participants.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.440
Clara Giannini, as a
long-time board member.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.440
And actually, Clara
Giannini and Janet Pomeroy

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.180
back in the 1960s, and Eunice Shriver,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.980
we have photos of them all together.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.020
That's what makes this
award so interesting to me,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.970
because between these women who,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.040
you know you think back
to the 1950s, early 1960s,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.570
wasn't easy for women to own any business,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.800
start any business, let
alone programs like this.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.360
But when you look at the
history of our country,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.360
that's really who drove the
models that we have today.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.010
And it's amazing.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.290
We have a dance and yoga studio.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.410
So one of the things that makes our

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.670
day activity program a little unique,

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.832
and in fact just two Sundays ago,

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:26.230
myself and another staff
member were in Hawaii

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.560
at a Pac Rim disability conference

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.750
sponsored by the University of Hawaii,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.660
and we were talking about our day program

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.860
because it is an educational program.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.000
We have over 45 classes, we run
it like a community college.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.800
And in fact two of the classes are run by

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.240
community college professors, and students

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.140
from the outside can come and take

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.130
their art or drama at the Pomeroy Center

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.743
along with our participants.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.013
Oops, I missed something, I wanna go back.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.090
So, pardon me?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.050
Oh you're gonna help me
with going backwards, okay.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.727
Um, we have another, there's
another part of our program

00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:12.290
that's very important
to the Pomeroy Center

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.230
in terms of bringing the public in,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.070
and that's this warm water pool.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.630
So, as our program was built,
you know, it has its roots

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.717
as a recreational center,
and certainly the pool.

00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:28.830
And Janet wanted the pool to be created.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.660
It's warm water, what I mean by warm water

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.400
we keep it between 92 and 94 degrees.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.690
It's salt water based, like the ocean,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.340
except it's a little
bit, we make the salt's

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.580
a little bit better for your skin.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.660
And the pool's used by
adults from the community

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.350
in both the morning and the evening,

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.110
people that may have had surgery

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.510
or they have some issue
of pain that they're

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.650
trying to solve or they're
rehabilitating themselves,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.810
and the pool's fantastic for that.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.180
It's also in mid morning
and right after school,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.600
we have infant swimming lessons and then

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400
children's swimming lessons.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.260
It's the best place in the
world if you have a baby,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.313
because the water is like bath water.

00:09:11.313 --> 00:09:14.070
You never hear an infant
scream like you do

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.560
when you go to the Y and they dip 'em

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.660
in the cold pool and they're freaking out.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.180
That just does not happen
at the Pomeroy Center.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.880
And so we, the pool is
a very important part

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.330
of bringing the community in.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.600
The other goal we have is
to help our participants

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.860
demonstrate their value,
not only by working

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.620
but also volunteering in the community.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.060
So we serve about 250
adults and more than 100

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.830
of them are not verbal,
or their verbal skills

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.400
are very very minimal.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.888
Some of them, a number of
them are not verbal or vocal.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:53.888
And so it is a very,
very difficult population

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.490
to get into the work community.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.790
But that doesn't mean
they don't have value.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.950
So we have found ways of
helping our participants

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.350
get into the community by
volunteering to do things.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.290
This is a group here that
works with the food bank.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.760
Every Tuesday we get a pallet of food

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.000
from the San Francisco Marin food bank.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.510
We separate it into grocery bags.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.100
Our participants, we load them up in a van

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.700
and all the groceries,
and we deliver groceries

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.960
to needy people in San Francisco.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.250
And I will tell you,
like the two gentlemen

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.909
on the right, neither one is verbal,

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:37.330
but when the van pulls up, they recognize

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.120
the apartment building they're going into,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.940
they know the apartment they're going to,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.230
they knock on the door, they go in,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.480
they feel very valuable and valued

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.500
by the community to do that.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.180
This is a group of the able gardeners.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.680
You're seeing them in the background,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.400
you see downtown San Francisco,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.963
just out in the community doing a project.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.550
This is our food bank volunteers.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.530
We also, besides delivering groceries,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.770
work at the food bank to help them sort

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.720
their incoming food to get it ready

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.753
to go out to other organizations.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.070
We also deliver meals for
Meals on Wheels in the city.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.410
So this is another
nonprofit that we work with.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.260
And just like the food bank, on Wednesdays

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.230
right now, we load up
our van and we take food

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.400
right now to 36 needy families
throughout San Francisco.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.780
And the director of the
food bank just contacted me

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.420
today about adding another route.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.370
I was assured that this
selfie was not taken

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.557
while the van was in
motion (audience laughing).

00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:45.195
I have no way to know.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.930
In our program, we also have
a full size basketball gym.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.130
And this is a group of our participants

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.370
practicing basketball, but our team,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.950
the Wildcats, is undefeated
in their long history.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.540
We can't wait for the
Golden State Warriors

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.370
to move to San Francisco, because that

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.650
will be our first test.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.980
But in reality, it's just
part of the whole thing

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.220
about physical fitness, this
is just one of the classes.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.940
On the right, you see
one of our participants

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.320
across the street at
Harding Park, which is a

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.110
tournament player's course.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.930
The PGA championship
will be there in 2020,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.080
and we get to go over there and work with

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.930
an organization, another
nonprofit, called First Tee.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.900
First Tee is a national organization,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.873
and we teach people golfing skills.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.630
And here's our group out golfing.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.130
Esther, who's sitting over here is our

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.210
development director and there's

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.590
our past board chair and
one of our participants,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.855
Frank, there on the far left,
is about to turn 80 years old.

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:58.380
And he is in great
health and great spirits,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.793
and he loves to golf.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.320
Last thing we're working
on right now of big issues

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.820
are our expressive arts program.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.670
And we want, it is amazing,
and I know some of you

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.680
are probably familiar
with this, but everyone

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.410
has an ability to express themselves.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.120
Sometimes verbally they don't,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.810
that's not how they do it,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.580
but they can do it through art,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.440
or they can do it through music.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.150
We have an amazing art program,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.000
and our artists show their art

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.830
at bakeries in the city,
we have a couple of retail

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.000
locations where we sell our art,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.840
and they of course we have
the Pomeroy Center itself.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.830
And the art class is one of the classes

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:46.720
that the City College of San
Francisco professors run.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.880
And so they're not only teaching,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.190
but opening it up for the community.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.730
And all kinds of art.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.550
I mean we saw some painting,
we also do a lot of sculpture,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.900
and then we do an expressive
art through music as well.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.380
And as well as dance, so I
showed you the dance studio,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.320
one of our staff, the
woman on the far left,

00:14:12.469 --> 00:14:14.480
she came to us, she's
a director of a staff.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.150
But in the evening, after
work, she's a ballerina

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.390
here in San Francisco.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.210
So she brought her talent
to the Pomeroy Center

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.570
so after providing direct
service, or as part of that,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.220
she also teaches a dance
class, and this is just part

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.053
of a performance they put on
during the holiday season.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.710
And this is our drama class.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.880
And they meet Tuesdays
and Thursday nights.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.750
And again, a lot of self expression

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.490
and a lot of ability for people to really

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.030
get up and do something
that they really wanna do

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:56.030
in front of their peers and in
front of an audience as well.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.523
Wonderful woman there,
Hope, with her tambourine.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.337
The last goal we've been working on,

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:05.870
and this is a lot of work for us,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.375
and that's because of
our children's program.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:13.410
So we have right now 82
kids in that program.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.760
70 of them have autism as either one

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.500
or part of a dual diagnosis.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.143
It is an amazing number
when you think about that.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.070
And our children, you know
we have a big playground.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.120
Our kids program is six days a week.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.840
So we have an after school program

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.360
and then an all day Saturday program.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.960
And then when the public schools

00:15:36.897 --> 00:15:38.850
are closed, we're open and we have camp.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.040
So parents have an opportunity

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.233
to continue to have
their children come in.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.950
We keep a 1:4 ratio, staff to children.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.670
And, you know, the kids are
just, they're just great.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.720
We have, this is what's
called a Snoezelen room.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.680
That's not a name we made up, by the way,

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.630
it's actually a scientific name.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.230
But it's a sensory room.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.830
It doesn't do justice to
look at it in a static way,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.540
but there's a lot of motion in the room.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.500
There's videos going on of things

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.790
that are very calming,
there's lot of light sensory.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.300
There's some sound as well.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.610
There's chairs so people who are confined

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.360
to wheelchairs can get out our their chair

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.720
and sit in a hammock
or something different.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.410
We have very sophisticated tools

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.950
to transfer individuals
from one thing to another.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.500
So that everyone can
enjoy a different mode

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.060
during the day, if they need it.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.380
Or, if they're in sensory overload,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.970
this is just a great place to relax.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.673
Where you find me most afternoons.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.270
Just more kids, bouncing
and Elizabeth, who,

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.750
this is Elizabeth being
Elizabeth in our program.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.400
I wanna say, like everybody else,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.400
I am amazed and just humbled by our staff

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.400
because this is an extremely
expensive place to live.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.210
And we have to pay hourly wages to people

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.240
who are taking care of
adults with disabilities,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.990
or children, and it's very difficult

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.500
to live in the community
on what we are able to pay.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.370
But the staff, we have
very little turnover.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.813
And in the last two
years, we've had nobody

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:26.960
go out and on unemployment insurance.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.680
You know, or leave us, you
know, it's just amazing to me.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.580
What are we trying to do moving forward?

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.580
Well, one, we want to continue to have our

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.300
individuals surpass their
community integration goals,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.490
either through employment
or volunteer service,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.200
combination of that, or
in any type of outing

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.340
that would be meaningful to them.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.180
And I do want to say
that we do not set goals.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.930
A lot of people come in want to know

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.000
what's your goal for number
of people to seek employment?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.580
And I go, I don't have a goal for that.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.950
Our goal is to satisfy
our individuals' desires.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.310
And our goal to do that's 100%.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.160
But we don't put any other goal on it.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.950
It's all about what they
want out of their life,

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.753
and what they want out of the program.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.420
We want our program to have an impact

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.640
in this community, and
have that impact grow.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.560
So one of the things we're doing right now

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.840
is we've just opened up
two residential facilities.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.584
That is not something
we've been in before.

00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:37.050
But it's something we
felt we had to go into

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.020
because many group homes in
this city are being sold.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.570
People who've been running group homes,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.140
now hey my house can, I can get a million

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.150
or two or three for my
home, and I can sell it

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.600
and I can move to Redding
or I can move to Fresno

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.560
or I can move out of state and start

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.330
a group home somewhere else.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.540
And in San Francisco, housing
is a problem for everybody,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.890
but it's especially a problem for people

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.340
with developmental disabilities.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.050
So we now have opened two group homes

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.070
on Fulton Street, near
the Golden Gate Park.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.650
And they're just beautiful homes

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.763
with a great, great vibe.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.780
The next thing we're looking at,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.620
because we have so much
experience with children,

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.770
is having an integrated daycare program.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.740
So we're just about done
with our license for that,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.990
and we hope to serve 20
children in a daycare program,

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.690
where at least half would be non-disabled

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.270
public, paid spots, and the other would be

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.870
kids with special needs that might be

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.280
subsidized there, or not.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.700
But, the idea is that, and we've seen

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.310
model after model that works.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.320
When you put kids together they do not

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.630
detect disability at that age.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.630
They simply don't understand it.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.700
All they do is they look
for ways to get around it.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.990
They wanna include everybody
in the games that they play.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.930
And we think that that
mentality, starting at two

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.950
and going to five years
old will carry over

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.480
when these kids get into school,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.830
and when they get into the, eventually,

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.280
into the employment market,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.080
because it won't be foreign to them.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.070
And I'm gonna end with just a couple

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.730
of photos of some of our people.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.490
And then lastly, I just wanna say this.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.160
I know some of you, many
of you have probably

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.160
have been to andadult day
program at one time or another.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:37.270
But when I walk into to our program,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.230
or really anyone, and you see

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:46.230
in our case 250 adults, and
they just wanna be who they are.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.416
And somehow if you can just accept

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:54.530
who they are, and the fact
that they have this value,

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.180
and for some them, maybe the value is

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.340
that they make you laugh,
and I know a lot of people

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.350
that don't make me laugh.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.270
So, you know, they have this value

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.680
that when you open your
mind and your heart to them,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.020
and then you learn how to
communicate, it's a struggle.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.640
You know, I grew up
learning how to communicate

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.870
mostly verbally, a lot of the people

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.590
I talk to now I can't use verbal cues

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.640
to communicate with them.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.570
But when you find ways of communicating,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.690
it is amazing what you learn

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.590
from these individuals every day.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.650
And for those of you not local,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.920
or those of you local,
if you're in the city,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.850
you're over by the zoo,
we're still by the zoo.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.220
Drop by, you're welcome any time.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.931
Thank you so much.

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:42.181
(applause)
