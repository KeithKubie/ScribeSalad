00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.879
 Welcome to the UK (and many more) as I explain CGP Gray 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.839
 UK, England and Great Britain? Are these places the same place? Are they places 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.580
 Different? Are the British secretly laughing at me who uses these terms wrong? Who knows the answer 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.850
 These questions? I know and I will tell you now 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.400
 To be lost: this is the world, this is the continent of Europe and this is where it is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060
 We have to explain it. The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.109
 Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single state, but a constituent state 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.970
 From countries 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.079
 Containing within it four equal and sovereign states 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.970
 The first of them is England - illustrated in red - often mixed with England 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 And the United Kingdom as a whole because it has the largest area and the largest population of states 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 The capital contains the actual London 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.200
 To the north, Scotland is shown in blue and to the west, Wales is painted white 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.170
 And often forgotten even those living in the UK are Northern Ireland 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.080
 Each orange has a local term for its inhabitants 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.870
 While you can call them all "British" but not desirable because the four states in general 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 Do not like some 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.300
 Northern Irish, Scots and Welsh consider the English slaves and colonial rulers 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.120
 Regardless of whether the three have an independent parliament and are entitled to vote 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.650
 On the English laws and that the opposite is not true - the English is considered 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.250
 The rest are uncivilized villagers and spend a lot of time with their sheep 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.239
 But since the constituent states of the United Kingdom do not have an independent passport, they are all 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 British citizens. they 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.520
 British citizens of the United Kingdom (by the way the full name of the Kingdom of Britain 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.079
 Great Britain and Northern Ireland) 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.049
 So where does Great Britain hide? 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.450
 Here: The black area is Great Britain. Unlike England, Scotland and Wales 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.469
 Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical term and not a political one 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.799
 Great Britain is the largest island of the British Isles 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.170
 In the UK, the term "Great Britain" is used to refer to England 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.189
 Scotland and Wales with intentional exclusion of northern Ireland 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.350
 This is mostly real, but not entirely, since the three states have islands 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.859
 Not connected to Great Britain such as the Isle of Wight (part of England) and Anglesey Island 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.340
 Welsh, Scottish Hippers, Shetland Islands and Orkney 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.630
 And the Clyde Islands 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.609
 The second largest island of the British Isles is Ireland 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.520
 Ireland is not a state. It is like Great Britain's geographical term 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560
 And not political 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.819
 The island of Ireland has two states, Northern Iranda (that spoke to us 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.600
 ) And the Republic of Ireland 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.109
 When people say they are Irish, they mean the Republic of Ireland 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:54.869
 A State independent of the United Kingdom 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.329
 But both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.959
 Although England claimed to be a Mid-Atlantic island 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.560
 Instead of the fact that it is 50 kilometers from the French coast. But this is a story for another time 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.299
 for review: 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.479
 The two largest islands in the British Isles are Ireland and Great Britain 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.650
 Two states, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, while Great Britain 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.860
 It contains (often) three: England, Scotland and Wales. When we gather these three 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.580
 With Northern Ireland we get the UK 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.870
 But there are many unanswered questions such as why you travel to Canada 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.450
 Do you find pictures of the royal family on money? To answer this question, we will talk about the empire 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.069
 It is impossible to be taught in countries that speak English without knowing that the British Empire 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.209
 Expanded to a quarter of the world and ruled about a quarter of its population 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.750
 While it is easy to remember parts of the empire that have been separated by violence 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 We often forget the states that have resigned through diplomacy instead of blood 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.420
 These places, which are formed by forming a state that has reached an agreement with the empire, will continue to recognize it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.590
 That the monarchy is the head of state in exchange for an independent local parliament 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.769
 To understand how to communicate we must talk about the crown 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.680
 The real crown is not behind the glass in the Tower of London and brings millions of 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.689
 United Kingdom tourists. But the crown as a complex legal entity is easy to think about 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.430
 As a one-man company. Who started this company? 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.629
 God started it. According to the British tradition all authority 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.340
 Derived from the Creator and crowned ruler in a Christian ceremony 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.329
 But God (does not want to be disturbed by the exact administrative details) and for ease is delegated 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.319
 His power to the entity claims the crown. While this was used to refer to a particular crown 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.180
 Preserved in the Tower of London, evolved over time into a legal company managed 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.430
 Only by the king 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.510
 It is useful to remember that the UK is still a religious state and the ruling king 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.400
 Serves as the head of state and the supreme ruler of the official religion of the state 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.530
 : Anglican. These are the difficulties we encounter when dealing with 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.069
 A 1000-year-old property. We return to Canada and the rest of the former colonies 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.340
 Which is independent during diplomacy and still recognizes power 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.159
 The crown is known as the Commonwealth States and is in the descending order of the census: 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.420
 Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Jamaica, Solomon Islands, Belize, Islands 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.920
 Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.510
 Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu. 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.629
 They are all independent states but still recognize ownership as head of state 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.930
 That its authority is very limited within the borders of those States. There are three other entities belong 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.909
 Crowns are Crown Dependencies: Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.950
 Unlike the Commonwealth countries, they are not considered independent states but are available to them 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.700
 Local independence and British citizenship from the UK (but the Kingdom 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.489
 Reserves the right to veto the laws of their local councils). 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.329
 Have we finished "now"? Almost but not quite. There is still some there 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.640
 Incomplete themes, such as this place, the small city of Gibraltar on the coast 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.849
 The southern Spanish, famous for its rock, its monkeys and caused by diplomatic tension between 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.120
 United Kingdom and Spain. And what about the Falkland Islands 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.319
 Have caused great tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina to the extent of war between them 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.540
 on her. These places belong to the last group of properties 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.560
 The crown known as British Land Abroad. But its former name (Crown Colony) exposes its origin 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.729
 It is the last remnant of the empire 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.600
 British. Unlike the Commonwealth countries did not become 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.039
 Independent states are still dependent on the United Kingdom for military assistance 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.330
 And (sometimes) economic. And like crown dependencies all who are born within 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.400
 Its borders are British citizens. Crown colonies are in the descending order of a census 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.440
 Population: Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.680
 Virgin Islands, Akrotiri and Dekelia, Anguilla, St. Helena Asuncion Islands, Tristan da 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.270
 Kona, Montserrat, British Indian Ocean Territory, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.360
 Falkland Islands, British Antarctic Territory, Pitcairn Islands. And for the latter Finn model 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.210
 The United Kingdom is located on the British Isles and is part of the Crown 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.050
 Which is ruled by the monarchy, is also part of the Crown and the British Isles 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.780
 Crown dependencies. Independent states of the former empire still recognize 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.210
 Baltag are the countries of the Commonwealth, and the remains of the empire is independent 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.199
 British territory abroad. 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.030
 Thanks a lot for following up.
