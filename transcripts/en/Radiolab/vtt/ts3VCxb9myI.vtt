1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.990
I see.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.630
<v 1>Great. You're listening to radio,</v>

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.090
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio [inaudible]. You

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.710
see

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.520
<v 0>n n p. R. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich Jad's,</v>

6
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.970
not exactly sure where Jad is. I know he's at a meeting that I should be at too,

7
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.890
so not being exactly America's number one meeting person I got out of it so that

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.580
I could be here with you for which I thank you very, very much. So, uh,

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.590
this podcast,

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.400
today's podcast is one of our in between season occasionals where we share with

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:38.360
you our regular listeners an idea, a compelling conversation,

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.220
a thought in this case,

13
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.740
what you're about to hear is a big thought for me anyway,

14
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.740
I put it together for the graduating class at cal tech.

15
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:50.741
I was invited to be the commencement speaker there this past June and I wanted

16
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:55.520
to make a case for talking about science to folks who may not be all that well

17
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.310
versed or even all that interested in science. He things,

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.560
because talking about this stuff I argued has very powerful consequences.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.463
<v 1>So</v>

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.050
<v 0>thank you. I can't crush on. Thank you.</v>

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.230
I was the only Shammo and thank you Judy Campbell and thank you congressman.

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.740
Shifting.

23
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.740
Thank you mayor Bagger and especially thank you to all 205 members of the cal

24
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.770
tech class of 2008 plus the extra 14. We're getting pretty close with aloud,

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.190
just sitting here, a congratulations to all of you. It's a great,

26
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:33.000
great honor to be here. Normally if you're a science reporter at NPR, at ABC,

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.040
you a trip to cal tech means that you call ahead and you asked for a few

28
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.100
precious moments with a world class intellectual, whatever,

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.660
and you're ushered in and you furiously take notes all the time thinking,

30
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.120
do I have any idea what this man is saying as woman,

31
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.820
I'm sure you know the feeling. And um,

32
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.220
when I got my invitation asking me to give you guys a lecture, I thought,

33
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.940
come on. I'm like, what can I tell you? But I thought of something. So,

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.460
and it's something that's going to happen to you.

35
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.100
You sitting here with the black hats, uh,

36
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:08.900
in the next hour or two there you'll be in your cap and gowns surrounded by your

37
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:13.010
family. And by friends and by friends of friends and somebody, you know,

38
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:16.820
maybe an uncle or a buddy, somebody there's going to turn to you and say,

39
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:20.180
so like what were you doing at cal tech? I mean, what, what were you working on?

40
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.470
Not that they really want to know, you know, but after all,

41
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:27.880
you've been here for four years, so you know, or even, you know,

42
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.240
different number. If you're a Grad student,

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.720
you must've been doing something here. So it's only polite to ask.

44
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:37.721
And I know that a lot of you have scientifically literate dads and moms and some

45
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:41.750
brothers and some sisters. Not all of them of course, but some. And uh,

46
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.170
let's just assume that one of these people, if they had to make it a relative,

47
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.640
let's say that he will make it. He, he's not a scientist, he's not an engineer.

48
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.290
And the last time he had a thought,

49
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.250
a complex thought about biology or math was back in 11th grade when he got the c

50
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:59.290
minus in both subjects and about never ever to think about biology or math ever

51
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.124
again.

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.990
But because this is your day and because this person loves you or because he

53
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.390
can't really think of anything to say after, Hey, uh,

54
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.680
he asks about your work and to make it still more interesting.

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.670
Let's assume that if you explain to this person what you've been working on,

56
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.671
you might have to use certain words like protein or cork or differential or

57
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.810
maybe hypothenuse and, and, and if you do, they're going to listen to you very,

58
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.010
very politely. But upstairs,

59
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.870
those words are going to be not a whole lot to them, you know,

60
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.730
because science is not their thing.

61
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.730
They can lip sync every word to instincts by, by, by, but you know,

62
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.140
high pop news is hard. So here's my question. When you are asked,

63
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.900
what are you working on? Should you think?

64
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.220
There's no way I can talk about my science with this guy because I don't have

65
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.720
the talent. I don't have the words, I don't have the patience to do it.

66
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.070
It's too hard. And anyway, what's the point? Which is, by the way,

67
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.540
not an unusual position, no less than Isaac Newton. And I mean Sir Isaac Newton,

68
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.140
that one when asked, why did you make your Principia Mathematica,

69
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.140
your here's chicken book about gravity and laws of motion,

70
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.590
so impossibly hard to read. He said, well,

71
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.950
I considered writing a popular version that people might understand,

72
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.430
but and I am quoting Newton here to avoid being baited by little sweaters in

73
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:20.440
mathematics. That was his phrase, little Smathers.

74
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.420
He intentionally wrote a book in dense scholarly Latin with lots of math so that

75
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.640
only scholars could follow. In other words,

76
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.510
Isaac Newton didn't care to be understood by average folks,

77
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.410
but here's the argument I want to make to you guys this morning and you're not

78
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.640
going to hear this advice often.

79
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.210
I suggest you ain't never hear it again when asked about your work,

80
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.630
do not do what Isaac Newton did. No, no, no.

81
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.470
When a cousin or an uncle or a buddy comes up and asks you,

82
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.830
so what are you working on? Even if it's hard to explain,

83
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.980
even if you know they don't really want to hear it, not really.

84
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.020
I urge you to give it a try because talking about science,

85
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.280
telling stories to regular folks is not a trivial thing.

86
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.610
Scientists need to tell stories to non scientists because science stories and

87
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:13.390
you know this have to compete with other stories about how the universe works

88
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.890
and how the universe came to be and some of those other stories, Bible stories,

89
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.170
movies, stories, myths can be very beautiful and very compelling.

90
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.970
But you protect science and scientists. This is not a gentle competition,

91
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.420
so you've got to get in there and tell yours your version of how things are and

92
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:34.720
why things came to be.

93
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.170
We all know about creation as science movements in America,

94
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.500
but what you may not know is that movements are spreading all over the world.

95
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.280
In Turkey there's a group led by a man named [inaudible].

96
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.590
He's a Muslim creationist and his group produced a picture packed 768 page

97
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.360
quote, biology unquote textbook that's priced very, very cheaply.

98
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:58.310
So schools can have it for next to nothing and that textbook is now used all

99
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.144
over Turkey.

100
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.500
It's written in clear and simple language using fabulous pictures and the

101
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:08.501
pictures are designed to prove that fossils show no evidence of evolution and

102
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.180
this group's books and their CD Roms and their grocery store magazines.

103
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:15.890
They have grocery store magazines.

104
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.220
Their websites are so widespread and so inexpensive and so provocative with

105
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:26.501
titles like the bloody ideology of Darwinism or the evolution deceit that in

106
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.120
Turkey's high schools, which are not religious schools,

107
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.710
they have a long secular tradition.

108
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.030
Their evolution and Darwin are disappearing from the curriculum in high schools

109
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.020
and that country. In 2006 when Turks were pulled and asked,

110
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.310
I want you to listen to this statement and tell us if it's true or false or you

111
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.550
don't know. Here's the statement. Human beings,

112
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:51.551
as we know them develop from an earlier species of animals in 2006 only 25% of

113
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:59.180
the Turkish public said yes to that. That's a very low number. In Japan,

114
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:03.890
78% say humans evolved from a Predator predecessor species in the u s it's,

115
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.200
it's 40% but that's above Turkey. In Turkey. There was a debate of course,

116
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.210
and they're still one sort of except Mr Octar sued people who opposed his views,

117
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.930
sued them for slander, managed to shut down their blogs in Turkey,

118
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.080
his followers attacked biology professors as a Maoists Maoists as Maoists for

119
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.740
teaching evolution,

120
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.030
which they called nothing but a deception imposed upon us by the dominators of

121
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:29.960
the world system.

122
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.560
High school teachers in Istanbul were fired because they taught evolution and

123
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:34.970
not creation science.

124
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.200
And while Mr Oxeye was recently arrested for his role in a sex ring operation,

125
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.790
so he may be taking a break.

126
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.430
Creation Science is now taught all over Turkey and while Turkey may seem and

127
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.650
ocean or more away, it is not.

128
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.340
There are always mister oak tars who aim their stories right at you,

129
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.590
right at the heart of a place like this,

130
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.370
at the values that cal tech has always honored from the beginning.

131
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.470
I know you spent long nights cramming and sweating under the weight of too many

132
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:10.670
assignments and too many tests and too many papers from too many professors who

133
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:13.310
didn't realize there were other professors that were making you do the same test

134
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:17.180
and the phone and so forth. But somewhere in that nightmare of work,

135
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.810
you may have noticed that your teachers were giving you more than tension

136
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:23.120
headaches. They were giving you values,

137
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.590
a deep respect for curiosity, for doubt.

138
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.450
Always doubt for openmindedness, for going wherever the data leads,

139
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.500
no matter how uncomfortable for honesty, for discipline,

140
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.020
and most of all the belief that anybody, no matter where they're from,

141
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.240
no matter what their language, no matter what their religion,

142
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.780
no matter what their politics, no matter what their age or their temperament.

143
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:52.610
I mean this place has seen monstrous egos and Bongo players and people who dress

144
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:53.660
in Viking hats.

145
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.650
But if you can learn how to sit down in a laboratory and think in an orderly

146
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:59.400
way,

147
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.400
and if you have the patience to stare and stare and stare and stare,

148
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.700
looking for a pattern in nature, you're welcome here.

149
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.960
It may be boring. It may be sometimes very exhausting,

150
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.370
but there's a freedom,

151
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.730
a freedom in this way of looking that is precious in the world.

152
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.620
And that freedom can be attacked or defended with stories,

153
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.270
stories matter after all what is a science experiment?

154
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.410
But you make up a story that may or may not be true and then you test that story

155
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.900
in the real world to see what happens. So for example,

156
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.200
let's say you're in Piazza,

157
00:09:35.201 --> 00:09:38.610
it's 1590 and the guy named Galileo comes up to you and says hello there.

158
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.110
They actually probably wouldn't say it that way,

159
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.340
but you see I have a canon ball in my right hand. It's a very,

160
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:49.330
very heavy thing to be sure. But in my left hand, sir, I have a golf ball.

161
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.190
It wouldn't be golf balls before golf I my left hand, I have a musket ball,

162
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.650
which is lighter than the Canon Ball. Now, sir,

163
00:09:55.651 --> 00:10:00.000
if I told you that these two balls if dropped from the same high place at the

164
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:03.300
same time, in spite of their five or 10 fold difference in weight,

165
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.750
that they would hit the ground simultaneously, the light one.

166
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.990
And the heavy one dropping landing at the exact same time.

167
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:14.400
Would you like to see me try whether Galileo actually did this or not?

168
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.010
If a guy named Galileo proposed this to you,

169
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.110
wouldn't you stick around just to see how it comes out? Galileo,

170
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.490
for my purposes is the great unknown. Newton, unlike Newton,

171
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.320
he had a flair for narrative, a storyteller's sense. Unlike Newton.

172
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.430
He wanted to tell people what was on his mind. Unlike Newton,

173
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.380
he thought that people could understand him.

174
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.230
That's why he got in so much trouble. In his famous book,

175
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:43.350
the dialogues about the sun being the center of the solar system.

176
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.090
He didn't write it in Latin.

177
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:49.860
He wrote it in Italian for a mass audience and the writing was gorgeous.

178
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:52.620
It was poetic. It was combative. It was funny.

179
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.610
It was a running conversation between three good friends who spend four days

180
00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:00.600
together arguing and eating and boating through Venice in Gondolas.

181
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.501
The argument being,

182
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.860
is the earth the center of the solar system or might it be the sun?

183
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.680
And the text of that book has little pictures,

184
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:11.340
line drawings that he made and he put it in marginal headings to break up the

185
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.290
text so he wouldn't have a big sheet of writing.

186
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.270
And while there are numbers in his book,

187
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.370
he doesn't get to them until two thirds through the book.

188
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:19.440
And if you skip the numbers you don't miss that much.

189
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.840
So because Galileo's book was so easy to read and such a page Turner,

190
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.370
it's so threatened,

191
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:30.870
the established order that Galileo as you know was put under house arrest and it

192
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:32.970
wasn't just his science that was alarming.

193
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.520
I think it was the power of his storytelling.

194
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.500
That's what made him extra dangerous because stories have this power,

195
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:42.480
people like them, you know Wilson,

196
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:46.230
the great scientist and the great storyteller writes that science like the rest

197
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:50.490
of culture is based on the manufacturer of narrative. We all live by narrative.

198
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.360
He is know that half of it I work on radio and TV and I've learned that I can go

199
00:11:55.361 --> 00:12:00.340
on Primetime TV and I have and do an hour on string theory and talk about

200
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.930
multiple dimensions and space time curvature. And supersymmetry.

201
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.970
This is very odd and very hard stuff for grandma,

202
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:10.570
for your brother and the cousin I was talking about before and yet a whole lot

203
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:13.750
of people, a few million people will sit there the whole time.

204
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:15.280
I mean ABC clocks, this kind of thing.

205
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.430
And they sit and they watch and apparently I have to assume they're pretty

206
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.690
fascinated, but the program ends and then you have like a bunch of ads,

207
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:26.140
like seven commercials and one network Id and three and a half to five minutes

208
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:30.040
pass. And the next program comes on the very same channel and it's about

209
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.480
extraterrestrials landing and anti gravity machines to examine the breasts of

210
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:35.920
innocent cocktail waitresses.

211
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.540
And the same people who are watching the previous hours sit there with the same

212
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.710
sense of awe and the same sense of fascination. And they say, wow.

213
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.630
And they kind of believe it too. People are not scrupulous about stories,

214
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.950
truths, fiction.

215
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.700
It's like this endless back and forth between Ross and Phoebe and the TV show

216
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:58.000
friends. If you know the show. We're also as a paleontologist,

217
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.380
he studies dinosaurs. Phoebe is his misuse French. He doesn't study anything,

218
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.490
but she knows everything. And in a typical episode,

219
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.420
Ross sits down and very carefully explains how opposable thumbs evolved slowly

220
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:14.680
over time. And Phoebe listens very respectfully and Ross finishes.

221
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.573
So he says,

222
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.850
you see how evolution explains opposable thumbs or says Phoebe,

223
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.670
maybe the overlords need them to steer their spacecrafts.

224
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.720
So people can slip very easily from reason to fantasy and they believe both and

225
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:33.370
they don't feel a need to be consistent.

226
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.240
They just want to feel like they're absorbed, like they're swept away.

227
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.810
And when you tell stories, boy, this hat is driving me nuts.

228
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:45.280
I'm going to just shit. You can't do it.

229
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:50.110
Only me. Uh, and I don't know what's wrong with my hair,

230
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:54.560
but man, I just forgive me here. When you tell stories to America,

231
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.900
really to anybody in the world,

232
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.820
you have to remember there are lots of Phoebe's stories with gripping visuals

233
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:03.310
and good punch lines and stories that make intuitive sense.

234
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:07.000
That makes sensual sense to your eyes and to your ears and to your touch.

235
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.990
They can convince they have power. You may not believe that two balls,

236
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:14.380
one heavy and one light jock from the same high place we'll drop together.

237
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.100
But if you see it with your own eyes that you remember,

238
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.350
and as science gets harder at the metaphor becomes more useful and even

239
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:24.184
necessary.

240
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.460
I mean more and more of what science teachers about the world is not intuitive

241
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:29.560
that way it makes no sensual sense.

242
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.090
This starts early in high school that if you slap your hand on a hard surface

243
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:35.770
like, like that,

244
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.360
the outer electrons on my hands and the electron on this wood here are repelling

245
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:42.370
each other. This is the electromagnetic forces. You know,

246
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.310
electronics just don't like being around other electrons.

247
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:49.480
So the reason my hand didn't go through the surface then is that two platoons of

248
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:53.570
electrons, mine and the tables on a line of scrimmage got in each other's face.

249
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.680
Okay?

250
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.680
That's harder though to add faces and motives and football analogies to

251
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.850
electrons. So there are some of you sitting here,

252
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:06.710
probably here who say you can't talk about nature that way it distorts what's

253
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:07.400
true.

254
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.400
What's true is what you see in equations in the math that points to these laws.

255
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.570
But I go back to my man Galileo,

256
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.540
who was maybe the first in western tradition anyway,

257
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.660
to honor mathematics as the primal force of knowledge,

258
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.790
the logic of the universe. He said in his book,

259
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:27.791
the SAR is written in the language of mathematics without which one is wandering

260
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:32.270
around in a dark labyrinth. But having honored math,

261
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.380
Galileo was very happy to create beautiful metaphors,

262
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.950
to invent marvelous characters, to draw pictures.

263
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.990
He knew how to light that labyrinth so the rest of us could see inside because

264
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.110
the more abstract and mathematical science gets,

265
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.080
the more we need to imagine something concrete.

266
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.820
As the physicist Alan Lightman has said,

267
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.290
we are blind people inventing what we don't see,

268
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.780
and yet 400 years later,

269
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.760
many scientists become a very weary of metaphors of adjectives,

270
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.170
of the active tents. It was observed that is much nicer for these people.

271
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:12.980
For some reason that I saw, and I can tell you from personal experience,

272
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:15.950
they do not like talking to reporters because they think whatever they say,

273
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:20.900
this journalist person is going to turn it into something stupid and cartoony

274
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:25.040
and wrong, and yeah, you're applauding. But, and maybe that's true,

275
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.030
but I was happy to learn that these people are just as nasty about each other.

276
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.230
My favorite example

277
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.570
is a pair of letters from Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger.

278
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.550
Two of the 20th century is great physicist.

279
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.830
Schrodinger liked to think in pictures.

280
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:43.610
His most famous one being the image of a cat in a box who paradoxically is both

281
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:45.410
alive and dead at the same time. Don't ask.

282
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.330
The point is Schrodinger love pictures and Heisenberg, he loved numbers.

283
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.960
And when shorting a read Heisenberg's papers and they were so mathematical,

284
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:57.110
he wrote, I am repelled his word.

285
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.670
I am repelled by the methods of transcendental Algebra. That's so lack,

286
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:06.350
visualized, stability. And Heisenberg answered back, Oh yeah, by, I mean,

287
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.310
probably didn't say it that way. The more I reflect on Schrodinger's work,

288
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:13.520
the more disgusting I find it. And disgusting is a quote.

289
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:14.480
It's Heisenberg's word.

290
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.770
So there is a tension here among scientists between two kinds of truth,

291
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.280
math and narrative, but the job that we faced,

292
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:24.920
and I should come clean with you and tell you what's really on my mind here,

293
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.990
is to put more stories out there about nature that are true and complex,

294
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:34.580
not dumbed down, but still have the power to enthrall to excite,

295
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.350
to remind people there's a deep beauty, a many leveled beauty in the world.

296
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.770
And what scientists say is not their off hand opinion.

297
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.940
It's hard one information. It's carefully hewn from the world.

298
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.520
It's not the bunch of ideas from a tribe of privileged intellectuals who look

299
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:53.670
down on everybody even though they are indeed up here looking down on you.

300
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.510
But it's my sense that if more scientists wanted to,

301
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.950
they could learn how to tell their stories with words and pictures and metaphor

302
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.840
and people will hear and remember those stories and not be as willing to accept

303
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:10.200
the other folk stories. Or at least there'll be a tug of war.

304
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.770
And I think that the science stories too will surprisingly win.

305
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.850
I remember standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon looking down to that enormous

306
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:20.910
hole created by running water, endlessly running water,

307
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:24.240
felt fed by a distant Colorado rain. And I thought, you know,

308
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:26.100
how did this beautiful thing happen?

309
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.730
And in my head I heard a line written by Lauren Isley, a great,

310
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:32.850
great scientist and writer, a line I read in college,

311
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.730
which describes the magnificent violence hidden in a raindrop.

312
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.270
And when I look back at the canyon at the roaring river there,

313
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.320
that's what I saw.

314
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.970
Magnificent violence hidden in a torrent of old green drops.

315
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.900
Now we can't all be that good. And even when we try, we don't always win again.

316
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.960
I'm thinking of Ross again, poor Ross and the show friends,

317
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:58.500
he puts 200 fossils in front of Phoebe.

318
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.040
He brings him in a suitcase to show her how overtime fossils gradually change

319
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.140
and evolve into recognizable forms. And he said,

320
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:06.000
I'm going to lay them out for you, all for you to see.

321
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.350
And you're going to see this with your own eyes.

322
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.170
Cause these fossils are from all over the world. And Phoebe says, really?

323
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.580
You can actually see it. And Ross says, you bet from the u s China, Africa,

324
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:16.900
all over. And Phoebe says, well, you know, I didn't none of that.

325
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.740
Or Russell as well. There you go. And Phoebe says, Huh?

326
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.510
So now the real question is who put those fossils there and why?

327
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.980
So yes, science stories don't always win, but at the very least,

328
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.370
it should be a tug of war. And if you tell them right,

329
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.850
they have power to change minds. On my way here,

330
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.750
I read a story in Smithsonian magazine as a good example of what I'm talking

331
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:42.540
about. Imagine that you're sitting on your porch with a friend,

332
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:44.640
a non-science friend, and as you sit there,

333
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:48.720
a Robin and ordinary Robin wanders onto the lawn and you say to your friend,

334
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:52.380
you see that Robyn? Did you know that Robbins, in fact,

335
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:54.690
all birds are directly descended from dinosaurs.

336
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.460
And in a way that Robin is a small, feathery, modern dinosaur.

337
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.120
Huh? And if your friends are like my friends, she would say, well,

338
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.150
let me go away, but don't go away. Instead, you could tell them a story,

339
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.040
which is how I'm going to conclude. Eight years ago, Bob Harmon,

340
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.570
who works for the Museum of the Rockies,

341
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:17.820
was having lunch in a canyon somewhere in Montana,

342
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.570
and he looked up at a big rock face and he saw a bone sticking out of a wall

343
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.230
just a bit. The bone turned out to be part of a tyrannosaurus rex,

344
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:27.990
one of the best preserved examples of a TRX found anywhere.

345
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.340
And after three years of carefully, carefully, carefully chipping away,

346
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.780
they got a 2000 pound skeleton out of the wall and it was removed from the

347
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:40.140
canyon. And the dinosaur was named Bob in honor of Mr. Harmon.

348
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.280
And on the way out for various logistical reasons, they had to break a leg bone.

349
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.590
And some of the fragments were sent to laboratory scientists around the world,

350
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.260
including to a scientist in North Carolina named Mary Schweitzer.

351
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.670
So Mary Schweitzer gets a bone of a bone fragment in the mail and she opens it

352
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:59.650
up and she looks at it. And although Bob the dinosaur was 68 million years old,

353
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.340
almost immediately, she said, as soon as she look, this is not a Bob,

354
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.220
this dinosaur is a girl and she's a pregnant girl.

355
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.910
And what Mary knew is that when women get pregnant,

356
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.210
they use calcium from their bones to build the skeletons of their developing

357
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.970
fetuses. And if the mother's a bird mother,

358
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.260
well birds form a very distinct structure in their bones when they're pregnant

359
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:22.870
and they need calcium to build eggs, egg shells.

360
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.420
So Mary had studied birds and when she looked at the dinosaur bone fragments,

361
00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:32.110
she saw just what pregnant birds have. But you know, just to be sure,

362
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:35.260
she looked up the most primitive birds, the moo and the ostrich.

363
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.170
And she called a bunch of ostrich beaters in North Carolina and she said,

364
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.920
anybody have a dead female? I need a, I need a leg bone here.

365
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.050
And a few months pass and the phone rings and it's a farmer saying,

366
00:21:45.051 --> 00:21:46.770
y'all need that lady ostrich.

367
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.220
And Mary and her two assistants drove to this farm to collect a dead ostrich,

368
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:54.430
which was in the farmers' backhoe bucket. And drove it back to Raleigh.

369
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.990
And what do you know? The former ostrich had been a pregnant former Austrian,

370
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.480
and the next year Mary published a paper in science,

371
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:06.220
which shows the dinosaur bone right next to the ox of the ostrich bone showing

372
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:09.640
nearly identical features. And since then another t-rex,

373
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:12.700
this one in Argentina was found to have the same calcium structure.

374
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.650
So there's more evidence here that when you look deep inside dinosaurs and deep

375
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:21.430
inside birds, what you see is very, very similar,

376
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.990
which gives us yet another reason to think that the Robyn in your front yard is

377
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.640
an Itty bitty dinosaur.

378
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.280
And then Mary went on to do many more interesting things about dinosaurs.

379
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:31.880
But if you are non-science,

380
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.300
Fran can listen to that story and lean in a little and hear how scientists work

381
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:40.810
with bones and dead birds and buckets patiently looking for patterns.

382
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.620
You have just placed a sword in the hand of your friend.

383
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.670
So the next time somebody tells her that scientists are no idols who toss off

384
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:53.470
opinions, that scientists science is an elitist plot. She would think, well,

385
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.530
but I did hear this story and the scientific method gets a little more defense,

386
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.750
a little protection, but better than that,

387
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.890
the next time your friend sees a Robin, she'll see,

388
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.410
I hope more than a Robin. She'll glance it,

389
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:12.820
a little bird pecking for worms on the lawn and she'll travel 60 million years

390
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:16.630
back in time to a place which creation is say did not exist.

391
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.400
But now because of your story,

392
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.130
your friend has a pregnant tyrannosaurus in her head.

393
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:22.870
But the unfortunate name Bob,

394
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.570
which makes Robbins and Sparrows and chickadees and crows and all birds,

395
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:32.020
just a little more amazing and a little more delightful to look at,

396
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.340
which means you win. The creation is can't be delight.

397
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.560
You have smoked them with your story.

398
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.370
So Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2008 mindful of the fact that this

399
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.980
place, this institution,

400
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:49.910
which is about to confer upon you a bachelor's of science degree and all your

401
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:52.850
others here and there who are getting your master's is in your doctorates.

402
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.320
Knowing as you much that places like this with their culture of intellectual

403
00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:00.710
freedom and respect for truth and love of inquiry,

404
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:04.400
not to mention illegal bonfires on city streets and basketball teams that lose

405
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.360
207 games in a row, but not the women's team.

406
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:11.390
I heard that they're astonishing. Two game back to back winning streak. Yes,

407
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:15.130
yes. You know,

408
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.430
you know that when you receive your degree today,

409
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.460
you are part of and you are celebrating something very rare and very precious

410
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.840
and very fragile. In our world,

411
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:31.230
this place celebrates freedom and because you are now free men and women,

412
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.680
you have to protect what you've been given by helping others who haven't been

413
00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:40.450
here and are never coming here to understand the value of what you do and what

414
00:24:40.451 --> 00:24:42.820
your teachers do and what their predecessors have done,

415
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.800
which is why an hour or so from now when your brother or your aunt or your mom

416
00:24:47.801 --> 00:24:51.700
asks you, so why don't you been up to while you've been here? Take a chance,

417
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.610
find the words, find the metaphor,

418
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.140
share the beauty and tell them what's on your mind. Tell them a story.

419
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.820
Thank you very, very much.

420
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.050
<v 3>Thank you very much Robert,</v>

421
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:09.110
for sharing your stories and your challenges with us.

422
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.200
I can't really imagine any more appropriate words for Caltech commencement.

423
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:20.950
<v 2>I'd like you all to turn before in your program and joined the Cal Tech League</v>

424
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.723
club.

425
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.420
So

426
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.410
<v 0>that's what I told the Caltech Eas. If you have any beef or any thoughts,</v>

427
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:39.030
any reaction, I'd love to hear what you think.

428
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:41.520
You can write us at our website and again,

429
00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:45.230
we'd like you to hang onto the fall when we have a whole new season of radio

430
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.433
lab.

431
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

432
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.100
<v 4>way, way wait, podcast is not over.</v>

433
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.510
I'm Jad and back from the meeting and Robert Forgot to read the credits.

434
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.210
So here I am to do, to do that for him. Um,

435
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.450
thank you to cal tech for providing us with the audio and for choosing you

436
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:06.410
Crowley to give the talk. Radio lab is funded by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

437
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.680
the corporation for public broadcasting, the National Science Foundation.

438
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.410
I'm Jack and Ron. Thanks for listening.
