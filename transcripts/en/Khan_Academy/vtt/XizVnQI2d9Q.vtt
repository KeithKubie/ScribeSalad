00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.700
We're on problem 19.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.700
If k, n, x, and y are positive
numbers satisfying-- let's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.560
see, what did they write?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:22.340
They wrote x to the minus 4/3 is
equal to k to the minus 2.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.680
y to the positive 4/3 is
equal to n squared.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:42.760
What is xy to the minus 2/3
in terms of n and k?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.160
All right, so we just have to
rewrite this in terms of n and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.380
k, so let me write it big.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:01:03.000
So xy to the minus 2/3, that
equals x to the minus 2/3,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.690
times y to the minus 2/3.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.700
We know what x to the 4/3 is.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.820
This is what I wrote here, it
might not be that legible.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.000
Sorry.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.090
So this is a 4, right?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.740
We know what x to the
minus 4/3 is.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.300
So can we rewrite this as x to
the minus 4/3 to something?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.780
Well, sure.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.370
We can rewrite this term, right
here, we can write this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.310
as-- let me write it right below
it so you don't get too

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.030
confused-- as x to the minus
4/3, and then you raise that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.590
to the 1/2 power.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.460
This is the same
thing as this.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.730
How do I know that?

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.070
Well, if I multiply 4/3 times
1/2-- because I'm raising

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.780
something to an exponent, and
then that to an exponent-- if

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.420
I multiply minus 4/3 times 1/2,
I get minus 2/3, right?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.970
This 2 cancels out, this
becomes a 2, and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.450
this is what I get.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.870
You can try it out.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.886
Similarly, I want to write this
second term-- I'm going

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:09.479
to do it in green-- this
y to the minus 2/3.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.040
I know what y to the
4/3 is, right?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.970
So I want to write it as y to
the 4/3 to some other power.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.340
So 4/3 times what is
equal to minus 2/3?

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.080
Well, 4/3 times minus 1/2.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.510
And you can try it out.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.570
4/3 times minus 1/2 is equal
to minus 2/3, right?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.780
A positive times a negative
equals a negative.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.380
And then the 4 and the
2 end up just the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.690
2-- sorry, I'm burping.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.580
So what does this become?

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.010
Well, we know what x to the
minus 4/3 is, right? x to the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.380
minus 4/3 is equal to
k to the minus 2.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.990
So that first term is equal to
this, is equal to k-- that's

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.690
too dark-- k to the minus 2, and
then we're raising that to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.000
the 1/2-- right, that's the
same 1/2 right there-- and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.190
then y to the 4/3.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.150
What's y to the 4/3?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.400
Well, that's n squared.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.310
And then that's, of course,
the minus 1/2.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.820
And then we can multiply.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.980
What's minus 2 times 1/2?

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.960
Well, it's just minus 1.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.050
So it's k to the minus 1.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.560
And then what's 2
times minus 1/2?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.473
It's minus 1 again.

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:31.910
So k to the minus 1,
n to the minus 1.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.790
And that's the same thing
as 1/kn, or 1/nk,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.720
which is choice A.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.090
And I just realized that there's
actually an easier way

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.850
to do that.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.290
We could've done it like this,
we could have just said-- let

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.160
me see, let me erase this stuff,
because it's, I think,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.850
good for you to know the easier
way, instead of the way

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.000
I just showed you
how to do it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Let me erase all of this.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.820
I think we would've
saved some steps,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.070
and been more intuitive.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.350
Let me erase all of this, I just
wanted to keep what I had

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.320
written before.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.820
Erase, erase, erase.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.800
OK, I think that's
good enough.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.220
You can just ignore the
stuff on the right.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.310
So we could've simplified
these ahead of time.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.645
We could have said, x to the
minus 4/3 is equal to k

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:24.590
to the minus 2.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:34.870
If we raised both of these
to the 1/2 power,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.520
we would get what?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.860
Minus 4/3 times 1/2 is-- we
would have gotten x to the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.740
minus 2/3 is equal to-- what's
negative 2 times 1/2?

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.360
It's negative 1, right?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.270
It would've equaled k
to the negative 1.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.050
And similarly, if we had raised
y to the 4/3 equals n

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.690
squared, if we'd raised both of
those to the minus 1/2-- if

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.095
you do something on one side of
the equation, you just have

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:07.090
to do it on the other-- then you
would have gotten y to the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.500
minus 2/3 is equal to
n to the minus 1.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.550
And then this would have been
really easy to solve.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.480
xy to the minus 2/3 is the same
thing as x to the minus

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.430
2/3, times y to the minus 2/3.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.200
x to the the minus 2/3
is k to the minus 1.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.350
And y to the negative 2/3
is n to the minus 1.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.780
So it would have been k to the
minus 1, n to the minus 1.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.600
That's 1/nk.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.470
Well, I guess in hindsight I can
say this was easier, but

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.260
the way we did it would've also
worked, and you really

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.394
don't know sometimes which one
will be the shortcut when you

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:42.490
do it the first time.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.580
But either way could've
worked.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.630
You could've simplified ahead of
time, if you had seen that

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.130
you wanted to get it into
2/3, not 4/3, because

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.390
they had a 2/3 here.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.390
Or you could just go the way
we did it the first time,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.450
either way works.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.780
Next problem, problem
number 20.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.140
OK, functions of f and g.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.100
So I'm going to have to do some
drawing here, if we have

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.362
enough time.

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:11.740
So I have to draw two of them.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.090
That one's going to be
for f, and this one's

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.340
going to be for g.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.430
What points are there?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.090
So f of x-- let's see,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.875
f of x is 2 points back, and
it intersects there.

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:36.210
And it intersects at the point
minus 1 comma 1, 2, 3, so it

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.400
intersects here.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.190
And then it goes through
the origin.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.530
And then it goes
to 1, minus 3.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.830
So that's 1, 2, 3, 1,
so it goes here.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.120
And then it goes at 2 comma
0, and it intersects here.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.010
So let me try to draw that.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.056
So the graph looks something
like this.

00:06:56.056 --> 00:06:59.920
It goes up, it intersects this
point, comes down through the

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.410
origin, goes down here, and
then goes up like that.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.795
That is y equals f of x.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.295
Now what does g of x do?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.360
g of x goes to 2 comma 1.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.630
So 1, 2 comma 1.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.600
Then it's to 4, minus 5.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.030
So 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5-- 4, minus 5.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.920
And then it goes back up.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.370
So it looks something
like this.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.170
It goes down, goes up like that,
goes back up like that.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.240
The figures above show
the graph of the

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.330
functions f and g.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:55.350
The function f is defined by--
so this one-- f of x is equal

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.890
to x to the third minus 4x.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:09.150
The function g of x is equal
to f of x plus h, plus k,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.250
where h and k are constants.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.040
What is the value of k?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.570
So essentially, what they're
saying is, g of x is f of x

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.190
shifted up or down by some
value, k, right?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.750
Because when you add a constant
to a function, you're

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.000
just moving it up or down
by some value, k.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.590
And when you add h, that means
you're shifting it to-- let me

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.380
make sure I get this right-- so
if it was x minus h, that

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.570
means you're shifting it
to the right by h.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.690
So x plus h means you're
shifting it to the left by h.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.840
So k is the easy one.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.190
This point corresponds
to this point.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.360
So how much did we shift down?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.030
This is the point negative
1 comma 3.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.070
And this is the point
2 comma 1.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.020
So we went from y equals
3 to y equals 1, right?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.130
So we shifted down by 2.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.710
So k is going to be minus 2.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.730
And similarly you could
do it with this point.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.110
So k is equal to minus 2.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.120
Now we have to figure out how
much we shifted left to right.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.690
So [? similarly, ?]

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.810
these are the corresponding
points, because you can look

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.250
at them in the graph.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.575
So we went from minus
1 to positive 2.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.100
So we shifted to
the right by 3.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.860
And you could do the same thing
with this point here at

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.380
the bottom.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.840
We shifted to the right by 3.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.990
So if I wanted to shift f of x
to the right by 3, I would

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.730
write it like this,
f of x minus 3.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.500
That's how I would shift a
function to the right by 3.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.080
They're saying plus h, so
h has to be minus 3.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.870
h is minus 3.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.090
And minus 3 times minus 2?

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.530
Well, that's positive 6,
which is choice E.
