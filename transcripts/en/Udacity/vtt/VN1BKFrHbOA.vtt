Both the web browsers and

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.230
web service are vulnerable,
because they need to execute or

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.168
generate dynamic content based on
user input, which can be malicious.

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:14.190
In cross-site scripting, the attacker
injects a script into a website, and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.730
the user's browser executes this script.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.420
In cross-site request forgery,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.060
the attacker tricks the user's
browser into issuing a request.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.590
And the website executes this request.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.020
In SQL injection, the attacker
injects malicious query actions.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.780
And a website's backend database
server executes this malicious query.
