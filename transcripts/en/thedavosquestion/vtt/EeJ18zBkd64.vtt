I'm Harmut Reinke and I'm the Regional Director

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960
for Turkey, Middle East and Africa for DuPont
in that region. The question is about role

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.630
models. I truly believe that role models are
very important for that part of the world.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.680
Leadership has to be help up. Young people
have to be brought to the work cycles. Society

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.780
has to see role models as the ones that are
helping to shaping politics, economy and overall

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.440
shift of the modern economy. So for Middle
East building up role models or having an

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:46.520
opportunity for people to become role models
is absolutely important. When we look at all

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.772
the expatriots that are coming into the region,
they may not be the right ones because they're

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:48.772
not coming from the right cultural background.
So a role model, the benchmark for the locals

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:50.680
have to be their own people. They have to
develop their own future and convince the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.629
world here on the right track in the Middle
East.
