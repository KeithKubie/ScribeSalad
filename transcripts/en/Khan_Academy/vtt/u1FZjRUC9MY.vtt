00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome back.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.160
We are on problem number 13.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.560
It's on page 491.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.070
The price of a telephone was
first increased by 10%, and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.300
then the new price was
decreased by 25%.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.860
The final price was what price
of the initial price?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.320
The price final is equal
to the initial

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.540
price-- price initial.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.640
So the price of a telephone,
the initial price, was

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.610
increased by 10%.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.970
So when you increase something
by 10%, that's like

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.322
multiplying it by 1.1.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:46.040
Or you could say 1 plus 10%.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.080
That's 1.1.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.030
And then it was decreased
by 25%.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.270
Well, decreasing something by
25% is the same thing as

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.810
multiplying by 0.75.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.340
Why is that?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.370
Because that's 1 minus 0.25.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.250
And so this sets up our
relationship, and so we just

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800
have to do some math.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:16.510
What is 0.75 times 1.1?

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.540
That's 75.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540
0, 75, 5, 8.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.930
And how many points do we have
in the decimal point?

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.310
One, two, three.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.240
Three points.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.310
So we have price final
is equal to price

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.220
initial times 0.825.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.420
And what do they say?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.690
The final price was what percent
of the initial price?

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.440
So that's it.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.335
The final price is 82.5%
of the initial price.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.930
And the main thing to just
realize, when you increase

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.980
something by 10%, that's
the equivalent of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.960
multiplying it by 1.1.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.240
And then when you decrease
something by 25%, that's the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.610
same thing as multiplying
it by 0.75.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.020
And why?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.640
Because it's 1 minus 0.25.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.990
You're decreasing it by 25%.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.690
And that is choice C.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.720
Next problem.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.425
Number 14.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.130
This is what I do every
day in my job.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.800
I work for a hedge fund.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm always doing percentages.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.530
Image.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.780
Invert colors.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.960
I do other things.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.000
Don't think my entire livelihood
is based on just

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.520
multiplying percentages, but a
surprising fraction of it is.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.970
Anyway, all right.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.200
Problem number 14.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.590
When the number w is multiplied
by 4, the result is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.120
the same as 4 is added to w.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.000
OK, so it's saying when w is
multiplied by 4, so 4w, is the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.200
same thing as the result as
when 4 is added to w.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.160
So it's the same thing
as w plus 4.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.850
Fair enough.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.580
What is the value of 3w?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.320
3w is equal to what?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.730
Well, subtract w from both
sides of this equation.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.460
You get 3w equals 4.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.730
That might have been
the fastest problem

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.690
we had to do, right?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.420
We just solved it.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.770
3w is equal to 4.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.020
Choice E.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.560
Problem 15.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.330
The lengths of the sides of a
right triangle are consecutive

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.530
even integers.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.520
Fascinating.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.120
And the length of the
shortest side is x.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.010
It looks like I'm going
to have to draw a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.450
triangle, in yellow.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.335
So it's a right triangle.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.470
That looks like a right
triangle to me.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.350
And they say they're consecutive
even integers, and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.100
the shortest side is x.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.940
So let's say this is x.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.340
Consecutive even integers.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.040
So the next even integer is
going to be x plus 2.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.320
And then the last integer,
it's going to be the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.400
hypotenuse, the next one.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.350
And that's going to have
to be x plus 4.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.770
And they want to
know what is x?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.410
Or what equation can be
used to solve for x?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.860
Well, this is the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.650
So we just say this squared plus
this squared is equal to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.170
this squared.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.269
So x squared plus x
plus 2 squared is

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.480
equal to x plus 4 squared.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.500
Now let me see if this
is already there

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.790
in any of the choices.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.940
x squared plus x plus
2 squared is

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.100
equal to x plus 4 squared.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.870
Yeah, it's already there.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.820
We didn't do any simplifying.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.500
This is choice C.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.390
And we are done.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.690
These problems are extremely
fast to do.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.710
And the important realization
is that they're consecutive

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.370
even integers.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.800
So you add 2 each time,
and you just use

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.770
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.260
Next problem.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.670
Problem 16.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:05.990
If x is an integer greater than
1, and if y is equal to x

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.900
plus 1/x, which of the following
must be true?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.450
I like these.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.460
OK, I'll write all
the choices down.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.500
II, and III.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.850
OK, this first one says
y does not equal x.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.870
The second one says
y is an integer.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.340
The last one says xy is greater
than x squared.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.660
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.920
First of all, do we know
that y is an integer?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.530
Well, no, not really.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.710
I could immediately find an x.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.460
If x is equal to 2,
then y is what?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.840
It's 2 plus 1/2.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.450
It's equal to 2 and 1/2.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.050
So we know y isn't an integer.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.960
If x is an integer, y doesn't
have to be one.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.040
So we know this is definitely
not the case.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.880
Now, do we know for a fact
that y does not equal x?

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.610
Well, let's play with this
equation to see if we can get

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.720
it to a form that makes a little
bit more sense to us.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.990
So we know that x is greater
than 1, or that x

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.650
does not equal 0.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.790
And obviously, this would be
undefined if x equals 0.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.200
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by x.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:27.980
So we get xy is equal
to x squared plus 1.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.680
This, all of a sudden,
looks fascinating.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.850
xy is equal to x
squared plus 1.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:41.850
So do we know immediately that
xy is greater than x squared?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.960
Well, sure.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.970
No matter what x squared is, xy
is going to be that number

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.030
plus 1, right?

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.940
And this term is always
going to be positive.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.260
This is always going
to be positive.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.910
There's no way you can
get x squared plus 1.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.015
If you're not dealing with
imaginary numbers, it's going

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:00.660
to be negative, so this whole
thing's going to be positive.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.580
x is positive.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.840
So if this is positive, x is
positive, we know also that y

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.770
is going to be positive.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.770
I don't know if that
helps, but anyway.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.860
But we know that xy is always
1 more than x squared, so we

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.080
do know that xy is
greater than x

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.750
squared, so this is true.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.400
Now, let's see if we can show
that y has to not equal x.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.110
Well, let's think about it.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:31.740
No matter what x is, y is going
to be equal to some

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.470
fraction larger than x.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.130
And as you get really, really,
really large x's, that

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.420
fraction, the difference,
is going to get smaller.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.570
You could try it on
a calculator.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:47.390
If you put in x is 5,
then y is 5 and 1/5.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:55.240
If x is 500, then y
is 500 and 1/500.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.280
But no matter what number you
put in that's a larger number

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.460
than 1, you're going to get
a little bit left over.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.080
y is going to be just
that little bit

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.240
fraction larger than x.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.010
So we know for a fact that y is
going to be not equal to x.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.680
And so this is also true.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.230
So choices I and III, and
that is choice D.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.430
We are done with this section,
because there's only 16

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.850
problems as far as I can tell.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.480
Yep, only 16 problems. Actually,
I think we're done

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.890
with all the math sections
in this test

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.240
number 2 in the book.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.120
I will see you in the next
test. See you soon.
