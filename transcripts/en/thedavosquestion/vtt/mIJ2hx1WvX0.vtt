00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
&gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube.
My name is Bill George.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.799
I'm a professor at Harvard Business School,
wrote a book called "True

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.000
North" and I am passionate about leadership
and I think the most

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
important thing that we can do in 2008 is
to select leaders who are

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.330
more committed to the global community than
they are to their personal

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.161
self-interest.
We need leaders who know how to collaborate

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:24.029
across country, company,
and NGO lines and bring people together in

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.550
a collaborative sense to --
to change the world and start addressing the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.179
really tough problems we
have in the world like health care, poverty,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.010
global peace, education,
and until we to that, I don't think we're

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.140
gonna get there until we get
a new generation of leaders and so I'm really

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.020
interested in seeing the
new generation of leaders to overthrow the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.850
baby boomers and step up to
take on leadership roles and start making

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.620
this world a better place
right now.
