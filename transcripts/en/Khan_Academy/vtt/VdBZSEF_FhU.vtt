00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.540
We're on problem 65.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:16.340
They wrote 2, 4, 6, 8,
n, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.110
And they tell us, in the list
above, if n is an integer

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.090
between 1 and 10, inclusive--
so that means n could be 1,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.760
and it could be 10, or any
number inbetween, and it's an

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.090
integer-- then the median must
be-- the median, right, not

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.440
the mean, the median.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.830
So the median means the
middle number, right?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.520
Let's put all the other
numbers in order.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:01:02.310
So we have 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.470
And they're essentially
saying that n could

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.730
be anywhere in this.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.960
It could be a 1 here, it could
be right here, it could be

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.400
another 2, it doesn't tell us.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.930
It could be any number, it could
be 2, could be another

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.090
3, could be 10.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.540
We don't know.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420
But before we stick n in
here, let's figure out

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.250
what the middle is.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.690
Right here we have eight
numbers, so the middle of the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.580
range is actually-- there is no
middle number-- but when we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.130
add n, there will be
a middle number.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.380
So let's just think about
it for a little bit.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.380
If n is 5 or less, so n goes
into this bucket, n goes

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.890
someplace here, then
what happens?

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.120
Then what becomes the
middle number?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.090
If n is 5 or less, then
we'll have n here.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.235
And n might be 5, n might
go right here.

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:52.520
But what becomes the
middle number?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.890
Then we have 1, 2, 3, 4 on
this side of the middle

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.760
number, and we have 1, 2, 3, 4
on that side of the number.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.980
So then, the median, which is
the middle number, becomes 5.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.840
That's if n is 5 or less.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.180
If n is less than or equal to
5, then we know that the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.220
median will be equal to 5.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.120
Now let's do the opposite
thought experiment.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.990
What if n is 6 or more?

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.840
What if n is greater
than or equal to 6?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.030
So it goes someplace over
here, so n will

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.720
go someplace here.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.010
Could be 6, I might have
to put it right there.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.320
But wherever I put it on the
side, I'll have 4 to the right

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.840
of 6, and I'll have 4
to the left of 6.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.580
n isn't on this side anymore,
4 to the left of 6.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.830
So then the median would be 6.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.580
And either of these cases
have to be true for n.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.520
So the median is either 5 or
6, and that is choice B.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.670
Problem 66.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.160
I like this brownish color.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.240
Reminds me of when I was
in middle school math

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.160
competitions.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:11.580
4u7, n23, 162.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.390
And you add them all together,
you get one 1,222.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.390
And what they want to know is,
if n and u represent single

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.640
digits in the correctly worked
computation above, what is the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.640
value of n plus u?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.830
So the best thing to do is to
try to work these out, and see

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.340
what happens.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.870
So 7 plus 3 is 10,
plus 2 is 12.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.340
So you would write a 2 here,
which they already

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.830
wrote, and carry a 1.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.690
And now we have 1 plus u-- let
me write this down-- 1 plus u

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.150
plus 2 plus 6 is equal to, well,
it's either going to be

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.940
equal to 2, or some
digit and a 2.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.020
So let's just think about
it a little bit.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.080
1 plus u plus 2 plus 6, that's
equal to u plus 9.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.780
u plus 9 is going to have
to equal something.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.170
So if u is 9, and it has to be
something that ends with a 2.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.839
And remember, u can only
be between 0 and 9.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.890
It's a digit, it has to be an
integer, it has to be a digit.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.220
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.700
It has to be something
that ends in a 2.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.180
So the only next thing above
9 that ends as a 2 is 12.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.140
Because you can't get to 22.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.390
To get to 22, you would
have to add 13, and

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.810
you can't be 13.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.510
So this has to be a 12, so
u has to be equal to 3.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.500
That's the only possibility
that'll give you something

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.110
that ends in a 2.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.310
So if we assume that u is 3,
then we have 1 plus 3 plus 2

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:59.510
plus 6, which is 12, carry the
1, you get 1 plus 4 plus n

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.870
plus 1 is equal to 12.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.250
So you get 1 plus 4 plus 1.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.450
That's 6, plus n is equal to 12,
and n would be equal to 6.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.480
And they want to know
what n plus u is.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.490
So n plus u, 6 plus 3.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.070
That's equal to 9.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.135
And that is choice B, 9.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.270
67.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.920
Look at that, this is a dense
looking one, but let me write

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.080
down the little equation they
wrote on top. r is equal to

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:52.620
400 times d plus s minus
p, all of that over p.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.280
If stock is sold three months
after it is purchased, the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.210
formula above relates p, d, s,
and r, where p is the purchase

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.030
price of the stock.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.020
That's the purchase price.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.080
d is the amount of any
dividend received.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.380
Fair enough.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.840
s is the selling price of the
stock, and r is the yield of

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.450
the investment as a percent.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.540
Fair enough.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.550
If Rose purchased $400 worth
of stock-- so p is equal to

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.030
$400-- received a $5 dividend--
so d is equal to

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:35.140
$5-- and sold the stock for
$420, for three months after

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.230
purchasing-- so this formula
applies, because this is the

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.470
formula for selling after three
months-- what was the

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.750
yield of her investment,
according to the formula?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.370
Assuming she paid
no commissions.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.480
We just substitute in.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.500
So let's see.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:55.660
The yield would be equal to
400 times 5 plus 420 minus

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.750
400, p is 400, all
of that over 420.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:10.170
That is equal to 420 minus
400 is 20, plus 5 is 25.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:17.570
400 times 25 over-- this
shouldn't be 420, this is p.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.290
The price you paid was 400.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.050
25 over 400.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.680
I just substituted these values
into this equation.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.250
This cancels out, and I'm just
left with a yield of 25, and

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.550
it's probably in terms
of percent.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.350
Yep, 25%.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.340
E.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.790
All right, problem 68.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.770
Let's switch colors.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.010
68.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.660
The temperatures in degree
Celsius recorded at 6:00 in

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.140
the morning in various parts of
a certain country were 10

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.610
degrees, I'm not going to write
all of it, 5, minus 2,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:03.990
minus 1, minus 5, and 15.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.880
What is the median of
these temperatures?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.760
The median just means
the middle.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.820
Don't confuse that with the
average, which is the mean.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.160
Or the mean, which
is the average.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.800
Median means middle, so let's
just put them in order and

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.810
figure out the middle.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.540
So the smallest of
these numbers is

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.060
minus 5, cross it out.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.470
Then we have minus
2, cross it out.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.630
Then we have minus
1, cross it out.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.410
Then we have 5, cross it out,
then we have 10, cross it out.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.970
Then we have 15.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.150
So this is interesting
about median.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.780
If there is no true middle
number, you have three on this

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.582
side of negative 1, or negative
1 and less, and you

00:08:43.582 --> 00:08:45.100
have three on that side, so
there's no middle number,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.910
because we have an even
number of numbers.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.130
So what you want to do is, you
take the two middle numbers,

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.390
which are negative 1 and 5,
and you average them.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.830
So it's negative 1 plus 5 over
2, which equals 4 over 2,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.360
which is equal to 2.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.320
2 degrees Celsius, which
is choice C.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.640
Problem 69.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:20.320
If y times three 3x minus 5 over
2 is equal to y, and y

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.070
does not equal 0, then
x is equal to what?

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.310
Well the simplest thing, since
y doesn't equal 0, we can

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.760
divide both sides of
this equation by y.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.290
You divide both sides by y.
y divided by y is 1, y

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.300
divided by y is 1.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:40.520
So then we're left with 3x minus
5 over 2 is equal to 1.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.390
Multiply both sides by 2, you
get 3x minus 5 is equal to 2.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.830
Add 5 to both sides,
3x is equal to 7.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:57.540
And you get x is equal to 7
over 3, which is choice C.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.980
And I'm out of time, so I'll
see you in the next video.
