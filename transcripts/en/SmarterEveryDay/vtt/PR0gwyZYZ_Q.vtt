[Music]

00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:07.825
Hey it's me, Destin.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.273
The idea, here at Smarter Every
Day, is to make you smarter.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:14.050
I guess it was 1872, the
governor of California

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.205
tried to solve the age old question:

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.982
When a horse runs, are
all four of its hooves

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.130
off the ground at any point in transit?

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.941
Now, artists of the day
liked to show images with

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.979
the horses' feet up front
and in back off the ground.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.131
So he commissioned a guy
named Eadweard Muybridge

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:34.041
to create a series of images
while the horse was running.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.759
Now, Muybridge was pretty sharp, so what
he did is he strung some strings out,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:41.771
and had a man ride the horse
through the series of strings

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:44.647
and each string was
associated with a camera.

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:47.618
Basically, it was a time of arrival switch.

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:49.740
So, this was pretty interesting.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.709
Now this is a pulse
generator,

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:55.228
given to me by acompany in Montana
called Quantum Composers.

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:59.655
It is amazing. It is a time machine
without the flux capacitor, basically.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.152
Time for science.

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:04.430
What we're gonna do, is we've
got a piezoelectric transducer

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:07.078
rigged up to this thing
on the trigger input.

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:11.873
All you have to do is just trigger the
thing acoustically and it flashes.

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:17.387
And this is programmable down to
the 25 picosecond resolution.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:21.296
Here's a 1.8 second flash after...
[snaps fingers] the sound.

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.381
So, it's pretty awesome. Anyway...

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.989
So what we're gonna do is to create a
series of high speed photography images

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.292
and put them together in a video, just
like Muybridge did, back in the day.

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:32.970
So, let's do it.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:34.416
Weapons are not toys.

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.629
What you're about to see was
done by educated, experienced

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:38.682
personnel in a controlled environment.

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:39.968
Be smart.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.742
Let's load.

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:47.832
Muybridge bullet, take one. Here we go.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:50.368
[Gunshot]

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.274
[Pulse generator beeping]

00:01:57.465 --> 00:01:58.465
[Gunshot]

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:00.817
[Pulse generator beeping]

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:05.335
This is what the video looks
like straight up, just as shot.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.575
And this is what the video looks like once
I correct for the ballistic variance,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.713
And go in there and, uh... put
them in order, in distance.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.583
So, pretty cool.

00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:28.703
Okay, so some of you are thinking,
"that's awesome! No clue what it means."

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:30.047
So let me explain.

00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.441
Commercial high speed
cameras are very expensive,

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:34.220
But what we've done, for repetitive events,

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:36.284
we've created one at a
fraction of the cost,

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.942
and at 7 times the resolution of 1080p.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.461
So like Muybridge, we've
combined simpler technologies

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:44.072
to create something that was
technologically out of our reach.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.145
It's pretty cool.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.767
I've got some improvements
to this, keep an eye on me.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.311
Alright, it is way too late to be
playing with guns and time machines,

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:53.375
so I gotta go to bed.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.134
Um, today we did art, science, math...
a little bit of history,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.645
we played with guns and cameras.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.678
That's pretty awesome. So if you would,
subscribe and tell all your friends,

00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:05.308
I'm sure they'd enjoy this stuff too.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.633
I'll put a link down in the info
on the video, please click it.

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.474
The least you could do is
check the website out.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.350
If you're an engineer, it's
really really cool stuff.

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.983
I got my dad a chicken, for father's day.

00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:20.219
And I want to show you a
pretty interesting method

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:22.650
that chickens have to
keep their heads stable.

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:25.728
You know, in guidance and control
you have feedback loops,

00:03:25.753 --> 00:03:27.777
and so you have to know your position

00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:31.650
and where your relative motion is
going so you can compensate for it,

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.552
but chickens are really good at this so...

00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:38.166
I'll show you. Watch his
head stay totally stationary

00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:40.031
as I move his body...

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:43.802
