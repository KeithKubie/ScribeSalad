00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.431
- Let's see if we can solve the equation

00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:07.431
P squared is equal to 0.81.

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:10.109
So how could we think about this?

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.543
Well one thing we could
do is we could say,

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:14.225
look if P squared is equal to 0.81,

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:16.430
another way of expressing
this is, that well, that means

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.098
that P is going to be equal
to the positive or negative

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:23.256
square root of 0.81.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.472
Remember if we just wrote
the square root symbol here,

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:26.633
that means the principal root,

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.293
or just the positive square root.

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:31.509
But here P could be positive
or negative, because if you

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.541
square it, if you square
even a negative number,

00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:35.549
you're still going to
get a positive value.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.070
So we could write that P is equal

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.443
to the plus or minus square root of 0.81,

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:41.277
which kind of helps us, it's another way

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:44.203
of expressing the same,
the same, equation.

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:46.959
But still, what could P be?

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.989
In your brain, you might
immediately say, well okay,

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.624
you know if this was P
squared is equal to 81,

00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:53.866
I kinda know what's going on.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:58.335
Because I know that nine
times nine is equal to 81.

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:01.878
Or we could write that nine
squared is equal to 81,

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:03.874
or we could write that nine is equal

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:05.836
to the principal root of 81.

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.413
These are all, I guess,
saying the same truth

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:12.109
about the universe, but what about 0.81?

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.174
Well 0.81 has two digits behind,
to the right of the decimal

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.717
and so if I were to
multiply something that has

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:22.062
one digit to the right of
the decimal times itself,

00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:23.333
I'm gonna have something with two digits

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.747
to the right of the decimal.

00:01:24.747 --> 00:01:27.243
And so what happens if I
take, instead of nine squared,

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:29.599
what happens if I take 0.9 squared?

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:30.989
Let me try that out.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:32.474
Zero, I'm gonna use a different color.

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:37.377
So let's say I took 0.9 squared.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:41.499
0.9 squared, well that's going to be 0.9

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.787
times 0.9, which is going to be equal to?

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:50.355
Well nine times nine is 81,
and I have one, two, numbers

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:52.378
to the right of the decimal,
so I'm gonna have two

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.178
numbers to the right of
the decimal in the product.

00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:58.562
So one, two. So that
indeed is equal to 0.81.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:03.407
In fact we could write
0.81 as 0.9 squared.

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:06.627
So we could write this,
we could write that P

00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:10.484
is equal to the plus or
minus, the square root of,

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.117
instead of writing 0.81,

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:17.017
I could write that as 0.9 squared.

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:20.137
In fact I could also write
that as negative 0.9 squared.

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:22.636
Cause if you put a negative
here and a negative here,

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:24.482
it's still not going to change the value.

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:27.218
A negative times a negative
is going to be a positive.

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:29.041
I could, actually I would
have put a negative there,

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.039
which would have implied

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.724
a negative here and a negative there.

00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:33.877
So either of those are going to be true.

00:02:33.877 --> 00:02:35.549
But it's going to work out for us

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.888
because we are taking the
positive and negative square root.

00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:39.328
So this is going to be,

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:44.328
P is going to be equal
to plus or minus 0.9.

00:02:44.973 --> 00:02:48.043
Plus or minus 0.9, or we could write it

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.131
that P is equal to 0.9,

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:55.883
or P could be equal to negative 0.9.

00:02:55.883 --> 00:02:57.160
And you can verify that,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.838
you would square either of
these things, you get 0.81.
