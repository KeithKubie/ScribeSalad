00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Tell me about Deep Learning

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.980
ermm... maybe it can start slightly mathy

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.860
okay but uh we can just go after with an example to see what what things are right.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.200
But

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.160
One one typical example is: if somebody wants to assess automatically what is the ehh umm price of uhh of a property?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.120
So there are certain variables that are important for property: you know
X1, X2 to whatever.. Xn

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.680
You know, these might be:
- The square meters
- This is like ehh uhh year of construction. Whatever else, right?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.980
and ehh...

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.980
then, the most

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.140
simple way of... of finding uhh an estimated value

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.340
is to say okay I'm gonna do this

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.320
a1, a2... aN

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.980
+

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.580
Uh usually we... you have a bias term

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.540
something like that

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.280
this gives you the estimated price, yeh?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040
and you can represent it like this, right?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.960
you have the input variables

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.880
And then you have err your output variable

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
and then, you do this meaning that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.760
you have this value, you have an a1 here

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.200
aN here

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.640
and all of these is summed here into the summation

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.380
Ok, so for instance, the larger the building, the higher the numberrrrrrr

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380
the... maybe the... the newer the house

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.060
YEH

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.480
or the more valuable it is [YEH] or whatever

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.480
YEH of which floor or whatever, right?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
so errhm this this is just

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480
a weighted combination of certain factors

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.220
right? so

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.220
so uh it all comes out a big number

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.840
right?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.060
that's [it, it will... yeh]

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
huh-hopefully you uh have uh more or less accurate

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.760
ehh weight, right? ehh

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
uhh of describing the ehh prices

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960
so how do you ermm... ehh... learn

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
this thing right so you can just, you know

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.360
decide yourself to put, to put the something here

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
more or less what, what comes out

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
makes sense, right? But ehh so usually

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360
you just find say hundred examples

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.740
right? err

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840
if, if you're interested in doing this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840
maybe you have, you know, a backlog of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840
of, of houses sold, right?

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
and then you more or less you know, plot

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080
the value in order to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080
visualize it we do it err... with only one

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.860
variable

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.020
which is in square meters, right?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.520
So, you have one example here and another here

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.020
and you have, this cloud of exmples, right?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.660
So this means that each one of these x's is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
You sold a house that is...number of square meters

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.440
for this price over here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.220
yah?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.620
And then you try to... more or less feed that, so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.320
so, you can say: I'm gonna do, like a straight line

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.120
that I will tell the relation between the square meters and the value

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.160
So, tomorrow if someone tells you, "you have this 80 square meter house"

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.620
there's a price, right?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.900
Then you come here and you say, "Okay, the price is this."

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.740
Yah. Which is the best line, you don't know.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.000
That is the question.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.280
You say, maybe a line is not a good thing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.320
so you will use a quadratic function, right?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.880
Because, like, you know maybe, larger houses, there are more uhh

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.560
they are not so easy to come by so

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.640
and you still have higher ends

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.920
so, things will not go linearly

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.460
So, there's a curve line, for those who are not mathematical. It's a curve line

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.060
yes, it's a curve line that will involve more

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.120
variables, right?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.480
and this means that you can feed things that are not so straight

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.120
so you have more flexibility in what you can model

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.340
This comes at the cost of having more variables to describe the model.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.440
And there's always this type of relation

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.820
you have more power to represent something and then

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.700
and you can cut through a thick of relations

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.740
so how to...which kind of model is best

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.060
this is not something that is clear at all

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.340
it's not like, "just throw as many variables as you can"

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.640
and we'll feed better

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.900
because you will be doing something that's called overfeeding

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.300
which is, you would be overestimating how well you do things

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.180
so maybe if you put enough variables

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.300
and you have a set of points, right?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.260
and then you will do this and you say

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.040
okay, I exactly predict everything

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.420
but then reality is that at some point you will get something there

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.040
and you're totally wrong

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.300
So, many parameters makes things hard

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.480
to optimize

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.820
so, in a plot structure...you have all of these

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.960
and then you have this variable that is a summation

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.760
and this is your output

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.840
and what you can do, as opposed to this, a deep structure

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.180
so a flat structure is just kind of traditional machine learning

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.240
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.140
Neural networks is something that has been around for a very long time.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.440
and neural network can be either shallow

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.840
shallow is better, it's a better name

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.540
shallow structure or

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.440
or it can be a deep structure

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.660
Shallow learning, we add everything together

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.880
we come up with a number

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.220
That number gives us, "how good is this or how bad is that"

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.560
Yeah

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.640
Deep learning, other stuff's going on, right?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.480
Yeah, so there's some variables in the middle

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.740
in between your input, the values that you are able to measure

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.900
like the size of the flat or the year of construction

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.660
and something happens that tells you some intermediate variables

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.880
and then from these intermediate variables you will get the output

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.640
you will get the prediction, or maybe

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.420
you will put yet another intermediate set of variables

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.800
and so forth

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.640
So, uhm...There are some compound concepts that might

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.640
be good for predicting

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.800
what you want to know. If you could have

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.980
direct prediction of this kind of structure

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.600
that would tell you what is the price

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.520
but maybe, the most relevant variables, in order to decide

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.100
what is the pricing is not one

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.720
of these things that were inputted

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.780
you might have to find some concepts that relate to a subset of this

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.920
in a certain way and that this is the real important

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.860
thing

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.820
so, for example, you might want to have

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.960
either a very large house with

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.640
several bathrooms

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.780
or you might want to have a small house and that  having one bathroom

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.180
is not a problem

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.320
this type of concept is a combination of more than one...you cannot decide

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.560
having one bathroom is bad

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.840
because it depends on the number of square meters of the house

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.020
the idea is that with deep learning, this thing right here will not be the price

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.260
this will be this intermediate concept

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.480
you will say, for example, I will create a concept

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.920
that you have bathrooms

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.300
and number of rooms

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.440
one one variable

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.240
and then these other things in here will not really matter

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.460
and then you can have something here that is basically

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.800
square meters...like, it's an important variable

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.640
independently of anything else

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.840
so, we will keep these. These are the only things that matter

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.100
for this variable, right?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.960
You know, maybe the year is a really good thing to have a new flat but maybe

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.480
if the property is more than 100 years old

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.480
suddenly it becomes really good

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.900
and maybe you want to have a concept that says

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.580
"Is this a new property or..."

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.260
you will have yet another concept that says "it's a historic property", right?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.540
and this will depend on the year but the type of relation

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.920
will be different because suddenly

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.680
it's not that old is bad

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.440
all becomes good

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.420
so you have to have all this set of intermediate concepts

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.340
in a way that now you can use them to decide

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.460
on the pricing of your house

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.560
and these will be more meaningful, more representative

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.440
of what people see

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.420
than just having the pure basic measure of things

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.800
in isolation

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.660
so, once you mix and combine some of these

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.120
will give you attributes

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.320
that are better in order to predict

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.400
but you can just do it again and again, right?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.000
so, there's no reason why you have to combine these things

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.740
only once

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.660
and suddenly you want, I don't know, for whatever reason you might

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.780
have a lot of market for

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.160
very old houses that

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.540
actually have

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.460
an even number of rooms and bathrooms

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.900
and then you create yet another layer

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.600
so instead of having these connections directly

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.440
to the pricing of the

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.280
house, you have yet another connection

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.420
we said that we have house with

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.320
that is really old so it just went up in value because it's a historical building

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.120
and then you have a very good configuration of

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.300
rooms and bathrooms, right?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.120
so this means that, for example, this variable here

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.340
that captures whether a good balance of rooms and bathrooms

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.900
will have a high value

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.620
we say that this variable is active

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.360
this will mean that, yeah, you have this variable active

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.680
you have this one...there was the one representing

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.200
whether the building was becoming historical

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.720
and with these two things having high value

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.760
then you have a high value also for

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.980
this variable over here

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.320
that will mean that you get really high

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.300
selling price in the end

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.160
instead, if you have a really bad

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.840
combination of room, bathroom

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.560
this variable here will have very low

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.860
value and then, instead of this variable

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.080
you will have the other one

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.900
being active and

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.300
you will have a low selling value

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.300
or lower than the other case

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.840
so these represent a kind of choices that

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.080
actually you can make

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.200
when you reason about things

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.780
So, what do you want?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.700
We want, not only, like, square meters

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.380
rooms, bathrooms

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.380
you actually take decisions based on

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.600
the combinations, right?

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.460
so, you will say, "Well, you know, it is a large flat"

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.040
"but the distribution is really good", right?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.360
So, this is a kind of combination of two

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.440
variables, having good distribution large

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.400
maybe if the flat was large enough you wouldn't

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.280
care so much about the distribution

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.860
and you can keep having this hierarchical

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.720
grouping of different variables

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.500
and the good thing about machine learning

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.140
is that in the same way that you reason

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.300
try to find a correlation

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.900
that will explain these things together

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.920
makes sense

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.580
the machine is able to find grouping of different variables

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.740
in a way that you basically have no idea what it means

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.580
but the machine knows that this is useful to take a decision

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.980
Right?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.560
So, the machine is trying out various different things and you've told me what the end point is.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.460
And it worked out what...could you

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.220
Exactly... the machine will be able to say, "Okay, in order to get an accurate prediction

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.400
you have to group these variables"

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.840
and create this kind of decision, right?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.000
So, if you meet all these conditions

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.760
then this thing will have a high value

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.580
and whenever this thing happens and some other decisions like that

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.240
happen as well and they have high values

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.480
then this thing will happen

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.760
and you can get going really deep

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.740
in this sense, right?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.060
Uhm, but the idea is that

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.000
You will take decisions based on these decisions

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.460
based on the input

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.820
values, right? So, you will

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.680
combine your inputs into some decisions that are intermediate

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.100
that are not really the pricing

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.740
and then you will have another

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.900
layer that will decide on the price

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.720
later on

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.540
If it tolerates you, it will give you some idea

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.020
of what's happening and you can sort of

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.440
I'm just gonna represent the other paddles...so we got two objects with the identical interfaces

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.480
one to represent the paddle on the left, one to represent the paddle on the right
