[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.870
AARON DIGNAN: Thank you.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.370
Thank you.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.700
So I just want to start right
off the gate with a pop quiz.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430
What year is this from?

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.990
Shout them out.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.850
Last year?

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.030
'80?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.020
Good.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.530
Closer.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.030
We're going to play
game show rules.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.160
You got to be
under but not over.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
AUDIENCE: '92.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.110
AARON DIGNAN: '92?

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.650
All right.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.896
Fair enough.

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:26.880
Anybody further back?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.380
No?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.220
All right.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.690
Here's the answer.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.850
It's from 1910.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.650
It's actually one of
the first org charts

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.130
to use boxes and lines.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.400
It's from an old Southern
Pacific Railroad in the US.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.990
And yeah, this is 109 years old.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.320
And what I find fascinating
about that is when I show this,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.670
I usually get guesses ranging
from about 1850 to yesterday

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.960
or even tomorrow.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.887
This is next month's
org chart release.

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:00.470
And what I find
fascinating about that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.010
is if I'd shown you a picture
of literally anything else--

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.140
a shoe, a house, a
car, a dress, a phone--

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.040
you would have been able
to carbon date it better.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.220
But when I show you
the main instrument

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.950
by which we visualize
all of human labor,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.690
you're kind of like, eh.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
There's a century of range on
when that thing was invented.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.520
And so one of two
things is true.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.550
Either it's perfect, and
we can all go back to work

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.320
and just cut it short today.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.820
Or there's something
about it that's

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.690
quite intractable and
quite hard to change.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.270
And so we have to just sit
with that for a second.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.860
So that's the first pop quiz.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.110
There are two more.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.270
The second one is to look
at these ways of working.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.470
So these are ways of
working that I've collected

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.112
from a mysterious source.

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:49.070
Insisting on doing
everything through channels.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.950
Not taking shortcuts
to expedite decisions.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.340
When possible, referring matters
to committee for further study

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.250
and having those committees
be as large as possible.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.510
Haggling over the precise
wordings of emails and missives

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.300
to customers and to our
fellow employees when

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.280
we make changes, et cetera.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
Referring back to
matters decided

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.020
upon at the last meeting,
maybe in a private one on one

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.000
or over coffee or
around the water cooler

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.350
or in an email or a
Slack message saying,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.158
hey, I think we should
make a decision differently

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:20.450
than what happened in the room.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.117
And then my personal
favorite is someone

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.770
that works with large companies
multiplying the procedures

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.380
and clearances involved in
issuing instructions and paying

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.340
checks and so on.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.890
We see that three people
have to approve everything

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.163
where one might be enough.

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:34.580
So show of hands--
who's ever seen

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.940
these behaviors in the workplace
here or elsewhere in the past,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.730
maybe has a spouse
who's dealing with this?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.410
Yeah.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.520
Does anyone know
what these are from?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.270
It's kind of a funny story.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.050
So most people guess that
they're from clients that I've

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.480
observed and worked with.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.230
But I didn't come up
with these, actually.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.897
These were invented--
they were invented

00:02:52.897 --> 00:02:57.290
in the '40s at the height
of World War II, when

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.140
the precursor to the CIA
was trying to figure out how

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.445
to sabotage enemy businesses.

00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:04.820
And the idea was
that people that

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.800
were confederate to us
that were on our side

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.470
but inside enemy
businesses would

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.390
use these approaches to
slow those businesses down

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.310
and grind them to a halt.
So that was the idea.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.580
And actually, there's
quite a long list.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.920
There's about 14 or 15 things.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.210
I chose my five favorites.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.320
But there are many,
many more in there.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.840
And so what has
effectively happened

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880
is in the space
of 80 years, we've

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.930
gone from this being obviously
nonsensical to sabotage being

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.715
indistinguishable from work--

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.747
that effectively, most
people in the modern economy

00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:39.830
are working in an environment
where we're actively

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.200
sabotaging ourselves
with the way of working,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.260
at least in terms of how people
might have thought 60, 70,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.080
80 years prior.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.410
And what's interesting is
that in the midst of that,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.380
the things that have maybe
served us well in the past

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.520
are starting to fail us.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.360
So we're all, of course,
aware of assembly lines

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.450
and the factory model of
working and having hierarchies

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.630
of managers and thinkers and
doers separated and all that.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.170
But somewhere along the lines,
that has started to fail.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.420
And it's really not something
that we talk about much.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.390
So if we look at indicators
like the average lifespan

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.779
of a company, down and
to the right over time.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.600
It used to be a
dynastic 60-year run

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.150
that you would have on a
big index like the S&amp;P 500

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.220
if you were a big,
successful company.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.020
Now it's closer to 10 years.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.580
Every two and a half
weeks, a company

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.820
falls off that list from either
dying and pulling a Kodak

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.940
or getting dealt with an M&amp;A.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.280
Return on assets, which
is a much better indicator

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.830
of business health than,
say, its stock performance--

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.470
the stock can be
manipulated a little bit.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.080
But the ROA is just,
how much profit can we

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.970
generate with what we own?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.650
Very hard to manipulate.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.070
And that's gone in the same
time period from close to 5%

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.188
to down to nearly 1%.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:54.980
And it's on its way
down, which essentially

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.460
means we can't make more
profit with more stuff.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.920
When we get bigger, when
we get more global, when

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.597
we get more interconnected,
suddenly we become immobilized.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.180
And we're seeing the
same thing happen

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.330
with productivity growth.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.050
So if you track productivity
growth over the last century,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.508
it has gone down and down and
down to the point where we're

00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:14.830
not getting any more gains.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.630
We're inventing all
this incredible stuff.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.970
The people in this
room and this company

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.580
are inventing things that
you would think, oh my gosh,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.350
the device in my
pocket has more power

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.617
than the computers that
took us to the moon.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.200
And yet productivity--
we're not being

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.900
able to make more
per hour than we were

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.820
10 years ago or 20 years ago.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.117
It's really grinding to a halt.

00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:35.200
And when you ask economists
why this is happening,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.320
they scratch their heads.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.230
They're kind of like,
we're really not sure.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.912
Or they debate about it.

00:05:39.912 --> 00:05:41.370
What's interesting
is when you then

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.800
ask people what's going on,
they say that they're not

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.580
super psyched about work.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.710
So one in two people is thinking
about quitting, thinking

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.260
about maybe how they're
unhappy in their current job.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.310
They're disengaged.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.900
They're working for the weekend.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.420
About one in five or
six people is actively

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.330
sabotaging their colleagues
and playing the politics game

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.280
and playing the
"how do I succeed

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.230
at the expense of others" game.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.680
And so we're not thrilled
about work as a whole.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.990
And what's staggering
to me about this data--

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.460
this is Gallup data--

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.647
is that this has been
the same for 20 years.

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:17.980
Every year, they release the
data with this big fanfare.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.160
And it's like, oh,
disengagement went down by 1%

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.817
from 52% to 51%.

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.150
And we're all just OK with that.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.610
We're OK with the
fact that most people

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.420
spend one third to one half of
their lives in an environment

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.190
that they're not psyched about.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.620
And that's just the way
the world is, I guess.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.570
So that's challenging.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.210
Now, as I mentioned, when you
ask what's going on-- when you

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.550
ask the economists, when you
ask people that are looking

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.970
at the system as a whole
what is happening--

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.260
they scratch their heads.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.810
But when you ask the people
at the edge, they'll tell you.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.710
Bureaucracy is what's happening.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.330
What's happening is that
the policies and structures

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.810
and boundaries and processes
and rules and norms by which we

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.280
govern our behavior at work
have metastasized into something

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.830
that we're no longer
fully in control of

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.230
and that we no longer
fully understand.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.772
And so it's slowing us down.

00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:12.730
It's creating friction.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.647
It's creating tension.

00:07:13.647 --> 00:07:15.720
It's creating dissatisfaction.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.760
And that dissatisfaction
has a cost.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.340
It has a very real cost.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.990
So to give you an
example, I like

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.300
to talk about it in terms
of organizational debt.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.280
So think about financial debt.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.100
You borrow money.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.050
You owe interest.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.223
That interest is a pain point
for you until you pay it back.

00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:32.640
For those of you
that work closely

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.250
in software development,
technical debt--

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.320
you rush to get the
software out the door.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.870
And later on, those
choices have a cost.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.360
You have to work to
refactor and reintegrate

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.610
the code that you've created.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.430
Organizational debt
is a third concept,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.680
and I actually think
the most pernicious.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.410
Organizational debt is
all the rules and policies

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.300
and structures we've created
that are no longer serving us

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.690
but that we haven't refactored,
that we haven't changed,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.335
that we haven't updated to
reflect the present day.

00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:01.710
So they're sort
of like something

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.900
that maybe someone
back in time understood

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.870
why we did it that way.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.610
Or maybe it once made sense, but
it doesn't make sense anymore.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.430
Perfect example-- so
there's an auto parts,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.340
a brass foundry in
France called FAVI.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.775
And they are incredible
at what they do.

00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:18.150
They're one of
the only companies

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.710
in that space that's been able
to survive the outsourcing

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.210
boom.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.210
They're one of the only
profitable, successful

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.530
factories in that
space in Europe.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.600
And when their prior CEO
came to take over the job,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.580
he noticed as he walked the
floor for the first time

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.260
someone standing by a cage of
equipment with a slip of paper

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.860
just waiting.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.970
And he said, hey,
what are you doing?

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.970
He said, oh, I'm
waiting for new gloves.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:42.470
OK.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.860
And what's the paper all about?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.980
Well, when you need new
gloves, you go to your manager.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.950
You show the boss your gloves
that are no longer working

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.000
that are worn out.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.110
And they approve that
they're no longer working.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.690
And then they give
you a permission slip.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.650
And you leave your machine.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.990
And you go over to this cage
where all the gloves are

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.800
under lock and key.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.720
And all the equipment
is under lock and key.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.010
And you turn in that
permission slip.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.052
And you wait while the
person goes back and finds

00:09:04.052 --> 00:09:05.430
the right size and what not.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.610
Then they bring it back to
you and stamp all your pages.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.103
And then you can go back
to work with your gloves.

00:09:11.103 --> 00:09:12.270
And he had the CFO with him.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.060
And he said, hey, how much
do the gloves cost us?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.625
Well, they're about 5 euro.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.750
And how much does it cost
us for this man's machine

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.380
to be down for 30 minutes?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.280
5,000 euro.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.220
OK.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.990
So that's organizational debt.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.770
And the gloves were
free the next day

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.130
and from then on
until the present day.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.690
So what happened
there is somebody

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.765
stole a pair of gloves.

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:34.140
Somebody went into the store
room and took all the gloves

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.490
or took a piece of equipment.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.340
And a leader, whose job
it was in their head

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.710
to ensure perfect execution and
ensure compliance and safety

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.710
and efficiency, was like,
I'm going to stop that

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.150
from ever happening again.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.525
And the way I'm
going to do it is

00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:48.330
by creating this
elaborate process.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.588
But in fact, the process cost
us more than just the trust

00:09:51.588 --> 00:09:53.130
and the judgment
that would have gone

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.470
into a much simpler system.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.240
So there's organizational
debt everywhere.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.782
I've never met a
team that's like, we

00:09:58.782 --> 00:10:00.055
don't have a stupid policy.

00:10:00.055 --> 00:10:01.680
We don't have a thing
that's in our way

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.440
or slowing us down from
doing our best work.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.290
So it's something that
does need to be addressed.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.720
Now, the reason that it
exists and the reason

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.970
that it's so hard to
address is that we

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.550
have a great confusion about
the nature of organizations.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.520
So an organization is a system.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.270
There are lots of
systems in the world.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.810
And different systems
have different natures.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.760
So when most leaders
and executives

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.160
that I meet around the
world see these two words,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.745
they see them as synonyms.

00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:28.620
So they say, oh, yes.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.120
Complicated,
complex-- that means

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.220
things that are frustrating
and that I don't understand

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.720
and that have lots
of parts and that

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.920
are very hard to break down.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.620
And they're all the same.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.770
Complicated, complex-- I use
those words interchangeably.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.560
But when you talk to a systems
theorist, they say, no.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.240
There are very distinct kinds
of systems in the world.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.600
And these are two
of those options.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.400
And they have very
distinct meanings.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.820
So I thought what we would do
today is do a rapid 60-second

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.660
master's degree in systems
theory by starting with

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.130
the final--

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.740
well, we might do one more
quiz later-- but nearly

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.050
the final quiz.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.580
So by show of hands
in the room, who

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.694
thinks that a watch is
a complicated system?

00:11:08.694 --> 00:11:09.680
OK.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.750
Who thinks it's
a complex system?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.500
OK.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.670
And what about the engine?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.268
Who thinks the engine
is complicated?

00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:17.060
A couple of people.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.560
And complex?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.530
A few more.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.030
OK.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.068
Let's turn the tables.

00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:21.860
What about weather?

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.640
Who thinks weather
is complicated?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.140
OK.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.110
Who thinks it's complex?

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.640
And who's a
conscientious objector

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.960
who thinks I'm
trying to trick you,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.168
and you're not going to play?

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:31.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.692
All right.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.650
And what about traffic?

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.450
Traffic complicated?

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.720
And traffic complex?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.220
OK.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.760
Cool.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.650
So you did what almost every
audience in the world does,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.420
which is about half
of you vote for one.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.730
About half of you
vote for the other.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.480
And as we go further
through the examples,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.610
fewer percentages
of people play,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.212
but still roughly equally.

00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:50.670
So let's get to
the bottom of this.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.930
So a watch and an
engine are both what we

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.560
would call complicated systems.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.855
And by that, I mean that
they are causal systems.

00:11:57.855 --> 00:11:59.480
There's a cause-and-effect
relationship

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.950
between their components.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.510
And while they might be rich
with lots of components,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.510
there might be lots of
pieces, and it might even

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.820
require an expert
to fix them, they're

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.990
not going to surprise us.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.190
They are predictable.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.330
They are knowable.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.340
If you take your car into
the mechanic on Friday

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.840
and it's not working, and they
say it'll be ready on Monday,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.760
it probably will be.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.780
And it certainly
won't surprise you

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.410
with-- a clown is not going
to jump out of the engine

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.640
when you pick it up.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.080
It's a known thing.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.460
It's a knowable thing.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.170
And so an expert can do that.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.240
When you have a problem
in a complicated system,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.190
you can solve that problem.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.030
You can solve the problem.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.910
Then we have complex systems.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.790
A complex system is
like weather or traffic

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.050
or your immune system or
a six-year-old, things

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.170
that we can't predict.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.220
We call them
"dispositional systems."

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.650
They have a vector.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.240
They have a way
they're trending.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.920
It looks like it's probably
going to rain today.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.570
But we can't be sure exactly
how much and exactly where.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.490
The only way to understand
a complex system

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.410
is to interact with
it, to go outside,

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.930
to be in it, to
poke it to see what

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.370
happens when something occurs.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.220
And so you're
always in dialogue.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.650
You're always in engagement
with a complex system.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.500
The best way to identify one is
if the thing you're looking at

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.890
has a chance of surprising you,
it's probably a complex system

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.500
if it's going to just come out
of nowhere with a reaction you

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.950
don't expect.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.480
And so with a complex system,
problems are not solved.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.443
They are only managed.

00:13:25.443 --> 00:13:27.360
Nobody ever comes in
from the garden and says,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.970
honey, I fixed the garden.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.297
It's done.

00:13:30.297 --> 00:13:31.130
That doesn't happen.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.120
You have to nurture it.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.140
You have to be in
relationship with the garden.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.240
And the same thing goes
for a six-year-old, right?

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.670
You can try your
damnedest to get that kid

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.660
to go to the school
of your choice.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.440
It might work.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.220
It might not.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.150
So complex systems require
that kind of interaction.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.700
So then the question
becomes, well,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.495
what does that mean
for organizations?

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:52.370
So what do you think?

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.820
What conclusions might you
draw from your recent master's

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.311
in systems theory?

00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.977
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:00.060
AARON DIGNAN: What's that?

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.000
AUDIENCE: The organization
is a complex system.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.980
AARON DIGNAN: The
organization is a--

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.860
AUDIENCE: Complex.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.670
AARON DIGNAN: Complex, yeah.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.360
The organization is
a complex system.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.210
It's not a complicated one.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.430
There are complicated
tasks and problems

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.480
inside an organization.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.640
If I ship a FedEx
envelope, there's

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.490
a very high probability it's
going to arrive the next day.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.500
But the culture,
the way of working,

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.800
the dynamics of the
organization with 10 or 100

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.740
or 10,000 or 100,000
people working together

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.780
is, of course, very
complex, and most obviously

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.683
because we human
beings are complex.

00:14:32.683 --> 00:14:34.100
So you put a bunch
of us together,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.630
that can only be more.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.330
And so if that's
true, then that means

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.470
that the way we engage
with the organization

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.773
when we think about culture
and way of working and change

00:14:43.773 --> 00:14:44.690
has to be appropriate.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.367
It has to be fit to the context.

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:48.950
So for example, when
I talk to leaders

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.063
who are quite frustrated
because they've just

00:14:51.063 --> 00:14:52.730
gone through a culture
change initiative

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.150
where they wrote down
all the values on posters

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.120
and put the posters up, and
people are still not behaving

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.920
differently, I laugh.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.590
Because effectively, they're
shouting at the weather.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.080
They're just sort of like
yelling at a thing that

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.190
doesn't respond to that.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.120
You can yell at the weather.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.787
You can yell at the
garden all you like.

00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:12.382
That's not how things
change in a complex system.

00:15:12.382 --> 00:15:14.090
The way things change
in a complex system

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.180
is you introduce something new.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.770
You put it into the wild.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.030
And then you see what happens.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.782
Maybe it's an attractor
that creates a big reaction.

00:15:22.782 --> 00:15:23.990
Maybe you like that reaction.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.020
Maybe you don't.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.900
But you're now interacting
with that system.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.580
So we have to bring the right
mindset and the right tool set

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.920
to organizations if we
want to change them,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.420
if we want to shape
them, if we want

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.040
to make them serve us better.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.373
And that doesn't matter who
you are in the organization.

00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:40.260
That's true.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.570
So I like to say it this way.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.190
To manage complexity, we need
a different operating system.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.410
We need a new OS.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.940
And I use the metaphor lightly.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.010
But I like the idea of
just basically saying

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.820
there's a foundational set of
assumptions, of principles,

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.610
of practices, of
norms in every team,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.900
in every organization upon
which everything else happens.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.280
We assume what's true.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.710
And then the norms and the
behavior of the organization

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.980
is built on top of that.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.940
So my favorite example of
an OS, of an assumption,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.270
is a conference room should
have a table and chairs in it.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.725
Nobody questions that.

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:14.330
That is just a given.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.250
Every office, every
startup I've ever

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.570
been to anywhere in the world--

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.140
you go in the conference room,
sure enough, table, chairs.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.830
Why?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.292
Because we assume
we're going to be

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:24.500
in this room to do something.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.080
What are we going to do?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.030
We're going to have a meeting.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.140
What's that require?

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.980
Well, it's going to
require sitting a lot.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.480
Why?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.180
Because it's going
to last a long time.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.680
OK.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.210
And we're going to need
a table for our laptops.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:34.710
Why?

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.330
So we can be checking our email
because we can't let that go.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.140
There's a whole lattice
work of assumptions there

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.932
that build that OS.

00:16:41.932 --> 00:16:44.015
And then, of course, when
you come into that room,

00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:44.690
you're limited.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.407
You've now constrained yourself.

00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:48.740
If I want to do something
physical with us in this room,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.160
and there's a table
in the middle,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.710
if we want to use
our bodies to think,

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.210
if we want to use the walls and
they're not set up that way,

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.880
suddenly we're limited
in our capacity.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.113
So there's a limitation
that comes with an OS.

00:16:59.113 --> 00:17:00.530
And this is a
really good example.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.970
So to bring the idea
of the OS to life,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.050
here are two different solutions
to the same problem space.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.160
So the problem space is,
two roads are crossing.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.303
So we have a problem
we have to solve for.

00:17:12.303 --> 00:17:14.220
How do we make sure they
don't hit each other?

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.859
And how do we maximize
the throughput,

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.290
the number of cars that get
through the intersection

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.460
per hour?

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.678
And there's an OS on the
left and a different one

00:17:21.678 --> 00:17:22.220
on the right.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.349
The OS on the left has
a set of assumptions

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.210
about people and the problem.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.430
What do you suppose are the
assumptions about people

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.350
and the problem in the
lighted intersection

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.984
with the red,
yellow, green light?

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:34.250
AARON DIGNAN: What's that?

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.478
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:37.520
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah, sure.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.388
What else?

00:17:38.388 --> 00:17:41.320
AUDIENCE: People will respond
to a red light or a green light.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.470
AARON DIGNAN: People will
do what they're told.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.250
Yeah.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.950
And more importantly,
people need to be told that

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.410
effectively, I don't
really trust all y'all.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.450
And so we're going
to have to keep

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.810
this thing under lock and key.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.352
We're going to keep
this thing moving

00:17:54.352 --> 00:17:56.700
based on a set of
central instructions.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.860
And so we're going to
use this apparatus.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.870
And by the way,
because it's electronic

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.930
and because it requires
an algorithm and controls,

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.250
it's quite a big apparatus.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.350
So we're going to have a central
control station and people

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.130
that program that.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.780
And we're going to need
an electrical grid.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.655
And we're going to need
to do a lot of things

00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:13.110
to make this intersection safe.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.002
And that is the knock-on effect.

00:18:15.002 --> 00:18:16.210
And then what about this one?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.960
What are the assumptions
of the roundabout

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.988
about people and the problem?

00:18:20.988 --> 00:18:22.030
We've got a few of these.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.570
AUDIENCE: People are capable.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:22.930
AARON DIGNAN: What's that?

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:23.920
AUDIENCE: People are capable.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.190
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.982
People are capable.

00:18:24.982 --> 00:18:26.470
Essentially, it's on you.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.080
The responsibility is
with you to each other

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.270
and for each other.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.290
I'm going into the
coliseum with you.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.890
And I hope that we
can all coordinate,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.240
that we'll socially coordinate.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.698
And the way they do that is
with a set of constraints, just

00:18:39.698 --> 00:18:40.840
two simple rules.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.610
We call them "enabling
constraints."

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.230
One is go with the
flow of traffic.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.813
So you got to go in
the same direction

00:18:45.813 --> 00:18:47.560
as the circle,
whatever that might be.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.600
And the second rule is that
you have to give right of way

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.830
to the people in the circle.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.302
So they have the privilege.

00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:54.010
And you have to kind
of work around them.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.885
Those are the only two
rules in a roundabout.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.760
And if you follow
those rules, you

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.610
can handle an almost
infinite number of scenarios

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.930
of things that can happen.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.660
And to know how true
that is, you only

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.360
have to look at one of
Europe's eight-lane roundabouts

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.000
to see just how profound
those simple rules can

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.115
be when put into practice.

00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:13.990
So these are two different
operating systems,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.063
two different sets
of assumptions.

00:19:16.063 --> 00:19:17.980
The question that we now
have to ask ourselves

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.290
is, well, which one's safer?

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.284
So on the whole, which
one do you think is safer?

00:19:23.284 --> 00:19:24.220
AUDIENCE: Roundabouts.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.012
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah.

00:19:25.012 --> 00:19:27.930
The roundabouts are about
80%, 85% safer, about 95%

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.000
safer on fatality collisions.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.585
Which one's higher throughput?

00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.010
AUDIENCE: Roundabout.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.650
AARON DIGNAN: Roundabout, about
80% to 88% higher throughput

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.450
per hour.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.200
Which one's cheaper
to build and maintain?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.100
AUDIENCE: Roundabout.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.862
AARON DIGNAN: Roundabout,
yeah, 10 to 20 grand cheaper.

00:19:41.862 --> 00:19:43.820
Which one works better
when the power goes out?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.710
Humorous, right?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.770
Which one do we have
1,000 times more of?

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.508
AUDIENCE: Traffic lights.

00:19:55.508 --> 00:19:56.300
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.280
And in fact, when I ask people--

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.280
certainly stateside, and
sometimes here in Europe--

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.230
which one do you feel more
comfortable in, they're like,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.732
oh, I much prefer a
light because I don't

00:20:06.732 --> 00:20:07.940
trust all these other people.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.560
I always feel uneasy
in a roundabout.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.860
And I like to be able
to kind of relax.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.730
And when I pull up,
I can check my phone.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.220
I can change the radio.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.260
I'm off the hook, essentially.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.510
The powers that be will
tell me what to do.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.680
And I can be off the hook.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.510
This one requires
quite a presence.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.970
It requires that you're
there in the moment.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.780
It's on you.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.770
It's on all of us
in coordination.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.370
So this is, in
most sense, in most

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.740
contexts-- not every
possible scenario on earth,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.410
but in most contexts--
the superior solution.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.690
But it asks more of us.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.480
It asks us to show
up differently.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.920
And this one makes us feel
like we're safe but is actually

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.630
less safe.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.460
So really, it's just
two operating systems

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.670
built on these ideas, control
and compliance and trust

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.328
and autonomy.

00:20:51.328 --> 00:20:52.370
So we're making a choice.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.472
Now, again, if we're
complexity aware,

00:20:54.472 --> 00:20:56.430
if we're aware of all
these different contexts,

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.420
there are going to be situations
and problems and products

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.820
and moments where control
and compliance approach--

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.690
the red light--

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.370
makes perfect sense.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.160
And god bless.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.140
That's wonderful.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.320
But there's a lot of situations
where trust and autonomy make

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.420
sense, but we haven't even
considered it in a century.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.420
We haven't even gone back
to say, wait a second.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.670
Does an annual budget
make sense in a world

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.080
that changes this fast?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.390
Does telling someone
what they should work on

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.905
make sense in a world
that's this varied, where

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:24.530
their talents and
skills are developing

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.740
and moving and changing and
shaping over time make sense?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.650
And what are the things that
we're not really getting

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.400
served by anymore?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.942
What's the org debt
where we're like,

00:21:32.942 --> 00:21:34.560
is there a better
way to do this?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.165
Is there a better way to handle
travel expenses than a travel

00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:38.540
freeze, where
everybody gets told

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.180
they can't travel no matter
what without manager approval?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.430
Is there a better way
to solve that problem?

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.110
Is there a roundabout solution?

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.960
So a few organizations
around the world

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.630
that have taken a crack
at that, that have sort of

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.310
flipped the table
over on bureaucracy

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.840
and played with it a bit.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.110
Handelsbanken, which is based
in Sweden and Stockholm,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.910
is a bank that in the '70s
was in trouble, coming out

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.470
of a financial crisis.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.105
And the new CEO was asked
to really change things up.

00:22:06.105 --> 00:22:07.730
And he came in and
said, hey, you know,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.105
I think we've got
this backwards.

00:22:09.105 --> 00:22:11.870
We at HQ are telling all
these branches what to do.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.220
But they know the customers.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.085
They're at the edge.

00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:14.960
They're in community.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.938
They're the ones that
have all the information.

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:18.230
Maybe we should change that up.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.960
And so his headline was,
the branch is the bank.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.760
And hundreds of
branches were suddenly

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.220
given the authority to
say, hey, make loans

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.930
to who you want to
make loans to at rates

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.602
you want to make them at.

00:22:28.602 --> 00:22:30.935
Do service for your customers
the way you need to do it,

00:22:30.935 --> 00:22:33.620
where they're not going to have
a central service line where

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.180
some person reading
off a script is

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.472
going to handle your customers.

00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:38.030
You guys can figure it out.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.540
And to keep things on
the straight and narrow,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.830
we'll just pick a couple
metrics that are learning

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.173
metrics for us that matter.

00:22:44.173 --> 00:22:45.590
And that will be
the thing that we

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.257
use to know if we're
on the right track.

00:22:47.257 --> 00:22:49.520
So we'll measure profit
over revenue, back to ROA.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.180
So we'll measure, is it
actually working as a system?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.410
And we'll measure
customer satisfaction.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.410
And we'll measure that
branch to branch and then

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.740
as a system as a whole.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.700
So the branches will see
transparently every month

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.400
how profit over revenue
and customer satisfaction

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.182
is trending.

00:23:05.182 --> 00:23:06.890
And then we'll see as
a system as a whole

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.470
how we're doing versus
the aggregate industry.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.092
And in order to fix
the incentives problem

00:23:12.092 --> 00:23:13.550
in the financial
industry, we won't

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.220
have these big individual
bonuses and these incentives

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.100
to sell, sell, sell or
create 15 different accounts

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.810
for a customer that
doesn't need one.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.490
Instead what we'll
do is we'll just

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.405
track profit over revenue
for the entire category

00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:26.030
here in Europe.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.740
And if we're better
than the average,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.562
then everybody gets a
bonus to their pension.

00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:32.270
And if we're not better
than the average,

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.340
then we just roll right
into the next year.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.580
And everyone's paid fairly.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.530
And that's fine.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.620
And so we're now all winning
together and losing together.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.810
And so they went
and made this play.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.520
And for 40 years--

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.380
for 40 straight years--

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.780
they've beaten the
average of all the people

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.670
in their competitive
set on profit

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.280
over revenue and
customer satisfaction.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.560
And they've actually
gone so far as

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.650
to blow up their annual
budgeting process

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.963
and move to something that's
more dynamic, that's more

00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:01.130
local, that's more regional.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.870
Because again, as long
as you're tracking

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.270
profit over revenue and
customer satisfaction,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.830
what difference
does the plan make?

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.630
What matters is,
are we performing

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.810
this week, this month,
this quarter, this year?

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.790
Through every financial
crisis that we've had--

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.140
the big ones that have
really shaken the system--

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.620
they've been able to just
very resiliently skate over

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.520
that because they don't
make stupid loans.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.020
Why?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.690
Because no one is
incentivized to.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.960
Or Morning Star tomatoes,
which is an American tomato

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.190
processing company.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.038
It's actually the
world's largest.

00:24:30.038 --> 00:24:31.580
So if you've had
some ketchup lately,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.550
you might have had
something to do with them.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.920
Their founder decided
that it was already

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.480
a tough enough
industry as it was.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.880
And so to make it more
vibrant and more interesting,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.370
we would let all the
employees write their own job

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.710
descriptions and set
their own salaries.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.830
When I say that, people
are like, [GASP]..

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.760
But of course, they've
done it for 20 years.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.940
So this is a company where
their category average

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.530
profitability is about 2%.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.960
Their average over the
last 20 years is 20%.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.565
So they're a 10x
outperformer where

00:24:58.565 --> 00:25:00.440
people are writing their
own job descriptions

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.565
and set their own salaries.

00:25:01.565 --> 00:25:02.633
How do they do it?

00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:04.050
They do it with
an advice process.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.428
So every year, I sit down.

00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:07.220
I write what I think
I want to do this year

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.458
and who I want to do it
with and make an agreement

00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:10.250
with my colleagues.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.667
And then they react to that.

00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:12.500
They give me advice.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.490
This is overshooting.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.975
This is undershooting.

00:25:14.975 --> 00:25:16.100
You're really good at this.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.683
I can't wait to work
with you on that.

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:20.120
This is something I think
you should consider.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.177
And people edit their
take because they

00:25:22.177 --> 00:25:24.260
know they're going to be
working with these peers.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.690
They're in relationship
with these peers.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.395
So there's a social pressure
instead of a top-down pressure.

00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:30.770
And the same thing
goes for comp.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.980
So they have these elected
compensation groups

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.480
in every pocket of the business.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.090
And when people
propose their salary,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.920
they're doing it with
total transparency

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.920
about the firm's profitability,
the category averages,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.140
what their colleagues
get paid, and for what.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.640
And they're saying, all right,
this is what I think is fair.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.515
Then they get advice.

00:25:48.515 --> 00:25:51.150
And then they modify
their take based on that.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.850
And again, this is
all judgment based.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.090
It's trust based.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.510
So if they say, I think
I'm worth $20 an hour

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.510
and everybody else is
worth $15, the system

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.362
is going to let
them play that out.

00:26:00.362 --> 00:26:01.820
And they're going
to find out, what

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.922
are the reputational
consequences of that?

00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:05.630
What are the social
consequences of that?

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.602
What are the P&amp;L
consequences of that?

00:26:07.602 --> 00:26:08.810
That's going to be found out.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.190
And if somebody
does something so

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.220
aggressive in a system like
this that it can't be tolerated,

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.100
there's a conflict process
that someone can engage,

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.350
where they'll have some
mediation and some discussion.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.470
And they can use their judgment
and their adult communication

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.040
to try to find a way forward.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.040
And that's something that
they very rarely need.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.513
So that's something that's
going on at Morning Star.

00:26:27.513 --> 00:26:29.180
For those of you that
have read the book

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.722
"Turn the Ship
Around," I'm a big fan

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:33.390
of David's work on
the USS Santa Fe,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.870
where he inherited the
worst-performing ship

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.300
in the Navy essentially,
a nuclear sub

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.870
that was not doing well.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.040
Was told he could not change
the staff of that sub.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.110
Had to actually
keep them exactly

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.990
as they are, but needed
to turn the ship around.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.920
And he did this through
a series of adjustments

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.200
that increased transparency
and increased clarity

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.870
about what competency looked
like, but most importantly,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.460
increased empowerment.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.770
So people would come to
him and say, Captain,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.850
what are my orders?

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.428
And he would say, well,
what do you intend to do?

00:27:04.428 --> 00:27:05.720
And they'd say, I have no idea.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.980
No one's ever asked
me that before.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.090
And he's like,
well, come back when

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.500
you know what you intend to do.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.110
And over time, people realized,
we have to show up ready.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.983
We have to show up prepared
for our role to the captain

00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:16.400
because he's not
going to tell us.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.358
So they'd come and say,
oh, I thought about it.

00:27:18.358 --> 00:27:20.643
And I want to go 45
degrees north and dock

00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:22.310
and refuel and do
this training exercise

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.540
and then go back out to sea.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.720
And he'd say, very well.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.220
Sounds good.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:25.970
Let's do it.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.590
He reserved one
choice for himself.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.723
That was the choice to
fire a nuclear weapon.

00:27:29.723 --> 00:27:31.640
That he was going to
keep for himself just out

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.020
of pure responsibility.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.323
But everything else was
distributed to the system.

00:27:35.323 --> 00:27:37.490
Two years later, it was the
highest-performing ship,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.880
produced more officers than any
other ship in naval history.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.140
It's a great story.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.580
I highly recommend
you take a look at it.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.130
And then last but
not least, Haier.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.140
Haier is a Chinese
appliance manufacturer

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.180
that has done some
really interesting things

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.620
in the past few years.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.858
Their CEO started to
recognize that they

00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:56.150
were getting further and
further removed from customer.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.040
And that was because
of functionalization.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.920
So you have HR over here
and design over here

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.970
and marketing over here.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.047
And everybody's
trying to communicate.

00:28:04.047 --> 00:28:05.630
But they can't because
we're in silos.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.810
And the end customer is not
hearing or seeing that value.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.860
And so what they did is they
took a 60,000-person company,

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.620
and they blew it up into
2,000 autonomous teams.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.338
Each team had a product or a
service, internal or external,

00:28:19.338 --> 00:28:20.630
that they were responsible for.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.220
And each team had a customer.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.510
And it was end to end.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.310
It was P&amp;L-level responsibility.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.990
So it's make or break.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.540
You decide when
it sinks or swims.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.400
If you fold up your
tent on a product

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.950
that you're trying
to make happen,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.242
that doesn't mean you're fired.

00:28:34.242 --> 00:28:37.010
You just move in the
marketplace to another system.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.540
You start a new
innovation project.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.850
Or you join another existing
team that's scaling.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.730
So there's kind of
a career pathing

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.700
and a role mix ecology
inside the system that's

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.960
quite powerful.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.642
And this has been so
remarkably successful

00:28:50.642 --> 00:28:52.100
that in the past
few years, they've

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.410
gone from 60,000
to almost double

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.730
that number of employees.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.400
They've become the world's
fastest-growing appliance

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.480
manufacturer.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.490
And they actually
acquired GE Appliances

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.010
in the midst of all this and
implemented their model there.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.468
And for the first
time in a decade,

00:29:05.468 --> 00:29:08.700
that business posted a
profit and a revenue growth.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.270
So there's a real power to
this connection to customer

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.850
and this new
structure that focuses

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.600
on functional integration
and speed and connection

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.970
rather than, how do
we centralize things

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.883
to make them more efficient?

00:29:21.883 --> 00:29:23.300
It would be so
much more efficient

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.830
if we put all the
lawyers together and got

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.820
rid of half of them.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.810
Well, yes.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.700
That would be efficient for the
P&amp;L right now in this moment.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.270
But would it be more efficient
for our overall outcomes,

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.610
for our success as a system?

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.360
So it's really about pulling
on those different tensions.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.070
So at the end in
the book, I looked

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.130
at about 68 different companies
out of a group of over 300

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.760
that we could consider.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.330
And there were really
only two mindsets

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.420
that permeated these places.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.820
And some of them were
living them to the fullest.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.490
Some of them were
experimenting with them.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.252
It depends on the company.

00:29:57.252 --> 00:29:58.460
But these were the two ideas.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.590
One was that they were
generally people positive,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.620
meaning they took the
roundabout take on, how do

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.480
we feel about people and risk?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.510
And the idea was people are
worthy of trust and respect.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.580
People are capable
of using judgment.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.460
People are capable of growing
and learning themselves

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.810
if left to their own devices
in the right environment.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.620
And that we ultimately seek
autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.740
As self-determination theory
and Dan Pink would say,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.190
those are the things that
really unlock our motivation,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.770
not some end-of-year
bonus scheme that's

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.290
going to mess with our wiring.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.330
And then complexity
conscious, which you all now

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.730
have a master's in, was
really just about the idea

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.730
that they recognized
that the market was full

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.770
of different contexts,
that the organization was

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.360
full of different contexts,
and that we needed

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.900
the right approach for the job.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.650
So if we're dealing with
something that's uncertain,

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.180
that's going to
surprise us, we need

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.430
to have the right constraints.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.820
We need to allow for emergence.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.290
We need to test and learn.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.305
All the values of
agility and lean

00:30:53.305 --> 00:30:54.680
and those sorts
of things that we

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.570
hear bouncing
around the industry

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:00.380
are all rooted in this basic
idea that if it's unknown,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.480
then we need ways of
knowing and finding out.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.410
We need ways of doing
this dynamically.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.170
We don't want to
make big commitments

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.722
to a three-year plan or a
budget that's going on forever

00:31:09.722 --> 00:31:12.180
or a set of choices that are
going to come back to bite us.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.150
We want to actually learn
more and steer continuously.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.580
And that's the big idea there.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.110
One of the founders
of sociocracy,

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.107
which is one of the early
distributed authority systems

00:31:22.107 --> 00:31:23.690
based in the
Netherlands, used to talk

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.340
about a bicycle as an example.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.710
He would say, if I told
you to ride from point A

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.370
to point B on a bicycle
and I locked the handlebars

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.050
and I screwed them
down tight, you

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.520
would fall down
in three seconds.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.960
You cannot ride a bike when
the wheel doesn't turn.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.510
And I invite you to try
it with proper padding.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.322
But you immediately fall over.

00:31:44.322 --> 00:31:46.280
What you actually do when
you ride from point A

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.830
to point B is you
keep your eye on B.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.960
And as you overshoot
left, you correct right.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.910
And as you overshoot
right, you correct left.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.890
And you're doing this
in micro adjustments

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.230
all the time when you're riding.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.520
You're not even aware of it.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.220
You're unconsciously micro
adjusting, always heading

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.530
towards intent, always
heading towards purpose.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.240
And that should be the
design of the organization.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.240
That should be the design
of any organism that's

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.720
trying to achieve its intent--
is that it's continuously

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.000
steering, that it's
continuously adjusting

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.470
towards its collective
and stated intent

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.720
rather than saying, all right.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.540
Let's lock these at
17 degrees and pray.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.730
And we'll check
again in January.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.990
So everybody says, great.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.070
That's lovely, Aaron.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.920
Let's change.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.050
But here's the problem.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.280
Change is impossible.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.780
And change sucks.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.830
So even though we're
all excited about this,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.080
we can't do anything about it.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.720
That's because we view change as
something that looks like this.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.480
It is essentially
the mourning process.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.580
Change is a death to
us in our culture.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.970
And so we have this,
I don't want to do it.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.573
And then we're forced to do it.

00:32:45.573 --> 00:32:47.490
And then we trip and
fall, and it's miserable.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.667
And then some of us have
this moment of epiphany.

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:50.750
And then we crawl back up.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.172
And we're 5% better off than
we were when we started,

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:56.130
which to me seems like
a horrible way to do it.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.500
And of course, if you can afford
a very fancy, exotic consulting

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.903
company, then it
looks like this.

00:33:03.903 --> 00:33:05.570
And so now you have
the exact same thing

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:06.737
but with more bullet points.

00:33:06.737 --> 00:33:08.570
And it's in 3D.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.092
And again, if this is your
vision of change, of course

00:33:11.092 --> 00:33:12.800
you're going to find
yourself frustrated.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.550
Because what does a system
of progressive steps,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.920
of linear steps of change
assume about the nature

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.510
of the system itself?

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.890
That it's complicated, right?

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.960
It's treating it as a watch.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.430
We're all in the discover phase.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.598
And then we're all in
the visualize phase.

00:33:27.598 --> 00:33:29.390
We're going to do a
survey of what's broken

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.150
and then we'll tell you
the most important things.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.060
Oh, there's a lack of
trust at XYZ company.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.460
Well, that was the average take.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.790
But if Bezos walks into a
bar, the average net worth

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.020
is $100 million.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.140
But that's not true.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.230
That's not what's really
going on in the bar.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.310
What's really
going on in the bar

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.352
is there's a rich guy and
a bunch of poor people.

00:33:48.352 --> 00:33:50.060
So we have to
recognize that when

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.643
we start to talk about averages
and we talk about us all being

00:33:52.643 --> 00:33:54.410
in the same stage,
that we're doing change

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.172
like the organization
is a watch,

00:33:56.172 --> 00:33:57.880
we're going to find
ourselves frustrated.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.660
And so what we do
instead is we change how

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.120
we change to a different model.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.100
And that model looks
more like this.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.440
It is teaching teams at
every level, at every shape--

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.440
I don't care whether
you're flat or hierarchical

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.969
or whatever you are--

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.650
to do this looping process.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.409
And this looping process is
about taking back ownership

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.190
of our way of working.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.670
It's about saying, the way
we work as teams is something

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.139
that we care about, that we
think about, that we nurture.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.400
It is our second job.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.110
Our first job is
to do what we do.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.880
Our second job is
to be org designers

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.485
and to shape the way we do it.

00:34:29.485 --> 00:34:30.610
And that's always going on.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.440
So it starts with
identifying, well,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.889
what are the tensions you hold?

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.830
And the question I always
ask teams when I start out

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.663
with them is, what's
stopping you from doing

00:34:37.663 --> 00:34:38.949
the best work of your life?

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:39.866
That's the bar for me.

00:34:39.866 --> 00:34:42.282
What's stopping you from doing
the best work of your life?

00:34:42.282 --> 00:34:44.630
Because if you're not
doing it, life is short.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.594
What are we doing here?

00:34:45.594 --> 00:34:47.469
And so then they'll say,
oh, we have meetings

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.761
to prepare for meetings, Aaron.

00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:49.780
And it's nonsense.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.699
Or, we have way too many emails.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.469
Or, we have a lack of trust.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.449
Or, we can't make
decisions quickly.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.020
Or, my boss talks nonstop and
I never get a word in edgewise.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.580
Or, we're not diverse enough.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.020
Or, fill in the blank.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.060
There are hundreds of
things that you can hear.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.810
They're all fine.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.510
Whatever is true for the
team is true for the team.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.720
And instead of saying, what's
the tension for the org, which

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.460
is not a real
thing, we say, what

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.070
are the tensions for the
teams inside the org?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.270
What is true?

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.602
And if there are things that
are present as patterns,

00:35:18.602 --> 00:35:19.810
then that's cool to find out.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.615
But let's find that out
by talking to the system.

00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:24.910
So I have these tension
and practice cards

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.990
with tensions on them.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.820
Routinely, I will
get a leadership team

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.107
of 40 or 50 top execs in a room.

00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:32.440
And I will have them choose
the tensions that they think

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.330
are most present for
the organization--

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.570
the top five, let's say,
out of a list of 78.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.908
But I'll do it in three groups.

00:35:38.908 --> 00:35:40.450
And then I'll have
them come together

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.075
and share with each
of the three groups

00:35:42.075 --> 00:35:44.830
that the very top of the
house thought was going on.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.837
And they are routinely
wildly different.

00:35:47.837 --> 00:35:49.420
And that is the
moment when I can say,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.940
yeah, there's no one
true thing going on here.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.320
You're right, and you're right.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.070
But now what are you
going to do about it?

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.410
So we find our tensions.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.080
We pick the ones that are
most present and alive for us.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.880
Then we explore practices.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.243
What are alternative ways
of solving this problem?

00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:04.660
What are the
roundabout solutions?

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.920
Maybe we invent some.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.120
Maybe we borrow some.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.620
Maybe we go on a
field trip and talk

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.910
to some of these
other organizations

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.140
and see what they've learned.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.045
But the idea is we got to go
figure it out for ourselves.

00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:15.920
And then finally, let's
design an experiment.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.070
So let's say we decide to
try something different.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.570
Maybe one of our
problems is that we

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.810
don't do a good job of
hearing everyone's voice.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.460
And we've learned
from a project that

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.710
was done in house
here that equal talk

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.052
time is one of the best
predictors of team success.

00:36:29.052 --> 00:36:31.510
And so we're going to start
meetings with a check-in, where

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.800
we just hear everyone's voice.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.630
What's a question we
can all answer that will

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.755
get us present in the room?

00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:37.120
Really small experiment.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.710
But then we have to decide,
who's going to do it

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.418
and for how long?

00:36:39.418 --> 00:36:41.020
And how will we
know if it helped?

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.390
So a very tightly
defined, constrained,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.460
safe-to-try experiment
that moves us

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.240
from here to what Steven Johnson
calls the "adjacent possible."

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.685
What's right next door that
we can actually get to?

00:36:51.685 --> 00:36:53.560
Because if I come in on
day one and I'm like,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.838
let's blow up the budgeting
process, everybody's like, no.

00:36:56.838 --> 00:36:57.880
That's not going to work.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.290
This place will be pandemonium.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.170
But we could get there if
we take some steps that

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.510
start to move the momentum
and start to trigger

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.790
bigger questions in our heads.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.798
So I started with one leader
at an educational company,

00:37:09.798 --> 00:37:11.590
where the first question
in their head was,

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.930
how do we make decisions
better and faster?

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.360
Super exciting, but
also easy to get at.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.980
It wasn't until
month 12 that they

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.070
started asking, what should we
do about resource allocation?

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.950
Because it seems awful slow that
we're making these decisions

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:24.490
once a year.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.940
And we were sort of like,
oh, interesting question.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.178
Once the question's there,
there's a space for the answer.

00:37:30.178 --> 00:37:32.095
Once you have that
negative space in your head

00:37:32.095 --> 00:37:34.310
or the leader has that
negative space in their head,

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.440
they're going to go on the
hunt to find the answer.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.297
So designing the
experiment, then we do it.

00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:40.130
And then eight weeks
later, we get together.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.588
And we hold a little
retrospective.

00:37:41.588 --> 00:37:42.190
Did that help?

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.790
Did it hurt?

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.640
Is it the same?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.320
Is it different?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.460
What's going on?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.125
When we teach teams to
do this concurrently

00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:50.500
and we have experiments alive
in the system about the way

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.117
we work, the things that
start to work spread.

00:37:53.117 --> 00:37:55.450
So a team figures something
out that really serves them.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.080
They tell other teams about it.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.200
And if we created a system
of trust and autonomy

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.970
where things can
spread, where we're

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.580
allowed to choose our way
of working, then suddenly

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.500
we find that more and more
teams are doing it that way.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.205
And there may even
be moments where

00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:10.330
the leadership or the people
at the edge or whoever

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.040
start to make bigger
pronouncements.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.090
We're going to do
things this way.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.423
Or we're going to take what
those teams have figured out

00:38:15.423 --> 00:38:16.570
and try to scale it.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.450
So this is the model of
continuous participatory change

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.830
that we're finding has the
most legs in these systems.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:28.300
A few quick rules of thumb
or heuristics or principles

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.120
that we've figured out along
the way that help while you're

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.060
doing this process.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.950
The first is through
them, not to them.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.740
So again, this has
to be happening

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.220
in the system in relationship
with participation.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.810
This is not a
PowerPoint document

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.410
that's written over the weekend
and foisted upon 10,000 people.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.300
That is not change.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.260
It's not changing how we change.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.510
The second is learn by doing.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.038
So I am so sick of having
debates with people

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.580
about what's the right way to
make decisions or the right way

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.720
to have a meeting
or the right way

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.180
to talk to somebody or the
right way to get feedback.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.730
Just try something
new and then decide.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.300
Did it help?

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.200
Did it hurt?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.040
Just do it.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.500
This is my son riding
a balance bike.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.710
Riding a training wheels bike
is not learning to ride a bike.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.750
That is learning to
be in a spin class.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.070
Learning how to ride
a bike is balance.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.280
It is being in
relationship to the bike.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.140
So learn by doing
rather than by arguing.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.070
We're not going to argue our
way to an answer about what

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.190
our operating system should be.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.450
Start small.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.940
Big systems are so
addicted to scale.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.190
Because to have
a idea that moves

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.730
a billion-dollar system 1%, it
has to be a $10 million idea.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.950
But instead, we
know that systems

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.680
change through the progressive
pattern of small things

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.303
that spark revolution.

00:39:39.303 --> 00:39:41.970
So we actually want to-- instead
of trying to move this boulder,

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.262
we want to figure out, how
do we do this with one team,

00:39:44.262 --> 00:39:46.920
with two teams, with 10
teams, with one location?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.720
I did one factory last year.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.700
Just figure it out here.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.730
And then let the echo
effect start to unfold.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.380
Start by stopping.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.320
So this is a really good one
in the age of Marie Kondo

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.210
and tidying up.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.250
We all are really
good at accumulating.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.990
This is a real client calendar--

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.430
45 hours a week of meetings
on average for this exec team.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.460
45 hours a week.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.790
No time for lunch.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.420
So instead of trying to fix that
by adding more stuff to it--

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.900
let's add another smart meeting.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.180
Let's add an agile practice.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.740
Let's add, add, add--

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.690
we said, let's stop.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.360
Let's stop meeting for two
weeks and see what hurts.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.520
What do you miss when we stop?

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.190
When we do that, we learn
things that we couldn't ever

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.420
have the space to learn.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.380
So we want to actually take
the time and make the space.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.880
Take 90 minutes at the end of
the week to reflect on the way

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.600
we work.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.490
Stop a policy that
doesn't make sense.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.075
You don't have to
have the solution.

00:40:37.075 --> 00:40:39.450
Someone's like, well, if we
get rid of our travel policy,

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.918
what will we do without
a travel policy?

00:40:41.918 --> 00:40:42.460
I don't know.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.290
Let's see what happens.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.640
What if we just didn't have one?

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.390
Would it be worse?

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:46.000
Would it be better?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.920
Would we learn something?

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.270
Would someone else
propose something

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.228
that we wouldn't have
thought of as the leader?

00:40:50.228 --> 00:40:54.120
Sometimes it's OK to just
let the negative space create

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.537
a pull on our system.

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:58.120
And then finally,
join the resistance.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.320
So it's very easy in
change work to argue

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.090
that the person
that's not playing

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.910
is a resistor, that they're
a laggard, that they

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.850
don't get it, that they need
to get on or off the bus.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.760
And instead, if you engage
those people in curiosity--

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.918
not to convince them,
but just to ask,

00:41:13.918 --> 00:41:15.210
why isn't this working for you?

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.360
Why aren't you engaged in this?

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.860
Why wouldn't you
try this new thing?

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.020
What about this is
not appealing to you--

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.350
they'll tell you stuff
you need to hear.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.300
The incentive system
is not set up for them.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.007
And they have two kids
in private school.

00:41:27.007 --> 00:41:28.590
They don't have time
on their calendar

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.132
to show up to this
thing because they

00:41:30.132 --> 00:41:32.100
have three bosses that
they dotted line to.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.810
And they are back
to back packed.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.740
There's a reason.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.475
People are rational
for the most part.

00:41:37.475 --> 00:41:39.100
And they will tell
you what's going on.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.260
And then you can
say, all right, well,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.670
let's design our
way out of that.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.128
So is there something
that we could

00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:45.780
co-create that would make
this more accessible for you?

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.460
Or you can just take
that and thank them

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.130
for the gift of the feedback,
of the clarity about what's

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.050
really going on.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.530
So I'll leave you with this.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:58.385
The high jump was done
this way in the early '60s

00:41:58.385 --> 00:41:59.550
and late '60s.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.080
And for those men
in the room, you

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.120
can see how precarious this is.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.760
And this was the norm because
the other side of the bar

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.320
was, for a long time, just dirt.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.790
So you had to land on your feet.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.240
And this was the way to do it.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.230
But then towards the
latter half of the '60s,

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.000
that dirt became foam.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.380
It became padded.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.030
Other options became possible.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.800
Dick Fosbury came along
and obviously went

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.300
over backwards and
head first, which

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.220
is now quite a famous
story, and not one

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.790
that I intend to bore you with.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.660
But what's fascinating about
Dick's story is that after he

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.840
won the gold medal
in the '68 Olympics,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.750
the reaction from the
fellow competitors was,

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.900
works for Dick, but
won't work for us.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.290
It's great for him.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.330
He's a freak.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.480
But we have these reasons
that we can't do that,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.040
that it won't work for us.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.350
And over time, those
reasons got whittled away.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.975
And now, of course,
only one person

00:42:47.975 --> 00:42:49.350
has held the world
record jumping

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.380
any way different than
this for the last 50 years.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.420
So what we know
is that people are

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.740
going to have that reaction.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.620
Oh, works for Buurtzorg,
won't work for us.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.840
Works for Morning Star,
won't work for us.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.710
Works for Google,
won't work for us.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.720
That's not really
a great excuse.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.050
The way to find out what
will work for you is to jump.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.852
It's uncomfortable.

00:43:09.852 --> 00:43:11.060
It's a little nerve wracking.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.320
It feels weird.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.270
But the reality is,
it's pretty safe to try.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.425
And if you constrain where
you do it, how you do it,

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:19.550
and you make sure that the
people that are doing it

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.220
are using their judgment, that
they're in the roundabout,

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.920
then a lot of things are
possible that we're not

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.940
seeing today.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.760
And we just might be able
to unlock our potential

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.760
and solve some of the
quite intractable problems

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.450
that we face.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.410
We have climate issues.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.550
We have political issues.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.370
We have issues in for-profit
and nonprofit businesses

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.900
that are going to require a
different level of performance.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.650
And we're not going
to be able to get that

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.980
with what got us here.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.640
So it's really incumbent
that we take the leap.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.680
And that's why I'm so
excited that you all came

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.920
to hear this message today.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.800
So thank you so much.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.280
SPEAKER: We have about
10 minutes for questions.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.370
Does anyone have a question
they'd like to ask?

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.870
AUDIENCE: I just
wonder, what's been

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.270
your experience of working
with the executives

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.880
and getting them all
excited about an idea?

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.640
What then happens after that?

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.390
Do you continue to
hold their hands?

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.017
Or do they go in and implement?

00:44:14.017 --> 00:44:15.600
Or do they go in,
and it sort of falls

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.320
by the wayside a little bit?

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.362
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:17.362 --> 00:44:18.990
So what we have
found is most helpful

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.440
is to have at least
some coaching support,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.990
both internally and externally.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.770
So when we get
started, we'll start

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.530
by having a red-pill,
blue-pill moment to see,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.450
do we want to go deeper
into the rabbit hole?

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.390
And if we have that alignment
and we have the right mindset,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.550
then we might provide
a couple of coaches

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.850
into the system to be present
and help the teams that

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.000
are looping stay
honest to the loop

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.660
and stay honest to themselves.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.480
And then we'll also
find people internally

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.430
who are very excited
about this stuff

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.950
and maybe have been trying
to agitate this themselves.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.470
And we'll start to bring
them into the fold as coaches

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.957
as well so that as
practices bubble up

00:44:54.957 --> 00:44:56.790
and we realize, oh,
this is a way of meeting

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:57.840
that really works here.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.580
This is a way of sharing
that really works here.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.590
This is a tool that we're
getting excited about,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.720
they can become knighted
in those things.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.560
And that way, when
we're not needed,

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.410
which is hopefully
soon, then there's

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.172
still a support
structure in place.

00:45:09.172 --> 00:45:11.130
One of the things that's
not often talked about

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.790
is most of the cases in the book
have a set of internal people

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.030
who are coaches with no
authority, who exist purely

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.536
to serve teams at the edge.

00:45:19.536 --> 00:45:23.940
So in Buurtzorg, I think there
are 14,000 nurses now out

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.500
in their distributed system.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.240
And there are 50
people in corporate.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.820
And of those, like
15 are coaches.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.710
So if a team throws
up a distress signal,

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.295
like our numbers
aren't looking good,

00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.670
or our engagement isn't good,
or we're not feeling right,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:39.420
or something's off, they
can request a coach come in.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.850
And the coach lobs in with
all that systemic knowledge

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.325
and just tries to help.

00:45:43.325 --> 00:45:44.700
But again, they
have no authority

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.120
to tell that team what to do.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.200
So there's an ecology like
that in most of these systems

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.028
that we see in some
way, shape, or form.

00:45:52.028 --> 00:45:54.070
SPEAKER: Are there one or
two examples which come

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.630
up again and again?

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.830
I know, for example,
at Google, we have--

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.470
with our corporate credit
cards, anything under $20

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.930
you don't need a receipt for.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.720
And that's a really good
example where we are trusted.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.370
And that just eases
through the system.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.310
Do you find examples
similar or other

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.040
where it comes up again and
again in large corporations?

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.370
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.960
Well, I think to
your point, the thing

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.793
that comes up again and
again is the concept

00:46:15.793 --> 00:46:18.250
of what WL Gore
calls a waterline.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.410
So the waterline is when
you're sailing a boat.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.950
If you get a hole below the
waterline, everybody dies.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.700
But if you get a hole
above the waterline,

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.620
you can patch it when
you get back to shore.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.080
And so what they taught their
people very early on is,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.660
when you're making a decision,
any decision, we trust you.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.102
And think long and hard
about, is this decision

00:46:35.102 --> 00:46:36.310
above or below the waterline?

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.592
If it's above the waterline,
knock yourself out.

00:46:38.592 --> 00:46:41.050
And so for different companies,
that's at different levels.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.140
My company can
only risk so much.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.160
A bigger company might
be able to risk more.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.350
But we know where
our waterline is.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.290
And then if it's below the
waterline, seek advice.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.000
So go to people that
have done it before.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.160
Go to people that will
be affected by it.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.140
And seek advice before
you make that decision.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.180
And then for those
very few decisions

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.420
that are really critical, maybe
it's an integrative decision.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.580
So it means that multiple
roles have to consent

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.600
to that before they act on it.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.680
So for example, we can't change
the maternity and paternity

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.700
policy at my company without
multiple roles consenting.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.940
But someone can spend
$10,000 with advice.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.270
And someone can spend
$1,000 whenever they want.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.000
So there are different
levels of clarity.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.520
And then when you
see decisions being

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.007
made that don't align with
maybe what you would do,

00:47:27.007 --> 00:47:28.090
there's a question to ask.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.590
A, is it safe to try?

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.740
So is the learning that will
occur worth the squeeze?

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.720
Because again, if we
just protect everybody

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.000
from learning, then
we end up immobilized.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.132
We end up with these
very incapable teams.

00:47:39.132 --> 00:47:40.840
It's sort of like
raising a kid where you

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.640
don't let them skin their knee.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.080
They'll never be good runners.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.755
You have to let people learn
and bump up against reality.

00:47:47.755 --> 00:47:49.630
But you want to do that
in a safe-to-try way.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.760
So you want to find like,
where's that dynamic?

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.860
Where's that edge?

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.750
So that kind of decision
stack, as I call it,

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.082
is present in almost every case.

00:47:59.082 --> 00:48:00.790
And there are different
languages for it.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.670
But it's always about,
what's the waterline?

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:04.883
What's the advice process?

00:48:04.883 --> 00:48:07.300
What are those decisions that
we reserve for certain roles

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.450
or for integrative
groups to make together?

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.740
And how do we push as much as
possible above the waterline?

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.490
Because obviously, the
more we have there,

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.640
the more adaptive and the
more resilient we are.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.100
AUDIENCE: To extend the
metaphor about above the line

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.560
and below the line,
it sounds like there's

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.660
a presupposed
assumption that everyone

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.160
agrees where that line is.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:27.455
AARON DIGNAN: Correct, yeah.

00:48:27.455 --> 00:48:29.620
AUDIENCE: And it also
assumes that everything

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.820
is net positive.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.090
And there is nobody that will
lose as a result of the change.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.130
So how do you
navigate situations

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.770
where there's perceived
headcount losses or perceived

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:43.200
political influence losses that
one person will lose if you

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.450
make the change to the system?

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.770
AARON DIGNAN: Yeah.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.830
Great question.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.120
So a couple of things.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.420
One, it's very true
that the waterline

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.290
is in different places
for different people.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.640
So based on their own
comfort, their own experience,

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.840
the roles that they hold--

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.813
I mean, certainly as the
founder of my company,

00:48:57.813 --> 00:48:59.980
I feel like my waterline
is higher than other people

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.570
just because I'm
like, I don't know.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.630
I just feel a sense of
ownership that I can do more

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.885
than maybe someone else does.

00:49:05.885 --> 00:49:07.510
That doesn't mean
that I wouldn't allow

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.320
them to do the same thing.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.910
But they may not
allow themselves.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.200
So their waterline
is where it is.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.470
So I think that's
absolutely true.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.590
Part of developing a system
with this kind of maturity

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.040
is having that dialogue.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.830
So the value of
the advice process

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:24.700
is, if you're even not sure,
just engage some advice

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.920
because you'll become a
richer decision maker.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.960
And we'll all benefit from
understanding your situation.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.660
So there's a little
bit of extra work

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.120
that goes into it early on
while we build that competency

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.077
and that mastery.

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:36.910
And then over time, we
get better and better

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:40.360
at refining where that line
is and also as the situation

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.210
changes.

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:42.820
So at the beginning
of this year,

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.550
my company changed the
nature of our incorporation.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.470
And to do that, we had
to kind of dump cash

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.670
and then re-add it.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:49.630
There was a month
where we didn't have

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.755
a lot of money in the bank.

00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:52.600
And it was like,
hey, everybody, flag.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.070
The waterline just moved.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.210
So now we all need
to be aware of that.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.970
And then once it
recovers, we can go back

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.250
to our normal attenuation.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.420
So that's the first answer.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.130
The second question was
about, when someone loses,

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.473
what does that look like?

00:50:05.473 --> 00:50:06.890
And there are two
kinds of losing.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:11.650
So there's legitimate losses of
power or influence or control.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.330
And then there are
perceived ones.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.500
And I think one of
the big shifts that

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.240
happens in these
types of organizations

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.450
is changing one kind of
control for another, one

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.287
kind of identity for another.

00:50:21.287 --> 00:50:23.620
So as a leader, yeah, maybe
I don't have the same number

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.180
of headcount underneath me.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.670
Does that actually
make me lesser?

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.110
Is the debate worth having?

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.810
And the identity of who I am in
the system and how I add value

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.940
and what I'm worth may or
may not change based on that.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.300
So there's a little
bit of growing up

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.503
that has to happen about
what's really being lost here.

00:50:40.503 --> 00:50:42.670
But the other thing is,
when there are real losses--

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.770
when someone's going to lose
their job or a bunch of people

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.200
are or we're going to change
something that materially

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.340
affects what we're doing--

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.170
that's probably an
integrative decision.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.490
So we're going to get
consent from multiple roles

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.680
that we've entrusted to
hold that type of decision.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.580
And even though not everyone
will agree with that decision,

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.530
we've agreed with
who will make it.

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.080
So it's possible that we
could make a decision tomorrow

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.355
at the ready that eliminates an
entire section of our business.

00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:08.480
The people that are in that
section of the business

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.060
have consented to
the body that would

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.860
make that decision making it.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.010
So it's something that
we're more explicit about.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.810
Where do decision rights live?

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:18.865
And who do we trust?

00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:20.990
And a lot of the roles that
hold that kind of power

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.210
in systems like
this are elected.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.030
So in hire, at the ready,
in other companies,

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.210
often the people that hold
those levels of influence

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.900
are elected.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.900
So that they can be trusted to
do what's best for the system

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.190
or the collective as a whole.

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.740
And for sure, sometimes
what's best for the collective

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.840
is not best for the individual.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.900
And there's some real
tension and stress there.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.900
AUDIENCE: I've got a
question about transparency

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.580
of remuneration.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.800
You mentioned in one
or two of the companies

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.630
that everybody knew
what everybody else was

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.010
getting paid.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.980
Is that an obstacle too far?

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.670
It feels like a
really strange thing.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:57.738
I know in Sweden they
publish their salaries

00:51:57.738 --> 00:51:59.780
and everybody knows what
everyone's getting paid.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.460
But how divisive
is it not to know

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.613
what everybody's getting paid?

00:52:04.613 --> 00:52:06.530
AARON DIGNAN: So there's
a few things about it

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.410
that are interesting.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:12.830
One is that in most
cultures, the opacity of pay

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.650
leads to bias and
unfairness in comp.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.380
So just on the whole,
it means that people

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.920
that are less vocal
or less negotiative

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.500
or have a different
background or situation

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.410
might end up not being paid
as well as their counterparts.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.390
And there's just a lot
of data to suggest that.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.690
So one of the things it
does is create more fairness

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.377
or more equity over time.

00:52:34.377 --> 00:52:35.960
But I think the more
interesting thing

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.540
is that when we don't know
what people are being paid,

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.210
we're missing out on a huge
part of the economic equation

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.150
of the business.

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:45.020
So if we're meant to be leaders
and managers and people that

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.390
are shaping the decisions we
make and we don't know what

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.930
those decisions
cost, we're missing

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.150
a huge piece of the puzzle.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.830
And so in terms of developing
that entrepreneurial spirit

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.660
and that awareness,
it's a big gap.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.660
And so I think there are
a lot of cultures where

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.118
it's quite a
sensitive topic, where

00:53:01.118 --> 00:53:02.872
it's quite an emotional topic.

00:53:02.872 --> 00:53:04.580
But what we've learned
through practice--

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.540
and we did first transparent pay
at the ready and then self-set

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.220
pay in two progressive years.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.680
And what we've
learned is that it's

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.862
the transition that's painful.

00:53:14.862 --> 00:53:16.820
Once you're on the other
side and you're really

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.090
embedded there, then there's a
different kind of discussion.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.877
But it's actually the transfer
from one thing to another

00:53:23.877 --> 00:53:24.960
that's the most dangerous.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.040
So I invite people to
be cautious about that

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.640
rather than where they're going.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.630
The how you do it almost matters
more than the doing it itself.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.870
But yeah, on the whole,
I think I definitely

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.720
come down on the side of the
benefits outweigh the costs.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.200
But there are stresses
and tensions and costs

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.630
and outbursts and
people who realize

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.078
unbelievable inequity
has been occurring

00:53:47.078 --> 00:53:48.620
and other people
who don't understand

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.220
why there's a difference.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.330
But again, I think that's
building the capacity.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.955
So if someone comes
to me and is like,

00:53:54.955 --> 00:53:57.080
Aaron, I'm paid half what
this other person is paid

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.045
and I think that's
totally unfair,

00:53:59.045 --> 00:54:00.920
now we have a chance to
understand something.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.533
Either they're right,
or we're right.

00:54:02.533 --> 00:54:04.700
So if they're right, we'll
find out through dialogue

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.020
that maybe it is a
little bit unfair

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.562
and we can make an
adjustment or they

00:54:07.562 --> 00:54:09.350
can if it's a self-set
pay environment.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.940
And if we're right, they're
going to learn something

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.390
about what the company values.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.150
So maybe they haven't
sold anything.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:17.205
And this other person has
sold $2 million of services.

00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:18.830
That's why they get
paid twice as much.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.005
And now they realize, oh,
this place values sales.

00:54:21.005 --> 00:54:22.380
But they didn't
know that before.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.340
It was just sort of in the soup
of how the important people

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.900
judge the other people.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.573
So I think just the transparency
creates those conversations.

00:54:30.573 --> 00:54:31.990
SPEAKER: With that,
please join me

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.865
in a mass round of
applause for Aaron Dignan.

00:54:33.865 --> 00:54:34.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:37.240
AARON DIGNAN: Thank you.
