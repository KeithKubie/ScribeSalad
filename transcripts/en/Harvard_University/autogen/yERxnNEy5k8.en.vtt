sort of dappled light and then a

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:27.280
sort of dappled light and then a
 

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.700
sort of dappled light and then a

yellow woods live on beautifully and I

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:53.160
yellow woods live on beautifully and I
 

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.310

just another one of those marks in

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:00.940
just another one of those marks in
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.690
just another one of those marks in

of collecting which is that decisions

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:06.670
of collecting which is that decisions
 

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.590
of collecting which is that decisions
are made for one reason and then that

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:10.600
are made for one reason and then that
 

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.870
are made for one reason and then that
changes so that's what the trees look

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:12.880
changes so that's what the trees look
 

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.810
changes so that's what the trees look
like on the top after we planted them

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:15.820
like on the top after we planted them
 

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.120
like on the top after we planted them
and then on the bottom the yellow woods

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.130
and then on the bottom the yellow woods
 

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.880
and then on the bottom the yellow woods
have done extremely well and filled in

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:22.890

and then the replanting of those and

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:31.590
and then the replanting of those and
 

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.340
and then the replanting of those and
then I guess I'll just make one other

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:34.350
then I guess I'll just make one other
 

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.020
then I guess I'll just make one other
point and then run through the slides

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.030

what we observed had been done

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760
what we observed had been done
 

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.470
what we observed had been done
historically was that when trees that

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480
historically was that when trees that
 

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.640
historically was that when trees that
were not Elms were introduced into the

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:46.650
were not Elms were introduced into the
 

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.330
were not Elms were introduced into the
yard arborists and I suppose maybe

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:50.340
yard arborists and I suppose maybe
 

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.580
yard arborists and I suppose maybe
landscape architects had made the

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:52.590
landscape architects had made the
 

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.950
landscape architects had made the
decision to remove the lower branches

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960
decision to remove the lower branches
 

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.210
decision to remove the lower branches
and the identity of trees is very much

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220
and the identity of trees is very much
 

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.030

through their form among obviously their
 

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.490
through their form among obviously their
leaves and other things and so this is

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500
leaves and other things and so this is
 

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.330
