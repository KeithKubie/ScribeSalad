00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.770
When I was 17, I was diving
off the coast of South Florida

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.773
and I saw the most beautiful
fish I had ever seen.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.476
It had these bold stripes
and these big dramatic spines.

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.345 line:0%
And I had no idea
what it was.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.847 line:0%
So I went to the
dive master and he told me

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.716 line:0%
I had just seen a lionfish.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.684
<i> And I was hooked.</i>

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.219
<i> I started reading
 everything I could</i>

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.988
<i> about this strange
 and beautiful fish</i>

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.424
<i> and what I found
 completely astounded me.</i>

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.092
I had no idea that
something so gorgeous

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:30.296
could be causing such harm on
our native reef ecosystems.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.665
<i>Lionfish are what is known
 as an invasive species.</i>

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.566
<i>And that's defined as a species</i>

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.936
<i>that is non-native to its area</i>

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.373
and that is causing harm
or is likely to cause harm.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:43.510
Now, lionfish are originally
from the Indo-Pacific region

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.544
and they were introduced off
the coast of South Florida

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.246
in the mid 1980s.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.282
<i> And most likely it was
through an aquarium release.</i>

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.184
<i> So, someone who
 had some pet lionfish</i>

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.685
<i> didn't want to take
 care of them anymore</i>

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.787
<i>and then just dumped them
into the local waterways.</i>

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.357
So this is problematic
for a couple of reasons.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.825
First, lionfish are
prolific breeders.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.795
They can produce two million
eggs over the course of one year

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.197
and one lion fish and
all of her offspring

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:08.935
can produce 8.1 quintillion eggs
in just three months.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.671
<i>And the other thing is they
 are voracious predators.</i>

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.574
<i>They're essentially like the
hoover vacuums of the sea.</i>

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.675
<i> They can eat anything
 up to half their size</i>

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.178
<i>and unfortunately that includes</i>

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.580
<i> a lot of the really cool
 interesting reef fish</i>

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.682
<i> that we like to see on
 the reef as divers.</i>

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.784
<i>To top it all off they have</i>

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.286
<i> a series of venomous
spines lining their back.</i>

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.956
<i> This produces a very
 nasty neurotoxin</i>

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.458
<i> that causes pain and
swelling if you're stung.</i>

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.227
One of my interviewees
told me that it won't kill you

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.929
but it will make you
wish you were dead.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.731
So, this is
definitely not a fish

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.300
that we want wandering around
where it doesn't belong.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.169
And the more I read
about this fish

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.271
the more I realized that there
was a lot of talk about

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.673
the biology and
ecology of lionfish.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.709
But really was--
no one was diving into

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.877
the kind of social
implications of this fish.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.180
<i>So, I went to South Florida and</i>

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.616
<i> I found this
incredible community that has</i>

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.152
<i>completely rallied around
the removal of this species</i>

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.521
<i> using whatever resources
they have at their disposal.</i>

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.123
<i> For example, you have
 Bob and Maria Hickerson.</i>

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.691
<i> They're located
 in South Florida</i>

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.828
and they would go in their
free time, and try and remove

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.731
as many lionfish as possible
on their local reefs.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.066
But they were getting
so frustrated because

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.401
they were leaving so
many fish behind.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.303
So, they took some tools and

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.105
random things they found
at Home Depot

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.942
and created the very first
lionfish-specific spear gun.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.745
So, now you can remove them
at a much faster rate.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.048
<i> And then, Maria takes
 the spines and the fins</i>

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.018
<i>and creates really beautiful
pieces of lionfish jewelry.</i>

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.387
<i>She then sells them to support
 the removal initiatives</i>

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:37.623
<i>but also raise awareness about
lionfish as an invasive species.</i>

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.592
So, the great thing
about lionfish is that

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.762
<i>they're actually delicious to
eat, and that's something that</i>

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.331
<i> John Mirabella,
who lives in Marathon Key</i>

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.498
<i> found out for himself.</i>

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:48.668
<i>He would go out and remove
 lionfish in the morning</i>

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.103
<i> and take it back to the
restaurant he owned on Marathon</i>

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:53.606
<i>and just experiment with all
different types of recipes.</i>

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.207
<i>So, here's lionfish sushi</i>

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.276
<i> which I tried and
 it was delicious.</i>

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.345
And then I did run
out of food money.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.480
I spent it all on diving.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.315
I have my priorities
really messed up.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.685
And so, I ended up eating
lionfish for almost every meal

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.686
for like two weeks...
( laughs )

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.021
which was totally barbaric.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.690
But it was delicious.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.692
<i> And the great thing is
that in John's restaurant</i>

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.727
<i> he marketed that he
 was serving lionfish</i>

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:15.862
<i> in the local newspapers</i>

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.797
<i> and people were coming
 from all over the Keys</i>

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:19.031
<i> to sample this fish</i>

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.768
which shows that even if people
are removing them themselves

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.037
they're excited to support
initiatives that are.
