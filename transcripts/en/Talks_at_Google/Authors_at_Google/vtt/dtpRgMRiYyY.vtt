DAVID BLACK: OK, good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.165
I am delighted to welcome
Jonathan Powell to Google

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:13.665
today.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.830
Jonathan spent
nearly two decades

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.346
mediating between governments
and terrorist organizations.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.090
He runs InterMediate,
a London-based charity

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.970
for negotiation
and mediation that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.760
focuses on the most difficult,
dangerous, and complex

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.430
conflicts in the world,
where other organizations are

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.180
unable to operate.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.610
He was Downing Street chief
of staff with Tony Blair.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.850
And in 1997 he met Gerry
Adams and Martin McGuinness

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.750
and became instrumental
in negotiating peace

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.280
in Northern Ireland.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.620
In 2008 he suggested publicly
that Western governments

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.760
should open talks
with the Taliban,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.020
with Hamas, and with al-Qaeda.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.120
And today he works on different
conflicts around the world

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.094
and is the Prime Minister's
special envoy to Libya.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:01.510
Jonathan has spent
half a lifetime

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.670
talking to people in
organizations labeled

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.330
as terrorists and has drawn
together his experiences

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.360
in his book "Talking
to Terrorists,"

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.170
which includes
conflicts from Colombia

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.940
to Sri Lanka to Palestine
to South Africa.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.220
So please give a
very warm Google

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.254
welcome to Jonathan Powell.

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:17.754
Jonathan.

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:19.642
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.880
JONATHAN POWELL: Thank
you very much, David.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.510
And thank you very much
for inviting me here.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.950
It feels coming from
Westminster a bit

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530
like several
centuries' time travel

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.140
to come into this building,
especially someone as old

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.440
as me.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.895
So I was Tony Blair's chief
of staff for 13 and 1/2 years,

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.270
from when he became leader of
the Labour Party to when he

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.690
left Downing Street.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.990
He left by the front door,
I left by the back door.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.657
And during that time I was
also the chief negotiator

00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:46.490
on Northern Ireland.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.698
So I spent a lot of time
going backwards and forwards

00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:50.940
across the Irish Sea and
meeting Adams and McGuinness

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.710
and other, less
salubrious characters.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.530
And when I left
government, I tried

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.571
being a banker for a while
but didn't really take

00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:58.990
to that, about 12 months of it.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.640
And I carried on trying to
work on terrorism with ETA

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.980
in Spain and other conflicts.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.300
And now I set up this
charity, InterMediate,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
to carry on doing the work.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.490
And it struck me there were
some lessons to be learned.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.230
And I have to say
I wasn't always

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.660
in favor of talking
to terrorists.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.820
The first time I
met some terrorists,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.700
I certainly wasn't in favor.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.890
I met Adams and
McGuinness in 1997.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.134
They had shot my father through
the ear in an ambush in 1940.

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:27.550
The IRA, not Adams
and McGuinness.

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:31.270
My brother, who wrote that
[INAUDIBLE] tripping on a death

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.080
list for eight years.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.010
So when I met them
I didn't really feel

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.290
like shaking their hands
and refused to do so.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.866
A petty gesture,
which I now regret.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.240
But actually,
interestingly, when

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.740
I came to study
past conflicts, this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.698
is one that repeats itself
time and time again.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.560
The first time people
meet from a conflict,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.851
they never want to shake hands.

00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:53.429
It takes a long time
to get to that stage.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.220
We went actually on a
walkabout immediately

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.820
after that meeting, Tony
Blair in east Belfast,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.997
in a very Protestant
area of east Belfast.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:01.830
And he was confronted
in the shopping center

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.250
by a crowd of old women,
so hell's grannies,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.280
I thought of them as.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.820
And they were
charging him, and they

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.020
started throwing
rubber gloves at him.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.390
And he thought maybe it was
a protest about washing up.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.670
But it was because
he hadn't worn gloves

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.550
to shake hands with Adams
and McGuinness, these two

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.170
murderers.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.440
It was a very visceral issue,
this shaking hands business.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.240
About a week after that
meeting, Martin McGuinness

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.821
gave me a call out of the blue.

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.070
And he said, would I visit
Northern Ireland incognito?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.180
But would I especially
not tell the securocrats,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.380
their name for the
police and the army.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.430
So I asked Tony Blair,
and he said, yes, go.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.350
So I took a plane to
Belfast and a taxi to Derry.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.950
I stood on a street corner,
feeling slightly foolish

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.422
like a character out of
some sort of spy novel.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.880
And then two guys
with shaved heads

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.792
suddenly turned up and pushed
me into the back of a taxi.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.500
And the taxi whisked
off and drove around

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.530
for an hour around Derry
until I was completely lost.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.020
And pushed me out of the door
just outside a new modern house

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.580
on the edge of an estate.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.010
And I knocked on the door.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.900
And Martin McGuinness came
to the door on crutches.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.946
I made a not very funny
joke about kneecapping,

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:06.570
which is the way the IRA used to
punish people they didn't like

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.535
by drilling holes through
all of their various joints.

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:11.660
I spent three hours sitting
in that house with him,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.780
and we made no breakthroughs.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.904
The lady of the house had
kindly asked no questions

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.029
and left some sandwiches
and a cup of tea.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.110
We made no breakthroughs,
but it started a pattern

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.134
of trying to build
some sort of trust

00:04:22.134 --> 00:04:24.050
to get out of this
conflict, which had gone on

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.660
for-- depending on how you
count it-- seven centuries or 30

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.537
years.

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:30.620
There was a huge gap of
trust, and that could only

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.400
be built by going
onto their territory,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.620
not demanding that they
come to Downing Street

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830
or they come to Stormont Castle.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.330
So I took from that
the idea that you do

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.230
need to be able to
talk to terrorists.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.530
But you do also need to bear
in mind that you'll never

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.850
bridge that trust totally.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.090
As I say, for the 10 years I
was crisscrossing the Irish Sea.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.442
But even late in the
negotiations in 2004,

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:52.900
I think it was, we
were negotiating

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.850
in a monastery in west Belfast,
in a Catholic area of Belfast.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.990
And we stayed
late, and the monks

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.709
had kindly given us
dinner in their refectory.

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:03.250
And we were eating,
and I was worried

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.850
about missing the
plane back to London.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.933
And I was looking at my
watch, and the minute hand

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:09.090
had become loose and was
swinging around loosely.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.840
So I couldn't work
out what the time was.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.298
Martin McGuinness
noticed and said,

00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:14.410
oh, I've got a watchmaker
at the end of my street.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.340
Give it to me and
I'll get it fixed.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.590
I said, no, honestly, really,
you don't need to worry.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.734
Please don't do that.

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:20.400
But he insisted.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.600
So he took my watch away,
and he gave it back to me

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.490
two weeks later at our
negotiations at Leeds Castle.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.990
And I, of course, had to give
it to the security authorities

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.562
to check it for
trackers and bugs.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.020
Which they did, and they broke
the minute hand immediately,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.520
and I had to go and get it fixed
very expensively in London.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.950
So there's a limit to how
much trust you can build.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.434
But I was interested
as I started

00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:41.100
doing this work as
my full-time vocation

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.420
now, giving up everything
else and just doing this.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.545
Whatever I'd learned from
Northern Ireland actually

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.960
also applied elsewhere.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.300
So what I've done with
this book is gone back

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.091
and interviewed the
people who participated

00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:53.560
in similar conflicts
everywhere else in the world,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.290
from South Africa to
Indonesia, the Philippines

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.310
to Latin America, El
Salvador, and Colombia.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.112
And there's an interesting
pattern that comes out of it.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.820
And one of the patterns
is that we always

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.584
say we won't talk to terrorists.

00:06:05.584 --> 00:06:07.250
When we first meet
terrorists, we always

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.875
say we'll never talk
to you, as we just

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:10.500
have with ISIS, for example.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.535
In fact, as Dick Cheney put it,
we never negotiate with evil.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.316
We defeat it.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.690
Well, the fact is
if we look back

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.980
at the history of
the last 30 years,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.530
or actually more
than that, you'll

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.696
find that we don't actually
defeat terrorist groups.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:24.260
We always end up
talking to them.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.730
And it would be a good thing
if we were able to learn it.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.259
Hugh Gaitskell, who is
leader of the Labour Party,

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:30.050
put it rather well.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.810
He said, the old
terrorists end up

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.970
having drinks at the
Dorchester as guests

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.315
of Her Majesty's government.

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:36.690
And that's certainly
true of what

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.440
happened to Britain
during decolonization.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.346
We called Menachem Begin, later
the Prime Minister of Israel

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:44.845
but at the time the
leader of Irgun,

00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:49.320
a terrorist group in Israel that
blew up the King David Hotel,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.250
killing 91 people.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.380
We called him a terrorist.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.760
We tried to gun him down.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.590
Later, we welcomed
him as a statesman.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.410
Jomo Kenyatta, the
leader of Kenya,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.650
we put in jail as a terrorist
in Kenya for five years.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.550
Eventually we negotiated
peace with him,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.040
treated him as a statesman.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.530
Makarios, Archbishop
Makarios in Cyprus, we

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.245
exiled to the Seychelles.

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:12.950
But later he was the person
we negotiated peace with.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.609
And yet we never seem to learn
the lesson that we are always

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:16.650
going to end up doing it.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.220
There's a sort of collective
amnesia we need to escape from.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.070
And if you think about
it, terrorist leaders

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.860
are just there much
longer than governments.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.943
Gerry Adams has seen eight
British prime ministers

00:07:25.943 --> 00:07:28.330
come and go in his time as
leader of the republican

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.830
movement.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.240
So not surprisingly, he has
a better sense of perspective

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.406
than we tend to have.

00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:36.280
Now of course there are
arguments put forward

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.660
against talking to
terrorists, and I've

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.660
experienced quite a few
of them since publishing

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.100
this book in the last few days.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.920
Some of them put quite strongly.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.660
And the first is that
it's appeasement.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.159
George W Bush made a speech in
the Knesset in Israel in 2005

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.450
in which he said talking to
terrorists was appeasement.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.760
It was just like Munich.

00:07:54.864 --> 00:07:56.780
Seems to me that's a
complete misunderstanding

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.404
of appeasement.

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:00.130
The mistake that
Chamberlain made in Munich

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.200
was not talking to Hitler.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.991
Talking to Hitler was
a very sensible thing

00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:06.268
if you wanted to try and avoid
another catastrophic world war.

00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:08.184
The mistake was thinking
you could buy him off

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:10.032
with a slice of Czechoslovakia.

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.740
Now talking to terrorists
is not the same

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.191
as agreeing with terrorists.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.440
The notion you'd give in to
terrorists because they've

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.570
got weapons would
be a terrible idea.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.080
But we sat down
with the IRA, who

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.460
were demanding a united
Ireland at the barrel of a gun.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.407
We did not give them
a united Ireland.

00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:25.240
What they got was
something quite different.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.420
They got power sharing,
they got the Irish language,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.760
they got north-south bodies.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.343
But unless you sit
down and negotiate,

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.910
you won't get to
that compromise.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.590
So the demand the
terrorist makes always

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.750
looks unreasonable.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.250
Once you start to
negotiate, you get

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.538
into the realm of
the reasonable.

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:39.954
The second argument
put against it

00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:43.390
is legitimacy, that we are
giving terrorists legitimacy

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.840
by talking to them.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.550
That is true, and it's
something the terrorists crave.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.330
But that legitimacy
is very short lived.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.610
If you take the FARC in Caguan
in 1998 to 2002, the rather

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.270
disastrous talks that
were held between

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.436
the Colombian Government
and the Marxist guerrillas.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.486
They got legitimacy from
talking to President Pastrana.

00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:05.110
But as soon as they
broke off the talks

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.195
and went back to fighting,
they immediately lost

00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:10.290
that legitimacy and went
back to a worse situation.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.440
Dismissed as
narcoterrorists who rejected

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.570
a very reasonable
political offer.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.630
So that legitimacy
is true, but it's

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.704
a very short-lived phenomenon.

00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:20.370
The third argument
is that we're showing

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.380
that terrorism works
if we talk to them.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.280
Jim Prior, who used
to be secretary

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.820
of state for Northern
Ireland under Mrs. Thatcher,

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.912
said this the other day
that terrorism had worked.

00:09:27.912 --> 00:09:29.120
The IRA got what they wanted.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.090
But they didn't get
what they wanted.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.180
And that's the point.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.812
Terrorism works in
terms of getting

00:09:33.812 --> 00:09:35.270
attention for what
they want to do.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.150
What ISIS is doing
gets them attention.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.900
It's not going to get
them what they want.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.690
They're not going to get
a caliphate out of this.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.356
But they're certainly
getting attention.

00:09:42.356 --> 00:09:44.000
Boko Haram kidnapped 200 girls.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They'd been fighting for
five years before that.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.709
They burned 100 schoolboys
to death in a barracks.

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.250
No one paid a blind
bit of attention.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.384
They kidnap 200 girls.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.550
Suddenly they get attention.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.980
They couldn't
believe their luck.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.097
That's what they wanted.

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:58.180
So terrorism does not work,
and by talking to them

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.560
we are not making it work.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.150
So governments always
start off saying

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.400
they won't talk to terrorists.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.770
They always start off
with a military campaign.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.020
And when the military campaign
shows it's not working,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.820
they think what we
need is one last heave.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.564
If we make a really
big effort, we

00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:13.980
will manage to
solve this problem.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.079
And that's of course what
we did in Afghanistan.

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.620
The surge in
Afghanistan was supposed

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.970
to put the Taliban
on the back foot.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.095
Trouble is the terrorist
groups don't necessarily

00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:22.720
agree with you.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.511
They may not feel
they're on the back foot.

00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:26.220
They may feel they
can keep on fighting

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.930
against conventional
forces indefinitely.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.840
And that you can
pile in your forces,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.540
you know they're going
to go away again.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.157
So this idea of a last heave
tends to be a delusion.

00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:38.740
There are some
revisionist historians,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.070
for example, who claimed
that in Northern Ireland

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.802
and with ETA in Spain, if
we hadn't talked to them

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:46.260
and if the government hadn't
insisted on tying the police's

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.340
hands behind their
backs on human rights,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.707
we could have defeated them.

00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:51.790
Having been engaged in
both of those negotiations,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.220
that's entirely untrue.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.189
It is true that the
IRA were having trouble

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:57.730
getting their attacks through
because we had them penetrated.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.030
It is true that ETA
was being set back

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.616
by French police arrests.

00:11:01.616 --> 00:11:02.740
But they were not defeated.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.010
They would have
carried on fighting.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.010
And unless we had engaged
with them politically,

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.220
we would not have
got to a settlement.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.510
So it is a false argument.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.885
Finally, I think
it's really true

00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:14.476
to say there is no alternative
to talking to terrorists.

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.976
If you take Hugh Orde, who was
the chief constable, the head

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.680
of the police in
Northern Ireland,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.880
he said there's
no example that he

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.740
knows in the world of an armed
conflict being policed out.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.750
In the end you have to
find a way of settling it.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.990
General Petraeus said of
Iraq that we couldn't fight,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.830
we couldn't kill
and capture our way

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.577
out of an industrial-strength
insurgency.

00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:39.660
And that really is true
of all of these conflicts.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.020
The academics have
done work on this

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.603
and they say there
are other ways out.

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.030
They talk about decapitation.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.520
If you kill or capture
the leader of a movement,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.510
that's supposed to
end the conflict.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.730
Well, it doesn't.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.480
Ocalan, the leader of the PKK,
was captured nearly 10 years

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.670
ago now, put in jail in Imrali
on an island in the Bosphorus.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.970
The PKK went from
strength to strength.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.730
Sheik Yassin, the
leader of Hamas,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.850
was killed by a rocket
strike by the Israelis.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.820
Hamas didn't disappear.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.236
It went from
strength to strength.

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:09.660
Decapitation doesn't work.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.380
They talk about Baader-Meinhof,
and Symbionese Liberation Army,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.054
and some of the
smaller armed groups

00:12:14.054 --> 00:12:15.595
and say, well, they
were policed out.

00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:18.200
Well, they weren't policed
out, but they did fizzle out

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.990
because small groups that
disturb middle-class children,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.604
as they were described by
their East German paymaster,

00:12:24.604 --> 00:12:27.020
do fizzle out because they
have no real political support.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.580
But if you're dealing with
something like the PLO,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.090
or the FARC, or the
FMLN in El Salvador,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.510
they have real
political support.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.695
They're not going
to just disappear.

00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:39.972
The one example put
forward as a way

00:12:39.972 --> 00:12:42.180
of solving a terrorist
problem which isn't by talking

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:42.721
is Sri Lanka.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.050
The Rajapaksa government
suggested they won,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.860
they beat the terrorists.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.420
And they did.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.394
They managed to finish
off the Tamil Tigers.

00:12:51.394 --> 00:12:52.810
But if you look
at the example, it

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.570
doesn't really give you
an example for anyone else

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.207
to follow in the West.

00:12:57.207 --> 00:12:59.040
For two reasons, or
three reasons, actually.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.970
The first is the methods they
used in Nandikadal Lagoon, when

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.885
they finished off the
last 50,000 Tamils,

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:09.010
were not methods that we
could ever use in the West

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.990
in terms of
indiscriminate slaughter

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.500
and disregard for human rights.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.300
The second reason is that the
reason the Tamil Tigers lost

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.110
was that their
leader, Prabhakaran,

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.020
who had been seen as
this military genius

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.700
up until that
moment turned out--

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.530
as one of the
Norwegian negotiators

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.860
described him-- as
a military fool.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.910
He tried to fight a
conventional fixed campaign

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.380
against a conventional army.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.890
Had he fought a
guerrilla campaign,

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.350
he would still be out there
in the jungle fighting

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.707
and not have been defeated.

00:13:34.707 --> 00:13:37.040
And the third reason is that
the political issue has not

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.720
been resolved.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.447
The issue of the Tamil
minority is still out there.

00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:42.530
As long as that issue is
there, there's the danger

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.580
that you'll face another
terrorist campaign.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.250
I hope to God we don't, but I
think it is entirely likely.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.200
And unless that
problem is solved,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.400
it won't prove to be
a lasting settlement.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.120
It is very difficult
for governments

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.547
to talk to armed groups,
democratic governments.

00:13:57.547 --> 00:13:59.630
You do not want to be seen
to be talking to people

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.880
who are killing your
civilians in cold blood.

00:14:03.195 --> 00:14:05.570
And usually, therefore, when
they're persuaded eventually

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.290
to talk to terrorists,
they do so secretly.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.150
Now John Major very bravely
started a correspondence

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.830
with Gerry Adams and
Martin McGuinness

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.450
in 1991, a secret
correspondence.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.790
And that correspondence
was going on

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.050
at the time of Warrington,
where a bomb went off and killed

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.382
two small children.

00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:27.090
I was at an event
yesterday in Cheltenham

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.464
with the father of one of
those two small children, Colin

00:14:29.464 --> 00:14:30.630
Perry, a very brave man.

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:33.770
And he was describing
the death of his child

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.210
and his child dying in
his arms from that bomb.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.080
And he said that had
he known at the time

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.570
that John Major was conducting
that correspondence,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.790
he would have been appalled
and demanded it stop.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.190
He said by about
six months later

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.721
he realized, thank God that
John Major was doing that.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.220
If John Major hadn't been having
that secret correspondence,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.119
we wouldn't have got to
an end to a conflict.

00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:55.160
So even a victim like
that, a victim of the worst

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.120
thing a parent can
have, sees the reason

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.090
why you do it in this way.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.000
John Major actually
appeared in Parliament

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.316
and said that at
exactly the time

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:07.940
this correspondence was going on
that it would turn his stomach

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.220
to talk to Gerry Adams,
and he never would,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.080
even though he was actually
conducting this correspondence.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.163
When Paddy Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary,

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:17.454
went to the House of
Commons to explain

00:15:17.454 --> 00:15:19.120
this when the
correspondence was leaked,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.710
he was convinced he
was going to be sacked,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.501
there would be demands
for his resignation.

00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:25.780
Interestingly, both Labour and
Tory benches understood what he

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.220
had done and welcomed it.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.660
But it is for that
reason, because

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.620
of the fear of publicity, that
these negotiations are usually

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.890
conducted by intelligence
agencies in the first instance.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.890
So for the Northern
Ireland case,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:42.400
the SIS opened a channel
to the IRA in 1972.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.060
And that channel
continued all the way

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.370
through to John Major's
correspondence in '91 to '93.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.360
So you start this channel,
and it takes a very long time

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.330
to get from the channel
to a real negotiation.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.270
Similar thing happened
in South Africa.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.070
Initial negotiations with
the ANC outside the country

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.120
were conducted by the NIS,
by the National intelligence

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.510
Service, who did the
hard work to start with.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.290
They met ANC leaders secretly
in various Swiss hotels,

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.980
moving around.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.521
Because Switzerland
was the one place

00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:14.180
they didn't need to have visas.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.960
And these meetings
are deniable so

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.800
that governments can walk away
from them if they come out

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.960
and they're embarrassed by them.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.610
It's not just John
Major who did that.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.520
Every Spanish prime minister
since the time of Franco

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.430
has had talks with ETA, and
every Spanish prime minister

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.920
since the time of
Franco has denied

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.220
he is having talks with ETA.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.135
Suarez, the Prime Minister just
after Franco, in Parliament

00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:40.600
when asked by the leader of the
opposition, Felipe Gonzalez,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.630
are you conducting
negotiations with ETA?

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.872
He said no, I'm not.

00:16:43.872 --> 00:16:45.830
Felipe Gonzales said,
but you told me yesterday

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.100
privately you were.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.254
And he said no, I'm not.

00:16:48.254 --> 00:16:49.670
So prime ministers
and governments

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.040
do go out of their way to
deny that these things are

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.760
happening.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.590
And governments use deniable
people to conduct them.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.720
The Oslo negotiations
on the Middle East,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.220
one of the most successful of
these sort of negotiations,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.520
was conducted by an Israeli
academic, Yair Hirschfeld,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.940
because if it had been
an Israeli official,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.069
it would've been something
they had to answer for.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.480
As long as it was
a private citizen,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.188
who actually was taking
a risk because it

00:17:11.188 --> 00:17:14.099
was illegal at that stage
for an Israeli citizen

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.700
to talk to the PLO.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.319
So he was at risk
of being imprisoned.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.220
He took that risk, he
conducted the talks,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.640
but he was totally deniable.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.390
But he got to a
successful agreement.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.724
Governments hate having
to use third parties.

00:17:26.582 --> 00:17:27.790
It's counting down, isn't it?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.815
Not up, I'm hoping.

00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:30.690
So I thought we were
going on for 41 minutes.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.898
It may feel like that to you.

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.560
I thought I was going
to run out of time.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.660
So governments hate
having third parties.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.677
They nearly always try
and drive them out.

00:17:42.677 --> 00:17:44.260
The Indian Government
has always hated

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.400
the idea of having a third party
working on the issue of Kashmir

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.680
and has kept everyone
well out of that.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.460
They even hated
having a third party

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.880
in the case of Nepal, a
neighboring country, which they

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.890
thought they should
be in charge of.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.300
And when the UN tried to get
involved, they saw the UN off.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.280
And in the end they had to
resolve the issue themselves.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.330
South Africa, they absolutely
refused to have a third party.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.920
They insisted the talks
must be face to face.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.692
But actually,
experience suggests

00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:13.400
that third parties
are crucial to getting

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.565
to a successful settlement.

00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:18.390
The Catholic Church has
traditionally played that role,

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.849
particularly in Latin America.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.390
It's increasingly
unwilling to do so.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.680
It sees it as a
politicization, and so they

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.600
tend to steer away from
it, for example, in ETA.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.300
The UN, which of course was set
up to do this kind of thing,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.360
had a brief
renaissance of doing it

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.017
after the end of the Cold War.

00:18:33.017 --> 00:18:35.100
During the Cold War, the
UN couldn't play the role

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.982
because everything
was a zero-sum game

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.940
between the Soviet Union
and the United States.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.260
So you couldn't have
the UN play that role.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.470
In 1989 they played the role
successfully in El Salvador,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.150
maybe in a few other countries.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.090
But countries soon
got chary about having

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.090
the UN coming in and
interfering in its affairs.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.760
So then we moved on
to small countries

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.420
doing these sort of
third party negotiations.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.940
Norway did it in the case
of Sri Lanka, for example.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.180
Explicitly in the words of
the Sri Lankan Government,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.930
because they were small,
they were a long way away,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.180
they had no interest,
they could be ignored.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.234
So they weren't too
powerful a third party.

00:19:07.234 --> 00:19:08.900
And one of the
interesting things that's

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.480
happened in diplomacy
over the last 10, 15 years

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.237
is the NGOs, like my NGO, play
this role of intermediaries

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.570
because we're deniable, we're
small, we're not powerful,

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.065
we're not a threat
to a government.

00:19:19.065 --> 00:19:21.440
One of the most interesting
to do that was a group called

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.402
Sant'Endigio, which is a lay
Catholic order based in Rome

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:26.860
that played the
role in Mozambique.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.910
They managed to build
the relationship

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.900
with RENAMO, this really
quite fearsome group

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.770
operating out of the jungle.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.550
They worked with an
archbishop from Beira

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.070
called Archbishop Goncalves,
who in his first visit

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.220
to go and see RENAMO went
to confession three times

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.172
before he left and dressed in
his full archbishop's robes.

00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:48.130
And he was flown in a
small jet into the jungle

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.150
and met them and managed
to start building trust.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.290
And that Catholic lay
group over four years

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.369
managed to get to the end of one
of the most bloody civil wars

00:19:58.369 --> 00:20:00.660
certainly anywhere in Africa
and possibly in the world,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.240
with millions who
died and many more

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.720
millions who were displaced.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.400
So there is a role
for third parties.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.080
But it's always hard to
persuade governments to do it.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.810
The question arises
of how do you

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.350
make contact with
an armed group?

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.558
They are deliberately covert.

00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:16.239
They are deliberately
trying to avoid

00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:17.530
you getting in touch with them.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.988
There's not some
front door you can

00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.460
go knock on and
offer your services.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.330
So it's quite hard
work to try and find

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.550
where these groups are.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.580
Your technology helps
to a certain extent.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.050
When some colleagues of mine
were trying to make contact

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.844
with the Nepalese Maoists, they
had no idea where to start.

00:20:33.844 --> 00:20:35.260
But they knew the
Nepalese Maoists

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.410
had a website called
shiningpath.com, dedicated

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.250
to their heroes, the rather
gruesome Maoist guerrillas

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.930
in Peru.

00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:47.500
So they sent an email to this
website, shiningpath.com,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.160
and were amazed to get a
reply and then gradually

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.551
set up a meeting in a deserted
unfinished entire block

00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:55.717
in Delhi where they were
taken in a rickshaw and all

00:20:55.717 --> 00:20:57.014
this other usual jazz.

00:20:57.014 --> 00:20:58.930
And they were taken there
and had the meeting.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.900
So it all started
with a website.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.360
In another case of
Aceh in Indonesia,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.860
where the guerrilla
forces have been

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.960
fighting for 30 years, the GAM.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.600
Again, the person
conducting the negotiations

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.136
knew the name of
the leader and knew

00:21:12.136 --> 00:21:14.654
the leader lived in Stockholm
but had no other details.

00:21:14.654 --> 00:21:16.820
So he went through the
Stockholm telephone directory

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.940
calling everyone with
the name until he finally

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.406
got to the right person.

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:22.530
And interestingly, that
person then wanted to meet.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.320
Because one thing that people
don't necessarily understand

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.710
is that leaders of armed
groups have often not

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.305
talked to anyone
external for decades.

00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:31.430
And they're longing to tell
their story to someone.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.480
They really want someone
to come and talk to them.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.854
So if someone
turns up and knocks

00:21:34.854 --> 00:21:36.545
on your door, even
if you suspect them

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.810
of being a CIA agent or
whatever it might be,

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.340
you are prepared
to talk to them.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.925
And you can actually get started
on building a relationship.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.640
Yair Hirschfeld, who
started the Oslo talks,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.140
had a similarly odd way
of starting the talks.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.750
He gave his mother-in-law's
in Finchley's telephone number

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.680
to Abu Ala, his opposite number.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.213
And Abu Ala called it 17 times
and eventually got through

00:21:59.213 --> 00:22:00.090
to him.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.630
And they agreed to meet in
a hotel, which was the Ritz.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.461
And Yair wanted to
rent a private room

00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:08.960
so they could have a private
meeting, but they had no money.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.220
So they agreed to meet
in the restaurant there.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.719
And what he hadn't realized was
on that particular afternoon

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:14.771
there was a [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:17.020
So there were elderly couples
waltzing around the room

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.920
while the two of them were
trying to negotiate peace

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.711
on the Middle East.

00:22:19.711 --> 00:22:21.765
So it doesn't always
work out perfectly.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.850
What governments often do
is try to find the guerrilla

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.605
leaders where they know
they are, which is in jail.

00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:30.730
That's often the easiest
way to start a negotiation

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.420
because it's not dangerous
for the negotiator

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.753
and you know where to find them.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.680
In Colombia, for example, the
ELN leaders, talks with the ELN

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.880
began with them in jail.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.995
The most famous one
was Nelson Mandela,

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:44.695
who was in jail who the
South Africans moved out

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:46.600
of Robben Island
and started talking

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.110
to him while he was in prison.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.572
It made his colleagues in
prison very, very suspicious.

00:22:50.572 --> 00:22:53.030
But that's really where the
germ of negotiations came from.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.954
And Mandela was wise
enough to realize

00:22:54.954 --> 00:22:57.120
that, instead of having
contempt for his oppressors,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.900
he had to engage them
to win their trust.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.680
And ended up with a rather
extraordinary meeting

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.710
with PW Botha before
PW Botha stood down.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.706
When Mandela was taken from
jail in a blacked-out car,

00:23:08.706 --> 00:23:10.830
they didn't tell the jail
people they were leaving.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.650
They zoomed out,
not because they

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.719
were scared of
Mandela being killed,

00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:17.260
but they didn't want the other
intelligence agencies to know,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.634
what they called the
brownshirts in South Africa.

00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:22.050
And they told the guards on
the Prime Minister's residence

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.250
that there was a visiting
dignitary, a president

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.280
of another African
country who was coming.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.749
And they whisked him
in up the elevator.

00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:30.540
And they had a rather
extraordinary meeting

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.140
between these two
old men who'd been

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.171
such vicious
enemies for so long.

00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:35.795
But in a way started
the peace process.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.110
It does, however, take a
very long time to build trust

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.810
and to actually turn any
channel you can develop,

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.726
like the one we developed
in 1972, into something

00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:47.100
that can be used
for negotiation.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.370
It doesn't happen from
one day to the next.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.190
In the case of Sri Lanka,
a Norwegian politician

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:58.410
called Erik Solheim, who
conducted the negotiations,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.450
had to work for a very long
time with the deputy leader

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.220
of the Tamil Tigers
called Balasingham

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.090
to get to a relationship
where he trusted him.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.360
And the first step
was Balasingham

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.730
had diabetes and needed to get
out of the jungle in Sri Lanka

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:16.840
and be treated.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.207
And the Norwegians tried to
facilitate him getting out

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:20.540
so he could have this operation.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.710
They negotiated with the
Sri Lankan Government.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.610
It didn't work.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.325
So the Tamil Tigers eventually
exfiltrated him to Thailand.

00:24:27.325 --> 00:24:29.950
He had a British passport so he
was allowed to come to Britain.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.260
But he still had no way
of having a transplant.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.580
And what Erik Solheim
did was arrange for him

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.090
to come to Norway and
have an operation so

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.680
that he could actually live.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.810
And that, not surprisingly,
built a relationship of trust.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.270
He had to insist that he brought
his own donor with him who

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.060
Balasingham insisted
was a relative,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.360
although he probably wasn't.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.234
Because the idea of
having a Norwegian kidney

00:24:51.234 --> 00:24:52.970
would not have gone
down terribly well.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.000
But it was a way
of building trust.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.560
The most difficult
thing often is

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.740
to-- In the
negotiations with ETA,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.620
for example, the people
handling the ETA leaders

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.540
had to have them
living in their house

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.000
for nearly six months,
which with small children

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.560
and so on is a kind
of weird thing.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.847
Because these people have
been on the run for years.

00:25:10.847 --> 00:25:13.180
They never stayed in the same
house for more than a week

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.410
or two at a time.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.860
They missed their own families.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.270
They had never been able
to cook because they

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.600
haven't been in a kitchen.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.000
And having this
emotion, and they

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.499
have horrors of the torture
they've been through.

00:25:22.499 --> 00:25:24.040
Although they are
also killers, which

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.944
you want to remember as well.

00:25:25.944 --> 00:25:27.610
But so having them
in the house, looking

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.030
at them babysitting
the children,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.140
them being allowed
to do the cooking,

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.723
spending Christmas
with a grandmother.

00:25:32.544 --> 00:25:33.960
Odd things that
you wouldn't think

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.400
would be an actual thing
to do for a terrorist.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.100
But if you want to get to a
relationship that takes you

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.280
somewhere, that's
what you need to do.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.070
And it takes a long time
in part because it's

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.130
an educational function.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.870
You need to help the
guerrillas who've

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.855
lived in isolation,
lived in a mental ghetto,

00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:48.980
talking only to each other.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.522
You need to help
them get out of that

00:25:50.522 --> 00:25:52.980
and start seeing how they're
seen by the rest of the world.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.455
And what may be achievable and
what may not be achievable.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.470
It is not always the
right circumstances

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.659
to begin a negotiation even
when you've built that trust.

00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:03.200
If a negotiation is
going to succeed,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.694
you need to have at
least what academics

00:26:05.694 --> 00:26:07.360
call a mutually hurting
stalemate, where

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.820
both sides realize
they're not going to win.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.620
In Northern Ireland
this happened probably

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.660
in the mid-1980s.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.730
In the early 1980s,
the British army

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.770
came to understand
it could forever

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.806
keep the IRA at a certain level.

00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:20.430
They could stop their
security becoming

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.610
threatening to the state.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.470
But they could
never defeat them.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.860
About the mid-1980s, Gerry
Adams and Martin McGuinness

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.290
began to realize that
they could fight forever.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.610
They would never be defeated.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.610
But they were never going
to drive the Brits out

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.400
by military force.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.950
They got way past fighting age.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.810
There's a generational
aspect to this.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.920
They started very young.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.711
They were fighters.

00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:41.790
They got to their 30s.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.400
They no longer believed
in fighting themselves,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.730
and they could see their
sons, daughters, nephews,

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.480
nieces getting arrested
or getting killed.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.146
They could see this
could go on forever.

00:26:50.146 --> 00:26:51.980
And at that stage
they reached out.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.500
It's also interestingly a
life-threatening disease

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.260
can have an effect
on these things.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.180
Ian Paisley, who had always
been one of the people opposed

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.780
to a settlement in
Northern Ireland,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.062
was someone who
actually helped start

00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:09.770
the fighting in the
first place by trying

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.530
to march on west Belfast.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.391
He went into the hospital in
2004 and very, very nearly

00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:14.890
died.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.790
He came out physically
completely different,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.160
very thin, very, very stark.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.990
And he told us afterwards
he'd had a close encounter

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.360
with his maker
while in hospital.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.660
And he decided he wanted to
end his life as Dr. Yes rather

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.400
than Dr. No.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.260
So when he came out, he took a
completely different reaction

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.440
to the negotiations.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.140
He tried to get to an agreement.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.140
Every time we had
a meeting, he'd

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.056
be trying to get to an
agreement and his party

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:41.280
would be pulling him back,
trying to stop him doing it.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.860
We saw that also
with Hugo Chavez.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.650
Hugo Chavez, who had been
instrumental in strengthening

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.530
the FARC, allowing the FARC to
base themselves in Venezuela.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.300
When he got cancer,
he not only started

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.490
going to church twice a day.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.004
He also actually
dedicated himself

00:27:55.004 --> 00:27:56.920
to trying to bring an
end to the war with FARC

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.330
by pressing the FARC to
go into negotiations.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.450
So you can have these
odd personal effects

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.327
to start the negotiation going.

00:28:04.327 --> 00:28:06.160
And you need most of
all to have leadership.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.870
You need to have politicians
on both sides who

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.380
are ready to take risks.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.675
In his book, Tony Blair
says that I accused him

00:28:15.675 --> 00:28:17.300
of having a messiah
complex, and that's

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.700
why he managed to
solve Northern Ireland.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.632
It wasn't quite that.

00:28:22.632 --> 00:28:23.340
It was Mo Mowlam.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.839
You're probably all too young
to remember who Mo Mowlam was.

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:29.970
But she was very colorful,
quite earthy Northern Ireland

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:30.553
secretary.

00:28:30.553 --> 00:28:32.886
And it was she who actually
said to me that Tony thought

00:28:32.886 --> 00:28:34.680
he was fucking Jesus,
which is not exactly

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.657
the same thing as a messiah
complex but in the same range.

00:28:37.657 --> 00:28:38.990
And there is an element to that.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.930
If you're going to have a leader
who wants to solve a conflict,

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.230
they have to believe that
it can be solved and believe

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.585
that they can solve it.

00:28:47.585 --> 00:28:49.960
Mrs. Thatcher did not believe
that Northern Ireland could

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.097
be solved, so she was
never going to do that.

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:53.680
John Major believed
it could be solved

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.640
but didn't really believe
he could solve it.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.557
You need people who have this
belief that it can be done.

00:28:58.557 --> 00:28:59.890
And you need them on both sides.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.306
It's one of the reasons the
Middle East process gets stuck

00:29:02.306 --> 00:29:04.460
in a rut when you
don't have leadership

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.300
of that sort on both sides.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.369
But we did luckily
in Northern Ireland.

00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:10.160
And of course, classically
in South Africa,

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.521
where you had that leadership
from Nelson Mandela.

00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:14.020
Without it, you
would never have got

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.165
to a peaceful outcome
for South Africa.

00:29:16.165 --> 00:29:17.540
And if you hadn't
actually had it

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.330
on the side of FW de Klerk,
if he hadn't seen the need

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.860
to negotiate rather than
his predecessor to fight.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.417
There is an art to
these negotiations

00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:30.250
once you start them.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.500
Again, looking
back at the pattern

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.958
of all these previous
negotiations,

00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:34.770
they're not simple things to do.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.190
There are certain rules
you have to follow.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.640
I had no training
in negotiation.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.850
I joined the Foreign
Office in 1979.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.620
And the training
consisted of one day.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.950
And we were given a copy
of Harold Nicolson's book

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.210
"Diplomacy," which is a
wonderful British book.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.580
It was published in 1939
and republished in 1948.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.190
And the 1948 edition has a
rather wonderful understatement

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.370
in the first line.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.860
"A number of serious events
have taken place in the world

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.401
since this book was
first published."

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:03.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.130
Which is indeed true.

00:30:05.702 --> 00:30:08.160
The only other training we were
given we were given a guide

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.460
to [? plasmon. ?] And
[? plasmon ?] is where you

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.660
should sit people
at dinner parties,

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.000
which is very
important in diplomacy.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.060
But we were given no
training in negotiation.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.360
So I've had to learn
it as I've gone along.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.484
But it is interesting
that people prepare.

00:30:21.484 --> 00:30:23.900
If you're going to fight a
military campaign, you prepare,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.447
you have a strategy,
you have a plan.

00:30:25.447 --> 00:30:27.280
If you're going to run
a political campaign,

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.030
you have a strategy,
you have a plan.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.880
People go into negotiations
without any plan at all.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.350
It's true of business as
well as in this sort of work.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.039
And you do need to have a plan.

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:39.580
And the first thing
you need to learn

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.434
in this sort of negotiation
is the importance of process.

00:30:42.434 --> 00:30:44.850
I wrote a book on Northern
Ireland when I left government.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.820
And they allowed me to go
back through all of the files.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.070
And I sat in this little
office underneath the Cabinet

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.029
secretary's office reading
all these old files.

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:54.194
And there's one thing that
leaped out of those files

00:30:54.194 --> 00:30:55.850
at me more than
anything else at all.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.790
And that was the
need for process.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.492
When there was a process in
place, then there was hope

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.450
and you believed you
could get to a settlement.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.366
When there was no process,
there was a vacuum,

00:31:05.366 --> 00:31:06.990
and the violence started again.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.880
So making peace is not an event.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.770
It's not some big thing
where you have a celebration.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.620
It's actually that process
that gradually builds trust

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.080
over a very long period of time.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.725
Shimon Perez, recently
the President of Israel

00:31:20.725 --> 00:31:22.100
who is a master
of the one-liner,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.058
sums this up very well.

00:31:23.058 --> 00:31:25.110
He says, in the
Middle East everyone

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.810
knows what the outcome
of Arab-Israeli peace

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.700
will be in terms of territory,
in terms of refugees,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.540
even in terms of Jerusalem.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.219
But there's no
process to get there.

00:31:34.219 --> 00:31:35.760
And he says, the
good news is there's

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.740
light at the end of the tunnel.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.826
And the bad news is
there's no tunnel.

00:31:39.826 --> 00:31:41.450
What you're trying
to do as negotiators

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:46.200
is create that tunnel so you can
actually get to a settlement.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.497
I think of it also
as a bicycle theory,

00:31:48.497 --> 00:31:50.580
that if you can get a
process going like in Libya,

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.104
where I work,
we've just started.

00:31:52.104 --> 00:31:53.520
We finally in the
desert last week

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.890
got the two sides to
sit down together.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.340
If we can keep
that process going,

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.060
if we can keep that
bicycle moving forward,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.809
and we don't let them
go back to fighting,

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:03.542
and we make it really hard
for either side to walk out,

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:05.250
there's a chance we
can get to a success.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.090
So it's like keeping
the bicycle moving

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.660
but not letting it
fall over at any stage.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.340
And that can
involve a great deal

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.230
of personal pain
and political pain.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.800
And I remember in 2004
in Northern Ireland,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.134
we had just failed to get an
agreement with Ian Paisley.

00:32:19.134 --> 00:32:20.383
The whole thing had collapsed.

00:32:20.383 --> 00:32:22.070
Everyone had walked
away from the talks.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.730
I went over to west Belfast
to meet Adams and McGuinness.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.780
I got off the plane.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.980
And I was met by a senior
official who took me

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.230
a mile in the car and then
stopped the car and got out

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.809
so the driver couldn't hear
what we were saying and said,

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:35.350
last night there
was the biggest bank

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.200
robbery in world history
at Northern Bank.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.102
And the dogs on the street
know the IRA carried it out.

00:32:41.102 --> 00:32:43.185
And I was just about to
meet Adams and McGuinness.

00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:44.310
I was absolutely furious.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.590
I went over and kicked a
rock and stubbed my toe

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.604
and thought I'd go back
to London on the plane.

00:32:48.604 --> 00:32:51.270
But I decided that actually that
would be the wrong thing to do,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.380
even though I was out on a limb.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.240
Everyone else thought it was
stupid to carry on the talks.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.750
The only thing to do was
to keep the process moving.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.390
So I went along to meet
with Adams and McGuinness.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.530
I couldn't even
mention the crime

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.380
because it hadn't been
made public at that stage.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.600
So I couldn't say
anything to them about it

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.445
like, you bastards.

00:33:04.612 --> 00:33:06.320
So I met them and I
had the conversation.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.430
And we kept the process going.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.221
And in retrospect, that
was the right thing

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:14.132
to do to try and make sure
that things keep moving along.

00:33:14.132 --> 00:33:16.340
There are all sorts of things
I'd like to say to you,

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.715
but I'm more interested really
in hearing your questions.

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:21.212
So I'm going to cut to the end.

00:33:21.212 --> 00:33:22.545
Just let me touch on the future.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.207
As I've already said, when
I left government I said,

00:33:27.207 --> 00:33:29.331
on the basis of what I
learned in Northern Ireland,

00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:32.070
we should be talking to Hamas,
the Taliban, and to al-Qaeda.

00:33:32.984 --> 00:33:35.400
And I was rubbished by my
former colleagues in government.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.350
They said, this is nonsense.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.500
They are quite different
from the PLO and the IRA

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.540
and we shouldn't be
talking to these groups.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.120
In the intervening
six years, we've

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.130
now had negotiations
with the Taliban

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.340
for the release of Sergeant Bowe
Bergdahl and other negotiations

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.191
behind that.

00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:50.190
There have been negotiations
with Hamas, Israel,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.320
and the United
States on a ceasefire

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.304
and on the release
of Gilad Shalit.

00:33:54.304 --> 00:33:56.470
And the former head of MI5,
Eliza Manningham-Buller,

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.370
says that we should be
talking to al-Qaeda.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.240
So these groups,
which six years ago

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.091
were too difficult to talk to,
suddenly now we think it's OK.

00:34:03.091 --> 00:34:04.090
And this is the trouble.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.420
Every time we come
to a new group,

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.794
it's a complete
revelation to us.

00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:09.010
And we never look back
at what we did before

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.540
and learn the lessons
of what had gone before.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.719
Now of course, groups
like al-Qaeda and ISIS

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.600
are more vicious.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.469
They want to kill more
people than IRA or ETA.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.750
They would kill 20
people at a time.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.739
ISIS wants to kill hundreds,
thousands if they can.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:25.585
Likewise al-Qaeda.

00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:27.960
But that doesn't actually make
a difference to terrorism.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.860
Terrorism is still horrific.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.441
The picture of the execution
of a single journalist

00:34:32.441 --> 00:34:34.940
is just as horrific and just
as effective for the terrorists

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.520
in terms of the terror that it
causes as killing 1,000 people.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.866
So we're dealing very much
with the same sort of thing.

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:43.699
People argue that because
they're religious,

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.659
this means that we can't
make peace with them.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.117
There's no evidence
of that at all.

00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:51.809
Peace has been made with GAM
and the MILF in the Philippines.

00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:53.850
Both of them were Islamic
movements, both of them

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.520
had unacceptable demands.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.427
This notion that these groups
are nihilistic and different.

00:34:58.427 --> 00:35:00.760
That's just because we don't
understand their reasoning.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.176
And unless you sit
down with them,

00:35:02.176 --> 00:35:04.570
you're not going to understand
what their rationality is.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.602
The evidence shows that
terrorists are not psychopaths.

00:35:08.602 --> 00:35:10.060
There may be
psychopaths among them

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.810
as there are among all
sorts of groups of humans.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.994
But the fact is they have
their own rationality.

00:35:14.994 --> 00:35:16.660
They're doing something
to get attention

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.826
for what they think they
want to have attention for.

00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:19.880
We're not pardoning them.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.420
What they do is unforgivable.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.370
But if you don't understand
their rationality,

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.600
you're not going to find a
way of dealing with them.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.119
Maybe we'll leave the discussion
for ISIS for the questions.

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:35.160
But if we really think
we're going to defeat ISIS

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.690
by bombing, we're
sadly mistaken.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.520
So let me just give
you my conclusions.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.720
Firstly, that terrorism
is not going to go away.

00:35:43.269 --> 00:35:44.810
We keep hoping it's
going to go away.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.518
We keep hoping we'll
find a magic answer,

00:35:46.518 --> 00:35:49.930
that drones or
jungle-penetrating radar

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.800
will solve the problem for us.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.530
It doesn't.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.985
They just move on to the
next bit of technology.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.529
We use Facebook and other
things to trace them.

00:35:58.529 --> 00:36:00.320
They use Facebook to
communicate without us

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.297
being able to get them.

00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:02.630
There's always a race like this.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.690
And interestingly, it goes back
if you look after the First

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.170
World War, there's
a similar thing

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.140
with terrorists
and globalization.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.890
So there isn't going
to be a magic answer.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.520
In a way, terrorism is the
evil twin of democracy.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.270
We'll have it as long
as we have democracy

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.644
because there are
people who feel

00:36:15.644 --> 00:36:17.242
they can't get their
way in democracy.

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:18.700
And there are limits
to what we can

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.810
do to try and
suppress such groups.

00:36:23.692 --> 00:36:26.150
Experience shows that you will
not get to peace in one day.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.915
You don't suddenly sit
down with ISIS tomorrow

00:36:28.915 --> 00:36:29.800
and negotiate peace.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.150
It takes a very long time.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:35.660
In Northern Ireland, there were
the Sunningdale talks in 1973.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.390
Seamus Mallon, leader of the
SDLP, the Catholic moderate

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.200
party, said, the Good
Friday Agreement in 1997

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.454
was Sunningdale
for slow learners.

00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:44.370
And in a sense it was.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.400
It had the same
elements as Sunningdale.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.155
But you had to wait
that long to get there

00:36:49.155 --> 00:36:51.030
because you'd had the
failure of Sunningdale,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.910
the failure of the
Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985,

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.320
the failure of the Downing
Street Declaration in 1993.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.080
And only with the
Good Friday Agreement

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.420
did you get to an agreement.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.740
Same with ETA in Spain
from 1974 onward.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.120
So don't expect to
get to it with one go.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.900
But I do believe that
all conflicts are

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.020
capable of resolution, even
Middle East peace process.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.000
If you keep going at
it, you'll get there.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.190
Just because it has
failed before doesn't mean

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.350
it will fail again.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.050
There is no such thing
as an insoluble problem.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.820
And an interesting
thing happens.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.625
As you approach an agreement,
up to that moment everyone has

00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:23.000
said that it's
insoluble, there's

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.670
no way it's going
to be resolved.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.690
Suddenly when you solve
it, it's inevitable.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:27.750
It was always
going to be solved.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.310
There was no problem.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.000
It was the fact that 9/11 or
whatever it was that changed.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.950
They're both wrong.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.130
No problem is insoluble.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.229
And no problem is inevitably
going to be solved.

00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:36.770
Because if you just
sit there waiting

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.480
for the force of
history to change it

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.356
or for something to
happen, it won't go away.

00:37:40.356 --> 00:37:41.854
You have to address
it, and you have

00:37:41.854 --> 00:37:43.310
to find a way of
doing something.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.310
And the only way
you can do it is

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.809
if you have political
leaders who've

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:49.730
got patience, who have the
understanding of what happened

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:54.020
before so they can learn the
lessons of that, have courage,

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.380
and we don't try and reinvent
the wheel every time.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.671
So I wish you all read my book.

00:37:57.671 --> 00:37:58.866
Thank you very much indeed.

00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:00.778
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:07.160
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.650
Thank you for an
absolutely fantastic talk.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.680
You can see the
audience spellbound.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.430
JONATHAN POWELL: Only
two or three asleep.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.341
DAVID BLACK: I'm sure people
are keen to ask questions.

00:38:16.341 --> 00:38:18.120
So please, line up at the mics.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.390
And to start us off while
people get to their feet.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.370
Let's ask you of your views
on the role of technology

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.155
in finding peace.

00:38:26.155 --> 00:38:28.280
And the role of technology
in some of the processes

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.120
that are going on,
from terrorists

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.160
using mass media or social media
to governments increasingly

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.727
using increasingly
advanced technology.

00:38:36.727 --> 00:38:38.310
What's the role of
technology in this?

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.410
JONATHAN POWELL: Well,
the role of technology

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.451
is interesting if you look
at it through history.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.190
You can see the videos on
YouTube now of the executions.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.210
So they know very cleverly
how to use technology

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.340
to get the maximum impact
for what they're doing.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.100
Their production values
are very upscale.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.330
And there's been this sort
of technological race all

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.329
the way through history.

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:01.690
I was saying, David, earlier
the original Fenians back

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.957
in the 19th century started
off using gunpowder.

00:39:03.957 --> 00:39:06.290
So they would try and blow
up buildings using gunpowder.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.792
And gunpowder is
not very efficient.

00:39:07.792 --> 00:39:09.250
There's a famous
occasion when they

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.750
tried to blow up
Clerkenwell Prison.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.874
They turned up with a
barrel, and they lit the fuse

00:39:12.874 --> 00:39:14.600
three times, and
it wouldn't go off.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.630
So they put it on a
wheelbarrow and took it home

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.940
and then brought it
back the next day.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.040
When they did eventually light
it, it blew up the wrong way

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.414
and blew out a
tenement building,

00:39:21.414 --> 00:39:23.080
killing a large
number of children.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.240
When they invented
dynamite a few years later,

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.740
that revolutionized the Fenians.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.200
They were able to use a small,
easily controlled substance.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.320
And they started attacking
all over the place.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.340
Interestingly, attacking
exactly the same things

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.965
that were attacked
by later terrorists,

00:39:36.965 --> 00:39:39.700
including a Tube train at
the same station as 7/7,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.100
the Glasgow gas works,
and the Hammersmith bridge

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.430
that was attacked
by the IRA later on.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.580
The Provisional IRA transformed
itself by using semtex.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.830
So they stopped using dynamite,
they used a colorless,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.580
odorless explosive.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.452
So technology can
change in that way.

00:39:54.452 --> 00:39:56.160
But we keep thinking
that somehow there's

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.550
an answer, as I said
earlier, the technology.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.030
Because there isn't.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.029
Because there's just this
race, always the race.

00:40:00.029 --> 00:40:01.990
So security forces
come up with a way

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.240
of frustrating bombs
operated by telephones.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.670
They'll come up with another
way of operating a bomb.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.150
So technology is not
the answer, but it

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.082
does keep revolutionizing
what they do.

00:40:12.082 --> 00:40:13.040
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.450
Sir.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.170
AUDIENCE: Interesting
follow-on question

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.040
from that is the role
of Google especially,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.650
because the tools we create
can be used on both sides

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.874
and show up are being
used on both sides.

00:40:22.874 --> 00:40:25.290
What do you think a company
like Google is uniquely placed

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:25.760
to do?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.065
Like what should we be thinking
about to try and make the world

00:40:28.065 --> 00:40:28.810
a safer place?

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.770
JONATHAN POWELL: Well,
that's quite a hard question.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.750
I mean, you're not going to
frustrate terrorism by Google.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.980
If you try and chase
the terrorists,

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.080
they'll simply find another way
of downloading their messages.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.692
I think actually by
demystifying things

00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:46.900
is the way that really helps.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.191
That if people can communicate.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.910
People sometimes think that
globalization, as I say,

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.117
is a threat to it.

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.700
If people can
communicate more widely,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.033
that's making it more dangerous.

00:40:57.544 --> 00:40:59.710
That was true, as I said,
after the First World War.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.319
That's when telegraphs
were invented, steam ships,

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:03.610
communications got much better.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.310
And the anarchist groups
operating in Chicago,

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.940
and those operating in Italy,
and those operating in Russia

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.320
all shared the same ideas.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.137
So it helped them share
ideas, but it also

00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:14.470
helps in fighting terrorism
if there's more transparency

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.400
and ideas spread.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.560
So if you're dealing
with Islamic extremism,

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.900
if people can actually get
access to that information

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.250
much more easily as they can
through the net and other means

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.041
like that, it could
make a real difference.

00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:26.645
So I don't see a
CT role for Google.

00:41:26.645 --> 00:41:28.770
I'm sure some of my former
colleagues in government

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.650
would like to.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.650
But I think it's much
more about the ability

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.960
to spread information
and demystify things that

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.235
are clearly crazy
that would help.

00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:39.835
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:41:39.835 --> 00:41:40.757
Adam.

00:41:40.757 --> 00:41:42.760
ADAM: So you spoke
about leadership

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.385
being really important
to resolving conflict.

00:41:45.385 --> 00:41:47.350
Just wondering
how you would mark

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:52.410
the leadership of Mr. Cameron
and Mr. Obama with the current

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.840
struggles that are happening?

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.430
And also, maybe if you don't
see leadership coming from them,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.950
where you do see it coming from?

00:42:00.265 --> 00:42:01.890
JONATHAN POWELL: I'm
always loath to be

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:03.030
too critical of
people in government

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.946
because I know how
difficult it is when you're

00:42:04.946 --> 00:42:06.840
faced with the
decisions in government.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.310
But there is a little
bit of illogicality

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.250
in launching a campaign against
ISIS that simply involves

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.930
bombing because no one,
including President

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:16.550
Obama or David
Cameron, thinks you're

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.360
going to solve the
problem by bombing.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.100
You may be able to stop ISIS
advancing by bombing, and even

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.260
in Kobani that's not clear.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.301
Now they're starting to
bomb more systematically,

00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:27.150
they may stop the advance.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:31.970
So I do worry that there's not
a clear strategy thought out

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.750
of how they're going
to deal with ISIS.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.044
And they're reacting
to opinion polls,

00:42:37.044 --> 00:42:38.460
particularly in
America, that have

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.911
moved to very large
numbers for taking action

00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:42.494
after the pictures
of the journalists.

00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:44.730
But they're doing it without
having, it seems to me,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.730
a clear structure that
can lead to success.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.665
So if you need to have
boots on the ground

00:42:49.665 --> 00:42:51.040
to drive these
people out, you're

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.498
not going to drive them out of
their defensive emplacements

00:42:53.498 --> 00:42:54.230
from the air.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.380
Whose boots do we
really think we're

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.610
going to put on the ground?

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:58.210
If it's the Kurds,
well, the Kurds

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.560
will advance as far as the
Kurdish areas, Mosul in Iraq

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.014
and down toward
[INAUDIBLE] in Syria,

00:43:05.014 --> 00:43:06.680
but they're not going
to go beyond that.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.460
The Shia army, the
Iraqi army is not

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.731
going to be successful marching
into Sunni territories of Iraq.

00:43:11.731 --> 00:43:12.980
So they're not going to do it.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.021
So arming them is not
going to solve the problem.

00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:17.355
Arming the FSA, the Free
Syrian Army, on past experience

00:43:17.355 --> 00:43:18.770
is not going to
solve the problem.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.880
So what is their answer
for boots on the ground?

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.860
For me the answer would lie
in the Anbar Awakening, which

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:29.540
happened when the American
forces were in Iraq when they

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.930
got the Sunni tribes to rise
up against al-Qaeda in Iraq

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.394
and very successfully
fight back against them.

00:43:35.394 --> 00:43:37.810
You need to have someone who's
Sunni who's going to fight.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.319
And I see no effort to do that.

00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:41.610
And of course, the Iraqi
Government, which is Shia-led,

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.990
does not want to do that because
they fear a Sunni militia.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.080
So the American or
British Government

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.195
would have to do that.

00:43:46.195 --> 00:43:48.320
There's a certain illogicality
in bombing only Iraq

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.390
and not bombing
Syria when ISIS makes

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.390
no distinction between
the two of them.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.159
And I would argue
in the longer term,

00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:55.700
you're going to have
to talk to them.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.940
You're going to have
to find a way certainly

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.982
of talking to the ex-Baathists,
the ex-Saddam generals who

00:44:01.982 --> 00:44:04.190
are among their supporters
who don't believe anything

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.240
about the caliphate.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.254
They simply feel marginalized by
the sectarian Shia government.

00:44:09.254 --> 00:44:11.420
And I see no one making
that effort to talk to them.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.070
We should have been doing
it for the last five years,

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.280
and we haven't been doing so.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.860
And in the end, we
will have to talk

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.900
to this political
manifestation of extreme Islam.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.870
There is, in my view,
no doubt that there's

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:23.610
real political
support behind this.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.100
Not behind the caliphate,
but between the grievance

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.872
that they feel.

00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:28.330
And if we don't
address that, if we

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.000
don't start building a link now,
trying an educative function

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.467
as we have with the
Taliban belatedly,

00:44:33.467 --> 00:44:35.050
the trouble is we
do this all too late

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.330
and people die unnecessarily.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.260
And General Petraeus
said of Iraq, correctly,

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.036
that Americans left
it too late to talk

00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:42.910
to people with American
blood on their hands.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.243
If they'd done it earlier,
they'd have saved more lives.

00:44:47.062 --> 00:44:48.020
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:48.916
David.

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:51.040
DAVID: Well, first off,
thank you for a great talk.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.480
And thank you for all your work.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.479
I'm rather rare in Google
in that I'm quite old.

00:44:54.479 --> 00:44:57.630
And I certainly remember
walking around London

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.490
when all the IRA
bombings were going on

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.839
and life felt very
different then.

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:02.755
So thank you for that.

00:45:02.755 --> 00:45:04.890
I would love to
hear your thoughts

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.150
about Russia and the Ukraine.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.580
And does what you've
talked about today

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.560
as applied to a situation where,
it's not a million miles away,

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.060
but there's sort
of a, shall we say,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.385
a certain legitimacy to
an existing government?

00:45:17.385 --> 00:45:18.260
JONATHAN POWELL: Yep.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.890
In my view, the thing that's
missing in the Ukraine

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:30.530
in particular is, or has
been up to now, a willingness

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.940
by-- I'm going to leave aside
obvious things like Putin's

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.194
aggression, why he's
doing it, and all of that.

00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.610
But there's one
bit that's missing

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.240
and that is the
Ukrainian Government

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.596
talking to the separatists
in the east of the country.

00:45:45.596 --> 00:45:47.720
They've been very unwilling
to give them legitimacy

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.520
by talking to them.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.870
And they've been determined
to try and fight them.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.457
And that's led Putin to come
back in with more armed force.

00:45:54.457 --> 00:45:56.540
So the thing that I think
is missing in particular

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.581
is that sort of dialogue.

00:45:57.581 --> 00:45:59.363
There's some evidence
it's now starting.

00:45:59.363 --> 00:46:01.520
But it seems to me it
should have been earlier,

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.190
that kind of dialogue
between Poroshenko

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.800
and those eastern separatists.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.580
In terms of Putin,
I think we do have

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.247
to be very firm in
sending him a message

00:46:09.247 --> 00:46:11.413
that we're not going to
tolerate this kind of thing.

00:46:11.413 --> 00:46:13.590
Except we always go around
drawing these red lines

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:14.950
and then we're not
prepared to fight for them.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.574
And then they become
very unconvincing.

00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:19.199
Saying we don't like what you're
doing, Ukraine, but by the way

00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:21.550
we're not going to fight is
not enormously convincing.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.510
But then I'm not
suggesting we should fight.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.050
So I admit they've got
a very difficult task

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.140
in Ukraine, the
Western governments.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.715
But the one bit that I would
try and add is that talking bit.

00:46:31.715 --> 00:46:34.540
DAVID: And just a follow-on is
should we be talking to Putin,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.040
and what would we
talk to him about?

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.750
JONATHAN POWELL: But we
are talking to Putin.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.599
Cameron's calling
him every other week.

00:46:40.599 --> 00:46:42.015
President Obama
is talking to him.

00:46:42.015 --> 00:46:44.090
The trouble is, I have some
experience talking to Putin.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.673
And it's like talking
to a brick wall.

00:46:45.673 --> 00:46:48.140
I remember when Tony Blair
had his last conversation

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.800
with Putin in 2007 at the
margins of a G-7 summit.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.690
It was just Tony
and me and Putin

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.272
and a Russian interpreter.

00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:56.730
And Tony decided
to use the meeting

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.570
to tell Putin what
he really thought.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.020
Because we'd been very
early in cultivating Putin

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.479
when he was running
for election.

00:47:02.479 --> 00:47:04.270
We went out to see him
in Saint Petersburg,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.540
thinking this is the new man.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.215
Let's cut him some
slack and maybe we

00:47:07.215 --> 00:47:08.590
can have-- after
Yeltsin-- we can

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.520
have some sort of
normal relationship.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.636
And he seemed like a modern
guy, he seemed very warm.

00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:16.760
And then I just watched
the hubris time after time.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.020
Every time we went back he
had more horses in his dacha,

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.810
more grooms for his
horses, more girlfriends,

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.935
and the whole thing became
completely out of whack.

00:47:22.935 --> 00:47:25.410
So anyway, Tony in 2007 tried
to tell him like it was.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.760
I would say that Putin
gave it back in spades.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.120
Talking to Putin can feel
quite counterproductive.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.710
DAVID: Hogging the microphone,
can you tell us what he said?

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:35.450
DAVID BLACK: Final question.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:36.950
JONATHAN POWELL: No,
because I can't remember.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:37.658
I can't remember.

00:47:37.658 --> 00:47:38.840
It wasn't very pleasant.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.230
DAVID BLACK: Thanks.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.150
Let's take some more questions.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.650
Please.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.370
AUDIENCE: How do you make sure
that terrorists do actually

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.035
have the power to enforce
an agreement with approval?

00:47:46.035 --> 00:47:48.160
JONATHAN POWELL: That's a
very, very good question.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.790
It's one of the first
things you-- Firstly, you

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.650
have to persuade people
in the government side

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:53.024
you're talking to
the real thing.

00:47:54.122 --> 00:47:55.580
You turn up and
they say, how do we

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.850
know these are actually really
the leaders of the terrorists,

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:58.672
not someone who's
telling you they're

00:47:58.672 --> 00:47:59.360
the leader of the terrorists?

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.276
So you have to ask for
proof, and that's often

00:48:01.276 --> 00:48:01.943
quite difficult.

00:48:01.943 --> 00:48:04.484
If it's a hostage situation,
you need a video, proof of life,

00:48:04.484 --> 00:48:05.540
and things like that.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.790
So first, you have to do that.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.620
And secondly, you
need an organization

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.850
that is quite united.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.260
So take Boko Haram in Nigeria.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.360
Boko Haram is very
fissiparous, with lots

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.380
of different groups in
the east and the west.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.630
So even if you made peace
with one part of Boko Haram,

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:20.332
it's not at all clear the
other bits would stop fighting.

00:48:20.332 --> 00:48:22.040
In the case of Ireland
it was interesting

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.090
because our first meeting with
Adams in Downing Street in '97,

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:29.460
at the end of the meeting,
which is very-- sorry,

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:33.900
allow me a digression--
it was an emotive occasion

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.135
because this was the
first meeting in what

00:48:37.135 --> 00:48:38.990
was called armed
force republicans.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.080
And it was a very tense
day in Downing Street.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.996
And there were more
cameras outside than there

00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:45.220
had been when we were
elected in May of that year.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.840
And when they came in,
Adams and McGuinness

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840
were also quite nervous.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.460
And I led them around to the
far side of the Cabinet table.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.168
And they were standing
behind the chairs.

00:48:54.168 --> 00:48:55.590
And Martin McGuinness
said to me,

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.572
so this is where all the
damage was done then?

00:48:57.572 --> 00:48:59.280
And I was actually
horrified, and I said,

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.620
yeah, the IRA mortars landed
in the garden behind you,

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.010
and they blew the windows in.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.926
My brother was here, and
he dragged John Major

00:49:04.926 --> 00:49:07.260
under the table, and four
policemen came in waving guns.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.092
And he said, no, no,
no, I didn't mean that.

00:49:09.092 --> 00:49:11.900
This is where Michael Collins
negotiated giving away Northern

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.430
Ireland with Lloyd
George in 1921.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.630
So they had a slightly
different historical perspective

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:19.610
on the whole thing.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.300
But anyway, so the
discussion finished.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.510
At the end of that meeting,
Adams took Tony Blair and me

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.050
to the end of the room,
the Cabinet room that

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.570
had two pillars
that separate you

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.200
off from where the table is.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.340
And he said, look,
I could probably

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.867
get into peace quite quickly.

00:49:31.867 --> 00:49:33.950
But if I do that, I'm going
to split the movement.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.410
We'll end up with
another IRA out there.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.160
If you give me time
and you give me space,

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.201
I'll bring the whole
movement with me, or as much

00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:40.090
as I possibly can.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.850
And the big bet
that we made, unlike

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.020
previous British
governments that had always

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.670
tried to split the IRA
into different groups,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.920
was that we would work with
them and try and keep them

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.113
together to make peace
once, not to have

00:49:49.113 --> 00:49:50.490
to make peace many times.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:51.500
And I think in the case
of Northern Ireland,

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.860
anyway, that was the right bet.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.810
But it's a problem you face with
nearly every terrorist group.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.810
Do they really represent
the whole of the group?

00:49:57.439 --> 00:49:58.980
Will their orders
really be followed?

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.360
And when they do,
they need to find

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.526
ways of ensuring they
actually do what they promise.

00:50:02.526 --> 00:50:04.352
And that's another question.

00:50:04.352 --> 00:50:05.060
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:05.990
JONATHAN POWELL: You're welcome.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.948
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:50:06.948 --> 00:50:07.888
Please.

00:50:07.888 --> 00:50:09.360
AUDIENCE: In most
of the examples

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.460
you gave, governments end up
talking to terrorist groups.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.840
Do you think this is a
tactic of waiting out

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.455
until the armed forces
resolve the immediate threat

00:50:18.455 --> 00:50:20.080
or until there's less
public attention?

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.690
Is waiting a tactic, or is
waiting just governments

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.420
being stubborn, of not learning
the lessons of the past?

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.584
JONATHAN POWELL: I wish it was
a clever strategy of waiting.

00:50:30.584 --> 00:50:32.250
But unfortunately
it's just an inability

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.637
to ever remember what
happened last time.

00:50:34.637 --> 00:50:36.970
It's quite interesting looking
back at the history of it

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:41.340
because the first real
negotiation with terrorists,

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.050
I guess, were with the
original IRA in 1919 to '21.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.860
Lloyd George came, and the
battle started in 1919.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.570
Lloyd George said we will
never talk to this murder gang.

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.640
By 1920 it was clear
that it was a stalemate.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.056
The only way the
British could win

00:50:55.056 --> 00:50:57.306
was by sending 500,000
troops to Ireland.

00:50:57.306 --> 00:50:58.930
So he then started
to try to reach out,

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.360
using someone like me,
a guy called Andy Cope,

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.900
to try and find the IRA leaders
and start talking to them

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.147
and start negotiation.

00:51:05.147 --> 00:51:06.605
He then had
negotiations, as I say,

00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:10.780
in exactly the same Cabinet room
that we had negotiations in.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.940
About five years later,
British officials in Palestine

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.597
were facing a rebellion
led by the mufti.

00:51:16.597 --> 00:51:18.055
And they had this
in the paper, you

00:51:18.055 --> 00:51:18.820
can read them in the papers.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.152
They had this explicit debate.

00:51:20.152 --> 00:51:21.860
Should we learn the
lessons from Ireland?

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.340
In Ireland, we did a
deal with a murder gang.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.020
Do we deal with a
murder gang here or not?

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.660
They said no, no.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.280
Let's forget about it.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.470
Let's just carry
on killing them.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.170
So they carried on doing that,
and Palestine is still a mess.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.980
So no, I fear it's
not a clever strategy.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.060
It is simply that we
simply don't remember

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.380
what happened last time,
which is why I wrote the book.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:43.314
It is true that you cannot,
you could not possibly sit down

00:51:43.314 --> 00:51:45.730
tomorrow and negotiate with
ISIS and come to a conclusion.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:46.521
That wouldn't work.

00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:47.610
It would take time.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.460
All I'm saying is
let's please think

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.790
about a long-term strategy
and think about what we're

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.300
going to be doing
later so we don't

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.830
get a whole lot of people
killed unnecessarily.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.266
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:55.266 --> 00:51:56.140
JONATHAN POWELL: You're welcome.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.060
DAVID BLACK: Thank you.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.101
Last couple of questions.

00:51:58.101 --> 00:51:58.602
Tariq.

00:51:58.602 --> 00:52:00.684
TARIQ: First of all, thanks
for coming and sharing

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.210
your fabulous stories and
for everything you've done.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.010
JONATHAN POWELL: Thank you.

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.926
TARIQ: You've talked all
about building trust.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.670
I'm curious as to
what that actually

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:09.905
looks like in practice.

00:52:09.905 --> 00:52:11.740
Because presumably the
first conversations

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.897
you had with McGuinness,
Adams over tea and sandwiches

00:52:14.897 --> 00:52:16.480
and getting straight
down to business.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.170
There must be some
what might be perceived

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.790
at the time as fairly
frivolous conversations.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.745
Can you just replay for us what
some of those conversations

00:52:24.745 --> 00:52:25.416
might look like?

00:52:26.137 --> 00:52:27.970
JONATHAN POWELL: I'm
not sure I can remember

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:29.872
the sort of details
of them, but I'll

00:52:29.872 --> 00:52:31.580
give you one that's
not really frivolous.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.940
But it's an example
of how it can work.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:40.560
So in 1999 I went to
see Adams and McGuinness

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.784
in a house in west Belfast.

00:52:41.784 --> 00:52:43.200
I remember because
I was picked up

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.410
by a woman who I better
not name, I suppose,

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.920
who was supposedly the fifth
member of the Gibraltar IRA

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.420
squad.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.560
The other four, you remember,
were shot by the SIS.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.460
She was the fifth member.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.240
She picked me up.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.610
I was carrying a
government briefcase.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.470
And it was so funny
being picked up

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.550
by this person who had
been a member of the IRA

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.810
with her baby in the
backseat and driving.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:52:59.741
It was rather weird.

00:52:59.741 --> 00:53:00.990
Anyway, I went to the meeting.

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:02.255
And we were trying to find
a way around this issue

00:53:02.255 --> 00:53:03.046
of decommissioning.

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:06.660
The IRA wouldn't agree to
put their weapons beyond use

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.350
until the Unionists
shared power.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.525
And the Unionists
wouldn't share power

00:53:09.525 --> 00:53:11.191
until they put their
weapons beyond use.

00:53:11.191 --> 00:53:12.900
So I talked to some
of our generals

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.650
who'd been in Kosovo
and in Bosnia.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.025
And they said what
they did there

00:53:16.025 --> 00:53:18.782
was they put the weapons
into sealed containers,

00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:20.990
and the UN would go and
inspect them every few weeks.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.210
So they hadn't given
up their weapons.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.260
They still had them.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.850
And the problem with the
IRA was their constitution

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.558
said they couldn't
give up their weapons.

00:53:27.319 --> 00:53:28.860
So I went to see
Adams and McGuinness

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.960
and said, here's this idea
our generals have given us.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.876
What about doing that?

00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:34.300
You put your weapons in sealed
dumps, have them inspected.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.260
They said, no way.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.343
There's no way the IRA
council will consider that.

00:53:37.343 --> 00:53:38.560
That's out of the question.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.601
Three weeks later, they
came to a meeting with us

00:53:40.601 --> 00:53:41.480
in Stormont Castle.

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.320
And it was a more formal
meeting with other officials.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.842
And they proposed
the idea to me.

00:53:45.842 --> 00:53:47.800
And I said, oh, OK, that's
an interesting idea.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.660
We'll go away and
think about it.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.470
And so that's what
you have to do.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:52.620
It's not really a
frivolous conversation,

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.740
I'm afraid, because
I can't remember

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.610
frivolous conversations.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:56.420
But it was one of the
ways that can work.

00:54:00.284 --> 00:54:01.520
SAM: Hi, Jonathan.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.610
My name's Sam.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.350
I'm also really
interested in the nature

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.000
of these human
interactions that you have.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.390
Your book is called
"Talking to Terrorists."

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.680
I'm curious if you
had the opportunity

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.850
to talk to the most
infamous terrorist

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.430
of the day, the
so-called Jihadi John.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:17.580
What would you say to him?

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.580
JONATHAN POWELL: Actually,
I wouldn't waste my time

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.570
talking to Jihadi John.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.940
He's simply an actor who's
wheeled onto the stage.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.020
And interestingly, quite
a lot of the jihadis

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.510
who come from European
countries find the experience

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.850
pretty unsatisfactory,
to say the least, what

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.517
happens to them
when they go there.

00:54:31.517 --> 00:54:33.600
I'd be more interested in
talking to Mr. Baghdadi.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.058
Mr. Baghdadi is an
interesting guy.

00:54:35.058 --> 00:54:38.210
He was a local vigilante in his
town near the Jordanian border

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.670
in Iraq when American
forces handed him over

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.780
to Iraqi security forces,
and he went to Abu Ghraib.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.170
And he came out a pretty
convinced proponent of al-Qaeda

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:47.990
in Iraq.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.879
It's where he had
his conversion.

00:54:49.879 --> 00:54:51.670
And actually, he's
clearly a very smart guy

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.350
in terms of tactics and how
he runs his organization.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:56.277
And I'd say to him
that you are not

00:54:56.277 --> 00:54:58.110
going to be able to
take and hold territory.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.695
No previous terrorist group
has been able to do that.

00:55:00.695 --> 00:55:01.820
So what do you really want?

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.410
What are you really
aiming to achieve?

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.760
And try and get into
that discussion.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.940
It would take a very long time.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.606
He'd probably behead
me in the meantime.

00:55:07.606 --> 00:55:10.770
But it would be that kind of
conversation you need to have,

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.020
and it takes a very long time.

00:55:13.517 --> 00:55:15.183
DAVID BLACK: Again,
final question, sir.

00:55:16.902 --> 00:55:18.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the talk as well.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:22.860
I'd like to ask about
how do you reinitiate

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.810
the talks after
something really bad

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.390
has happened during
the conflict?

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.469
Let's say, example
of now in Gaza,

00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:30.510
there's been talk for two
years, but then there's

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.250
been this conflict
there this year.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.380
What must happen so that
the talks are reinitiated,

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.260
and how does the first
meeting look like?

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.380
JONATHAN POWELL: The first
meeting is often very ugly.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.970
I remember talking to
a Tajik Islamist who

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:50.722
had been fighting for 20
years out of Afghanistan

00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:51.930
against the Tajik Government.

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.064
And him saying the first
meeting was very emotional

00:55:54.064 --> 00:55:55.480
because he had
never sat down face

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.829
to face with government
representatives before.

00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:59.870
And after that he found
it much harder to go back

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:01.150
to killing them.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.140
It really had quite
an emotive effect.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.564
Sometimes in other
places, talking

00:56:05.564 --> 00:56:07.480
to the people in the El
Salvador negotiations.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.870
Interesting because they sat
down and, even though they

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.240
really, I mean--
Joaquin Villalobos, who

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.710
was leader of the
FMLN, describes

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.110
just talking to this general.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.026
And the general rolled
up his sleeve and said,

00:56:17.026 --> 00:56:20.160
this is where your forces
shot me in an ambush.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.050
But they'd all been at the
same schools and universities

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.739
before they split and
went into the war.

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:26.280
So it was less
emotional, it was more

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.350
picking up old acquaintances.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.799
In terms of really
bad things happening,

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:32.340
the trouble is when
bad things happen

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.660
they tend to completely
kill off the talks.

00:56:36.846 --> 00:56:38.720
And they're very, very
hard to pick up again.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.345
And one of the reasons why it's
always best if you can possibly

00:56:41.345 --> 00:56:43.880
get to a ceasefire before you
start public talks is then

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.840
the talks won't be
interrupted by these things.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.798
But at the moment in
Colombia, President Santos

00:56:47.798 --> 00:56:50.040
is talking to the FARC,
and he's insisting

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.174
on fighting and talking
at the same time.

00:56:53.174 --> 00:56:55.090
Because President Pastrana,
when he had talks,

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.480
gave the FARC an area the
size of Switzerland as a DMZ

00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.835
that was their area.

00:56:59.835 --> 00:57:01.960
And they abused it, and
they went back to fighting.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.300
And so he's determined to keep
the military pressure on them.

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.133
The trouble with that
is outrages do happen.

00:57:06.133 --> 00:57:07.750
They killed 10
soldiers the other day.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.374
And of course, that
disrupts the talks,

00:57:09.374 --> 00:57:11.390
and then people don't
want to carry on.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:13.940
In the case of the ETA talks,
which were going on in Geneva,

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:17.620
a bomb went off while
the talks were going on.

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.960
And the instructions to
the Spanish Government side

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.604
were to leave.

00:57:22.604 --> 00:57:23.520
They didn't, actually.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.750
They said we're not going
to stay unless you promise

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.590
us there won't be
anymore attacks.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.920
So it can be a visceral thing.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.180
But if you want to succeed, you
often have to keep it going.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.810
But keep it going without
giving them perverse incentives.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.351
If you give them
perverse incentives,

00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:41.007
it just means the
struggle will go on.

00:57:41.007 --> 00:57:42.840
DAVID BLACK: And Jonathan,
closing thoughts.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.870
With the events in
Syria in the news again

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:48.706
today, if you needed to
advise governments on a thing

00:57:48.706 --> 00:57:50.080
they should be
doing differently,

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.580
what would be your
advice to them?

00:57:53.478 --> 00:57:54.853
JONATHAN POWELL:
Well, I think it

00:57:54.853 --> 00:57:56.728
would be something I've
already said, really,

00:57:56.728 --> 00:57:59.499
which is don't go around
pretending that you're

00:57:59.499 --> 00:58:00.790
going to solve this by bombing.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.670
I mean, I know it's
difficult to talk

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.795
about what your longer term
strategy is, but please

00:58:04.795 --> 00:58:06.439
at least have a
long-term strategy.

00:58:06.439 --> 00:58:08.730
The trouble having worked
for a long time in government

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.490
is everyone thinks there is
a conspiracy in government.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.910
To tell you the truth, it's
nearly always a cock-up.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.720
Because government doesn't
have the capacity to really

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.099
think about things.

00:58:18.099 --> 00:58:20.640
What I'd like to think is that
if someone would at least read

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.367
the conclusion of
the book, they might

00:58:22.367 --> 00:58:24.950
think about how they're going
to tackle ISIS in the long term.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:25.880
And a whole lot
of people would be

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.590
alive who would
otherwise be dead.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:29.510
DAVID BLACK: Thank you so much
for an absolutely fascinating

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:30.010
talk.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.360
[APPLAUSE]
