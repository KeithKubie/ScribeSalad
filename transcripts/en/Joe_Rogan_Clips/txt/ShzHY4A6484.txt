Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, the Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:03          you had a injury Yang here, like a million people asked me to talk about Ubi [inaudible] so I, um, I, you still support her at Uva. I think, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11          we're probably going to have to do something if I don't only argument against ubi in my eyes is human nature. The idea that we could possibly take all these people that have no idea where the next meal's coming from and eliminate that and always have a place to stay. And then from there on, you're on your own. Yeah. But that's what universal basic income essentially covers, covers food enough for food, right. You're not going to starve to death. You're not going to be rich. It's not like you could just live high on the hog, but you gotta wonder what the fuck the world looks like when we lose millions and millions and millions of jobs almost instantly due to automation.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Yeah. It's a, it's a really interesting question, especially with Andrew Ng's positions. So there's a lot of economics questions then ubi, I think the spirit of it, just like, I agree with you, we have to do something.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Yeah, the economic seem kind of questionable. Right? There's $1,000 a month. Is that what it is? I thought for him it's a thousand dollars thousand dollars a month for 300 million people. So it's difficult to, not to everybody. No, because the way I heard him explain it, everybody, if you're 18, if you're already getting some sort of welfare, you wouldn't get that thousand. You would get like the difference of the thousand. So if you're already taking money in some way, you just get like an extra 200 bucks, something like that. So the thousand gets factored in. Yeah. Yeah. So if you are wealthy, you get it too though. And you could opt out, right? That was the idea.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Yeah. So it's like, uh, like everything else, it's super messy. So what is the right, what is the right amount and how do we pay for it? And ultimately the problem is, uh, helping people, giving them financial grounding to find meaningful employment or just meaning in their life. And the, the main thing of a job isn't just the money. It's finding meaning and purpose and the re derive your identity from work. I mean that's, maybe that's one of the downsides of us, uh, human, human that the biology is, we kind of crave that meaning. And the question I, he has a lot of other ideas around besides just ubi, but ubi by itself does not simply provide that meaning. And that's a really difficult question of what do we do next? What kind of retraining, what kind of, how do we help people educate themselves over their life?

Speaker 2:          02:35          Right. And that's the real question. Yeah. This, the end and the, and the other balances. Any underlying all of this. So one of the things I disagree with it, uh, Andrew Yang on is the, the fearmongering, which I think in this culture we have, you have to do as a presidential candidate, that might be part of the game. But the, the mongering of saying that we should really be afraid of automation, that automation is going to take a lot of jobs. And from my understanding of the technology, from everything I see, that is not going to be as drastic or as fast as as he says. And, but then how much do you think he's exaggerating by in your estimation? He, well, he doesn't, I mean, not even exaggerating. What, what, how, how much do you differ on his prognosis? I think, I think he doesn't really provide significant, like a specific prognostics is, nobody knows it's a, there's a lot of uncertainty.

Speaker 2:          03:34          More about the spirit of the, the language used. I think AI will, technology, AI and automation will do a lot of good. The question is, it's a much deeper question about our society of that balances capitalism versus socialism and nobody, I don't think, if you're honest, it, capitalism is not bad. Socialism is not bad. You have to grab ideas from each. You have to, there you have to both reward the crazy broke, uh, entrepreneur who dreams of creating the next billion dollar startup that improves the world in some fundamental way. The Ilan Musk has been broken many times creating that startup. And you also have to empower the people who just lost their job because there were data entry, uh, their data entry job of some basic data manipulation data management that was just replaced by a piece of software. So that's, that's a social net that's needed. And the question is how do we balance that?

Speaker 2:          04:42          That doesn't have to do, that's not new, that's not new to Ai. And when the, the word automation is used, it's really not correctly attributing where the biggest changes will happen. It's not AI, it's simply technology of all kinds of software. It's pretty Dee Dee digitalization of information. So a data entry becoming much more, uh, much more automated, some basic repetitive tasks. Uh, I think, I think the questions there aren't about, so the enemy isn't there. First of all, there's no enemy, but it certainly isn't AI or automation because I think AI and automation will help make a help, make a better world and a salad. Your spokesperson for AI and automation. I am. I am. I am Anna for Ubi. I think I, I think we have to give fun people financial freedom to learn, like lifelong learning and flexibility to find meaningful employment. But like AI isn't the enemy. I see what you're saying. Um, but what do you think ever could be done

Speaker 1:          05:57          to give people meaning this, this meaning thing? I agree with you. Giving people just money enough to survive doesn't make them happy. And if you look at any dystopian movie about the future Mad Max instead, it's like, what is it? Society's Gone Fay wire and people are like ragamuffins running through the streets and everyone's dirty and that shooting each other and shit. Right? And that's what we're really worried about. Well, we're really worried about some crazy future where the rich people live in these like protected sky rises with helicopter circling over him and down in the bottom it's desert chaos, right? That's what we're worried about. So suddenly you'd be as a part of that. Uh, so providing some backing some what any kind of welfare program is a part of that, but also much more seriously looking at our broken education system throughout. Yes. I mean, it's just like, not blaming AI or technology, which are all inevitable developments, which I think will make a better world.

Speaker 1:          06:52          But saying we need to, uh, do lifelong learning education, make it a lifestyle, invest in it. Not Stupid, a rote learning memorization that we do. It's the sort of the way mathematics and engineering and chemistry, biology, the sciences, and even art is approached in high school and so on. But looking at education as a lifelong thing, finding passion and like that should be the big focus, the, the big investment. It's investing in the knowledge and development of knowledge of young people and everybody. So it's not learned to code. It's just learn. Mm. I couldn't agree more. And I also think you're always gonna have a problem with people just not doing a really good job of raising children and, you know, screwing them up and, you know, making kids, there's a lot, a lot of people out there that have terrible traumatic childhoods. There's just to fix that with universal basic income, just to say, oh, we're gonna give you $1,000 a month to hope are going to be happy.

Speaker 1:          07:55          I was, that's not going to fix that. You know, we have to figure out how to fix the whole human race. You know? And I think there's a very little effort that's put into thinking about how to prevent so much shitty parenting and how to prevent so many kids growing up in bad neighborhoods and poverty and crime and violence. And that's where a giant chunk of all of our, the momentum of this chaos that a lot of people carry with them into adulthood comes from, it comes from things beyond their control when they're young. And that is the struggle at the core of our society at the core of our country. That's bigger than raising humans. Yeah. Raising and educating humans making and you know, making a better world where people get along with each other better, where it's pleasing for all of us. Like we were talking about earlier, the thing that most of us agree on, at least to a certain extent.

Speaker 1:          08:52          So we enjoy people. We might not enjoy all of them, but there's the ones we enjoy, we enjoy, and you really don't enjoy being alone unless you're one of them. Ted Kaczynski type characters. All those people that are like, I'm alone or like fuck you. You are. Fuck you. You are. And you might like to spend some time alone. You don't want to be in solitary, man. He don't want to be alone in the forest with no one like Tom Hanks and cast away. You'll go fucking crazy. It's not good for you. It's just not. Yeah, people get annoying. Fuck yeah, I'm annoyed with me right now. Then listen to me for three hours. I'm annoyed with me. People get annoying, but we like each other. We really do. And the more we can figure out how to make it a better place for these people that got a shitty roll.

Speaker 1:          09:36          The dice that grew up in poverty, that grew up in crime, they grew up with abusive parents. The more we can figure out how to help them. And I don't know what that answer is, you know, but I suspect if we put enough resources to it, we could probably put a dent in it. At least if we really start thinking about at least it would put the conversation out there. Like he can't pretend that this is a just capitalism in this country when so many people were born like way far behind the game, like way, way fucked. I mean if you're growing up right now and you're in West Virginia in a fucking coal coal town and everyone's on pills and it's just chaos and crime and face tattoos and fucking get your teeth knocked out, what are you going to do? I don't want to hear any of that.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Bullshit man. Cause if you're growing up in an environment like that, you, you, you're so far behind and everyone around you is fucked up. And there's a lot of folks out there listening to this that can relate to that. If we don't do something about that. If we don't do something about the crime and the poverty and the chaos that so many people have to go through every day just to survive until we, we shouldn't be looking at anything else where all this traveling to other countries to fuck things up and metal here and metal there. We should be fixing this first. We're like a person who yells at someone for having a shitty lawn when our houses in array, full chaos plants growing everywhere. It's, it's goofy. We're goofy. We, we, we, we almost like are waking up in the middle of something that's already been in motion for hundreds of years and we were like, well, what do we do?

Speaker 1:          11:19          We, is this the right direction? We'd go, we, okay, we're flying in this spaceship, this spaceship earth, and in the middle of our lives we're just realizing that we are now the adults and that all the adults that are running everything on this planet are not that much different than you and I, not that much. I mean like Elon Musk is way smarter than me, but he's still human. You know what I mean? So he's probably fucked up too. So everybody's fucked up. The whole world is filled with these fucked up apes that are piloting this spaceship and you're waking up in the middle of thousands of years of history and no one knows if we've been doing it right along. We just know that got us to this point. So do we continue the same stupid fucking patterns or do we just take a step back and go, hey, how should we really do this? How should we do this? Because we, yeah, what do you got? Like 50 years left, 60 years left. We just kind of like hang on

Speaker 2:          12:11          to our rubles into the end. We're going to clutch our bag of gold in our bucket

Speaker 1:          12:16          diamonds. Is that what we're going to do? We're going to live in our mansions and fly around in our planes.

Speaker 2:          12:21          And I think, uh, through the decades now we've been developing a sense of empathy that allows us to understand that Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and uh, somebody in Texas, somebody in Russia, somebody in India, all suffer the same kinds of things all get lonely. I'll get desperate, all need each other and all need each other. And I think technology has a role to help. They're not hurt. Uh, but we need to first to first really acknowledge that we're all, we're all in this together and we need to solve the basic problems of humankind as opposed to investing in sort of keeping immigrants out or above law. These kinds of divisive kind of ideas as opposed to just investing in education, investing in infrastructure, investing in the people, uh, Ubi as part of that. That could be other totally different solutions. Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:21          [inaudible].
