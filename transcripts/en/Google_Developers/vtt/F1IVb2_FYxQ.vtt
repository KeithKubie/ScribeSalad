JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.610
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.090
We have a very exciting
show for you today.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.340
In fact, it's a little
more exciting

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.810
than what we expected.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.010
We are having a special guest
joining us from Helsinki.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.110
His name is Jussi Laakkonen.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.480
And he's the founder and
CEO of Applifier.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.310
How are you doing, Jussi?

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.060
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: I'm
doing very well.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.650
Thanks for having
me on the show.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.689
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you for staying late.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.720
I know it's late here
now in Helsinki.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.180
But we are very honored to have
you on our show because I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530
understand that the Nordic
countries is where the action

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.510
is in mobile nowadays.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.970
Is that true?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.360
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Well, there's
definitely a lot of excitement

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.000
in the area.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.520
You have companies like Rovio,
Supercell, King, and a number

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.350
of others that are creating
great games in the region and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.110
certainly kind of a break
out, if you will.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.790
Think of a region of just
15 million or so people.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.380
And basically, all the top
grossing spots on iOS are

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.739
being covered by Nordic games.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.695
So it's a great time to be
here working on games.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:07.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.710
So it's a great segue
to my next question.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.860
How did you come up with
the idea behind

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.710
Everyplay and Applifier?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.660
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Well Jarek, I
asked myself, how do I find

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.980
games for our mobile device?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.320
And, of course, I can
go to the app store.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.790
But it's pretty crowded.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.200
And it's kind of created
by somebody else.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.320
And when I really thought
about it, the answer was

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.580
pretty obvious that the best
games I ever found came

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.870
through a friend.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.770
I ask a friend.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.860
A friend tells me.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.350
Or even better, a
friend shows me.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.470
This is how I discovered a game
called Flight Control

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.380
like three years ago.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.570
And I'm still playing that
game after three years.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, great.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.510
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: But the
challenge with having a friend

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.790
pick up an iPhone and say like,
hey Jussi, you really

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.280
got to play this game, is that I
actually need to meet you in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.250
order to see that.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.980
So Everyplay is really about
taking that moment, oh gee,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.040
this game rocks.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.070
I want to show everyone.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.890
Or I'm doing so well
in this game.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.990
Look at me.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.470
And taking that moment and
making it shareable

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.050
by posting it online.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.539
So that's what Everyplay
really is.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.140
It's about digitizing word of
mouth and making it shareable.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
traditionally, this type of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.950
sharing use case has already
been done in console

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.900
games and PC games.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930
We have a lot of that type
of content on YouTube.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.170
It's extremely popular.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.610
So how is mobile different?

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.730
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Mobile
is different in a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.530
good number of ways.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.950
First of all, these devices are
considerably lower power

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.676
than your average high-end
PC gaming rig.

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:40.900
On a PC, you have quite a lot
of horsepower to spare for

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.170
video recording.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.350
Whereas on a mobile device, it's
actually a pretty hard

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.440
engineering problem to
make it go fast.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.280
Also what's very different from
PC is that on a PC you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.150
can actually download a separate
software, like Fraps,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.300
to record another software.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.450
Whereas on an iOS
and Android, the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.710
applications are sandboxed.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.720
What this means is that another
application cannot

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.790
access the contents of
another application.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.830
So you actually cannot have
a general purpose

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.200
screen casting tool.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.800
Instead, what we do is we
provide an SDK that's easily

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.870
integrated into the games and
provides a seamless instant

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.580
replay and sharing solution.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.630
So is it fair to say that for
most of the PC titles today,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.220
the videos that we see on
YouTube are basically captured

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.490
using third party software,
edited locally, and then

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.400
uploaded to YouTube?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.280
Whereas with mobile, the way
forward is to really

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.524
incorporate this functionality
directly into the game?

00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.020
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: That's
absolutely true.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.500
And it's a function of the
limitations or say

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.910
restrictions and protections
of the iOS and Android

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.400
operating systems.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.570
And also I think what's
interesting, as you mentioned,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.630
it's very popular.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.600
Let's Play videos are
hugely popular.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
And walkthroughs as well as
reviews by user are extremely

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.850
influential on YouTube.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.740
And what that really speaks to
is that even though making of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.800
these videos is not trivial, you
need to have the software.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.170
You need to record and edit
separately and then upload.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.090
There's a lot of people
doing it.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.810
And what we are aiming to do for
mobile is to simplify this

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.360
by making it a completely
transparent part of the game.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.570
So you play the game.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.460
And you get a replay.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.420
You don't think about that, oh,
I need a tool for this.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.030
Or I want to do a replay.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.140
Instead, you just get it.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.520
And you can easily share
it or comment on it or

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.380
put it out to YouTube.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.320
And I think that's really going
to unlock a number of

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.750
creators that would not have
done it on PC because the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.030
tools were too complicated.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.390
So the discover use case and
distribution use case is

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.470
definitely very important.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.930
And I can totally see how this
is going to help mobile game

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.340
developers.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.730
So maybe we should switch gears
now and have you show us

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.290
a little bit more about
your product.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.960
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Definitely.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.380
So let's jump into a screen
share from my iPhone 5.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.890
And hopefully this
comes through.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.380
So I'm going to show you
a demo of a very

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.940
high-end Unity 4 game.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.550
And I apologize in advance that
this is going to be a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.620
little choppy over hangout.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.250
This actually runs
at 30 frames per

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.260
second on my device.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.920
So right now we are not yet
recording this game.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.440
And as I tap this button, we are
now recording this game.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.000
And there's actually zero
difference on the frame rate

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.770
on this game.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.940
And we cannot really see it on
this live hangout because of

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.460
the way hangouts work.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.600
But I encourage you to
go to everyplay.com

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.030
to see it for yourself.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.390
So I'm going to stop the
recording now and open up our

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.220
editor user interface.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.600
So the editor here shows the
replay that was just captured.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.390
And we can even comment on
that by adding a forward

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.500
facing camera that actually
shows me.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.490
So this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.140
I'm in a Hangout that shows
me from my iPhone

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.740
AirPlay to the Hangout.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.530
So this is ability for us to add
a video commentary by the

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.940
player himself into the
game he's playing.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.810
It's actually very exciting
because that takes the video

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.650
of the game play into
a personal story.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.620
So this here was Unity.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.740
We also work with a number
of game engines.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.290
You can use Everyplay with
Cocoas a custom engine.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.920
And most recently we've actually
added support for

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.410
even Unreal Engine.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.590
And unfortunately, I don't have
the demo for an Unreal

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.650
Engine game on my phone.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.700
But instead, I want to show you
a very popular game right

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.130
now called Nimble Quest.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.510
And Nimble Quest is made by a
company called NimbleBit who

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.510
are best known for games like
Tiny Towers and Pocket Planes.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.010
They are a small studio out of
San Diego where they've been

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.410
extremely successful.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.740
And this is their latest game
that was featured by Apple and

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.100
is out today actually
on Android.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.800
So you should get it from
the Google Play Store.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.940
So this game plays a little like
the original snake game.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.720
And this may be a little
small on the screen.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.680
But what happens here is that
I'm controlling this snake

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.010
made out of my heroes.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.680
And I'm trying to kill
the monsters.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.690
And as I move around, this game
is actually capturing the

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.750
replay as it happens.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.800
So there is no action the
user needs to take.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.910
Instead, the capture is
done automatically.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.670
And now, just for the purpose
of this demo, I'm going to

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.590
kill my snake and die
here miserably.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.800
And you can see on the top
left-hand corner, there's a

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.160
button called Share Replay.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.140
And this is the replay of the
game play we just created.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.100
So it was captured in the
background while the game

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.200
played without performance
impact.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.300
And now as the user, I can
easily share this with my

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.860
friends and other game players
through Everyplay.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.080
So we're going to do that
now live on air.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.440
So I'm tapping on
Share Replay.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.920
And this opens up Everyplay.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.740
And this is the Share screen.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.560
So we're going to give
this a title.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:14.090
Let's say YouTube Developer
Live On Air.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.470
And let's use a hashtag to
organize this contact.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.010
We'll call it Jarek because
this is a fan to

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.020
be there for Jarek.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.380
And we're going to share it to
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.980
I'm not going to send this in an
email because you all know

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.890
how email sharing works.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.179
But we'll see it being shared
to all distributed networks.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.336
So I'm going to tap on Share.

00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:41.330
And what happens is that the
upload starts in the

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.090
background.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.320
And now I can share
it to Facebook.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.450
And I'm going to share this
publicly on Facebook.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.530
And we can post it.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.900
And we're going to send it out
as a tweet, going live

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.930
on air right now.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.160
And because I was already
connected to YouTube, this

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.060
actually has been uploaded
to YouTube also.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.480
So right now we're looking at
Everyplay's social interface.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.920
So this is me on Everyplay.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.230
We use a nickname system with
the follower paradigm.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.910
So here are people I'm following
who follow me.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.870
And here's my previous
actions.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.440
So I'm going to go out and
demonstrate a little bit about

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.420
Everyplay's social functions as
the video is being encoded

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.770
on our servers.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.910
So this here is my home
feed, people I

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.940
follow, and their actions.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.480
So I can see the replays
from cool games

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.170
that they're playing.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.080
So let's find out something
interesting here.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.210
Let's see.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.390
OK, here's a BMX game.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.910
So let's check out this game.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:54.260
So we're currently streaming it
down from our servers and

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.010
then playing back on my iPhone
and then playing back to you

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.760
over the hangout.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.960
So here's a BMX game.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.570
This was captured by another
player, shared on Everyplay,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.090
potentially Facebook, Twitter,
and YouTube.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.740
And we can see the game play
right here on Everyplay.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.600
And we provide a number of
social functions like ability

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.850
to comment.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.100
And so that's my comment.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.280
I misspelled it nicely.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.500
You can obviously Like videos.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.850
You can re-share videos.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.820
So if you find something cool, I
could re-share it to YouTube

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.610
under my own account.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.120
And obviously, because everybody
is geared towards

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.740
discovering content, we also
provide an app store but on a

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.730
straight beam social
interface.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.610
And you can just install the
game that you've discovered

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.770
straight through Everyplay.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.840
And also for game developers who
provide an ability to do

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.210
community management through
Everyplay, so this is the

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.990
games community management
page.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.540
All the videos that have ever
been shared from this game are

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.640
visible here.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.310
And the community manager of
this game could also re-share

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.450
these videos to YouTube
or Facebook or

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.060
Twitter, for that matter.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.950
So Everyplay provides basically
a fully flexed

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.630
social infrastructure around
mobile gaming and is geared

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.870
towards connecting the fans
of the games together.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:23.210
So why don't we now see if my
video has completed encoding.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.320
So here's the video that
we just uploaded.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.810
Let's see if it's
been encoded.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:29.330
There we go.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.330
So it's been encoded.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.960
And we can see it's YouTube
Developers Live

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.850
On Air hashtag Jarek.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.570
And we are now streaming it down
from our servers to play

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.090
it back on this device.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.700
And here it goes.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.990
So this is the capture
we just did.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.620
We uploaded while we talked.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.550
And it's now live, available for
anybody to check out why

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.220
this game is cool.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.240
And as you may recall, we
shared it to Facebook,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.450
Twitter, and YouTube.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.370
So let's first open
up Facebook.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.210
And this is my personal
Facebook account.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.210
So you can see all of
my gory details.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.420
And as you can see here, we have
YouTube Developers Live

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.300
On Air featuring Jarek.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.640
And we could watch the video.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:09.870
See?

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.540
It's ready to go.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.570
And you can click to download
from the app store.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.250
And let's see if I have
Twitter open.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.840
I don't yet have Twitter open.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.280
So let's open up Twitter.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.065
And I'm going to go
to my tweets.

00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:26.590
As you can see, YouTube
Developers Live On Air.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.610
We support also Twitter cards.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.500
So you can play directly from
Twitter to watch this reply.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.160
And of course, most
importantly, we

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.300
also support YouTube.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.160
So I'm going to go into--

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.332
these are my uploads.

00:12:41.332 --> 00:12:43.080
Now let's see if it made
it to YouTube.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.130
Yes, it made it to YouTube.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.980
But it says that this video
is being processed.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.655
So that's on YouTube.

00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:49.350
The videos already
been uploaded.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.130
But we can watch an earlier
upload I did from Nimble Quest

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.630
as I was testing this about
10 minutes ago.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.560
So here's the replay.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.160
So this is a very seamless
system that enables the

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.630
players to share their best
replays, connect socially on

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.160
services like YouTube,
Facebook, and

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.710
Twitter within Everyplay.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.650
And that's it.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.010
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.570
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Hope you
enjoyed the demo.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
this was great.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.230
Thank you for doing this.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.560
So let's talk a little bit more
about how this system is

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.040
implemented.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.660
So can you tell us a little
more about the

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.086
technology behind it?

00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:24.020
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: So certainly
there are a couple of

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.800
components with this.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.600
One is the SDK that goes
inside the game.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.190
And that's a native iOS code
that we provide in the various

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.600
plug-ins for Unity, Cocoas,
Unreal Engine 3, and custom

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.695
game engines.

00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:42.020
We are also hard at work with
our Android version.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.550
And we hope to give you news
about that in the not too

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.270
distant future.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That
sounds great.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.760
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: That actually
captures the game play.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.760
And then we have our server side
which runs on a Note GS

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.400
Mobile DB on the various
service and CDNs.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.470
And basically, that's where the
videos are uploaded to.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.220
And the whole social interface
you saw is all HTML5.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.775
So there is no separate
Everyplay app right now.

00:14:06.775 --> 00:14:09.750
It's all HTML5, all the social
stuff we looked at.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:15.840
And we provide that on desktop
browsers, mobile browsers as

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.620
we looked at within Facebook
within Twitter.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.450
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, great.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.050
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: And then we
provide integration to

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.630
services like YouTube where
we upload the video.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.610
It's always uploaded to the
user's own account on YouTube.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.370
So we want the users
to be stars.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.355
And so they can have them
on their own channels.

00:14:32.355 --> 00:14:32.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.060
Yeah, this is definitely the
approach that we recommend.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.850
We also find that these videos
are more likely to go viral

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.100
because users have an incentive
to actually share

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.710
their achievements.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.640
So this fits the use
case quite well.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.110
So how do you use
the YouTube API?

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.260
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Excuse me.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.820
You were breaking up a little.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: My question
was, how do you use the

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:53.850
YouTube API?

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.320
Can you tell a bit more
about how you use it?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.100
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: So we have
a server-to-server

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.150
connection to YouTube.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.530
So we use that for--

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:08.150
first, the user authenticates
himself with OAuth2 to

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
authenticate that he has
a YouTube account

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.100
and ability to publish.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.900
And we store that access
keys after that.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.320
And as we have the video on
the server, we use our

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.950
server-to-server integration to
YouTube service to upload

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.120
the video after it's been
encoded on our service.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Got it.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.650
So the token is obtained
on the client.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.140
So this is something that the
OAuth flow is executed on the

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.530
mobile device.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.130
And then the refresh token is
sent to the server side.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.730
And then the video is uploaded
on behalf of the user using an

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.460
access token that is obtained
from the refresh token that

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.550
you have actually obtained
on the client.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.430
Is that correct?

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.806
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Correct.

00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:44.560
That's correct.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.815
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:47.330
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: And we don't
directly uploaded from a

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.730
client to YouTube because
we also do

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.890
moderation on these videos.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.710
And we have certain safeguards
in place to make sure that the

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.670
content is PG-13, if you will.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.600
And that's why we do the
re-encoding on the server side

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.780
and the security checks on the
server side and then upload

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.810
from the service.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.490
This also means that the user,
if he is sharing to multiple

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.950
services, he only needs
to upload once.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.900
And as we provide a
services-like background

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.450
uploading, then the video upload
will complete even if

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.360
the user exits the
application.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:16.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.320
And then are you using YouTube
API v2 or v3 for the upload?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.700
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: We're currently
using version two.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.010
But we're very excited by the
opportunity that version 3 is

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.370
opening up.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.430
So we're very much looking
forward to migrating to that.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.250
And we have big plans to
leverage the data API on

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.180
YouTube because I think there
are great things you can build

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.430
with that, play lists, do a
feature that kind of creates

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.790
the content of your channel.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.880
And we're really on the
early stages of that.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.740
We first wanted to enable
the sharing for players.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.120
And now the next step is kind of
creating that content into

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.260
interesting playlists,
organizing that by games, and

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.230
enabling games to find
their audiences.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.990
So we're excited about the
new version three API.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.160
And I think the YouTube audience
will appreciate easy

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.180
way to find this content,
especially if you're talking

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.070
about [? queue ration ?]

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:02.810
and play list management.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.310
I think that's all very
important for game developers.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.220
Because once the content is
out there, how do you help

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.010
users find it?

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.250
And definitely the
[? queue ration ?]

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.700
is the right way
to approach it.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.010
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: We also
leverage metadata so our

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.800
developers can specify a number
of arrivals, some

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.510
public, some private, that's
used to navigate these videos.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.580
And we also are publishing I
think most of that, if not

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.800
all, to YouTube.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.450
And the goal is to really enable
rich search abilities

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.170
within YouTube.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.510
So one question that I typically
like to ask is,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.410
while you were developing
your product or the API

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.670
integration, was there anything
that surprised you,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.000
like things that you really
didn't anticipate about your

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.200
users or about the API?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.290
Any lessons learned that
you would be willing

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.876
to share with us?

00:17:54.876 --> 00:17:56.910
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: I think what
we did right is that we

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.870
actually got in touch with the
YouTube team pretty early on.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.880
And a few of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.010
were actually covered in our
first introductory course,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.200
like the authentication
flow and the best

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.870
practices for that.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.960
If we hadn't known about those,
it probably would have

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.370
been something that we'd been
scratching our head around a

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.980
little bit.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.760
But because we took the
proactive approach and we got

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.910
good support from the YouTube
Developers team, I would say

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.720
that we really didn't run into
anything that was kind of an,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.025
oh, that's really weird.

00:18:24.025 --> 00:18:26.560
But it's more like, hmm, OK,
I'll read the documentation,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.810
which is actually what Google
really shines on in my opinion

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.060
is the documentation
is exemplary.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.550
So we had actually
a very easy time

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.310
implementing the YouTube API.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good
to hear that.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.060
I will definitely pass this on
to our colleague Andy who

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.405
works on our documentation, gets
a lot of praise for it,

00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:43.965
and that he's doing
an excellent job.

00:18:43.965 --> 00:18:46.520
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: I wish
ours would be as good.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So any API
features that you wish we had

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.940
and they're not there yet?

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.730
Like, what are the next
things that you think

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.010
we should be pursuing?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.760
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Well, I think
when you look at a lot of the

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.350
gaming videos, there's quite a
lot of annotations going on.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.150
And that would be certainly
something eventually to be

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.710
able to allow players or
programs to annotate videos.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.370
So that would be certainly
something that we would be

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.240
looking forward to do because I
think that doing it manually

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.450
for videos, this requires
more manpower than a

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.440
small startup has.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.070
That is definitely, I would say,
on top of my wish list.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.290
And there are almost always
improvements that

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.000
you can look for.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.100
But that would be kind of
a thing I'm looking for.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.040
And I think I'm very excited
to also see [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.090
live-streaming APIs coming out
and all the possibilities that

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.200
that opens up to content
creators.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.670
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.000
So let's switch to
our questions.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.490
I see we have a question
from a viewer live on

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.090
YouTube about Android.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.580
And you touched about that
earlier in the show.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.190
And the question is, when
is Everyplay going to be

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.000
available in Android?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.220
I'm sure you get that a lot.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.060
So anything to add to what
you've previously stated?

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.110
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: So we met
with a lot of developers.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.300
I would say close to 1,000
developers at GDC last week.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.520
And we had nearly 10
people in staff and

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.250
did a lot of evidence.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.270
And if there were one thing that
was above anything else

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.100
that was requested
was Android.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.140
The good news is that we are
already at a working prototype

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.620
on Android.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.530
So things are running.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.830
It's not [INAUDIBLE] hey,
we hope this will work.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.210
We know it works.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.480
And I think with Android the
key thing we're working on

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.920
right now is device
recommendation.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.550
And there's quite a few very
popular GPUs on Android that

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.580
you need to support in order
to have a viable solution.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.220
So our goal right now is to have
a broad enough support

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.370
that we can launch a beta
version of Android in not too

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.730
distant future.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.250
Unfortunately, I cannot give a
time frame because every GPU

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.310
is a little bit of a challenge
of its own.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.220
And getting to high enough
penetration on the kind of

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.600
devices that you would expect
people to be playing on, it's

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.480
something that we're
still working on.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.000
So it's definitely I would say
our number one priority.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.270
We are already on it.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.340
The prototype is running.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.570
Things are looking good.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.090
And now we can just conquer
the fragmentation.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.450
Thank you for this
detailed answer.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.740
And I think we're all anxiously

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.712
awaiting Android support.

00:21:08.712 --> 00:21:09.640
I'm an Android user.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.660
So definitely would like
to try it out.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.630
So another question is for me.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.170
Is YouTube Developer
Relations hiring?

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.300
And the answer is, yes,
we are hiring.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.340
Google Developer Relations as
well as YouTube Developer

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.950
Relations is hiring.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.230
To learn more go to
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.150
And you can learn all about
it right there.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.140
Well, thank you very
much, Jussi.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.730
I know it's getting late
right now in Helsinki.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.310
Thank you very much for
joining our show.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.190
And then looking forward to see
the new features coming

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.260
out of Applifier and sharing
my game play with the games

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.970
that you have integrated with.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.050
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: And you're
going to be sharing on

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.110
YouTube, obviously.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Absolutely.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.076
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: And that's
going to be awesome.

00:21:47.076 --> 00:21:47.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.270
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Thanks
for having me.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.645
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And thank
you for watching.

00:21:49.645 --> 00:21:50.480
See you next week.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.310
JUSSI LAAKKONEN: Bye.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Bye.
