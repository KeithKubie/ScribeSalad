that way
that's it it looks at from a different

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960
that's it it looks at from a different
 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.570
that's it it looks at from a different
point of view of how did this get

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580
point of view of how did this get
 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.340
point of view of how did this get
started and how it can get twisted how

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
started and how it can get twisted how
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.030
started and how it can get twisted how
other people can get sucked into it and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
other people can get sucked into it and
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.310
other people can get sucked into it and
you know how something so miniscule can

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320
you know how something so miniscule can
 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.990
you know how something so miniscule can
turn to something so large if you wet it

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000

wasn't good but this is literally
 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.600
wasn't good but this is literally
everything that's been building up to

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
everything that's been building up to
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.630
everything that's been building up to
and it did have an ending it had a good

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:44.640
and it did have an ending it had a good
 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.190
and it did have an ending it had a good
ending in a smart ending and then they

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.200
ending in a smart ending and then they
 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.020
ending in a smart ending and then they
added that on top of it it just wasn't

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.030
added that on top of it it just wasn't
 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.800

needed uh and I was trying to get around
like some sort of philosophical way that

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.570
like some sort of philosophical way that
 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.750
like some sort of philosophical way that
this ending can be justified and I just

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:56.760
this ending can be justified and I just
 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.740
this ending can be justified and I just
can't do it
