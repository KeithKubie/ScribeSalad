1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,380
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,410
All right. So let's shift to your
new book, living with the monks.

3
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,050
I want to get the, the subtitle
totally right here cause I love it.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,980
What turning off my phone
taught me about happiness,

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,220
gratitude and focus. So we
are taping this right now. Uh,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,560
we're holding it for a little bit because
I want to air this right before I go

7
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:26,800
off the grid because my audience knows
I do this August off the grid thing.

8
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:31,630
Literally lock my phone in his safe.
No phone, no TV, no electronics,

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,180
no nothing.
I'm going to work on my book a little bit.

10
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,220
I'll probably escape to
a beach for a little bit.

11
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm not even totally sure
what I'm going to do,

12
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,160
but just get off the
endless information grid.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,830
So before we talk about me and
why I think it's good to do that.

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,800
What led you to wanting to
do this in the first place?

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,830
Well, I'd spent, I'd invested so much
in the physical side from my whole life,

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,131
you know,

17
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:59,990
running marathons and doing
endurance events and had a
navy seal move in with me.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,240
But I really had felt like I had neglected
the inner side and just the inner

19
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:09,740
work and I was just going so fast.
So I felt too to really,

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
again, maybe I'm turning
all their, I don't know,

21
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:17,081
but to get the whole package or that
what I want and be as well rounded.

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,020
I really needed that side. There's
the spiritual side. And um,

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,350
and I was just thinking like,
well who would be the best teacher?

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,880
And I thought monks and I didn't know
anything about monks other than like

25
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,300
watching some movies, you know,
fringe articles here and there.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,420
I thought that'd be really
cool to learn about, you know,

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,640
the traditions and how
amongst lived their lives.

28
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,550
And I'm doing exactly what
you said. You know, I'm,

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,610
I'm bombarded by information and
I don't spend any time alone.

30
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,760
And when you don't spend time alone,
you lose your super power,

31
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:53,570
use your intuition because you're being
influenced by everybody else and your

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,590
exercise, your gut muscle.
I was losing my superpower.

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,920
So I said to Sarah, I think
I want to go. And, and

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,580
was there a moment that you really felt
that you had lost it or that you could

35
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,780
really recognize that you lost it?

36
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,910
Because I think a lot of people walk
around with that all the time now.

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,740
I just felt just cause
the endless social media,

38
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:13,370
you're so hit with stuff
constantly that it does make your,

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,960
your sort of inner monologue
sort of harder to listen
to because it's just being

40
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,800
slammed in every way.

41
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,710
It was a buildup. I just felt so
distracted. Yeah. And you know,

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,330
we all feel overwhelmed. I mean, but I
felt really distracted and I felt like,

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,620
you know, I have four kids
a job, I'm married friends,

44
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,320
my parents are getting older.
I mean all these different things.

45
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,240
And then all these different social media
things and news and Netflix and Hulu

46
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,330
and the, a little bit about, I'm
like, I just want to, like, I got to,

47
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:47,210
I wouldn't be alone. And so
it was a buildup. And then we,

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,840
my wife and I were talking
about it as I just want to,

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,770
I'm going to go and live in a monastery.
And she was super encouraging, you know,

50
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,880
and she was like, um, so,
so that's what happened.

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,980
So what do you, do you give a call, you,

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,560
you to say, is this a
Yelp thing? Yeah. Uh,

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,280
yes. Siri. I, um,

54
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,380
I actually found this monastery through
a friend of mine who was actually my

55
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:15,430
publisher and a,
I went to a monastery with eight months,

56
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,570
which already was a misconception for
me cause I thought monastery meant

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,250
community meant hundreds,

58
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,270
but there were eight months at this
particular monastery for which had been

59
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,560
there for 50 years. Wow. And they
lived on 500 acres in the states,

60
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,660
but in isolation, 500 acres. And
similar to what you're about to do in,

61
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:38,470
in August or now, um, you
know, no phone, no Internet,

62
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,590
no news, no this, no that. Uh,

63
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,700
and I just took 15 days to decompress.
So what was it like?

64
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,180
So you get there day one, I mean,
what was the most shocking part?

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,130
I got sent to a pretty open guy.

66
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,310
So there was probably not much that can
shock you, but like what do they say?

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,240
Do they like take all your stuff? First
of all, they were Russian Orthodox.

68
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,560
They weren't Buddhists like that arrest.
I didn't,

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,240
I had no expectation of anything.

70
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,560
And um,
I walked into my room,

71
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,830
which they call cell, that's the
rooms are called sales and monastery.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,250
And it was the size of this carpet,
like where we are. And I had a bed,

73
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,260
one little desk with a light
and brother, uh, Christopher,

74
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,340
who was like my Goto monk,
uh, sat me down and he said,

75
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,360
tomorrow at 7:00 AM we'll
start with prayer, reflect,

76
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,040
reflection and meditation. And
I said, okay, it's 6:00 PM,

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,280
you know, what do I do next? 13 hours.

78
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,310
And he looked at me and he said,
you think?

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,730
And I said,
okay.

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,050
And he left the room and I realized like,
I can't call my wife,

81
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,920
I can't, there's no books in my
room. I mean, they had books,

82
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,870
but there are no books. There's
no like, it's super like eerie,

83
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:59,320
quiet. Yeah. And I'm like, all right,
I'm going to, I'm going to meditate.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,370
Let me start the journey. I took a
TM, transcendental meditation course,

85
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,140
set my timer for 20 minutes,

86
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,610
and I sat in my chair and I started to
close my eyes, focused on the mantra.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,200
And, um, I'm getting bombarded on,
well, how am I kids, my wife, you know,

88
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,340
the hawks are going to be, what are
we going to do this shit, you know,

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,130
everything's going through my head and
I will talk about the hawks were window

90
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,290
by the way. I'm sitting and I'm going
and I'm like, why hasn't my beeper beep?

91
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,260
Cause I've been here forever. And
I'm like, I probably didn't start it.

92
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,180
So I let me just keep going, keep going.
And finally there's no beep. And I said,

93
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,810
well, let me just reset my beeper
and I'll start over. No, I go back.

94
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,620
That will be cheating anyway. I mean
my chair forever. And I finally like,

95
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:41,650
this is ridiculous. I'll just let
me reset this and start this again.

96
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:46,000
I opened up my eyes, I look at my time
or three minutes and 27 seconds. Wow.

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
And I am really calculated how many
minutes I have left on the monastery.

98
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,130
I did 15 days times 24 times.
And I was like,

99
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,280
I just said to myself,
I'm fucked. Like this is,

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,090
this is great on paper in theory,

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,680
but this is going to be fucking hard.

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,540
And I just sat in my room and I was like,
oh my God,

103
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,260
why did I get myself into where
you allowed to leave the room?

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,130
I can leave the room. Um, I
couldn't leave the property.

105
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,960
This is the craziest situation.

106
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,500
So the monks to keep the
lights on at the monastery,

107
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,960
they breed German shepherds.

108
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,490
So there are 11 adult German shepherds,
eight monks.

109
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,380
And so they're selling German shepherds.
Yes. They sell puppies. That's,

110
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:41,380
and they trained dogs. They're
world renown dog trainers. World's,

111
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,870
they've written books. They've sold
millions of copies of books. They're just,

112
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,410
it's just a really unusual scenarios.
So yes,

113
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,700
I could leave myself and walk around
the monastery, but first of all,

114
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:56,030
it's four degrees outside.
It's P, there's no lights.

115
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,780
It's like pitch dark at four o'clock.
It's freezing.

116
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,350
There's bear according to the monks like,
so no, I really couldn't leave them.

117
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,310
Right. So I mean I just kinda like, um,

118
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,670
I ended up walking 120 miles up and down
the driveway they had because I had to

119
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,300
get some exercise over the course of my
journey, but I didn't, I didn't leave. So,

120
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,420
um,
I just sat there and you know,

121
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,370
the first five to s five days was really,
really difficult for me.

122
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,760
And I started immediately doing
probably what I think most people do.

123
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,980
Certainly what I do,
I started giving myself an out.

124
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,960
I started justifying that it would
be okay to go home early jazz,

125
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,760
seven days, man, that's enough. Get out
of here in seven days. No one's gonna say,

126
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,920
Oh, you didn't do whatever. Just,

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,220
and I started creating all these excuses
in my head and I started thinking

128
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,750
myself like,

129
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,200
what are the goals do I have in areas
of my life and my giving excuses in,

130
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,933
you know,

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,530
and really started like analyze everything
that was going through my head and

132
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:03,920
put it into out the,
the real my real world.

133
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,390
And I just saw a lot of things
about myself, you know, through the,

134
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,160
through just being quiet and alone.

135
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,880
How did you break through that moment
of I can get away with seven days here.

136
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,130
Like what was the actual
thing that turned down on it?

137
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,460
I have a two words that changed my
life that I refer back to all the time.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,240
And um, the, when I wanted to go
home, those two words were like,

139
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,450
I signed up 15 days.
That's what,

140
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,390
that's what this goal was 15 days.

141
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,560
Day five when I really want to go home
and I missed my kids and I couldn't call

142
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,300
them. You know, the two words are,

143
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:43,301
remember tomorrow when you have a big
split second decision or a big major

144
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:47,300
decision, how, how is that decision
going to make you feel tomorrow?

145
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,370
So I said to myself,

146
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,270
if I drop out and quit now the one
time I'm going to do this in my life,

147
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,610
how am I going to feel about this tomorrow
when I get home? When someone says,

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,470
how'd you do? Did you make
it terrible? You know, if I,

149
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,250
my legs are swollen at mile 18 I want to
drop out of the race. So the marathon,

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,220
but I don't want to come home. And the
next day after the New York Marathon,

151
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,710
did you finish?
So remember tomorrow.

152
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,040
So I just kind of said that
to myself over and over,

153
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,580
like just remember how you gonna feel
about this and remember how proud you are

154
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:22,110
going to feel at the end of the journey.
And before I went, my wife said,

155
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,040
don't leave until you have a
breakthrough. You're broken. And I'm like,

156
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,910
I'm not broken. And I haven't
had a breakthrough. I'm saying,

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
so did you get broken
or have a breakthrough?

158
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,510
You know, it's funny. I
have to, I know the answer,

159
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,460
at least the one I had some breakthroughs
for sure, but I never felt broken.

160
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,140
And I think,

161
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,470
I think the reason I never felt broken
is because it has a definitive end date.

162
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,423
Yeah.

163
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,890
So broken for you would have been like,
I'm leaving.

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,530
Okay. Would it be like, yeah. It would
have to really take me to a place of,

165
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,050
you know? Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,030
I mean I had moments of being broken
and Super Sad. I mean, you know,

167
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:03,790
like when you're away from everything
and you don't know what's going on,

168
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,650
you just don't know.

169
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:10,030
You don't know God on my kids getting
bullied or something happening is my wife.

170
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:10,864
Okay.

171
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,150
You know is the world in risk is you
just don't know and you start to imagine

172
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,870
that the world's going to end.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,980
I think your brain automatically goes to
the words, it doesn't go to everything.

174
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,450
It's great. It's like, Oh shit,

175
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:28,030
I should've been so much nicer than
my wife because I'm going to go there.

176
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,710
She's not going to be
home when I get home.

177
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,030
Like you start sticking shit like that
and then it just spirals because you have

178
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,620
energy and space to think and imagine
and dream and envision and all the shit

179
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,310
that's like,
it all comes to the surface and you know,

180
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,670
cause it's in the real world.
If you're having a tough day,

181
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,360
you could say to Dave, you, you, you,
you guys were like, you know what?

182
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,770
Let's put on a movie and Netflix and
just so fucking escape. And you sit down,

183
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,740
you order Chinese food and you
have your Netflix and you watch it.

184
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:03,940
But guess what, the issues don't
go away when the movie's over.

185
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,580
That shit is still there.
Now your to do list.

186
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,400
They're still there when I'm
watching Netflix itself, right.

187
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,140
They're still there and you know,
this forced you, there was no escape.

188
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,940
This was your escape.

189
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,380
So it forced me to have to think through
stuff and I got a lot of clarity.

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,990
You know, it's funny, although
this is in no way comparable.

191
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:26,170
When I did my off the great thing
last year and half for a week,

192
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,240
we were at 10 days or so,
we were in Mexico and I just,

193
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:32,500
I just needed to do nothing.
I just needed to wake up every morning,

194
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,350
have a light breakfast. I went to the
gym and then I would just sit there.

195
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:40,000
I got the same seat at the beach every
day and I would just sit and stare at the

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,350
ocean for hours,
really for hours and I'd do all that,

197
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,600
try to do a little meditation and stuff.
Um,

198
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,330
but I did have that moment at
one point where I was like,

199
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,770
anything could be happening right now.

200
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,830
Like World War three could be starting
there, you know, terror attack. Like boom,

201
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,360
you know, Zombie, like where do
you go to like the craziest shit.

202
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,950
And then I remember thinking,
I was like, you know,

203
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:00,100
you go there for awhile and
then I suddenly got to the
end of it and I was like,

204
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:04,480
well nothing I could do about it
right now. So I better reset to this,

205
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,600
to this better place.
And there's a real discipline in that in,

206
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,910
in how you can control your
mind and your thoughts.

207
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,150
I think the F for sure for the first
three or four days there I was obsessed

208
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,840
with my to do list and by
day four or five I'm like,

209
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,020
if a hurricane came and whisked
my to do list into the ocean,

210
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,430
life goes on. Like I'll be
okay. Yeah. And you know, I was,

211
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,200
I was like a captive to my
to do list because you know,

212
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,570
I'm always, and it's
my to do list. For me.

213
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:40,400
It wasn't even about finishing the tasks
as good as I could possibly do them.

214
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,900
It was about finishing up so I can keep,

215
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,520
it felt so good to cross them off that
even if it was 70% to what I could

216
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:50,030
probably do it onto the next,
onto the next,

217
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,130
onto the next at the monastery. The
the, the most only had to do list.

218
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,900
There was no to do list.

219
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,280
It was whatever is in front
of me is my task at hand.

220
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,330
So tell me a little bit just
sort of what that day looks like.

221
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,750
So you get up the next morning,
now it's day two.

222
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,900
So Day seven did you say 7:00 AM or
6:00 AM 7:00 AM and then prayer starts?

223
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,690
Yeah, so they would ring a big, a
big like Notre Dame, Notre Dame.

224
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:19,330
We like Church and val loud.
I was right next to which was the,

225
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,380
which signals to go to the,
to the church where they,

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,100
we would have a bout an
hour and a half service,

227
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,050
which was meditation,

228
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,960
reflection service that w
was it religious in any way?

229
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,660
They were Russian Orthodox. It was,
it was a religion. It was religious.

230
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,400
For me it was, it was peaceful.
Um, but it was definitely,

231
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:47,980
it's definitely religious. And then,
and then we would shift to, um,

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,480
breakfast, which was traditionally
silent. Most of those breakfast,

233
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,600
the breakfasts were silent
and that would go to,

234
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,830
let's say nine 30 or 10 and afterwards,
that'd be a little bit of alone time.

235
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,940
And then it would go to tasks and each
of the monks would have a different

236
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,210
responsibility,
which was just unbelievably efficient.

237
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,310
And I spend each day shadowing a different
long, so I got two rounds basically.

238
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,840
Uh, and then there would be supper.
Dinner was lunch time, so they flip flop.

239
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,940
So breakfast was a really light meal,
which for me is just fruit. Then lunch,

240
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,910
their lunch was dinner.
That would be the big meal rest.

241
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,590
Or if like sleep away camp you go
less rest time we will see more labor,

242
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,890
which could be cleaning the church,
doing something,

243
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,240
whatever the everyone's tasks where,
yeah.

244
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,900
Did they always have stuff to do? Cause
I, it's, it's like, it's kind of funny,

245
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:40,300
like if you think about it, like, all
right, so eight guys living at this place,

246
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,450
you're always doing stuff always seems
like there wouldn't be that much more to

247
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,284
do.
You know,

248
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,570
she didn't want to know why,
if, if the toilet breaks,

249
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,890
they don't call a plumber to fix the
toilet. They built the monastery by hand.

250
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,220
They, everything is, they do
everything right. Well let's,

251
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,130
let's get a swimming
pool. Okay. Get a shovel.

252
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,030
You get a shovel and you get a shovel,
you know, let's figure out how to do it,

253
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:05,890
you know, and we'll build,
well, the swimming pool please.

254
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,170
So they do every hire you for a couple of
jobs. I didn't, I couldn't do anything.

255
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,190
I was a supervisor. Um, and then,

256
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,730
and then we would,
there was just more time alone.

257
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,080
So there was a tremendous amount of
time. Yeah. But also true. A lot of work.

258
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,490
So talk a little bit about the
disconnecting from technology.

259
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,460
I get the concerns about your
wife, your kids, things like that.

260
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,660
How did you feel about not putting your
hand in your pocket to go to your phone

261
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:35,500
or not having an iPad right in front of
you or television screen or the rest of

262
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:35,900
it?

263
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,430
You know, it's funny cause when
I got back, everybody asked me,

264
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,270
well what'd you miss?

265
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,300
And on the obvious answers I
missed my family and this and that,

266
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,970
but no one ever asked
me what didn't you miss?

267
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,600
And what I didn't notice at all were
things that I do everyday that I thought I

268
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,390
would miss. For example, I went
during the NCAA tournament.

269
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,830
I didn't miss not watching March madness.
It's been a pivot,

270
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,830
let's move suddenly I'm
loved to do forever.

271
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,000
And if I calculated how many hours of
basketball I've watched, it's like,

272
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,980
you know,
it's probably a years of my life,

273
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,360
but I didn't miss it and I didn't
miss hitting like that. You know,

274
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,630
liking my friend's picture and canned
cocoon with, with, with a corona.

275
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,670
I didn't miss any of that stuff.

276
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:22,200
I didn't miss going through Hulu and
Netflix and debating with my wife what to

277
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:26,970
watch. And I realized I spent a lot of
time on things that I really didn't miss.

278
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,400
And if I eliminated some of those,

279
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:33,300
I would freed up a lot more time to
spend to do the things I love to do with

280
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,460
people. I love to do them with. Yeah. So,

281
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,420
but it was so comfortable with
my phone's always in my hand.

282
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,220
It was hard, man, really hard. It took,
it took a long time to get past that.

283
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,660
Did you feel that there was like a
little bit of a learning curve with it?

284
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:49,600
Like when I did it and as I said,
I locked my phone in a safe,

285
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:54,070
I did not know the code and I found that
for the first day or two I kept going

286
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,740
in my pocket, even at the beach,
like I'm just going to be,

287
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,140
but there's nothing in my pocket.
I don't even think my shorts had pockets,

288
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,430
so I was just like going like this.

289
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,280
And then there's like this weird
anxiety of like, what's going on?

290
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,700
What did I miss? Is the Zombie apocalypse
or the war started or whatever.

291
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:10,810
And then suddenly by day like five,
I kind of felt empowered by day eight.

292
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:13,090
I was like,
I want nothing to do with that.

293
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,260
Then maybe there's a little bit of
like a return to a, it'll be okay,

294
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,810
I'll manage it differently.
Did you go through all of them

295
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,760
exempts the exact steps that you just
mentioned in the exact timeframe you just

296
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:28,620
did? Yeah. Um, once I got to the
point where I didn't miss it,

297
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,000
where the habit of checking before I
went to bed or waking up at five in the

298
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,470
morning and seeing anything new come
in through, you know, the words.

299
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,730
Once I got past that, yeah. Uh, I just,
I didn't miss it. I didn't want it,

300
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,250
you know? And once I got home and I
put on the news and read, you know,

301
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:51,300
like what's going on in the world and
all the negative stuff, it was just like,

302
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,800
ah, but here I am, I've been home and
then I'm back on my phone and I came home.

303
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm like,
I'm off email.

304
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,760
Yeah. I'm all, I don't need. Right
Kevin, you know, but you drift back.

305
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,620
So have you been able to put any kind
of just personal policies in place to

306
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:07,720
manage this stuff? Cause
I'm, I'm still trying,

307
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,450
I don't do phone in
bedroom 90% of the nights.

308
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:13,660
Every now and again it just somehow ends
up there. But like that's one for me.

309
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,460
So that at 5:00 AM I just don't do that.

310
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,830
Yeah. And you know I've been the obvious
ones, you know. No, not in the bedroom.

311
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,310
Not at meal time.
Not In movies I'm at.

312
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:26,310
And I used to sit and movies and I
heard a ding or a beep or a buzz.

313
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,920
Yeah. I'd go into my shirt and look,
you know, it's like light, you know,

314
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,950
or look under here.

315
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,520
But now, so there's, so I, I became this,

316
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,950
I think this will summarize
my experience the best.

317
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,660
They had a retreat at the monastery and
they had all these guests and when the

318
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,540
guests left they said to me,
Jesse,

319
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,710
you are going to clean up all the dishes
like the, like the rookie on the team.

320
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,620
Okay,
there's 500 dishes stacked.

321
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,070
So I started cleaning the dishes and I'm
drawing them and cleaning up and drying

322
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:59,910
them and they'd go and they bring more
in and I turned to them, I'm like,

323
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm just going to take me forever.
How am I going to do all of these dishes?

324
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,450
And one of the monks turned, he
goes, there's not all those dishes.

325
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,070
There's only the dish that's in your hand.
And I was like,

326
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,980
it reminded me that I'll never wear,
my feet are,

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,680
and I gotta be where my feet are,
you know, this is what I'm doing.

328
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,540
Yeah.
There's something there.

329
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,810
Because I do find that I
actually like doing the dishes.

330
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,020
I know that's a little nuts
and I'm not doing it for him.

331
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm not doing it for 500 people.
But I do find it's like one of like,

332
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:32,360
I can't have my phone in my hand while
I'm doing the dishes. Right. Like I,

333
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,630
it's one little thing that
you're doing right there.

334
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,850
So I do find on these brief
moments that you, you know,

335
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm on tour right now and
it's like when I'm doing this,

336
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:43,310
when I have these brief moments,
I like doing like very menial.

337
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:47,030
Like I really like gardening or just
like cleaning up outside or like these

338
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,660
things that aren't much
because they seem to have this,

339
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,470
this is incredible important.
We've lost touch with a lot of those

340
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,680
things that help us feel connected.
You know,

341
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,770
like we have no connection to our food.
We go to a supermarket, we have no,

342
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:02,820
unless you live on a farm,

343
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:07,821
like we're very disconnected from a lot
of things that make us tick and simple

344
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:11,220
things like that bring us back
down to earth and they ground us.

345
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,230
And I felt the same way
I felt as a contributor,

346
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,380
even if it's contributing to
your own household, you know?

347
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,150
And as opposed to having someone to come
and clean it or however you guys do it

348
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:28,950
or whatever. Um, but it makes you
feel connected, important part of it.

349
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,420
And uh,
it creates momentum and wins.

350
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,280
I can't explain it, but I felt
the same way. I love it. I was,

351
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,110
yeah. Yeah. There's real value in that.

352
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,760
Like even when you came into my
house and you're really like, oh,

353
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,220
it's so great here and this and
that. And it's like, I really love,

354
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,010
like we put a lot of effort into like I
want to like wake up in the place that I

355
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,730
want to be at and like make it better
and make it more valuable in all that.

356
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,750
So for the average person that can't
maybe go take a month to do this,

357
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,740
what's the piece of advice? Or is it,
can people do a weekend with monks?

358
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:03,100
Can you do it? Can you just do a day with
monks? Maybe. I think it was, and I think,

359
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,200
I think anyone could spend time alone.
Yeah.

360
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,890
I think spending time alone and you
reckon I recognize like I don't spend any

361
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,370
time alone other than going
for runs, which is, you know,

362
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,880
but I think it's really important because
I think the only way you can really be

363
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:19,720
in tune with your gut is to be,
is to spend some time alone.

364
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,480
So I think that's really important.
I think for me,

365
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,600
I carry a lot of stuff in my head.
I realized that I need to,

366
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:28,990
like I put everything on paper now I get
out of my head, it doesn't disappear,

367
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,820
but it frees up space.

368
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,110
I had a lot of space and creative energy
at the monastery because I didn't have,

369
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,590
I wasn't cluttered. So now I have
a two journal system that I use.

370
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:42,580
It's very simple. I dump everything
into one big journal. Doesn't go away,

371
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,160
but it's out of my head. Yeah.
I don't have to remember.

372
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:49,780
I could get a kid at birthday present or
whatever and then I make my daily kind

373
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:54,190
of routine and, and, and
this kind of thing. And um,

374
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:54,881
yeah.

375
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:59,050
And I think just being really aware of
where your feet are is really important.

376
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:04,051
I mean the monks from Mano taskers I live
in a world of multitasking and I think

377
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:07,600
that, you know, for the
everyday, for everybody,

378
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,470
I think that feels overwhelmed
or field feels distracted,

379
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,490
is to do one thing at a time
and do it well and move on.

380
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,080
Have you been back to the monastery since?
I'm going to go, I haven't been back.

381
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,830
What I plan on going to go back to
partake you get or is it just like,

382
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:28,090
can you go like have lunch with them like
just for some high fives and that like

383
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,180
they're down for that sort of thing.
Like I think the dad for some, yeah,

384
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,570
for some high five I guess you'll
find out. I mean I was like an alien.

385
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,900
I came here, there I was full
energy. I'm like, ugh. I'm like,

386
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,290
well what are we running?
Did it,

387
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,120
did they have any idea of your history
or just you know that your success is any

388
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:46,250
of that stuff. They just think
it's just some guy. Yeah, we're,

389
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,260
we're letting in on this.

390
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,360
I remember that must've been
pretty cool in and of itself.

391
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,600
I remember very clearly sitting down
and I was telling him about my journey.

392
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,330
I was talking about coconut water
and they all looked at me and said,

393
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,590
what's coconut water?

394
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,280
I was talking about the Atlanta Hawks
and one of them raised their hand, said,

395
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:04,360
I went to an expos game. Wow. In
Montreal. And I'm like, that's baseball.

396
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,750
Don't anymore. Like, you know. Yeah. All
right, well for our last few minutes left,

397
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:13,570
let's talk about the hawks for a second
and just, Oh, you own a basketball team,

398
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:16,030
which to me is, as you
know, I love basketball.

399
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,190
Like that's like the
greatest thing on earth.

400
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,890
Like I would probably stop doing all this.

401
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,650
I would trade it in to own a
basketball team. I'm, I'm, I'm,

402
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm not the principal owner. I'm part of
the yeah. And uh, we got a great group,

403
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:31,090
but for me,
living in Atlanta as a basketball fan,

404
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:35,440
I was a season ticket holder for years
first and then I was a consultant to the

405
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,380
team,
so I got to fall in love with the players,

406
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:42,910
the coaching staff and management first
and now to be part of the ownership

407
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:47,630
group with my wife and friends.
It's a in a city that I live in.

408
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,470
Yeah. And a team that I love. Yeah.
It's like, you know, it's just,

409
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,100
it's just unbelievable. There's, I was
talking to my wife the other day, I said,

410
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,150
you know, from my father and my
family and my friends and the city,

411
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,320
there's 80 plus games a year where
I could put the tea nights a year,

412
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,130
I could put the TV on. I'm thinking
about you as a knick fan. Yeah.

413
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,320
Multiply it by 20. And just, you
know, as, and just really love it.

414
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,590
So it's been super exciting and I
think we've got a really bright future.

415
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:19,190
So I'm looking forward to
the next couple of years.

416
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,710
I know it was a little before
your time of owning the hawks,

417
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,810
but how has Dominique Wilkins
not in the hall of fame?

418
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,460
And I love Nick. How's that guy? Not
In the whole thing. He deserves to be,

419
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,290
he deserves to be. He's a, not
only is he great basketball player,

420
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,670
but he's in Atlanta. He's, you know, he's
just a big part of the, of the community.

421
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:41,790
So if he's still part of the, Oh, is
that right? And Yeah, he does the play,

422
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,190
but he's, um, is that every game? So I,

423
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:48,810
I never seen him say no to a
photo or an autograph ever.

424
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,960
Never just,
um,

425
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,310
he makes people feel really good and
uh, he's very approachable. Yeah.

426
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,230
What are you guys doing over there to just

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,540
bring all of the things that you've talked
about here into the game and make it

428
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:07,130
fun and add some of the other stuff
that's not part of the 48 minutes? Like,

429
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,960
you know,
the Goto hurts go thing.

430
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,590
I think there's several buckets.
There's the internal bucket and wrestlers,

431
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,150
the principal on.
He's done an amazing job of just,

432
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,970
we have a new practice facility
that's state of the art best,

433
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,960
probably one of the best in the
NBA. Uh, we're renovating the arena.

434
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:26,670
Massive multi hundred million dollar
rent of renovation that's going on now.

435
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,960
So there's a whole,

436
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,020
there's like the internal stuff and
then there's the game presentation.

437
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,810
There's so many layers,
game presentation.

438
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:38,810
There's the actual basketball side of it.
Um, there's the nights that, that, that,

439
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,030
that the team doesn't play, that the
arena is available. We have a concert.

440
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,730
I mean it's just,
there's so many layers of it,

441
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,120
but I think at the end of the day it's
that enthusiasm and passion and just

442
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:54,280
bringing whatever you can to
infuse a culture of thick,

443
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,850
of your emotional connection
to the next you taught.

444
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,450
First thing you said to me when I
walked in with you took me to 94 games.

445
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah. You remember those? I remember
where I was sitting for a certain games.

446
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:04,830
You know what you're eating

447
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,360
and you're 25 years ago. I don't remember
what I ate last week. Exempt. Right.

448
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,360
You'd have no idea.
There's just so much emotion.

449
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,540
And if we could bring that same passion
to the community and marry that with the

450
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,920
Atlanta Hawks, that's going to be super
powerful. And I think we can all run away.

451
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,290
What wasn't Mandy? It's
pretty clear you're bringing
that to your life every day.

452
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,710
Cause this was just, I mean this flew by
and it's like I could feel it on time.

453
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,280
That's it. That's it. Well you got to
go do Rogan now, so I don't want to,

454
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,150
I don't want to steal
all your brain power.

455
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,340
You got three more hours with Rogan I
sent to you are going to be up to it to

456
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,080
the challenge and don't even
drink caffeine. You just
hopped up on coconut water.

457
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,360
I am potassium doubt. You don't even
need bananas anymore. Do you have any,

458
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,750
why would he have been at this point?

459
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,890
I had a lot of it and just eat the bananas
too too. Well, listen, man, it's been,

460
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,000
it's been an absolute pleasure.

461
00:26:57,001 --> 00:27:00,510
I suspect we will cross paths
again perhaps in Atlanta
because even though we're

462
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,560
holding this for a little bit, uh,
maybe a little bit, they come watch Ya.

463
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,090
All right. We're going to come to the
shore, the Peterson event in Atlanta.

464
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:10,230
Awesome. Uh, for more on Jesse,
