00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.390
Using the-- I guess we
could call it the washer

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.300
method or the ring
method, we were

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.260
able to come up with
the definite integral

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.810
for the volume of this solid
of revolution right over here.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.561
So this is equal to the volume.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.060
And so in this
video, let's actually

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.540
evaluate this integral.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.577
So the first thing that we could
do is maybe factor out this pi.

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:22.160
So this is going to be equal to
pi times the definite integral

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.650
from 0 to 1.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.690
And then let's square this
stuff that we have right here

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.220
in green.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.847
So 2 squared is going to be 4.

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:32.180
And then we're going to have
2 times the product of both

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.880
of these terms.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.520
So 2 times negative
y squared times 2

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.280
is going to be
negative 4 y squared.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.590
And then negative
y squared squared

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.050
is plus y to the fourth.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.435
And then from that, we are going
to subtract this thing squared.

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:55.280
We're going to subtract
this business squared, which

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040
is going to be 4 minus
4 square roots of y

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.480
plus-- well, square root of y
squared is just going to be y.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.830
And all of that dy.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.740
Let me write that
in that same color.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.750
And so this is going
to be equal to pi

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.440
times the definite
integral from 0 to 1.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.370
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.870
We have a positive
4 here, but then

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.286
when you distribute
this negative,

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:29.510
you're going to have a negative
4, so that cancels with that.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.270
And let's see.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.870
The highest-degree
term here is going

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.130
to be our y to the fourth.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.030
So we have a y to the fourth.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.050
I'll write it in
that same color.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.870
And so the
next-highest-degree term right

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.560
here is this
negative 4 y squared.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.270
So then you have negative--
let me do that same color.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.110
We have negative 4 y squared.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.120
That's that one
right over there.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.887
And then we have this y.

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:00.220
But we have to remember we
have this negative out front.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.250
So it's a negative y.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.760
So this one right over
here is a negative y.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.919
And then we have a
negative times a negative,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.120
which is going to give us a
positive 4 square roots of y.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.742
So this is going to end up being
a positive 4 square roots of y.

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.200
And actually, just
to make it clear

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.030
when we take the antiderivative,
I'm going to write that as 4 y

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.740
to the 1/2 power.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.459
And we're going to multiply
all that stuff by dy.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.250
Now we're ready to take
the antiderivative.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.910
So it's going to be equal to pi
times the antiderivative of y

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.100
to the fourth is y
to the fifth over 5.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.880
Antiderivative of negative 4
y squared is negative 4/3 y

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.650
to the third power.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.960
Antiderivative of negative y
is negative y squared over 2.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.680
And then the antiderivative
of 4 y to the 1/2-- let's see.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.055
We're going to
increment, so it's

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.820
going to be y to the
3/2 multiplied by 2/3.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.060
We're going to get 8/3
plus 8/3 y to the 3/2.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.644
And let's see.

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:09.143
Yep.

00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:09.970
That all works out.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.690
And we're going to evaluate
this at 1 and at 0.

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:17.010
And lucky for us, when
you evaluate at 0,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.610
this whole thing
turns out to be 0.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.860
So this is all going to be
equal to pi times evaluating

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.430
all this business at 1.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.495
So that's going to
be 1/5 minus 4/3--

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:34.646
I'll do that in a green
color-- minus 4/3 minus 1/2--

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:36.020
so whenever you
evaluate it at 1,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.520
it's just going to
be-- so plus 8/3.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.530
And let's see.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.430
What's the least common
multiple over here?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.900
Let's see, a 5, a 3, and a 2.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.080
It looks like we're going
to have a denominator of 30.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.460
So we can rewrite
this as equal to pi,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.512
and we can put everything
over a denominator of 30.

00:03:57.512 --> 00:04:01.966
1/5 is 6/30.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:07.020
4/3 is 40 over 30,
so this is minus 40.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.520
That's the different
shade of green.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.150
Well, actually, let me make
it another shade of green.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.820
So this is minus 40/30.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.339
Negative 1/2,
that's minus 15/30.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.770
And then finally, 8/3 is
the same thing as 80/30,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.060
so that's plus 80.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.810
So this simplifies
to-- so let's see.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.284
We have 86 minus
50-- oh, actually,

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:42.450
let me make sure I'm doing
the math right over here.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:56.680
So 80 minus 40 is going to get
us 40, plus 6 is 46, minus 15

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.770
is 31.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.270
So this is equal to 31 pi 30.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.950
I have a suspicion that I
might have done something shady

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.554
in this last part
right over here.

00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:08.970
So this is going
to be, let's see,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.720
negative 36,
negative 51, plus 80.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.855
I think that seems right.

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.230
I'm going to do
it one more time.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.730
Let's see.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:26.700
80 minus 40 is 40, 46, 46
minus 10 is 36, minus another 5

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.680
is 31.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.261
So, yes, we get 31 pi
over 30 for our volume.
