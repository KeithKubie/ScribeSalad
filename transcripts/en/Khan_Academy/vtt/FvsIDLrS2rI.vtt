00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:04.221
- So here we have something
that you probably have done

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.822
in the last, maybe in the last day.

00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:09.947
And if we're in a car and
we're just making a turn,

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:13.517
let's say at a constant
speed, on a road that is flat.

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.666
So it's not a banked race
track or anything like that.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.922
What is keeping the car from just

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:21.136
veering off in a straight line?

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.204
And this one's a little bit less intuitive

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.516
because we don't have any string here

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:28.683
that's tethering the car to the center

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.379
of the curve of our road.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.644
So what's keeping it from
going in a straight line here?

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:39.094
Pause the video and think about that.

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:41.149
Well in this situation,
and we could think about

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.150
other forces that are at play.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.148
And once again I'll
assume we're in a vacuum,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:47.186
although you could think
about air resistance as well

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:49.723
and think about what is
counteracting the air resistance.

00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:51.696
It turns out that that's friction.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:53.974
But the other forces at play,

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:55.811
you of course have the force of gravity

00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:59.356
pulling downward on the
car, force of gravity.

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:03.333
And that's being counteracted
by the normal force,

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:07.166
that's being counteracted
by the normal force.

00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:13.110
Force, the normal force
of the road on the car.

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.344
But what's keeping the
car going in a circle?

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:18.309
And actually let's just
do air resistance for fun.

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:22.239
So the air resistance, the
force of the air on the car,

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.167
that's gonna be pushing
in the direction opposite

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.015
from the velocity of the car.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:32.174
So we could call that, let's
just call that force of air.

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:35.412
You can't read that, let me do it this.

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.687
So, force of the air, that
would be its magnitude.

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:41.151
And then that's being counteracted by,

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:42.567
and this is a little bit counterintuitive,

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.067
and this will actually give us a clue

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.885
on the centripital force,
that is this component,

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:51.277
that is being counteracted
by this component

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.444
of the friction, so force of friction,

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:58.816
in the direction that the car is going.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.476
Think about it, if you didn't have--

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:03.940
if this was ice on ice, if the
wheels didn't have traction,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.857
no matter how hard the engine went

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:07.769
and no matter how fast the wheels sped,

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.049
it wouldn't be able to
overcome the air resistance,

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.460
and then the car would decelerate.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.185
But these are all the
forces that aren't acting

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:19.677
in a radial direction,
that aren't keeping the car

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:22.430
on the road, so to speak,
or keeping it going

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.662
in that circular motion around the curve.

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:28.829
The one there, is once
again, the force of friction.

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:31.620
So this is another, I guess you could say,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.677
another component of
the force of friction.

00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:35.818
And that's happening where the tires,

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:38.277
where the literally, the
rubber meets the road.

00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:41.407
But this right over here, you
have the force of friction,

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:43.494
that is keeping, and maybe I'll call it

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:46.577
force of friction radially, radially.

00:02:48.198 --> 00:02:49.483
We'll put it in parentheses.

00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:51.816
Force of friction, radially.

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.363
That is keeping us going
in a circular direction.

00:02:57.363 --> 00:03:02.073
And so, in this situation,
that is our centripetal force.

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:05.250
Let's do another example,
and let's keep going

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.832
with the theme of cars now.

00:03:07.832 --> 00:03:10.332
So let's say a scenario where,

00:03:12.073 --> 00:03:14.031
we are on a loop-de-loop,

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:16.196
which is always fun, and kind of scary.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.442
I have dreams where I have
to drive on loop-de-loop,

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:21.784
for some reason, and I
find it intimidating.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.321
But let's think about the
car at different points

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.981
of the loop-de-loop, and
think about what is--

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.577
what is the centripetal
force at different points.

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:33.100
So let's first think about
this point right over here.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.318
And, once again, we assume
that we are dealing,

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:39.710
we're on a planet, and so you
have your force of gravity,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.500
right over here, force of gravity.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.000
And then, you also have your normal force.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.520
And I'm going to draw
it a little bit larger,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.890
because in order to be
moved, I guess you could say,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.738
upwards, to stay on the loop-de-loop,

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.502
the normal force has to be larger,

00:03:57.502 --> 00:03:59.904
you have to have a net force inward.

00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:03.786
So this is "F," this is our normal force.

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:07.877
And so, in this situation, the magnitude,

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:10.286
the magnitude of our centripetal force,

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:13.095
let me do this in a different color.

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:16.523
The magnitude of our
centripetal force is going to be

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.440
the net radial inward radial force,

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:22.836
for the magnitude of the
net radial inward force.

00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:27.598
So this would be equal to the
magnitude of our normal force

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:31.765
minus, minus the magnitude
of the force of gravity.

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:36.486
If this wasn't net inward right over here,

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:38.211
then you would not, this car would not

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.666
be able to move in a circle.

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:43.059
It would just, if this netted out to zero,

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.241
it would go in a straight line that way.

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.620
And if this netted out
so that it was negative

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.058
it would accelerate downwards.

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:52.149
So, let's go at this
point right over here.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.926
And we could also think about
things like air-resistance

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.332
and friction, where
air-resistance is pushing back

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:58.709
on the car, and friction is overcoming it,

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.692
but we're going to focus
just on the things that are

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:05.216
driving us centripetally
inward or outward right now.

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:08.253
Now what about this point for the car?

00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:10.525
Well, we still have the force of gravity,

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.234
you still have the force of gravity.

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:15.859
And actually, I'll make
this a little bit bigger.

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:18.263
We could-- eh, let me put
the air-resistance there,

00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:19.096
just to be complete.

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:23.263
So this would be the air
resistance, force of the air,

00:05:24.822 --> 00:05:28.952
and then that's being
counteracted by force of friction,

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.110
the traction that the
car has with the road.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.203
Over here, this orange
vector, this would now be

00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:37.206
the combination of the force of gravity.

00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:38.652
And actually, you could even consider it

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:43.121
the force of gravity,
plus the, plus the force,

00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:47.166
the air resistance, plus
the force of the air

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:50.147
pushing back on the car,
the pressure of the air.

00:05:50.147 --> 00:05:53.314
And then that is being counteracted by

00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:59.441
the force of friction,
so the force of friction

00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:01.721
of the tires of the
tires pushing, pushing--

00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:03.632
Or I guess, the force
of friction of the tire,

00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:05.711
between the tire and the road.

00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:08.396
But neither of these are
acting centripetally,

00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:10.109
acting radially inward.

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.458
So, what's that going to be?

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:16.433
Well, here you have the
normal force of the track.

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:18.894
The track is what's keeping this car

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:21.502
going in this circular direction.

00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:22.835
And so you have,

00:06:24.607 --> 00:06:26.126
so you have--

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:30.806
Here, the inward force is
the normal force, F normal.

00:06:30.806 --> 00:06:33.878
So in this situation,
our centripetal force,

00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:36.163
the magnitude of our
centripetal force is equal to

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:38.257
the magnitude of our normal force.

00:06:38.257 --> 00:06:40.747
And these, actually, are
even going to be the same,

00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:42.357
the exact same vectors.

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:45.934
Now, let's consider one last scenario.

00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:48.557
When we are at the top
of the loop-de-loop.

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:52.067
Pause the video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:54.913
Well, once again, we can do things like,

00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:57.728
we could say, hey look, there's
probably some air-resistance

00:06:57.728 --> 00:07:01.539
that is keeping us, that
is trying to decelerate us.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.257
So that, and then that's being,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.464
that's being netted out
by the force of friction.

00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:09.345
But let's think about what's going on

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.085
in the vertical direction.

00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:13.668
So here, pushing down this way,

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:18.753
you're going to have,
potentially several forces,

00:07:18.753 --> 00:07:20.197
and I want this to actually
be at the top of the

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:22.767
loop-de-loop, although it
doesn't look quite like that,

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:24.544
but actually let's just assume it is.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.765
We're at the top of the loop-de-loop.

00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:28.981
Pushing down, you're going
to have the force of gravity.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.685
But what else are you going to have?

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:32.038
Assuming you're going fast enough,

00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:34.237
the track is also pushing down.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.954
The force of gravity
plus the normal force.

00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:39.959
The magnitude of this vector
would be the magnitude,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.519
it would be the sum of the magnitudes

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.785
of the gravitational force
and the normal force.

00:07:44.785 --> 00:07:47.813
And that is what's providing
your centripetal force there.

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:50.256
And so, in this scenario, we would say

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:52.123
the magnitude of our centripetal force

00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:54.518
is equal to the magnitude
of our gravitational force

00:07:54.518 --> 00:07:57.178
plus the magnitude of our normal force.

00:07:57.178 --> 00:07:59.158
Or, we could even think
about it as vectors.

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:01.490
We could say, hey look, if
we just add up these vectors,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.414
these two vectors, you're going to get

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:05.401
your centripetal force vector.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:09.424
That's what keeps the car
going in that circular motion.

00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:13.468
Now let's just do one last
scenario, just for fun.

00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:17.651
Let's imagine that we
have an object in orbit.

00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:21.192
So, this is our planet,
or any planet really.

00:08:21.192 --> 00:08:23.472
And you have an object in
orbit, some type of a satellite.

00:08:23.472 --> 00:08:27.211
I'll draw what we normally
associate with as a satellite.

00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:29.582
But this could be even
a natural satellite,

00:08:29.582 --> 00:08:31.937
a moon for the planet,
and what I'm about to say

00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:33.741
applies to the moon as well.

00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:35.701
So here, we don't have air,

00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:37.952
we have very minimal air resistance,

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:41.907
there might be a few molecules
every here and there.

00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:44.800
But for the most part,
this is in a vacuum,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.126
and it's in orbit, so what keeps--

00:08:48.126 --> 00:08:50.557
So it's in a uniform circular motion,

00:08:50.557 --> 00:08:52.578
it's moving in a circular
orbit around the planet.

00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:55.110
What keeps it going
off in a straight line?

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.364
Pause the video and think about it.

00:08:57.364 --> 00:09:01.468
Well here, you have the force of gravity.

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:04.988
You have the force of
gravity of the planet.

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:07.914
So right there, you have
the force of gravity.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.614
And at first people
say, wait wait, gravity?

00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:11.446
I see these picture of astronauts

00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:12.869
floating when they're in orbit.

00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:14.335
Well, that's just because
they're in free-fall.

00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:17.272
But the gravity at that point,
if you're a few hundred miles

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:19.560
above the surface of the
Earth, is not that different

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.516
than the gravity on the
surface of the Earth.

00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:25.031
You just don't have air there,
and if you are in orbit,

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.499
you're in constant free-fall,

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.983
so it feels, to you,
like there is no gravity.

00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:33.927
But it's gravity that is
keeping you on the orbital path,

00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:36.430
on that circular path, and
keeps you from just going

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.241
in a straight line out into space.
