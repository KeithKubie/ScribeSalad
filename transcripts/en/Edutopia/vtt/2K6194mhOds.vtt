00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:04.556
&gt;&gt;Mark: You know, when
I first started here,

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:07.196
I felt like we were doing the
same thing over and over again,

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:09.116
and we were wondering why
our kids weren't buying in.

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:11.436
We were running traditional
public schools,

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:14.396
but we weren't really
embracing innovation and change.

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:16.016
&gt;&gt;If we're not getting the success,

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:19.736
then it's an innovation we should
do away with and try another.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.436
&gt;&gt;I really saw my role as, how do we,

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:25.536
on a limited budget,
really reinvent ourselves?

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:26.976
&gt;&gt;Patrick: All right,
good, that's perfect.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:28.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes!

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.136
&gt;&gt;Mark: To move your vision
along, people need to buy in,

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.826
they need to trust you as a leader.

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:41.196
So for us, it's always been about
collaboration, working together.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:44.976
This commitment to putting students
at the forefront of our decisions.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:45.956
&gt;&gt;How do you like the new building?

00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:47.656
&gt;&gt;Student: I love it a lot.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:47.906
&gt;&gt;Mark: Good, good.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.136
&gt;&gt;For our district, four
key areas of work

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:52.786
in Meriden are creating student
centered learning environment,

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.696
technology integration,
expanding learning time

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:57.156
and building district capacity.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:00:59.876
&gt;&gt;Student: We'll test conductivity,

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.716
density and then make
a data table after.

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:03.123
&gt;&gt;Brenda: Okay.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.016
&gt;&gt;Mark: First, we want to create
schools where students want to be.

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:10.246
What they were telling us is, when you
allow us to work with other students

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.956
and solve real world
problems, we learn better,

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.546
we enjoy it more and we feel challenged.

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:19.046
So how do we support our
teachers in this transition?

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.846
We have student centered
learning coaches.

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:23.186
&gt;&gt;Patrick: As a coach, I
would work with teachers.

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.056
We try to find ways to build in
student centered learning activities

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:29.196
in every single classroom, where
kids have more opportunities

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.106
to learn from each other.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.876
&gt;&gt;Jake: Student centered learning
provides us with a better outlook

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.346
of what real life is going to be.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:37.746
It feels like you're experiencing
something, rather than taking notes

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.976
on something and having a test
on it the next week, it's fun.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.466
&gt;&gt;He runs away because he's guilty.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.276
&gt;&gt;Mia: End scene.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.106
[applause]

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.296
&gt;&gt;Mark: We also knew
that if we were going

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.016
to create student centered
learning environment,

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.076
we needed to make sure technology
was in place for students,

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:54.966
so they can learn anywhere
and at any time.

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:57.066
&gt;&gt;What made you guys choose
the white tigers to study?

00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.916
&gt;&gt;Student: We saw that the
white tiger was very majestic.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.486
&gt;&gt;Daniel: When we went
to one to one devices,

00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:04.356
the district did an outstanding job

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:07.816
of supporting classroom
teachers, offering PLC time.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.166
We had technology integration
specialists.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.026
We also have something
called tech buddies.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:14.736
&gt;&gt;Patrick: There's no reason
that we can't take those experts

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.436
in our buildings, our older students,

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.976
and have them work with
our younger students.

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:20.076
&gt;&gt;Sergio: And E is right next to it.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.966
&gt;&gt;Lauren: Using the technology
is really motivating

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.166
for these twenty-first century
learners; that's how they learn.

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.976
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: See how easy that was?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.156
&gt;&gt;Mark: Next, it was that we were going

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.726
to expand learning opportunities
for students.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:33.596
We heard about some of the creative
work that was occurring in other schools

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.396
and we said, why can't that occur here?

00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:38.416
So we applied for an
AFT innovation grant,

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:42.336
where students go a hundred minutes more
per day, forty additional days a year.

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:45.756
Not every elementary teacher needs
to work eight thirty to three thirty.

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:49.696
Some could work seven thirty to two
thirty, others will work nine to four.

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:53.566
The results there have been
tremendous, academic results,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:56.456
standardized testing results,
climate survey results.

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:58.376
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, tell me why though.

00:02:58.376 --> 00:02:59.066
&gt;&gt;Student: It felt crunchy.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:02:59.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Excellent.

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:03.906
&gt;&gt;Mark: So by flexing teachers'
schedules, having the union's agreement

00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:06.856
to do that, we're doing
creative things that kids love.

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:09.496
&gt;&gt;Very good, give me five.

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:10.976
Okay, good work.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:13.466
&gt;&gt;Another innovation is how
we build district capacity,

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:16.336
how we support our staff
and create the initiatives,

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.266
especially during these
tough budget times.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:21.686
Here at Hanover, we have a
program for students with autism

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.356
and other communication disorders.

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:24.426
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: What we were doing

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:27.666
for special education
students before we had a lot

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.806
of outside agencies working with them.

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:33.176
&gt;&gt;Mark: I thought to myself, why are
shipping them to a school so far away?

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:36.566
And the answer was, we don't have
the staff, we don't have the space,

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:37.856
we don't have the programs.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.676
I'm thinking, well, staff,
we hire teachers.

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:45.606
Space, we can always be creative, and
programs, I love designing programs.

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:46.976
We can do better.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:48.606
&gt;&gt;Heather: Are you ready to go?

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:48.976
Listen, go.

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:53.266
&gt;&gt;Mark: We are the only district

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.526
in Connecticut whose special
ed population has increased,

00:03:56.576 --> 00:04:00.786
but the overall expenses have went down,
because we've done service internally.

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:04.436
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: Mark is forward thinking

00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:06.836
and that's what I love
about being a principal.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.916
Under his leadership, I
am able to try things.

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:14.386
&gt;&gt;Mark: Leadership is about making
people comfortable to take risks.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.526
If you're not willing to fail,
you're never going to be innovative

00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:18.966
and you're never going to be
as successful as you should be.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:19.486
&gt;&gt;Ah, I'm tired!

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:20.786
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't give up!

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:24.816
&gt;&gt;Mark: Never give up, never give up!
