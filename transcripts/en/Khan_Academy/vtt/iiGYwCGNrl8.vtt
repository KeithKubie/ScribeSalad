00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.410
We're now going to
explore one of the most

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.710
fundamental reactions
in organic chemistry.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.490
And first, let's
look at what are

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.450
the things that
are going to react.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.700
So over here, I have
a hydroxide anion.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.820
It has a negative 1 charge.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.160
And that negative 1
charge comes from the fact

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.990
that oxygen is neutral if
has six valence electrons.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.200
But this has one, two,
three, four, five,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.910
six, plus half of this
bond with hydrogen.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.530
So you could think of
that as another electron.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.650
Or it's got half of
these two, so that's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.490
another electron, which
gives it a negative 1 charge.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.970
Now, this right over
here, it has one carbon--

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.010
I guess that you could
say-- in its backbone.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.400
It's a methane.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.641
And it has a group right over
here consisting of bromine.

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.640
So this is bromomethane.

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:53.660
So let's think a
little bit about what

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.500
might happen under
the right conditions.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.714
So this hydroxide anion-- we've
already gone over the fact--

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.380
that you could kind
of view it as having

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.420
an extra electron, which
gives us this negative charge.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.770
Well, if you have a negative
charged anion-- like this--

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580
it will be attracted
to positive things.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.840
And one example of a
positive thing is a nucleus.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.880
And so in this
reaction, we are going

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.045
to refer to this hydroxide
anion as the nucleophile.

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.770
Phile literally refers to
things that something likes.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.550
This thing, it's
a nucleus-lover,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.810
I guess you could say.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.450
And so it might want to share
maybe a pair of electrons

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.820
with a nucleus.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.870
Now, over here, I
have this bromo group

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.980
in the bromomethane.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.600
And bromine is quite
electronegative.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.550
It is more electronegative
than carbon.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.640
So even in this bond,
we have two electrons

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.240
in this bond right over here.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.030
Bromine is going to hog the
electrons a little bit more

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.270
than carbon.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.175
And also, electronegativity
says that, if this bond were

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.940
to break, it's more likely that
this pair-- the pair that's

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.070
in this bond-- is going
to go to the bromine

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.090
than it's going to
go to the carbon.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.800
So the way that this reaction
works-- and it's really

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.310
kind of happening in one step.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.240
And this is key to the
name of this reaction,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.810
as we'll see in a second-- is
that this nucleophile right

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.860
over here might say, hey,
I got this extra charge.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.240
Let me share some of that
charge with a nucleus--

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.530
in this case, the carbon.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.630
Let me draw it like this.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.220
So it would share this pair,
which would form a bond.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.050
Carbon would have
half of the pair.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.740
Oxygen would have
half of the pair.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.240
So it would share
this pair with carbon.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.520
Now, if carbon is now
sharing half of this,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.830
it's essentially kind
of getting an electron.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.370
It doesn't need this electron,
which bromine is already

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.620
hogging a little bit.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.960
And so bromine would take
this entire pair back.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.245
Whenever we draw full arrows
like this-- just normal arrows

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.620
that you're used
to seeing-- it's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.710
referring to the
action of pairs.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.580
So this whole pair
is going to bromine.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.510
This pair right over
here is now going

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.120
to be shared with the carbon.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.670
It's going to form a
bond with the carbon.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.970
So when we do both
of these steps,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.960
after both of these steps,
it would look like this.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.260
Let me draw my
bromine first, which

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.190
is now going to become
a bromide anion.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.030
So bromine one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.350
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.670
And now, it gets both of these
electrons from this bond.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.940
So it has both of those
electrons right over there.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.987
Now, this will have
a negative 1 charge.

00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:46.820
How do we know that?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.995
Well, bromine is neutral, but
it has seven valence electrons.

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:52.700
And this thing now has eight.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.340
So this now has a
negative charge.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.970
Now, let's think
about what happens

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.660
to all of this business.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.270
So let me draw my carbon first.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.130
And let me draw this
hydrogen that's popping out.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.615
So this hydrogen that's popping
out, let me draw it like that.

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:11.660
So that's the bond.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.260
I'm trying to show that's
popping out of the page.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.545
So that's that hydrogen.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.920
I just made them
different colors

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.980
so we can keep track of
the different hydrogens.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.620
Then the hydrogen that's
going into the page, that's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.190
that one right over there.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.470
And you have this
hydrogen that's going up.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.700
So that hydrogen
right over there.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.510
And now, the hydroxide anion
has bonded to this carbon.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.560
Now it'll be a hydroxyl group.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.840
So this thing has now bonded.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.570
So let me draw the bond and the
color of these two electrons.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.250
It has now bonded.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.930
So those two electrons
now make up this blur,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.930
this bond right over here.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.380
And now, we have our
oxygen but with those two,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.440
these two right over here,
these two right over here,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.152
and then, the bond
to the hydrogen.

00:04:58.152 --> 00:04:59.360
Now, what just happened here?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.670
The oxygen is now neutral.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.420
Why is it neutral?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.350
Well, it has one,
two, three, four.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.960
And then, it has
half of this bond.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.150
So you could view
that as an electron

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.080
or the equivalent
of electron charge.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.590
And then, it has
half of this bond.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.880
So it has the electron
charge equivalent

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480
of six valence
electrons-- which makes

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.507
oxygen neutral-- and
now bromine is negative.

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:19.840
So one way to think about it
is that the negative charge

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.630
has been transferred to the
bromine in this reaction.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.430
Now, in this reaction,
bromine has left.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:36.466
And that's why we call this the
leaving group of the reaction.

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.090
This thing right over
here is the thing

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.910
that is going to leave.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.636
That is the leaving group.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:44.010
Now, the other thing that you
might find interesting-- it

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.640
looks like kind of
this hydroxide anion.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.470
Some people would even say
attacked this bromomethane,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.765
the bromomethane left.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.060
The bromine left-- not
the bromomethane left--

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.487
that attacked the
bromomethane, the bromine left.

00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:03.570
So in some ways, you would
say that there's really

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.280
two reactants over here.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.310
You have the hydroxide anion,
and you have the bromide anion.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.670
And this carbon right over
here with the hydrogens,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.880
this was kind of the
thing that to some degree

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.450
facilitated the reaction.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.200
This thing bumped
into it and attached.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.890
And then, this thing the left.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.915
And so in this context,
we would call the carbon--

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.415
with the three hydrogens-- we
would call this the substrate.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.600
Now, what should we
call this reaction?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.000
Well, one way to think about
it is we substituted this bromo

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.860
group with a hydroxyl group.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.540
So it might make sense to call
this a substitution reaction.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.100
Substitution has occurred.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.544
Now, what did we
substitute with?

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:50.210
Well, we substituted
with a nucleophile.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.440
And how many reactants
were involved

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.120
in the rate-determining step?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.328
And I know that might not
make a lot of sense to you.

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.750
But this had, essentially,
one determining step.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.820
This had to want to
bump in the right way.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.380
And this would want to have to
leave right at the same time,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.320
or roughly the
same time, in order

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.160
for this reaction to occur.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.210
So this reactant
and this reactant

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.350
were involved in
figuring out, well,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.790
how fast is this
reaction going to happen?

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.080
And we're going to see
future reactions where

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.342
you don't have both
reactants involved

00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:27.550
in the rate-determining step.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.140
We'll see only one
reactant involved

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.590
in the rate-determining step.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.470
But I'll just write
this right over here,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.750
2 reactants in
rate-determining step.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.350
There's a garbage truck outside.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.850
OK.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.474
I think the garbage
truck has left now.

00:07:43.474 --> 00:07:44.600
Safe to resume.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.290
So as we were saying, there
are two reactants involved

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:56.290
in the rate-determining step.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.470
And so the shorthand
for this reaction

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:05.855
is to call it an Sn2 reaction.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.120
It's substitution with
a nucleophile where

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.942
both reactants are involved
in the rate-determining step.
