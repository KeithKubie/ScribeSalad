00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.800
So, you know I think a lot
about the transformative power

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.685
of cinema.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.326
The Interpersonal
impact of a great film.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.400
A great film can awaken
us to our inner genies.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.050
A great film can imprint
itself in our consciousness

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.540
and transform us from within.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.409
The French new wave
filmmaker, Godard,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.830
said that cinema was
truth 24 times per second.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.360
Gene Youngblood expanded on this
in his book, "Expanded Cinema."

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.940
He says cinema reflects
mankind's historical urge

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.520
to manifest his consciousness,
his interiority outside

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.130
of his mind, in
front of his eyes.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.510
Cinema is a mirror we
hold up to ourselves

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.326
that reveals us to ourselves.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:55.470
It's a dream sharing
technology that

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.320
allows us to visit the space
of truth, of archetype,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.420
of myth, of legend.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.080
It's the magical borderland.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.855
It's the story world in
which we lose ourselves,

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:07.670
and we find ourselves.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.610
The book "Cartographic
Cinema" goes even farther.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.340
It says that cinema is
cartography for the mind.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.680
Cinema is a map for
consciousness offering us

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.210
orientation in this
imaginal realm of dream.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.200
And of course, with such power
comes great responsibility.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.860
Cinema as a tool, as a technique
for such cathartic illumination

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.280
means that filmmakers
have a responsibility

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.370
to craft work that thrusts the
human spirit into the numinous.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.160
We need to expand the
consciousness of society.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.670
As filmmakers, as
craftsmen of the lens,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.870
this is our responsibility.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.720
That's what I think.
