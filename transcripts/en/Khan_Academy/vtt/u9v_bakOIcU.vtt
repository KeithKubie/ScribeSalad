00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.330
f of x is equal to 2x
squared plus 15x minus 8.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.690
g of x is equal to x
squared plus 10x plus 16.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.510
Find f/g of x.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.030
Or you could interpret this
is as f divided by g of x.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.110
And so based on the
way I just said it,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.670
you have a sense
of what this means.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.230
f/g, or f divided by g, of x,
by definition, this is just

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.230
another way to write f
of x divided by g of x.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.440
You could view this as
a function, a function

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.580
of x that's defined
by dividing f

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.290
of x by g of x, by creating
a rational expression where

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.850
f of x is in the numerator and
g of x is in the denominator.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.490
And so this is going to be equal
to f of x-- we have right up

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.020
here-- is 2x
squared 15x minus 8.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.050
And g of x-- I will do in blue--
is right over here, g of x.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.260
So this is all
going to be over g

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.880
of x, which is x squared
plus 10x plus 16.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.130
And you could leave it this
way, or you could actually

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.800
try to simplify
this a little bit.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.550
And the easiest way
to simplify this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.600
would see if we could factor the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.110
expressions into maybe
simpler expressions.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.040
And maybe some of them might be
on-- maybe both the numerator

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.810
and denominator is divisible
by the same expression.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.500
So let's try to
factor each of them.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.030
So first, let's
try the numerator.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.660
And I'll actually do it up here.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.320
So let's do it.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.611
Actually, I'll do it down here.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:39.110
So if I'm looking at 2x
squared plus 15x minus 8,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.220
we have a quadratic expression
where the coefficient is not 1.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.230
And so one technique to factor
this is to factor by grouping.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.310
You could also use
the quadratic formula.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.140
And when you factor
by grouping, you're

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.170
going to split up
this term, this 15x.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
And you're going to
split up into two terms

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.850
where the coefficients
are, if I were

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.090
to take the product
of those coefficients,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.800
they're going to be
equal to the product

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.700
of the first and the last terms.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.432
And we proved that
in other videos.

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:11.390
So essentially, we want
to think of two numbers

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.750
that add up to 15,
but whose product

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.600
is equal to negative 16.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.940
And this is just the technique
of factoring by grouping.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.430
It's really just an attempt to
simplify this right over here.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.650
So what two numbers that,
if I take their product,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.270
I get negative 16.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.091
But if I add them, I get 15?

00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.340
Well, if I take the product
and get a negative number,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.290
that means they have to
have a different sign.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.540
And so that means one of
them is going to be positive,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.730
one of them is going
to be negative,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.890
which means one of them
is going to be larger

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.500
than 15 and one of them is
going to be smaller than 15.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.170
And the most obvious
one there might

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.960
be 16, positive
16, and negative 1.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.900
If I multiply these two things,
I definitely get negative 16.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.040
If I add these two things,
I definitely get 15.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.240
So what we can do is
we can split this.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.450
We can rewrite this expression
as 2x squared plus 2x squared

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.400
plus 16x minus x minus 8.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.910
All I did here is I
took this middle term

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.800
and, using this technique
right over here,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.920
I split it into
16x minus x, which

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.140
is clearly still just 15x.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.010
Now what's useful
about this-- and this

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.280
is why we call it factoring
by grouping-- is we can see,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.840
are there any common factors
in these first two terms

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.110
right over here?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.050
Well, both 2x squared and 16x,
they are both divisible by 2x.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.400
So you could factor out a
2x of these first two terms.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.622
This is the same thing as
2x times x plus x plus 8.

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:49.610
16 divided by 2 is 8,
x divided by x is 1.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.330
So this is 2x times x plus 8.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.940
And then the second two
terms right over here--

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.440
this is the whole
basis of factoring

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.450
by grouping-- we can
factor out a negative 1.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.990
So this is equal to
negative 1 times x plus 8.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.070
And what's neat here is
now we have two terms.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.930
Both of them have
an x plus 8 in them.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.480
So we can factor
out an x plus 8.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.750
So if we factor out
an x plus 8, we're

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.380
left with 2x minus 1, put
parentheses around it,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.760
times the factored out x plus 8.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.470
So we've simplified
the numerator.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.874
The numerator can be rewritten.

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:32.290
And you could have gotten here
using the quadratic formula

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.120
as well.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.120
The numerator is 2x
minus 1 times x plus 8.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.230
And now see if you can
factor the denominator.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.730
And this one's more
straightforward.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.930
The coefficient here is 1.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.790
So we just have to
think of two numbers

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.200
that when I multiply
them, I get 16.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.850
And when I add them, I get 10.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.690
And the obvious one is 8 and
2, positive 8 and positive 2.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.160
So we can write this as
x plus 2 times x plus 8.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.670
And now, we can simplify it.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.220
We can divide the numerator
and denominator by x plus 8,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.139
assuming that x does
not equal negative 8.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.680
Because this function
right over here

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.710
that's defined by
f divided by g,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.620
it is not defined when
g of x is equal to 0,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.660
because then you have
something divided by 0.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.540
And the only times that
g of x is equal to 0

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.620
is when x is equal to negative
2 or x is equal to negative 8.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.390
So if we divide the numerator
and the denominator by x plus 8

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.880
to simplify it, in order to not
change the function definition,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.660
we have to still put the
constraint that x cannot be

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.989
equal to negative 8.

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:39.280
That the original function,
in order to not change it--

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.321
because if I just cancelled
these two things out,

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.860
the new function with these
canceled would be defined when

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.276
x is equal to negative 8.

00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.650
But we want this
simplified thing

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.570
to be the same exact function.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.100
And this exact
function is not defined

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.000
when x is equal to negative 8.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.870
So now we can write f/g
of x, which is really just

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.900
f of x divided by g of
x, is equal to 2x minus 1

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.720
over x plus 2.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.380
You have to put the condition
there that x cannot be equal

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.470
to negative 8.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.280
If you lost this
condition, then it

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.230
won't be the exact
same function as this,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.009
because this is not defined
when x is equal to negative 8.
