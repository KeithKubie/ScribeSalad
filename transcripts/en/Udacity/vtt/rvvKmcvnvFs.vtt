00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.447
Welcome to Unit 9. As you build larger and more complex programs they quickly

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:08.535
become too big to hold in your head at one time. Time means we need techniques

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.292
to manage complexity. The biggest one we're going to learn about is modularity

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.144
that's breaking a program into pieces, so you don't have to understand the

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:19.814
whole program at once. In this unit we'll look two mechanism python provides,

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:23.519
to help programmers manage complexity modules and classes.
