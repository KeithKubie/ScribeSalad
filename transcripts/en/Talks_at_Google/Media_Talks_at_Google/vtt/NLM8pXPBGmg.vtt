[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.760
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: All right.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.990
DANIEL SIEBERG: So thank
you all for joining us here,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.337
both in person and
on the live stream.

00:00:09.337 --> 00:00:10.420
My name is Daniel Sieberg.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.890
I work on the News
Lab at Google.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.170
We collaborate with
journalists entrepreneurs

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.050
to build the future
of media with Google.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.190
For folks here at Google,
you can go to go/newslab

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.885
to learn more.

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.010
Of course, I think our
guest needs no introduction.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.330
But I want to do that
anyway and call out

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.482
some of the accolades and
awards that Christiane

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:31.440
has had over the years.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.860
So I'm going to do that
if that's all right.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.270
OK, I'm going to
take that as a yes.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.550
Full disclosure-- Christiane
and I worked together

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.487
at CNN many years ago.

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:42.570
I was covering technology.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.770
I was the dorky guy talking
about gadgets and the internet

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.967
and viruses.

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.050
And Christiane was always
in some exotic location.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.410
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: And I
was this the non-geeky person

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.660
who didn't understand a thing.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.275
DANIEL SIEBERG: I
think you were asking

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:55.550
me to help you with your
email on a regular basis.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.100
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, there you go, yeah.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.920
DANIEL SIEBERG: So she's a host
of "Amanpour," as many of you

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.990
know, a Chief International
Correspondent at CNN,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.840
previously Global Affairs
Anchor at ABC News.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.220
Her illustrious career began in
journalism three decades ago.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.110
And we'll talk a little bit
about those origins in a bit.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.970
Her international
reporting began in 1990

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.850
as a correspondent
for CNN, where

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.640
she's reported on international
crises in the Gulf War, Iraq,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.140
Afghanistan, North Korea, the
Palestinian territories, Iran,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.370
Sudan, Israel, Pakistan,
Somalia, Rwanda, the Balkans,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.264
Egypt, and Libya.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:29.180
Am I missing anything?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.800
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Probably, but it's OK.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: Kind of
reads like a list of vacation

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.840
spots for many of us.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.055
We just can't wait to go
to some of those places.

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:37.770
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I
still have the travel bug.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.730
DANIEL SIEBERG: Do you?

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.720
OK, we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.971
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
We can talk about that.

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:41.860
DANIEL SIEBERG:
She's interviewed

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.151
most of the top world leaders
over the past two decades

00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.990
and received every
major broadcast award,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.460
including an Inaugural
Television Academy

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.200
Award, 10 News and Documentary
Emmys, four George Foster

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.870
Peabody awards, and
nine honorary degrees.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.510
She's a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.350
and a Commander of
the Most Excellent

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.050
Order of the British Empire--
you were born in London, as I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.950
recall-- and an honorary citizen
of Sarajevo, and to top it off,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.009
a graduate of the
University of Rhode Island.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.310
Any other URI grads here?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.810
No?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.637
OK.

00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:14.470
It's a small school.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.760
Isn't it a relatively
small school?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.810
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: No,
it's a big school actually,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.680
the big state school
state in Rhode Island,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.985
small state, big school.

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:21.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: So listen.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.100
It's funny because I
know we've sort of known

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.240
each other over the years.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.660
And I, in my life, have
done a number of interviews

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.700
with lots of people.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.270
But when I got to thinking
about doing this interview,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.050
I got all nervous.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.660
And I thought, my
gosh, I'm interviewing

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.520
Christiane Amanpour.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.730
She's this interviewer
who's interviewed all

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.270
these amazing world leaders.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.780
Who am I?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.154
How am I going to
get this right?

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:42.770
So I want to start off
by getting some tips

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860
on interviewing from you.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.080
And I'm going to try to
steal some of those secrets

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.580
and tips--

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.940
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
You don't really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550
think I'm going to give
you my secrets, do you?

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: I mean,
it's just us, right.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.901
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: No,
it's really not just us.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:53.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.750
It's not only not
just us here, it's

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.465
not just us connected online.

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:58.460
DANIEL SIEBERG:
Virtually, everywhere.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.250
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Yeah, virtually.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.125
DANIEL SIEBERG: You know
what I want to know?

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.400
I want to know how and why
some of these world leaders

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.880
keep coming back to you,
when you're certainly

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630
less than nice, shall
we say, to some of them.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.470
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
It's a good question.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.178
Some people think I'm
too tough, and they

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:12.280
don't agree to talk to me.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.570
And that's a problem.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.525
And there are quite hefty holes
in my world leader selection.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.170
I'm still working
on a lot of them.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.910
But if you really
want me to give you

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.950
one tip, the only tip I really
know is to be thoroughly,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.650
thoroughly, thoroughly,
thoroughly, informed.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.060
And when you go to sit in
front of a world leader

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.435
or somebody who has a major
position of responsibility

00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.840
and you're meant to get
information or hold them

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.880
accountable, you
can't just prepare

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.042
as if you're preparing for
a sound bite interview,

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:41.250
for a three-minute interview.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.450
There's a huge amount of
research and self-education

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.460
that goes into it.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.810
And I have a fantastic
team-- some of them

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750
are here-- who really help me.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.560
And it's really vital
because that's it.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.490
When you're sitting
in front of somebody

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.920
and you have to
ask them questions

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.710
that may be the last
questions you ever

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.356
ask this person because maybe
you'll never see them again.

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:04.730
Either they won't
let you, or you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.710
won't have that opportunity.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.240
Your role and your
job is not to be liked

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.050
and not to necessarily sit
down and have a nice sort of,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.360
scratch my back, I'll scratch
yours kind of conversation.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.990
You know you've
got to get in there

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.130
and get the kind of ounces
that actually our viewers want

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.210
us to get.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.070
And it is true that in America,
the tone of an interview

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.700
is much more genteel and
friendly, even with a leader,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.340
than it is in England,
as a comparison.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.620
There's a famous broadcast
interviewer called

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.880
Jeremy Paxman in England.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.680
Yes, and he's known as the
Pit Bull, the Interrogator.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.780
I'm nowhere near--

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: "News
Night" was his show.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.090
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
But it takes

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.820
balls to sit in front
of a world leader

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.840
and just hold them accountable.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.669
And even when your feeling
sort of dodgy and nervous--

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.960
and oh, my god, can I ask
him this question or her this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.040
question-- you just have to.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.700
And so it's due.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.867
There's a lot of adrenaline.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.533
You're sitting on the
edge of your seat.

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.840
You want to make sure you've
asked the right question.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.965
Because presumably, that's
what our viewers, that's

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:09.210
what our online community,
that's what people

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.540
want us to us because we're
their representatives.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: Let me ask
you about a specific example

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.889
with that.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.440
In 2002 with Yasser Arafat,
you were on the phone

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.084
with him, while he was
surrounded in his compound.

00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:23.000
And you asked him some
pretty tough questions.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.710
And he called you out,
in a sense, right?

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.876
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: He did.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.910
Well, when we say,
Yasser Arafat,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.740
it's like an ancient era.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.430
Isn't it?

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.930
This was in 2002, and
he was a big deal back

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.640
then, head of the Palestinians.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.640
And Ariel Sharon was the
prime minister of Israel.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.420
And there'd been some
suicide bombings in Israel.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.820
And as a result, there
was a another war

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.280
between Israel and the
Palestinian territories.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.710
And Sharon decided to
reinvade the West Bank

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.770
and go all the way to
Arafat's headquarters.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.370
And of course, he was
the Palestinian Authority

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.082
President.

00:05:57.082 --> 00:05:59.290
So everybody was trying to
get an interview with him.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.960
And we couldn't go there
because there were barricades.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.810
And it wasn't possible to get
through the Isreali blockades.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.170
And so we thought it was a great
scoop to get him on the phone.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.190
And I'm standing in
Israel, in Jerusalem.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.020
And I'm interviewing
him live on the phone.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.560
And I think I asked him
something like, President

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.900
Arafat, can you assure the
Israelis that you arent'

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.850
responsible for
these suicide bombs?

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.380
And how is it like that?

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.797
And he-- you should know you're
speaking to General Arafat.

00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:31.380
And he basically
told me to go to hell

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.160
and hung the phone up, on live
television, which some people

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.430
thought was great TV.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.970
In those days, we didn't have
the viral thing, you know.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.300
There wasn't YouTube.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.860
And I mean, it just
didn't happen back then.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.694
But is as it went, it
was pretty exciting.

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:48.610
And I thought this was
terrible for my career.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.782
But everybody else
though it was great.

00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:52.119
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:53.910
As you say, compelling
television to watch.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.480
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: It was
compelling television, yes.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: Let's
fast forward a little bit

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.064
to some of the sort
of news of the day.

00:06:58.064 --> 00:07:00.770
I would love to get your
take on the situation in Iran

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.360
and the nuclear deal there
or framework for a deal,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.515
if you will.

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:07.390
I'm sure folks know you
have Iranian descent.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.887
Your father is Iranian.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.970
Aside from that, I know
you've spent a lot of time

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.230
in the region.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.910
What is your take on this deal?

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.420
Is this going to define
the Obama presidency

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.840
from a foreign
policy standpoint?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.390
Is it further fracturing
relationships with Israel?

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.789
What's the sort of mood that
you're getting from people

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:26.830
that you're interviewing?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.621
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, you see, there's

00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:30.740
this narrow thing that's
called the nuclear deal.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.670
And then as everything
else around it,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.520
which causes all the noise
and all the kind of questions

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.730
that you're asking.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.870
For 35 years, United
States and Iran

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.890
have been enemies, adversaries.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.044
It's been hostility since
the Islamic Revolution of '79

00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:46.460
and particularly
since the hostage

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.700
crisis, which you remember--
I can't remember how many now.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.622
But more than 50 diplomats
were taken hostage for 444 days

00:07:55.622 --> 00:07:56.580
by the revolutionaries.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.140
And that killed the relationship
between Iran and the US.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.960
And they have not had
diplomatic relations since then.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.630
And fast forward ot when Iran
started its nuclear program.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.830
It always maintained that
its program was peaceful,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.320
but the world didn't believe it.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.880
And so there's
been a huge amount

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.750
of, again, tension between
Iran and the rest of the world.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.560
Never mind the other stuff that
it's accused of-- terrorism,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.700
supporting the bad
guys in Lebanon

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.130
and the Palestinian territories,
et cetera, plus human rights,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.270
and oppression of
people at home.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.159
Just strictly on
the nuclear matter,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.750
nobody could figure out
how to deal with Iran.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.284
What are you going
to do, bomb them?

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:38.700
You going to go
go to another war,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.884
after Iraq and Afghanistan?

00:08:39.884 --> 00:08:42.630
The President, I don't
think, wants to do that.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.390
The Europeans don't
want to do that.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.165
I don't think Israel
wants to do that.

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:50.280
Are you going to sanction
them for the rest of eternity?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.230
Well, the sanctions
actually have

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.840
caused them to be more
proficient in their technology.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.430
Because just like-- I hope
this isn't controversial.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.360
But you all are incredibly
clever engineers

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.280
and technological experts.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.170
And as you know,
Iranians are also

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.235
very, very clever
technology and engineers.

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:10.860
And many of them are
in Silicon Valley.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.600
But those at home
have managed to build

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.400
their own nuclear program
at home, from scratch--

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.590
centrifuges, mastering the
enrichment cycle, the fuel

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.727
cycle, and all the rap.

00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:24.060
And they have it in their heads.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.460
So this was going ahead, and
despite all the sanctions,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.060
more and more centrifuges,
more and more spinning, more

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.780
and more stockpile of uranium,
higher and higher levels

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.530
of enrichment.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.690
Things weren't going well.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.470
And the most Draconian
sanctions in the history

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.110
of international sanctions
were placed on Iran.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.460
So fast forward to
President Obama,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.710
who decided to try
a different tack.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.290
And probably all of
you remember when

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.350
he was in a debate
before the 2008 election.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.800
He was asked, what would you
do with North Korea, Iran, et

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.300
cetera?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.700
He said, I would negotiate.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.590
And he was roundly
chastised and mocked.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.800
But the truth of
the matter is that

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.970
thanks to the election
of President Rouhani,

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.730
who's a moderate and
who the people in Iran

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.140
would like to see much more
freedoms and more engagement

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.920
with the rest of the world.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.160
Rouhani basically said, when
he came into office, OK.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.660
I have got to get
these sanctions lifted.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.260
Our economy sucks.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.980
We have a million more people
in the job market every year.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.359
We can't provide jobs for them.

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:27.400
And therefore, we have to
do something different.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.900
So it was great timing.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.110
And he and President
Obama decided

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.775
to have these negotiations.

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:35.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: But
now they're saying,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.020
they want the sanctions
lifted immediately.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.260
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, listen, I've

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.850
been doing this on
my program today.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.170
First of all, there was
a lot of mistranslation.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.990
President Rouhani said, "the
sanctions must be lifted"--

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.700
and of course, this
is part of the deal--

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.720
"upon implementation
of the deal."

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.900
And that's exactly what
the agreement says.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.040
And that's what the US
Energy Secretary Ernest

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.520
Moniz told me this week.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.610
And there it
mistranslated to say,

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.670
sanctions must be lifted
as the deal is signed.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.609
But of course, we're
not out of the woods.

00:11:02.609 --> 00:11:04.400
There are three more
months of negotiation.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.370
There are very, very
difficult issues.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.950
I believe sanctions will
be a difficult issue,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.610
because if they're not
lifted within a relatively

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.750
reasonable period of time, I
don't think Iran will sign on.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.430
And I don't know
whether everybody

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.540
knows the parameters of
exactly the times and all

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.230
the rest of it.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.479
And of course, still, you
have the hard-liners causing

00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:24.710
a lot of trouble in Iran.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.440
But the supreme leader has s
sort of-- he's on a seesaw.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.590
He said, "I don't disagree,
and I don't agree."

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.410
So he's sort of
hedging his bets.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.010
All the others have
fallen into line--

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.760
the heads of the army,
the revolutionary guard,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.885
the Speaker of he Parliament,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:40.510
So it's interesting.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.930
DANIEL SIEBERG: Absolutely.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.330
There are the critics who
would say too that it's just

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.830
being kicked down the road.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.345
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I don't think it's

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:46.060
being kicked down the road.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.640
DANIEL SIEBERG: There's
still an opportunity

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.650
to come back to this later.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.720
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
There might be.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.245
But I think this is
important enough just

00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:51.536
to spend a bit more time on it.

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:53.120
And I spent a lot
of time in Iran.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.536
And to be honest
with you, this is

00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:56.600
where I believe
journalism is important.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.730
You go to the sources.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.740
You talk to the people.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.620
You don't just talk
to talking heads.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.480
So I've spoken to
the leaders in Iran.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.420
I've spoken to the energy
secretary here and other people

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.240
around them.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.640
And yes, it's not perfect.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.690
Perfect would be no
program whatsoever.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.750
They want a civilian program.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.300
They needed to
negotiate to save face.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.710
That's what negotiation is.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.620
It's compromise.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.450
It's not a zero sum game.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.260
And this is the compromise.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.120
But some of these provisions,
for instance, the inspections

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.380
and things, they
last, apparently,

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.500
forever and most
definitely for 25 years.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.120
And it will be about
transparency, i.e.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.870
Inspections and reducing the
nuclear stockpile, et cetera,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.930
that will make people know
whether this is going to work

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.430
or not.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: I should
say, from what I've seen,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.540
the critics who've
talked about it

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.720
don't have a great alternative
strategy for any of this

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.220
either.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.050
So if it's not this, what is it?

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.490
And along those lines,
what is your sense

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.210
of the appetite
for news like that,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.830
for foreign news, if you will,
for people who live in the US.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.810
Because when I travel
around, I get a sense

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.860
that people are just more
interested in what's happening

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.670
in the rest of the world.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.760
Maybe that's just my own bias.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.520
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
No, you're right.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.330
And I think it's a change.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.260
Over these last few years,
maybe the last year,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.790
the last couple of
years, there have

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.300
been such cataclysmic stories
from all over the globe,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.540
from the downing or the
disappearance of flight MH-370

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.970
to the rise of ISIS
to Ukraine and Russia

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.173
to the Iran negotiations,
all these things.

00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:34.380
And CNN has reverted to its
wheelhouse, to its sweet spot,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.550
because we were the first
real international news

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.740
organization.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.260
And when Ted Turner started
CNN as a startup back in 1980,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.140
that was his mission,
to bring the world

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.440
to the American people
and to be able to be

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.590
the electronic diplomat,
if you like, of the world.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.350
And that is what CNN has been.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.270
Introduce the world
to the American people

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.900
and introduce the American
people to the world.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.400
And it's been an
amazing accomplishment.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.490
And right now, over the
last couple of years,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.500
you'll see, if you even watch
CNN USA, what we see here

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.060
in the United States, a lot more
of these important foreign news

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.560
stories.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.670
And guess what?

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.240
We're doing really
well, based on this.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.960
We're doing better than
we've done a long, long time.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.860
So it's great, and
of course, obviously,

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.980
the domestic stories as well.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.329
But no more can we say, that
foreign news doesn't sell.

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:30.745
Or foreign new is
not interesting.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: It
doesn't affect us.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.075
It's not about us.

00:14:32.075 --> 00:14:32.330
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
And certainly

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.121
that it doesn't affect
us, because it done.

00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:36.690
And I was just thinking,
wow, isn't this amazing.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.580
You've also got Trevor
Noah, a South African,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.660
who's just been named
to replace John Stewart.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.980
You've got John Oliver at HBO
doing a fantastic weekly satire

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.700
program, which is
really successful.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.530
They're foreigners,
but it doesn't matter.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.890
We're all in the same
pot, so to speak.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's fantastic.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.930
So you touched on
early days at CNN.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.500
You started in
1983, is that right?

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.390
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Yes, I did, yeah.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: So
I started in 2000.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.950
And when I was there, it
was a right around the time

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.490
that Time Warner was
being merged with AOL.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.090
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Those were days

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.330
that people thought were
full of hope and promise.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.630
But it was not good for us.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.463
DANIEL SIEBERG: It
didn't work out that way.

00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:19.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:21.140
Maybe we can get into
that another time.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.830
But when I was there,
I heard stories

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.390
about the sort of
early days of CNN,

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.890
that Ted would come
down in his pajamas

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.730
and be in the control room and
be talking to the people there.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.644
And what was your
interaction with him like?

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.060
As you say, it was
like a startup.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.285
And nobody knew if it
was going to succeed.

00:15:40.285 --> 00:15:41.660
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Nobody knew.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.930
And if you read the
books-- remember,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.370
I wasn't there from day one,
but it was still really young

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.410
when I got there.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.230
And first of all, there
were lots of-- just

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.310
like in the startups
today, there

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.720
were lots of young people, many
of whom hadn't gone to graduate

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.630
Most of us hadn't gotten
graduate Journalism degrees.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.600
We thought we'd do
that on the job at CNN

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.890
and then maybe go,
if we were lucky,

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.390
and get a job in the big
time, somewhere else,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.810
in a network or whatever.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.390
Who knew that CNN would
become the big time?

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:13.040
And I remember being told
that in the very early days,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.960
sometimes Ted couldn't
make the payroll.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.090
It was really touch and go,
hand to mouth and sort of trying

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.730
to stretch a piece of string.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.660
But he is a genius.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.440
I mean, he is a genius.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.350
He's a quintessentially
American genius.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.020
And he has been on
the cutting edge

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.350
of every major movement
of not just this country,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.675
but of our 20th century.

00:16:37.675 --> 00:16:39.050
DANIEL SIEBERG:
The environment--

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.570
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, the environment,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.180
rapprochement between the
Soviet Union and the West,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.440
when that wasn't cool, just
ahead of the-- you know,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.210
years before the
Berlin Wall fell down.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.940
Obviously, broadcast-- he was
cable before cable was cool,

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:59.869
the first television station
to go international and many

00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:00.410
other things.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.090
Philanthropy, he was one of
the first great philanthropists

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.820
of the late 20th century.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.424
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think
he's one of the largest

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:05.760
private landowners in the
United States as well.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.990
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: That's
absolutely true, yeah.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.869
So it's been remarkable, and
to work for somebody like that

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:14.050
and to start off as a
young person at the bottom

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.480
of the career ladder.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.349
DANIEL SIEBERG: What
was your job like then?

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.557
Desk assistant, is that the--

00:17:18.557 --> 00:17:20.750
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah,
I was kind of a gopher.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.690
I mean, really, it had the title
Desk Assistant, Foreign Desk

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.190
Assistant.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.482
And then Ted abolished the word

00:17:26.482 --> 00:17:27.981
DANIEL SIEBERG:
Right, that's right.

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.710
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah, that
was because nobody is foreign.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.950
DANIEL SIEBERG: It was sort of
a negative connotation to it.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.908
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Yeah, we're international.

00:17:33.908 --> 00:17:35.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.650
Yeah.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.320
So you know, I
was a little upset

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.278
because I wanted to be
a foreign correspondent,

00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:42.680
not an international
correspondent, in any event.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.350
DANIEL SIEBERG: And
how did you get-- I

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.240
know there's a
lit of things that

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.510
happen between
being a desk assist

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.650
and getting to
where you are now.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.660
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Not in those days,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.720
it was less actually.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: Really?

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.350
OK.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.516
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Because
it was-- we were young.

00:17:52.516 --> 00:17:55.400
And they need all the
talent they could get.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.550
And if you worked
hard and showed them

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.700
that you wanted
a little bit more

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.450
than just sort of
punching the clock

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.190
and coming in for your
own prescribed hours,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.930
there was the
opportunity to move ahead

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.320
in a very vertical way, which
is so much more difficult now

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.430
in all organizations.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.030
But CNN-- well, Time
Warner is 4,000 people.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.623
It's huge.

00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:17.590
We were maybe a couple
of hundred people

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.960
at CNN at that time.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.020
So it was little, really little.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.200
So I was on I was on the desk.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.240
I did a lot of
dusting and cleaning.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.830
I did a lot of talking
to the correspondents

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.120
and typing in their
scripts, because we

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.750
didn't have what we have now.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.560
We didn't have email
and all the rest of it.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.830
There's a little bit of top-line
kind of in-house messaging.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.140
Sitting in the feed room and
logging the feeds that came in

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.611
from all over the
world and every minute

00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:50.610
just feeling more and
more excited about wanting

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.510
to get out there, so
I then taught myself

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.740
how to write for the news.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.910
In other words, I would
come in on my own time,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.674
bug that producers.

00:18:58.674 --> 00:19:00.590
Please, can I write
something for you, please?

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.840
And I would come in on the
weekends and this and that.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.792
And gradually, I
worked my way up

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:06.000
and then I became a producer.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.679
And then in a moment of sort
of-- I need something more.

00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:14.720
If you're not going to
let me be a correspondent,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.660
I'm going to have to leave.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.680
So I did.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.030
But luckily, we had a
really wonderful president

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.080
called Bert Reinhard.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.930
He's not alive anymore.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.730
But he was a great, great guy.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.510
And he said to a
colleague in New York.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.370
He said, this girl, she's OK.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.790
We don't really
want lose her yet.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.290
Let's see.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.510
She might work out.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.100
So grab her for a
little freelance stuff.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.060
So I came to New York.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.680
And they picked
me up in New York.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.310
And the rest is CNN.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.760
DANIEL SIEBERG:
At what moment did

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.679
you get the bug, to sort
of say, I love this.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:47.970
I can't envision anything else?

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.270
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I got the bug late.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.200
It wasn't that I was
five years and always

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.532
wanted to be a correspondent
or a journalist.

00:19:54.532 --> 00:19:55.740
I didn't know about anything.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.230
I grew up in a very
privileged, nice life in Iran.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.970
We were in a monarchy.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.230
We didn't know about the
First Amendment or freedom

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.620
of expression.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.960
We know about democracy.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.100
And then there was
the revolution.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.640
And my whole world sort
of turned upside down.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.820
And I knew then I
couldn't rely on my dad.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.260
And I didn't want
to get married.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.460
And I just wanted to know
work and do something.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.790
And I realized watching the
revolution-- I was old enough

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.250
to see it, understand
it, be there--

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.220
I lived through it-- that
actually, this was really

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.260
interesting and
that I would like

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.370
to be able to tell these kinds
of stories and explain them.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.900
And then that led to journalism.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.240
And then I came to America,
went to university, made

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.150
good friends, one of whom
is here in the audience.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.620
And then I went to CNN.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.120
Yeah.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.328
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you've
been to these places which

00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:50.340
are dangerous.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.702
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah.

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:52.365
DANIEL SIEBERG: Often--

00:20:52.365 --> 00:20:53.448
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah.

00:20:53.448 --> 00:20:56.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you keep
going back or have gone back.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.800
And I can't imagine how
this doesn't affect you

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.300
in some way, emotionally,
psychologically,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.337
like a lot of war
correspondents or others

00:21:05.337 --> 00:21:07.170
who are exposed to these
types of atrocities

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.980
and harrowing events.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.830
There's an ad campaign running
right now for CNN called

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.400
"Go There." and you're featured
in it talking about it,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.560
in a sense, what that's like.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.040
What is that like?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.800
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, look--

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.550
I don't want to minimize
it because it is really

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.184
very dangerous.

00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:26.850
And it's actually
gotten more dangerous.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.150
I would say, exponentially
more dangerous,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.950
because it used to be that
journalists, by and large, were

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.430
killed in the crossfire.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:41.280
That was the risk you
took when you went to war.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.530
But now, journalists are
deliberately targeted.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.170
You've seen the truly
horrendous stuff

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.220
that's been going on with
our colleagues who've

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.490
been beheaded by ISIS.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.460
You've seen people all over
the world thrown in jail,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.250
abused, shut down.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:04.012
Even in this country, you've
had practically prosecutions

00:22:04.012 --> 00:22:04.970
of certain journalists.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.190
It hasn't happened, but a lot of
pressure on journalists because

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.360
of various sourcing
and not wanting

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.171
to release their
sources, et cetera.

00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:16.420
So it's really, really
difficult and really dangerous.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.570
And I spent a lot
of time doing that

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.947
for an extended period of time.

00:22:21.947 --> 00:22:24.030
I always say that had I
been married or had a kid,

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.640
I probably wouldn't have
been able to do that then.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.770
Because you have a
responsibility, when you

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.090
have a family, to stay alive.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.770
And when you're young,
you don't think--

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:32.427
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:32.427 --> 00:22:33.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's true.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.850
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
When you're young,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:35.974
you don't think about that.

00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:37.780
You think you're immortal.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.450
And you just want
to do the story.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.620
But the older I get, the
more I realize that it

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.990
has had a very, very deep toll.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.960
It's taken a tough toll on me.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.090
And I'm very lucky that I have
a very good family and very

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.860
good friends.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.210
And I'm able to put my
energy that might destroy me

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.850
into my work still.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.060
But you know, I've seen
some horrible things.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.430
I've also seen
some great things.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.510
And I've also seen how
this platform can really

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.580
make a difference.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.490
I would say that we made
a difference in Bosnia.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.120
We made a difference in Kosovo.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.600
The problem was that we
weren't there in Rwanda,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.710
so we made a
difference for the bad.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.300
Something terrible
happened in Rwanda

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.590
because we weren't there
in a critical mass.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:32.870
So I'm very conscious of the
massive power of this platform

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.850
and how I use it.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.590
And I'm conscious now
that I have a voice,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.080
and I have a big
megaphone at CNN.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.800
And how to use it is very,
very important to me.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.740
DANIEL SIEBERG: Let's sort of
build on that for a second.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.847
So you also have 1.3
million Twitter followers.

00:23:46.847 --> 00:23:47.930
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Do I?

00:23:50.657 --> 00:23:52.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: I'm one
of them, by the way.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.140
I'm sure some people
in here are as well.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.750
And I know that you
were very involved

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.770
in covering the Arab Spring
and what grew out of that.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.360
Television as a platform is
obviously still very powerful.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.790
And then CNN manifests in lots
of different ways-- CNN.com,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.860
may mobile devices, and so on.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.320
But I would love
to get your take

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.407
on the role of social media
during the Arab Spring

00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:15.240
and kind of after that
and if you've seen it

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.420
in other parts of the
world and galvanizing

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.290
people around ideas.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.440
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: It's a very
complex question, because you

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.740
can say, oh wow, it's great.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.979
And it causes revolutions
and this and that.

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:27.270
I don't actually think it does.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.060
I think what social
media in this-- I'm

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.810
talking now about the Arab
Spring and the other countries

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:38.610
that don't have other ways of
avowed political organization.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.930
The social media has
been the only method

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.630
of political organization.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.750
And that has been
phenomenally important, really

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.760
phenomenally important,
in countries like Iran,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.180
where people actually are not
meant to be on social media.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.814
But of course, they're so smart
that they keep figuring out

00:24:55.814 --> 00:24:56.980
how to get across firewalls.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.725
And there's a cat and mouse
game with the authorities.

00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:02.930
And they try to cut
it down in China

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.320
and all these other places.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.189
They can really reach out.

00:25:06.189 --> 00:25:07.730
And it's really
very, very important.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.563
Because sometimes, it's
the only connection.

00:25:09.563 --> 00:25:11.317
And as I said, more
importantly, the only

00:25:11.317 --> 00:25:12.275
political organization.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.270
So that's one
thing, that's good.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.410
But I think you'll find that
a lot of people in the Arab

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.560
Spring, like the
people-- oh, my god,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.880
his name has just gone out of
my-- Waleed, no, not Waleed.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.490
Anyway, you remember the guy
who was so famous who created

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.220
the big platform in Egypt?

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.720
AUDIENCE: Wael Ghonim.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.100
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Wael
Ghonim, Wael Ghonim, yeah.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.180
I think he and others
like him are disappointed,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.180
because maybe they
put too much belief

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.820
and all their hopes for
the future of government

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.720
in this platform.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.830
And I don't want
to see the ease,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.070
because it came at a high price.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.790
A lot of people
were killed in Egypt

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.400
before there was the revolution.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.390
But nonetheless, it
happened fairly quickly.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.140
The resolution in Iran
in 1978 took a year.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.660
In Egypt, it took
a couple of weeks.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.650
That's a huge, huge,
huge-- and media

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.010
and social media is partly
responsible for that.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.640
DANIEL SIEBERG:
Accelerating that.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.090
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: For sure.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.760
But then, what
happens afterwards?

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.110
So I think there's that
to consider as well.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.500
I like social media
for myself because I

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.150
like to use it for my show.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.912
And I like to be able to
reach an audience that doesn't

00:26:29.912 --> 00:26:31.120
necessarily watch television.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.453
Now, I can't believe that
people don't watch television.

00:26:33.453 --> 00:26:34.880
As I say, I'm a dinosaur.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.060
But if you ask my son
and people apparently

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.540
up to 40 or whatever, they
don't watch television.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.500
So yes, CNN is doing all
these multi-platforms

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.470
so that people can
actually go and get

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.131
all this stuff in the best,
most-convenient, most-tech way

00:26:48.131 --> 00:26:48.630
they want.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.750
And that's what's happening.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.710
And that's what it is.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.030
So that's great.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:56.150
Now, I have a son, young people.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.500
And I want to know
whether they're

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.560
fully aware of all
some of the intrusions,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.800
some of the lack of
privacy, some of the-- you

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.600
can't take it back
kind of reality

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.570
that our young people
grow up in right now.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.240
I'm constantly telling him,
don't me on your smartphone

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.000
all the time.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.190
Look at people, talk,
converse, learn, read.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.830
Listen, he's super smart,
and he's really good.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.250
But that kind of worries me.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.680
I once thought to myself, I
should do a little mini doc.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.360
I used to ride my bike
to work every day.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.210
And every day, I would see
mothers or fathers or nannies

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.929
or sitters or whatever
with the kids.

00:27:38.929 --> 00:27:40.720
They weren't looking
at the kids or talking

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.390
to the kids-- like this.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.500
And I wonder what that
does for communications.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.771
I wonder what it does
for brain rewiring.

00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:49.520
And I wonder what it
does for young people

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.810
to make ordinary mistakes.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.740
People make mistakes
in their life.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.990
But now, every mistake
is there for the taking.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.060
So I think that's interesting.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.790
And then we have some
of the controversies,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.537
even around Google,
around the NSA,

00:28:04.537 --> 00:28:06.120
around what the
government-- you know,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.270
PRISM and all of these things.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.110
The world, we're all way
too plugged-in in my view.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:20.880
Do I want all my emails rerouted
through the NSA or whatever?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.820
No.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: It probably
goes back to be awareness.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.740
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: And you
saw going to all of the talking

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.545
to Edward Snowden, right?

00:28:26.545 --> 00:28:27.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:27.600
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, I'm not

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.130
going to pick up what he
said about the pictures.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.250
But you know what I mean.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.375
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.670
It's a good point.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.870
So listen, I want to dig into
your career arch a little bit,

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.570
if we can.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.990
Ben Sherwood,
President of ABC News--

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.440
I'm trying to imagine
how the "This Week"

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.130
conversations came to
be, when you went to--

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.500
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: He wasn't
the President of ABC News.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:48.760
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's right.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.936
He wasn't at the time.

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:50.810
Well, when I started.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:51.850
I wasn't hire by him.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: So
but how did it start?

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.030
What was the Genesis to the--

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.970
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Again,
it was sort of serendipitous.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.870
They had to moved people around.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.990
George Stephanopoulos, was, I
think, going to morning news.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: "Good
Morning America."

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.623
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah,
"Good Morning America,"

00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:12.560
rather and just a series of
conversations between David

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.380
Weston and some other of
my friends at that ABC

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.660
and at Disney that this
might be a good idea--

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.080
and I like to
think that maybe it

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.890
was an idea ahead of its time.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:30.720
Because clearly, I wasn't going
there to be a Sunday morning

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.660
political anchor in Washington.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:39.990
That wasn't what I though I was
doing or what I'd agreed to do,

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.200
nor what I would be good
at, because that's not

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:42.960
my wheelhouse.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.320
That's not what I've done.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.590
So I hoped to be able to simply
broaden the conversation,

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:54.130
to yes, do politics, maybe do it
slightly differently than it'd

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.480
been done in the past, maybe
break the form-- not break,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.670
but break out a little bit and
do a lot more of the world,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.250
which we're seeing now.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.050
So I say, maybe I
was ahead of my time.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.960
What can I tell you?

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.694
Anyway, it didn't work out,
although I had a fabulous time.

00:30:08.694 --> 00:30:10.110
I really did have
a fabulous time.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.920
I met some amazing
people, worked

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.520
with some amazing people,
got to see network news

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.410
firsthand, having been
at CNN all my broadcast,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.335
all my professional life.

00:30:23.335 --> 00:30:25.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: What
did you learn from that?

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.020
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I
learned quite a lot of things.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.390
I learned that I did a
very good documentary.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.330
It was really good,
very successful.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.660
I learned some of the
commercial pressures,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.410
which actually exist everywhere,
frankly, even at CNN.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:48.170
I learned also not to
be afraid to take a risk

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.110
and not to be afraid
to recognize when

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.350
something doesn't turn out.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.270
To me, it's not
a failure at all.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:00.000
I learned a huge amount,
and I came back to CNN.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.100
And I wouldn't-- I don't regret
a moment of it, obviously.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.150
It would have been fun, if
the model had worked out.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:13.070
Because I do think that, as
you can see with the ratings,

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.280
less and less people watch
the Sunday morning shows.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.970
And I never wanted to be inside
Washington, inside the beltway,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.250
talking in weird jargon
just to yourself,

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.320
which essentially-- and
the same faces every week,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.190
saying the same things.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.480
And I also, because
I came, I think,

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.340
from outside the comfort
zone of politics,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:45.640
I was really used to
being slightly more

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.660
willing to compromise access.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:55.250
Access wasn't my top priority.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: There's a nice
parallel between the learning

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.030
from your experiences
and if it didn't work out

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.150
with the tech space.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.430
This is something that, at
Google, we talk a lot about,

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.684
sort of failing fast
or acknowledging

00:32:08.684 --> 00:32:09.975
that something didn't work out.

00:32:09.975 --> 00:32:11.808
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Failure is not all this

00:32:11.808 --> 00:32:13.822
it's worked out to be.

00:32:13.822 --> 00:32:14.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: No, no.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.331
I think that failure has
a number of definitions.

00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:19.247
I think that if something
is a total flop then

00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:20.330
it could be a failure.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.860
And then it could be
a learning experience.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.776
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I
tell you another thing.

00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:25.880
Look, we also raise a
young generation that

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:31.680
is at risk of
believing and feeling

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.200
that they have to succeed every
single step of the way, or else

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.730
life is a failure.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.410
It's just not real.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.750
Some of the most
successful people

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:44.150
can stumble occasionally.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.870
It's about whether you can
get up afterwards, obviously.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.770
But it's also about what
you learn about what's real.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.770
What are your real expectations?

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.430
So many young people sometimes
feel somewhat entitled,

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.800
like OK, so I came here.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.130
I punched my card in.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.460
Tomorrow I want to be up here.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.920
I want to be your boss.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.760
I'm exaggerating for effect.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.490
But I have had a lot
of people ask me,

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.920
how do I get to do what you do.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.490
So I say, well, if
you've got 35 years--

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.850
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
No, but seriously, I

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.586
think that we should
all understand that.

00:33:16.586 --> 00:33:18.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: And
I want to be clear.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.810
I'm not calling your time
at "This Week" a failure.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.110
I'm really not saying that all.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.818
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I'm not embarrassed.

00:33:22.818 --> 00:33:24.710
I'm not embarrassed,
because I went out there

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.890
to do something different.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.579
And they weren't
willing or didn't

00:33:28.579 --> 00:33:30.370
want to do something
different at the time.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.810
The times we did
something different,

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.935
I had a great time with
the current President James

00:33:33.935 --> 00:33:38.900
Galston, who at the time
was an EP of "Nightline"

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.820
and transformed "Nightline" and
his deputy Jim Murray Condon.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.110
And they were sort
of in charge of me.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:51.340
And we did some really
great stuff on the road

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.830
in the "This Week"
time I was there.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.440
That was really successful.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.510
I mean, you could say that
I kicked ass during the Arab

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.900
Spring for "This Week."

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.840
I got more Mubarak.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.630
I got Gaddafi.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.680
Nobody else did.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.470
So this was very good.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.200
It was a very, very
good experience.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.780
And I was able to put it on
American network television.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.679
And that was great.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.649
So a lot of things
worked out really well.

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:16.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: I love
the kicked ass part.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.731
I think that's absolutely true.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.100
Has there been an
interview where

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.862
you felt like-- not that
it went badly or well--

00:34:26.862 --> 00:34:28.570
but when that you
would like to do again,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.460
one that you could
go back and say,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.710
I'd like to do this one again.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.001
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah,
probably Slobodan Milosevic,

00:34:34.001 --> 00:34:34.980
during the Bosnia War.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.090
But there are many.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:36.870
There are many.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.840
Because I only met him--
I met him the once,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.850
and it was just as I was-- he
was in Europe, if I remember.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.670
It was either Strasbourg or
Salzburg or one of those.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:51.310
And there was an
attempt to stop the war.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.929
And this was right
as it was starting.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.380
And Milosevic was
going full steam ahead

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.420
to carve out this part
of Bosnia for himself

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.510
and this part of the Balkans.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.741
And I didn't know
enough at that time

00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:05.240
because I hadn't
been on the ground.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.330
And I just got this
interview with him.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.560
And I did ask him a
question, which at the time

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.830
was quite bold.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.210
I kind of pounded him
about all the people

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.490
who were being killed.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.810
How do you sleep at night?

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.970
I was literally on the edge
of my seat and in his face.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.280
And he kept trying
to offer me whisky.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.460
And I promise you.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.150
I promise you.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.960
And I knew that I
obviously couldn't do that.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.790
But it was shot.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.850
And he never spoke to
me again, never, never.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.550
So I wish I'd been
able to redo that,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.160
once I'd been there for a few
months or a couple of years.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.480
And yeah, there are a lot.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: And today,
who is somebody who you

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:41.260
would like to interview today.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.550
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I mean, look--

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.920
DANIEL SIEBERG: Who's the most
interesting person out there

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.520
now who you --

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.145
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
There are so many.

00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.880
But am I going to
give away my secrets?

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.780
No, everybody has the
same wish list-- the Pope,

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.547
the Queen of
England, Kim Jong Un.

00:35:58.547 --> 00:36:00.130
DANIEL SIEBERG: Talk
to Dennis Rodman.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.830
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
For starters-- I

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.320
tried talking to Dennis Rodman.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:03.640
DANIEL SIEBERG: Really?

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.570
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I
couldn't get through.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.361
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:36:05.361 --> 00:36:07.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.400
Go play some basketball
with him or something.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.840
So you're based in London.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.940
I would love to get a sense
from you-- aside from CNN,

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.560
who's doing news well?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.420
Because as a team
at the News Lab,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.170
we try to look around and find
those news organizations that

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.380
are engaging audiences
and tapping into digital.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.060
Is "The Guardian?

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.140
Who do you feel like?

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.806
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
There are obviously

00:36:30.806 --> 00:36:34.659
a lot of famous, organized
newspapers, television, radio

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:35.200
who's doing--

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.270
DANIEL SIEBERG: There's an
election coming obviously.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.840
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yes.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.960
Look, if you look at the
top newspapers in the United

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.834
States, they're brilliant,
from the "New York

00:36:40.834 --> 00:36:43.320
Times" to the "Wall Street
Journal," "LA Times,"

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.520
et cetera, "Washington Post."

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.480
NPR, WNYC, I always get
the letters transposed.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.350
But public radio is
brilliant, I think.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.560
And I'm a big radio listener,
also BBC World Service, BBC

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.280
Radio 4.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.250
And the tones are
slightly different.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.950
But it's really fascinating.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:08.840
I learn such a lot from
radio and obviously online.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.450
And what's really
interesting for me--

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.280
so I can actually answer
you with a little bit

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.632
of knowledge-- is that
I judge an award that's

00:37:17.632 --> 00:37:18.840
called the Livingston Awards.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.530
I'm one of a panel
of judges on that.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.880
And that's for journalists
35 years and younger.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.310
So it's young journalists.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.840
And in the last several years,
obviously-- and every year,

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.420
we get more online submission.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.050
And the quality
of that journalism

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:38.260
is just phenomenal, from radio,
television, magazines, online.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.870
It's really, really phenomenal--
have print, all that.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:48.340
So I'm very, very encouraged by
the amount of good journalism

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.550
that's going on.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.640
And again, you see at
CNN, you do the hard news.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.140
You do the breaking news.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.450
But then you've got things
like "Parts Unknown"

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.820
by Anthony Bourdain
or any number

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:06.180
of those kinds of programs
around the breaking news that

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.450
expand your knowledge
and give you

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.270
this experience in
a different way.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.730
And I think that's all really,
really interesting as well.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.740
And I think people's
appetite for documentaries

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.980
is really the
heartwarming as well.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.500
Because I often
say, documentarians

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.190
are doing what we
used do as news

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.230
reporters on a daily
basis, because we're not

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.160
doing so much reporting.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.990
There is reporting.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.710
But there's a lot also of
talking heads of discussion

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.050
programs in this and that.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.020
So documentarians are filling a
gap that a lot of organizations

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.880
have left a vacuum.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.070
And I think that's great.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.321
It's really, really great.

00:38:48.321 --> 00:38:49.570
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's exciting.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.780
I have more questions.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.160
There are microphones
in the room.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.520
There are two of them there.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.120
So if you have questions,
please line up.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.580
And we will call on you shortly.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.750
I guess I want to just
touch a little bit

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:11.110
on the idea of journalism as a
whole and media moving forward.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.040
And do you see that the media
industry is a little less

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.790
risk-averse these days?

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.065
Is that what's necessary?

00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:18.440
There's a lot of
concern and hand

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.300
wringing about the future of it.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.030
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Listen,
we have been wringing our hands

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.050
about the future of journalism
for a long, long time.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:30.880
And it's still here,
still alive and well.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.000
We're still reporting for duty.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.930
And I think news of its demise
is obviously way overblown.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.060
And it just depends
on how you do it.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.050
Yes, there are periods of
troughs and valleys and peaks

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.230
and all the rest of it.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.470
And I just think we're at
a good place right now.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.970
I really do.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.640
I mean it's kind of
depressingly good.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.680
There's so much news.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.490
And it's so-- I can't
keep my head on straight.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.120
And I have a daily program
that airs on CNN International

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.030
and online.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.960
You can all see it at
cnn.com, amanpour.com.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.950
And it's really the interviews
and the world leaders

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.350
around the breaking news.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.410
And it's just whoa.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.050
It's like, every
day, you wake up,

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.330
and there's
something cataclysmic

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.460
that's happened overnight.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.470
And I think we'll all
be gainfully employed

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.270
for a long time.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.370
DANIEL SIEBERG: I read
something recently that--

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:24.890
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Which is great

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.389
because there's a
lot of opportunity

00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:30.900
for young journalists, I
Think, a lot of opportunity.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.710
Journalism schools were
worried for a period of time.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.450
What are we going to do
with all these students

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.801
and journalists who we
freshly mint and send out?

00:40:39.801 --> 00:40:41.925
There's a lot of space for
them right now, I think.

00:40:41.925 --> 00:40:43.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: I read
recently-- I'm paraphrasing,

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.570
but it was that some media
companies are in trouble,

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:46.680
because some of them are.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.960
But the journalism
as a whole, it's

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.330
almost like a renaissance
period between data journalism

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.685
and access to audiences.

00:40:53.685 --> 00:40:55.950
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I
think what we do have to be

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:03.050
absolutely clear about-- we have
to be tough and rigorous and be

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.760
the eyes and ears of our
viewers our . clickers,

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.490
our online watchers, everybody.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.490
Do you know what I mean?

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.740
Because you don't want to
be too cozy as a journalist.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.610
And you want to be able
to look at yourself

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:19.740
and look inward and have really
rigorous self-critiques, if you

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.360
like.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.220
What went right?

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.190
What went wrong?

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.640
And I think that's why people
like John Stewart, Steven

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.920
Colbert, the late night
comics have done so, so well.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.940
Because I think for
a period of time,

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.470
there was a credibility gap.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.020
And they filled that
gap in a different way,

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.580
in a way that used
satire and humor.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.360
But they became so trusted.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.830
And I think we need
to understand why

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.180
and understand that we--
trust is our bread and butter.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:55.150
We have to be trusted by
the people who turn to us.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.560
And we have to be trusted
to do the right thing

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.440
and the rigorous thing
and the honest thing.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:05.535
And credibility is
our coin of the realm.

00:42:05.535 --> 00:42:07.326
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's
a big responsibility.

00:42:07.326 --> 00:42:08.450
There are lots of question.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.660
So we'll start maybe over here.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.630
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
That gentleman was first.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.250
AUDIENCE: Sorry, this
might be a little bit odd.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.070
But I guess, the
question fundamentally

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.700
is-- what should Google do?

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.810
Imaging that we
said to you, just

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.320
tell us one thing to
either build or fix,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.300
whatever it is you
want, something you

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.947
need that you don't have today.

00:42:24.947 --> 00:42:26.530
DANIEL SIEBERG:
Christiane personally?

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.200
AUDIENCE: You personally,
for your personal life

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.110
or for your work, whichever--
if you had absolute control

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.430
and you could get Google
to build something,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.805
what would it be?

00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:38.930
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Golly!

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.030
DANIEL SIEBERG:
Imagine the power.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.160
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Wow.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.709
DANIEL SIEBERG: Is Larry
watching right now?

00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:47.250
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: What's that
thing called that transports

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.719
you to different centuries?

00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:51.385
DANIEL SIEBERG: Oh,
like a time machine?

00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:52.925
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah, a
time machine and a teleporter.

00:42:52.925 --> 00:42:53.950
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:54.730
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yes.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: Like
in an hour or two?

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.208
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Look, I would like to say,

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.860
build something that
could cure disease,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.400
the most common diseases.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.880
Bill Gates is doing his best.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.830
But is there some way you can
build some fantastic vaccine

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.090
or whatever, to kill things like
malaria and all the rest of it.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.140
Or do something that
makes all kids go

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.042
to school, those who
want to go to school

00:43:18.042 --> 00:43:19.250
and who need to go to school.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.410
62 million girls are
out of school today

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.070
in the developing world.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.050
Is there some chip
you could implant?

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.970
I'm kidding, but you
know what I mean.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:31.470
Do something that protects
women from the daily assaults

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.600
that they face every
single day in this country

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.680
and every other country,
for no good reason other

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.140
than they're women.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.350
So those are the big
issues that I care about.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.460
But what a great question.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.200
I haven't given
you a good answer

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:51.590
because I'm not technologically
or engineering savvy enough.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.510
Do I want to go to the moon?

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.570
No.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.660
I did once.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.805
I did once.

00:43:56.805 --> 00:43:58.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.200
Thank you.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.700
We'll go to this side next.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.240
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.560
My question is about a book
which is about your grandma,

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.150
I guess, by Bernuth

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.150
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Gosh,
I don't know anything

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.960
about this book.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.710
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.700
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I really don't.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.241
AUDIENCE: So then
I have no question.

00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:19.682
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Aw.

00:44:19.682 --> 00:44:20.765
You're Persian, obviously.

00:44:20.765 --> 00:44:21.330
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.371
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yes.

00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:23.571
AUDIENCE: So maybe ask you--

00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:25.820
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: What
did it say about my grandma?

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.910
AUDIENCE: Very great
things, as a role model.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.570
She's the role model for me.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.160
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Really?

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.350
What's her name?

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.700
AUDIENCE: Hanum.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.030
OK, so I should give--

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.755
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Yes, this is news to me.

00:44:39.755 --> 00:44:40.455
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:40.455 --> 00:44:41.913
DANIEL SIEBERG:
We'll look into it.

00:44:41.913 --> 00:44:45.850
AUDIENCE: So I want to know
is there any impact on you

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.337
and your success from
any women in your family?

00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:49.420
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.190
I would think my mother
actually is my role model,

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:58.590
not because of what she said or
did or how she may have led me.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:04.590
But because, as a woman in
Iran married to an Iranian men,

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:09.370
I never ever, ever, ever got the
message from her or my father

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.990
that because I was a girl,
anything was off limits to me.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.170
And that has been the most
important lesson in my life.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.340
Really it has, because
it was not told.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.650
It was something
I just picked up.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:27.030
And growing up in a patriarchal
society, in an Islamic society,

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.820
I still never ever,
ever, ever thought

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.850
that I couldn't do anything
because of my gender.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.090
As long as I worked hard and
had some kind of abilities

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.920
and competence, I could
do that, whether I

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.751
was a or girl or a boy.

00:45:41.751 --> 00:45:44.000
And I think that was very
important for me, obviously.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.190
DANIEL SIEBERG: I
love hearing that,

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.220
as the father of two girls.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:46.670
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.660
Yeah, really important.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:48.950
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, Jenna.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.690
Hi, I like your nail
polish, by the way.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:51.306
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank you.

00:45:51.306 --> 00:45:53.160
AUDIENCE: I was sitting in the
front row, so I noticed it.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.701
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
My producer will

00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:56.440
be very happy to hear that.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.782
We sometimes talk about
what colors I should put on.

00:45:59.782 --> 00:46:02.631
AUDIENCE: We are at Google, so
it's important to be colorful.

00:46:02.631 --> 00:46:03.130
I'm Jenna.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.660
I work in the Google Ideas
team here in New York.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.530
And we're basically Google's
free expression group.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.450
We focus on the user that we
believe is most in distressed

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.670
or most at risk,
so people living

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.090
in places where
there's conflict,

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.280
geopolitical instability,
censorship, et cetera.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.170
And so as a result, journalists
are both very important

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.070
partners and users for us.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.320
And so we've started to do
more and more in the space,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.780
for example, creating
a centralized online

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.850
repositories, so journalists can
collaborate on investigations

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:31.887
across borders.

00:46:31.887 --> 00:46:33.470
We're also very
interested in the role

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.390
that we can play in verifying
user-generated video

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.980
content on YouTube, particularly
in war zones and conflict

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.750
areas.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.860
My question to you
is-- what do you

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.480
think that Google should be
doing to help journalists

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.580
promote free expression?

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.820
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, I just

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.150
think that you're there
promotes free expression.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:59.560
I think that free expression
is something that, as you know,

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.320
practically the whole
world doesn't have.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.220
It's very limited
parts of the world that

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.120
have that enshrined
in their democracies

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.260
and their constitutions.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.160
From my own experience and
not being totally familiar

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.430
with what you're talking
about, from my own experience,

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.770
being in places where they're
not even allowed to have access

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.040
to the internet, et
cetera and knowing that

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.620
they do because they're smart.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.200
And who can close
it off these days.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.939
Although North Korea
still doesn't, they

00:47:28.939 --> 00:47:29.980
have this weird intranet.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.370
And they're getting more and
more thumb drives and things

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.610
like that, that people
bring information in.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.700
And it's probably one
of the last holdouts

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:45.020
where people don't have what
we now consider basic access.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:52.250
I think that what you're
doing a 21st-century variation

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.340
and much more interactive
obviously and much more

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.010
accessible than what the BBC
World Service radio may have

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:04.470
done 10, 20, 50 years ago,
when people in prisons,

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.240
famous political
prisoners, would say,

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.170
they had access to
radio or whatever.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.130
And they hear the news and what
was going on just on the radio.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:15.060
So all of that-- our
technology is simply

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.400
part of a momentum that
feeds this desperate

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.150
need to know and to be free.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.820
Freedom is most definitely,
in my view-- and democracy--

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.240
the default option in us.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.900
And I say this, because
it might seem obvious.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.600
But you remember, for
a long, long time,

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.150
people questioned
whether people in--

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.080
and they still
question right now

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.750
whether the people
in, let's say,

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.170
the Islamic world
or the Arab world

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:42.330
could deal with
democracy and Freedom.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:44.090
But it is the default option.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.130
And any opportunity
to help build that

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.420
and to have people be able
to communicate and talk

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.130
and learn and get moral
support through that is great.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:56.305
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:56.305 --> 00:48:58.087
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes.

00:48:58.087 --> 00:48:59.420
AUDIENCE: Don't have a question.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.540
Just wanted to say, thank
you for continuous coverage

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.730
of the Turkish
Gezi Park Protests.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.110
You should know that you're
a hero to millions in Turkey.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.140
Everybody knows your name.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.600
You were on newspapers
during the time.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.910
And CNN International
was the only news source

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.100
that we could get up-to-date
information about what

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.160
was going, because everything
else was pretty much controlled

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.410
by the government.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.280
It was great when you said, "the
show is over" to the government

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.630
official on live television.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.340
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Well,
I appreciate what you said.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.850
And I don't know whether some
people online from Turkey

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.720
will be able to access this.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.760
But I got into a lot
of trouble for that.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.430
And I was not welcome in
Turkey for a long time

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:44.670
because of that.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.830
And the truth of
the matter is, I

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.590
know some people would like
to think I did a great thing.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.050
But all I really meant
was, the show is over.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.160
We're out of time.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.870
That was what was happening.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:05.490
I had the director shouting
in my ear, wrap, wrap.

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.170
So I said, thank you, sir.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.940
I can't remember.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.120
The show is over.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.290
And everybody thought
I was telling him,

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.772
the government is over.

00:50:14.772 --> 00:50:18.046
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's how we got it.

00:50:18.046 --> 00:50:20.050
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
But you do bring up

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.110
a very interesting thing.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:26.500
Because one of the downsides of
all this freedom of expression

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:31.970
and being able to broadcast and
et cetera, and in particular,

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.040
in places like turkey
or Egypt or elsewhere,

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.120
journalists have
become so politicized,

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:45.280
not necessarily by choice, but
by force of what's going on.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.620
And that's one of
the negative aspects

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.550
of what's going on right now in
these countries where there's

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.930
such deep divisions.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.350
Egypt, when half the country
says, x, the other half says,

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:57.720
y-- similar in Turkey.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.440
And each side uses
journalists as their weapon,

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.250
as their instrument of,
I would say, propaganda.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:07.317
And it's really sad.

00:51:07.317 --> 00:51:09.900
It's really, really sad, because
when that starts happeningg--

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.020
and there are a lot of
independent journalists who

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.840
work really hard and
risk punishment or worse.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.340
And if you're only getting
journalists on the extremes,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.550
then you're never
getting to the truth.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:28.167
So that is an uncomfortable
development right now.

00:51:28.167 --> 00:51:29.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.190
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank you.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.901
AUDIENCE: Hi, Christiane.

00:51:31.901 --> 00:51:33.560
I'm Jean Claude.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.960
I've been watching
you for several years

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.490
from Togo to France.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:42.390
And we all do bemoaned
not having access to CNN

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:45.255
International when I moved to
the US because you weren't--

00:51:45.255 --> 00:51:47.380
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Can
somebody start a movement?

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.390
AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.600
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Get CNN International.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.800
Google, you asked me what to do.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.155
Get CNN International to be
viewed all over the United

00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:57.655
States.

00:51:57.655 --> 00:52:00.500
AUDIENCE: I think it would have
a huge impact on how Americans

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.080
view the world.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.080
So Daniel gave us a list of all
your journalistic achievements

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.230
over the past 35 years.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.670
I'm just curious whether
journalism has always

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.499
been the end or whether there's
a life beyond journalism

00:52:13.499 --> 00:52:14.790
for you and what that might be.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.990
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: It's
a really good question.

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:20.100
And it's one that I
do think about now.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.090
I never did really.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:27.010
People are-- really colleagues
a good deal older than me,

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:30.240
but still who've been
around for a while

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.040
doing really amazing stuff
are starting to retire

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.050
and looking at other things.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:39.320
And I have ideas, but I'm not
really ready to talk about them

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.120
right now.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.050
But journalism is in my
present and in my future,

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.620
for the foreseeable future.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.891
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:52:46.891 --> 00:52:48.182
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank you.

00:52:48.182 --> 00:52:49.185
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes.

00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:50.960
AUDIENCE: So my
question has to do

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.500
with your foreign background.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.050
Do you ever find yourself
struggling to stay objective

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.310
when the report on issues that
have to do with the Middle East

00:52:58.310 --> 00:52:59.550
or Great Britain?

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:03.890
And if so, how do you put your
personal bias and emotions

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.919
and memories aside, to
basically stay objective?

00:53:06.919 --> 00:53:08.960
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank
you for that question.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.610
And people do want to know that.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.910
And it's a legitimate question.

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:20.225
We have a golden
rule in journalism.

00:53:20.225 --> 00:53:22.720
And it's called objectivity.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.290
But what does objectivity mean?

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.340
Objectivity means
explaining and giving

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.649
all sides of the issue,
the story, whatever it is,

00:53:31.649 --> 00:53:32.440
going to all sides.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.590
You can't just do
it from one side.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.590
But it doesn't necessarily mean
treating all sides the same.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.670
So let's just go back to
the first really major story

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.560
of my career, which was Bosnia.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:48.180
You had a war, which was
then ethnic cleansing, which

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.840
was then genocide, which was
Sarajevo besieged and guns

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.330
and mortars being
poured into the city.

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.770
And I knew very quickly that you
cannot equate the victims with

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:01.270
the aggressors.

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:05.681
So I was accused of losing
my objectivity and siding--

00:54:05.681 --> 00:54:07.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: You were
pro-Muslim at the time?

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.929
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yes, Yes.

00:54:08.929 --> 00:54:12.810
And it made me really
think about this.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.940
And I realized then what I've
just told you that objectivity

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.340
is not a false neutrality.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:23.160
There's nothing worse than moral
equivalence where none exists.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.150
So that's on those big
issues, the big violations

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:29.800
of international
humanitarian law, genocide,

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.120
violations of human rights.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.410
You have to be absolutely
clear what's going on

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:37.950
and tell the truth,
and tell the truth.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.740
Then you get the,
let's say, right now--

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:45.710
Iran, the United States,
Israel, about the nuclear thing.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.591
I'm sure some people
say, oh, she says

00:54:47.591 --> 00:54:48.840
all sorts of stuff about Iran.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.970
She's Iranian.

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.520
Actually, Bill
O'Reilly suggested

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.215
that because I was born in
Iran, which I wasn't, but raised

00:54:55.215 --> 00:54:55.715
in Iran.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.890
The implication was that I was
compromised in my reporting.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.490
So I quickly tweeted back.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:08.390
I said, well, I'm sorry that
my objective reporting seems

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.210
go to offend.

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:13.370
But I'm really flattered that
he thinks I'm only 35 years old.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.680
Because of course,
it was 35 years ago

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.420
when the Ayatollahs
took over Iran,

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.180
and I was not raised
under that regime.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:27.320
So just to say that
it's all ridiculous--

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.150
if you're a professional,
you're a professional.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.470
I'm English but I'm Iranian.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:37.570
I've done all my
studying in America.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.430
I consider myself objective.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.430
And I consider what I
do-- perhaps the fact

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:45.220
that I have so many
international influences allows

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.670
me to actually tell the
other side of the story

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.840
and all sides of the
story, in a way that's

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.350
less chauvinistic than if I was
just one person or one religion

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:58.500
or one nationality
or one ethnic group.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.000
You know what I mean?

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.660
I'm a woman.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.750
And I biased?

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.720
I don't know.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.250
You could also people.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:09.440
I've gone brown eyes, I'm not
in favor of brown-eyed people,

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.420
necessarily.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.185
So in the end, you have to
be a competent professional.

00:56:14.185 --> 00:56:16.060
AUDIENCE: I have to
say, I always find

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.650
your reporting very objective.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:18.840
And in some sense.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.070
it surprises me,
because I do carry

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.525
the baggage of my, in my
case, Romanian upbringing.

00:56:23.525 --> 00:56:25.650
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Well,
you're not a journalist,

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:26.217
and you can.

00:56:26.217 --> 00:56:26.800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.383
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I'm a journalist,

00:56:28.383 --> 00:56:30.400
and I've taken an oath
of office, so to speak,

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.730
an oath of the profession.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.250
And I take it seriously.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.500
In my personal life, I
have all sorts of ideas,

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:41.710
but in my professional life,
I'm very clear about what

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:45.120
it is that I'm doing, what
the platform is that I have,

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.591
and what people expect of me.

00:56:48.591 --> 00:56:49.090
Thank you.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:52.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for being here.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.650
As an appropriate segue
from that question perhaps,

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.180
I want to go back
to you discussing

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.540
how programming outside
of just direct journalism

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.290
like the Anthony
Bourdains of the world

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:06.045
have really contributed to this
possibility of bringing down

00:57:06.045 --> 00:57:07.670
walls and being able
to be a little bit

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:11.740
more objective or at least
more understanding of news.

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:16.490
My hope is that we can
look forward to an Amanpour

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:17.816
virtual reality experience.

00:57:17.816 --> 00:57:19.190
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
What's that?

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:20.390
Tell me.

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:21.765
Is that good?

00:57:21.765 --> 00:57:22.755
AUDIENCE: I hope so.

00:57:22.755 --> 00:57:24.171
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
What is that?

00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:26.510
AUDIENCE: So you are probably
familiar with the Oculus

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:30.790
Rift and Google's
more humble Cardboard.

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:35.760
This is something-- we can
talk offline and explore this.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.260
But there are a
few developers who

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.400
have taken the Android operating
system and the cardboard

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.300
experience and
being able to create

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.220
a world that an individual
like myself would

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.870
be able to enter
into, to really get

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.980
a sense of that environment.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.942
And since there is no
forthcoming Amanpour

00:57:55.942 --> 00:57:57.400
virtual reality
experience, I don't

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.589
have much to look forward,
but an idea maybe.

00:57:59.589 --> 00:58:00.880
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank you.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.810
Thank you very much.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:02.643
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:02.643 --> 00:58:04.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: I like it.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.925
Yes.

00:58:05.925 --> 00:58:09.790
AUDIENCE: You briefly mentioned
some of the whistleblowing

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:13.080
accusations that have been going
on under the Espionage Act,

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:13.580
I believe.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.150
And I was wondering if you've
seen any chilling effects

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.732
from that in your
profession, and if you have

00:58:18.732 --> 00:58:20.190
or if you haven't,
what you thought

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:22.810
the best way would be to
mitigate that from happening,

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.400
whether you thought
the-- maybe the onus is

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.799
technological in making
people-- maybe journalists

00:58:27.799 --> 00:58:29.840
wouldn't even have to know
who their sources are,

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.480
in order to gather
information from them.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.210
Or if it's like you say it is.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.590
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I'm
not sure that's possible,

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.424
because the only way to have
sources that you can trust

00:58:36.424 --> 00:58:37.090
is to know them.

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:42.320
And you have to
have those meetings.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.050
If you look at what Jim Risen
has been through, and very

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:49.260
fortunately, the Attorney
General Eric Holder said,

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.470
on my watch, no journalist
is going to jail.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:56.660
Very fortunately, because
James Risen was doing his job.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.820
And the unacceptable pressure
that came down on him

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:03.300
was something that
we all have to resist

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.380
and that we all
have to do our job.

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.755
And the problem is, here we're
talking about a democracy.

00:59:07.755 --> 00:59:09.130
Here we are in
the United States.

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:09.950
There are laws.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.970
There's the Constitution.

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:13.880
There's a legal system.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:19.070
But outside, people are
pressured to doing things

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.060
that they shouldn't be
doing or giving up sources,

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.295
giving up names at the
end of a barrel of a gun,

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:29.620
at the end of a knife
across the throat.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.790
And we just have to understand.

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:37.140
And all our organizations
need to stand up for us,

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.990
that there are
rules for a reason.

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:44.170
And if we are solid and
sure about our sources

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:46.330
and about our
information, then we

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.190
should be able to
print, to broadcast,

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.420
to put online or whatever.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:54.080
Now, having said that, there are
clearly areas where, let's say,

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.010
I go to cover wars.

00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.360
There's this whole issue
of military security.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.990
I would never break that, never.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.730
If I'm travelling with a unit,
I would never break that.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.442
Because first and
foremost, I don't

01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:11.650
want to get killed, if the
enemy knows what I'm doing

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.170
and who I'm traveling with.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.680
And secondly, that's the
trade-off that you make.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.790
But I don't know
whether this whole sort

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:26.130
of mega-technological
society that we live in

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.250
makes that harder or less hard,
the whole surveillance thing.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.170
But I think that what
we've been through

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:36.420
and what we've been exposed
to by all these revelations

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.470
is very sobering.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.050
And perhaps it's not
as bad as some say.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.740
But it's most
definitely something

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.120
that we need to hold the
line against, I think.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.570
AUDIENCE: How can we also
prevent or an intelligence

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.942
agency from pulling the
national security card.

01:00:51.942 --> 01:00:53.400
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, they do.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.030
I just mentioned PRISM.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.520
And if I'm not mistaken--
correct me if I'm wrong.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.690
This is what Edward
Snowden said-- companies

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:04.180
such as Google, Yahoo
all the many others,

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.432
the government would like them
to be their online sheriffs.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.640
This is the world we live in.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.360
We all have to ask
ourselves questions

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.090
about how appropriate.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.190
How far do we go?

01:01:16.717 --> 01:01:17.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:18.210
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Thank you.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:18.620
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thanks.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.530
All right.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:20.622
Yes, couple more.

01:01:20.622 --> 01:01:22.335
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:25.540
I have a question
on trust in general.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.840
So trust is a really
big issue that

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.480
has been a company [INAUDIBLE],
that we got good enough.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.150
But my question
is, how do we-- do

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:41.490
you see that trust and
journalism itself or what

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:43.830
journalists are saying
has been decreasing

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:48.150
over the years, especially
because of blogs, for example?

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.690
I used to read
editorialists and then

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:52.330
didn't quite read
the first page.

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.160
Basically it was
always like someone's

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.460
bogus, made-up stories.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.140
But I knew that I had
different trust factor,

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.830
depending on which page of
the newspaper I'm reading.

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:03.490
And then so long
over the years, it

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:06.070
has-- I have this
distrust of TV.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.224
I am out of newspaper.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.890
I don't have any
subscription newspaper.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:11.160
And I find my
generation or folks

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.140
who are coming,
even more so, they

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.090
don't trust what is
being said by people

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:19.240
who are in between a
country far off and here.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.210
Rather, I would read
a blog about someone

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.220
who is actually on
the spot and living

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.650
there, because
it's possible now.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.100
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Yeah, look, Americans

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.570
remember Walter Cronkite.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.760
He was the most
trusted man in America.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.550
And he gave you the news at
6:00 or 6:30, whenever it was.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.300
And that was that.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.390
And you trusted that he
was absolutely honest.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.980
And he was.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.520
And he was a
brilliant journalist.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.960
Fast forward all to
now, and the trust level

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.690
has most definitely diminished.

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.060
And it's not just
because of the explosion

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.280
of different platforms
and blogs and things that.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.560
There are many reasons for it.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.570
Trust, in general
for institutions

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.600
has diminished, whether
it's for government,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.210
whether it's for-- there's
the Edelman Trust Barometer.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:04.770
And it's quite scary to see
how lots of the civil society

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.850
organizations, the trust
level is down very, very much.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.260
That's why I keep talking
about trust and credibility

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.390
and honesty.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.570
And in this world where
we talk about brands,

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:20.100
people have to know who they're
getting their information from.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.420
That's what I think.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.320
So you build up a
relationship with a person

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.595
or an organization or
a show or a newspaper

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.270
or whatever it might be.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:32.490
And you trust, based
on your experience

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:34.760
and based on how
they measure up.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.050
But I think trust in our
business is fundamental.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:42.650
And if we don't have the
trust of our audience,

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.950
then we're just pissing
in the wind really.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:46.040
I mean, what's the point?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:46.430
DANIEL SIEBERG:
And I think there's

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:47.690
a fascinating discussion
around recovering

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.920
from losing that trust
too, like a Tailwind

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.040
or something like that.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:51.560
That is a whole other--

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.101
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: I think we
did something very important.

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:56.310
Tailwind was a very
bad moment for CNN.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:00.620
And that was back in 1998,
I think, seven or eight.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: Newsstand
had just started.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.643
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Yeah.

01:04:03.643 --> 01:04:05.936
But you remember,
because-- I don't know

01:04:05.936 --> 01:04:07.060
whether you were there yet.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:07.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just
before I go there.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.530
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: But
they took a very firm stand,

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:11.175
very quickly.

01:04:11.175 --> 01:04:12.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Can you
just recap it quickly,

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:13.130
for folks who don't know.

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.690
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
No, I can't really.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:13.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:15.428
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
I sort of can.

01:04:15.428 --> 01:04:19.040
Basically, it was a program
where a false allegation was

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.880
made that the US
military used, I think,

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.470
chemical weapons in Vietnam.

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:27.230
And it was a mistake, and
it wasn't apparently truly.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.220
It wasn't true.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.720
And we had to retract it.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.890
People lost their
jobs, heads rolled.

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:36.570
And CNN did the right thing.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:44.369
CNN did the right thing by
owning it, owning up to it,

01:04:44.369 --> 01:04:44.910
and doing it.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:49.810
And look, we see that
in different ways today.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:55.550
Obviously, the German
wings disaster,

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.140
the officials of the
airlines, the government,

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:02.360
they all came out so much
faster than what had happened

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.220
when MH-370 went missing.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.490
Look at what happened in
South Carolina yesterday.

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:12.710
The mayor and the police
chief came out pretty quickly,

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.995
compared to what happened
in previous instances,

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:17.420
like in Ferguson and
all the rest of it.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.595
So yeah.

01:05:18.595 --> 01:05:19.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:22.180
All right, I think we have time
for just one more question.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.780
AUDIENCE: I'll be quick.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.585
I promise.

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:25.880
Thank you so much, Christiane.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.272
So I'm from Venezuela.

01:05:27.272 --> 01:05:27.980
My name is Paula.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.730
And I know you've
been interviewing

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.380
a couple of presidents there.

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.130
Assuming, well, just
as my Turkish friend,

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.190
we don't have freedom of
expression, basically,

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.670
like the old [INAUDIBLE]
are owned by the government.

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:47.570
And that led to basically
a movement of my generation

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.400
having their news and doing
their news in social media,

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.810
using YouTube as a
platform, basically.

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.690
Well, we're super patriotic,
and we're really passionate.

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:58.410
My generation is
really passionate.

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:01.650
I guess my question is,
from your experience,

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:07.040
what have you seen in other
countries, that social media,

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.540
viral--

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.331
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Well, I think you just

01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:10.660
hit the nail on the head.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.930
And I think this is what
CNN did, when we first

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.360
went international.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.570
We provided an
independent news menu,

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.590
in countries where they only
had state television or state

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:22.330
media.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.969
So it's still happening.

01:06:23.969 --> 01:06:25.260
It's happening in your country.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.843
It's happening in
many other countries

01:06:26.843 --> 01:06:30.070
where there is not
freedom of the press.

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.760
And in fact, there's
the opposite.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.280
Those who try are sent
to jail and worse.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.030
So yes, that's
another reason why

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:40.260
social media is so
incredibly important,

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.760
because so many people get
their news from Twitter,

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.990
from social media.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:46.925
And it is incredible,
the way everybody

01:06:46.925 --> 01:06:48.000
has harnessed Twitter.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.950
I mean, the supreme leader of
the Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini,

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.240
was busy tweeting
up a storm today.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.910
And that's his first weighing
in on the nuclear deal.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.140
But now everybody
is getting into it.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:09.070
So yeah, I was going
to say, you're right.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.030
You only have that.

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.980
The worst, horrible
thing is when

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:18.100
you have somebody like ISIS
using our technology so well

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.520
for their own
propaganda, whether it's

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.500
their social media, whether
it's their YouTube videos.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.630
And it is scary.

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:27.290
So that's what I say about
the whole cat and mouse thing.

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:29.840
For everything we do or
they do, somebody else

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.410
can do one better.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:34.990
And it's all used
for good purposes.

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:40.210
And that's where we have
use our critical faculties

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:41.200
and our judgment.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.070
And that's where it
gets very challenging.

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:45.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank you.

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:46.720
Well, the show is over.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.592
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:48.592 --> 01:07:51.372
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
As they say in Turkey.

01:07:51.372 --> 01:07:52.830
DANIEL SIEBERG:
But I want to thank

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:55.590
you so much for coming
in here this afternoon

01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:58.120
and sharing your thoughts
and insights with us

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.030
and the online audience as well.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.330
And let's give Christiane
a round of applause.

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:01.890
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
Thank you, guys.

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:02.723
Thank you very much.

01:08:02.723 --> 01:08:08.835
[APPLAUSE]
