00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.710
Now if you're in the math or statistics, you

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.900
might know that statistics provides a convenient way to group

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.750
probabilities like this through a calculation of something called

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.510
the standard deviation. We're not going to go into this

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.180
here but you can learn more about it in

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.530
lesson six. Of the statistics course offered here on the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.390
Audacity website coinstructed by Katie Cormanick. So without knowing

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.825
anything about a woman or her genetics or her environment,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:30.750
where on the risk spectrum for breast cancer would we estimate that she falls?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.714
On the lower risk end, the average risk middle or the high risk end?
