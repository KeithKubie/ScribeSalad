00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.380
After concatenation,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.640
it's now time for minification to
shrink the file size of our JavaScript.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.580
The most popular minifier today
is uglifyJS which does some heavy but

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.090
safe optimizations to squeeze every
last bit out of your raw source code.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.990
And you might have guessed it, plug-in
and include it into the gulp-file.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.305
Now this is where our scripts and

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:23.700
scripts-disk tasks are starting
to become slightly different.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.050
As JavaScript minification is
a very time-intensive stop.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.080
Therefore, it makes no sense to do
this while live-editing your code.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.820
Add the missing pipe to the scripts-dist
task right after the concat pipe and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.710
call it pipe uglify.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.670
Yes, that's all you need and calling
this task now will produce nicely

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.440
concatenated and minified JavaScript.
