00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.070
To motivate our discussion of scripts, let us continue with our metaphor of

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.690
machines with whom we can talk in stories. Now the Watson program and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.770
the Siri program, normally they understand stories that are limited to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.990
one sentence. You can ask Watson a question, you can ask Siri a question,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.942
and those questions are one sentence questions. Similarly when Siri and

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:25.507
Watson reply, they typically give their answers in one word or one sentence at

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:30.600
most. The story plays a very important role in the life of quadrant division and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.240
we would expect AI agents that live among quadrant divisions also to be able to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.250
understand stories. And one of the common roles that story players that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.890
they enable more common sense reasoning. To see how stories enable common

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.240
sense reasoning, consider two simple sentences. Imagine the first sentence was,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.740
Ali asked, do you think we'll have many customers in the next half hour?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.550
And the second sentence is, Sarah replied, go ahead and grab your lunch.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.920
So these are two sentences of a story. Does this story make sense to you?
