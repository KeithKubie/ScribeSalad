00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.899
so we we have this technique that other

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909
so we we have this technique that other
 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.720
so we we have this technique that other
people really haven't used but we found

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
people really haven't used but we found
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.410
people really haven't used but we found
to be very powerful technique and

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420
to be very powerful technique and
 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.419
to be very powerful technique and
because they've been looking at the fate

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
because they've been looking at the fate
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879
because they've been looking at the fate
of the oxygens of inorganic phosphate

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
of the oxygens of inorganic phosphate
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000
of the oxygens of inorganic phosphate
when it made ATP those oxygen one of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
when it made ATP those oxygen one of
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.500
when it made ATP those oxygen one of
them goes to make water hmm

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510
them goes to make water hmm
 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.140
them goes to make water hmm
now we found that by use of the stable

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
now we found that by use of the stable
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.590
now we found that by use of the stable
isotope oxygen-18 we could measure this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
isotope oxygen-18 we could measure this
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810
isotope oxygen-18 we could measure this
reaction and water going in and out of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
reaction and water going in and out of
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660
reaction and water going in and out of
phosphate part of the process and by

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
phosphate part of the process and by
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460
phosphate part of the process and by
measure that under the conditions we can

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
measure that under the conditions we can
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470
measure that under the conditions we can
probe down as what's happening in the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
probe down as what's happening in the
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.150
probe down as what's happening in the
heart of the enzyme that we couldn't see

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
heart of the enzyme that we couldn't see
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.250
heart of the enzyme that we couldn't see
by other way oh yeah

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
by other way oh yeah
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040
by other way oh yeah
so we had a way or safe way of seeing

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
so we had a way or safe way of seeing
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.709
so we had a way or safe way of seeing
what's happening down inside and really

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
what's happening down inside and really
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.660
what's happening down inside and really
the start of the binding change

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
the start of the binding change
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.100
the start of the binding change
mechanism was when I was sitting in a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110
mechanism was when I was sitting in a
 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.069
mechanism was when I was sitting in a
seminar talking about some aspects of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
seminar talking about some aspects of
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959
seminar talking about some aspects of
theoretical chemistry that I did not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
theoretical chemistry that I did not
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.959
theoretical chemistry that I did not
understand yet and so I let my mind walk

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969
understand yet and so I let my mind walk
 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.730
understand yet and so I let my mind walk
and then I suddenly came to me that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
and then I suddenly came to me that
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830
and then I suddenly came to me that
stage but a few times I get a stroke of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
stage but a few times I get a stroke of
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640
stage but a few times I get a stroke of
insight I can explain our oxygen-18 data

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
insight I can explain our oxygen-18 data
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.910
insight I can explain our oxygen-18 data
if the energy is not used to make the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
if the energy is not used to make the
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670
if the energy is not used to make the
ATP molecule but if it can be made

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
ATP molecule but if it can be made
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890
ATP molecule but if it can be made
without the energy input when the energy

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
without the energy input when the energy
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.429
without the energy input when the energy
is used to release our ntp mallya so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
is used to release our ntp mallya so
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.010
is used to release our ntp mallya so
that was the startup and that was the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
that was the startup and that was the
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.280
that was the startup and that was the
sudden inspiration ever so that's one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
sudden inspiration ever so that's one
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890
sudden inspiration ever so that's one
time

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.600
there was a starting point now and other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610
there was a starting point now and other
 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.210
there was a starting point now and other
times you make progress you you can

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
times you make progress you you can
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.080
times you make progress you you can
hardly recognize you started none this

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
hardly recognize you started none this
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.980
hardly recognize you started none this
was a start down it yeah
