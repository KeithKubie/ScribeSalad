00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:08.690
SPEAKER 1: Hi, everybody,
and welcome to Talks

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.010
at Google Cambridge.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.447
Today I'm delighted to introduce
Professor Sunstein, who

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:14.030
will be talking about
his newest book,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.280
"The World According
to Star Wars."

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.790
Professor Sunstein is the Robert
Walmsley University Professor

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.580
at Harvard and the
founder and director

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.800
of the university's program
on behavioral economics

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.130
and public policy.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.950
He's written many,
many books, including

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.630
best seller "Nudge," "Simpler,
the Future of Government,"

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.042
and "Republic.com," and,
of course, his newest book,

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.500
"The World According
to Star Wars."

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.180
He's a pretty big fan of
"Star Wars," as are probably

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.000
many of you in this
room, so please join me

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.600
in welcoming up
Professor Sunstein.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.800
CASS R. SUNSTEIN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.780
It's a complete
thrill to be here.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.440
I think "Star Wars"
the universe presaged

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.030
a lot of the work going
on at Google, didn't it?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.530
So this is extremely fitting.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.920
There's "Star Wars."

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.800
Brings a burst of
excitement and nostalgia

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.580
and hope for what's coming next.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.040
There's a book.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.160
There's the origins of
this unlikely project.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.810
I'm a law professor.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.390
I work some on social science
and psychology and economics.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.530
That's my son.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.150
He was taken with "Star
Wars" at the age of five,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.420
and his, to me, surprising
fascination with "Star Wars"

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.490
hooked me.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.760
My puzzle and topic
here is very simple.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.490
Why did "Star Wars" succeed?

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.190
For those who like
"Star Wars," that's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.240
not an interesting question.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.520
I'm hoping that for
those four people

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.460
on the planet who don't
like "Star Wars," that's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.480
not uninteresting either.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.740
Because it has
general implications

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.550
for why ideas
succeed and fail, why

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.060
certain understandings
of rights get out there,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.650
why some products end up
being terrifically successful

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.386
and others don't, why
some politicians--

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:15.302
is it likely that someone
named Barack Hussein

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.790
Obama would become president
of the United States?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.530
I don't think that
was anticipated.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.190
It happened.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.000
Was it likely that
Donald Trump would

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120
be the Republican nominee?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.500
That wasn't anticipated.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.430
It looks like it's
going to happen.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.810
Why are rebellions
both so hard to predict

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.900
and often so massively
successful, like the Arab

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420
Spring?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.860
"Star Wars" success has
some similar features

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.650
I'm going to try to suggest.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.900
Here's the epigraph
for these remarks.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.930
It's a dialogue between
two titans, George Lucas,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.770
the mastermind of "Star
Wars," and Lawrence Kasdan,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.310
his co-author.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.110
Kasdan, a genius,
as Lucas is, sharply

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.870
disagreed, the two of
them, on the question

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.960
whether Luke or
somebody else should

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.340
die in "Return of the Jedi."

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.090
And Kasdan said,
Luke should die.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.850
And Lucas said, Luke's
not going to die.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.460
And then Kasdan said, well,
someone else important

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.570
should die.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.580
And Lucas said, someone else
important is not going to die.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.480
You're a product of the '80s.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.610
This is not that kind of movie.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.340
And Kasdan then said,
with evident feeling,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.310
I'm saying the movie has
more emotional weight

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.000
if someone you love
is lost along the way.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.910
The journey has more impact.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.970
That was a very
feeling-full statement

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.540
on the part of Kasdan.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.290
And Lucas responded,
apparently, very quickly, I

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.880
don't like that, and
I don't believe that.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.620
I think those are precious
words because of their immediacy

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.330
and clarity.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.260
They're also behavioral
words in the sense

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.240
that they track understanding
from behavioral science, which

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.550
is that often our
beliefs are motivated.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.710
I don't like that, and
I don't believe that.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.391
That's Lucas' sequence.

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:08.890
OK.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.440
So as of now, the
"Star Wars" movies

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.430
have made more than $30 billion.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.769
That's more than the gross
domestic product of about 90

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.990
of the world's nations.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.590
If "Star Wars" were
a nation, it would

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.780
rank about the middle of the
193 nations on the planet.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.770
Doesn't it deserve its own
place at the United Nations?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.340
It has become the
defining saga of our time.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.990
President Obama ended a news
conference in December saying,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.560
I've got to go see "Star Wars."

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.160
Secretary Clinton ended a
Democratic debate saying,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.870
may the force be with you.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.720
And Senator Cruz tweeted before
one of the Republican debates

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.300
something that picked up
on "The Force Awakens."

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.390
so it's bipartisan
and all-American.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.840
Ironically and stunningly, no
one expected it to be a hit.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.660
Nobody, really.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.760
Throughout its production at
Fox studios, there was apathy.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.490
They hoped a lot of times
it would just go away.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.240
The movie theaters,
whose business

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.370
it is to predict success,
gave advance guarantees

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.870
of $1.5 million.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.960
That's pathetic.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.602
Fox's hope was $10 million.

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.360
That's a low bar.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.290
They couldn't get
close to the low bar.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.260
Fox didn't even print
enough celluloid to meet

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.580
the early demand.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.270
They literally didn't think the
movie was worth the celluloid

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.220
on which it was printed.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.070
Right after "A New
Hope," originally

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.490
called "Star Wars" opened,
George Lucas and spouse

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.220
went on vacation in Hawaii.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.070
It was not just because
they needed a break.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.150
It's because they thought
they'd probably released a flop.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.440
In Hawaii, they could
escape what Lucas thought

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.450
might well be a disaster.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.970
The actors didn't have
much faith in it, either.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.260
Harrison Ford says there's
this giant guy walking around

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.470
in a dog suit.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.845
It was ridiculous.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.110
OK.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.880
So we could think that
the success of "Star Wars"

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.330
had something to
do with the timing,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.340
and this may have broad lessons
about products and politicians

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.010
and ideas that you have to hit
the culture in the right way

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.180
at the right time.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.480
That's an external explanation.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.140
Or you could have an internal
explanation, something

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.850
about the amazingness of the
thing whose success we're

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.560
trying to explain.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.610
I'm going to go very
briskly over a series

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.000
of possible explanations.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.930
And the external
explanations are

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.760
going to look very bad, to give
a little bit of the game away.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.800
There was a movie a few
years ago that won the Oscar.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.620
It's called "Searching
for Sugar Man,"

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.380
and it's about a rock singer
from the early 1970s named

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.300
Rodriguez, about whom even
connoisseurs of rock music

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.340
knew nothing because he released
two albums, as they were

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.490
then called, and they failed.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.960
So think of this as one of a
zillion wanna-be rock stars who

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.440
flopped and ended
up, in this case,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.910
going into the construction
business as a demolition man.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.930
Unbeknownst to himself,
Rodriguez was, in South Africa,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.710
a giant.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.870
They would speak of him with
awe and reverence, Rodriguez.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.380
They wondered what
had happened to him.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.010
Had he burned himself
on stage, as rumors

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.640
had it, and thus
become an iconic kind

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.320
of self-immolating guy?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.500
Now, there's a puzzle.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.050
Why did Rodriguez become
a runaway success--

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.890
bigger than the Beatles,
really-- in South Africa

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.880
and kind of an utter failure
in the United States?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.580
What's going on there?

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.380
Well, I think we have
a little bit of clue

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.970
from "Harry Potter,"
where 12 publishers turned

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.930
down the "Harry Potter" novels.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.852
J.K. Rowling had a
struggle getting published.

00:08:21.852 --> 00:08:23.310
The publishers are
supposed to know

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.550
about quality and saleability.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.950
The advance originally for
"Harry Potter" was very small.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.580
What happened there?

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.080
OK.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.880
There's a strange tale
involving a mystery

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.361
writer named Robert Gottlieb.

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:40.860
I'm not sure if
you've heard of him.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.480
He's written three
novels, the first of which

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.770
was called "The
Cuckoo's Calling."

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.410
"The Cuckoo's Calling"
was very well reviewed.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.330
Sold horribly.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
So it was one of these
critical successes

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.200
that was disappearing.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.420
But it emerged, I
think, by happenstance

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.010
that the real author of
"The Cuckoo's Calling"

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.540
is J.K. Rowling, and
the book exploded.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.290
Bestsellers.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.050
What's going on there?

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.740
William Blake, one of
the most revered poets

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.860
in the English language,
disappeared from the canon

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.380
for a long time.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.692
Jane Austen herself
was-- and I'm

00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:18.400
trying to see if you're
paying attention,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.990
because it's misspelled
there-- Jane Austen

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:26.370
was one of several
novelists in her era,

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.470
and she was not
thought to be the best.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.480
Why did Jane Austen
and William Blake

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.330
turn out to be canonical
where people who at the time

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.921
were thought to be better
have, in fact, dropped out?

00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:39.420
OK.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.270
Here's a clue.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.590
This is an experiment a few
years ago, online experiment,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.530
where-- it's called
the music lab,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.240
where there's a
real website which

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.750
has dozens of songs on it.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.560
In the control condition,
you can go on the website

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.380
and download the songs you like.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.540
That's the control.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.970
And that measure gives
an independent measure

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.740
of popularity.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.600
In eight subgroups,
something different happened,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.410
which is you could see in
your randomly sorted group--

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.260
the group into which you've
been randomly placed--

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.689
you can see how many people had
downloaded all of the songs.

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:18.230
So there's a control
condition, where

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.990
you don't see the
social influences,

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.190
you don't see what's
happened to other people,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.470
and there are eight
other groups, where

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.790
you can see how
the songs are doing

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.120
with the relevant population
of 1,000 visitors, thousands

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.330
of visitors.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.830
OK.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.610
If intrinsic quality
is what mattered,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.210
you'd predict that
the eight worlds where

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.870
you saw the initial
downloads would turn out

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.080
to be the same as the
control condition.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.830
Yes, quality [? would ?]
[? out. ?] And that's a very

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.360
plausible hypothesis.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.820
That's not what happened.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.000
Basically, while the best
songs never completely tanked

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.410
and the worst songs were
never spectacular successes,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.040
otherwise, anything
could happen.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.920
A song which did very
poorly in one world

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.920
could do very well in another,
where the only difference was

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.280
that it got initial downloads.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.370
A song that did very
well in most worlds

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.570
could tank in others,
and the reason

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.940
is it didn't get a lot
of initial downloads.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.370
Now, this is a profound
explanation, I think,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.350
of success and failure
in terms of movies,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.680
products of all kinds,
books, political candidates,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.880
and ideas.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.770
The question is, is there an
initial burst of enthusiasm

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.690
which zillions of
other people see?

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.780
When that happens, something
whose intrinsic quality

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.640
isn't higher than
that of other things

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.570
can be culturally very resonant.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.820
Not because of the
culture, but because

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.090
of the relative happenstance
that a number of people

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.060
got excited about it early.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.560
OK.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.010
In terms of theory, what
we're speaking about here

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.310
is cascades.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.950
There are two kinds of cascades.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.150
One is informational and
the other is reputational.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.480
An informational
cascade is when you're

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.020
in a kind of temporal queue.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.110
You're deciding among
five products, let's say.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.190
The first person in
the queue decides

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.780
on product B of the five.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.970
The second person in the
queue isn't quite sure,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.120
kind of likes product C, but
is moved by the first person

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.530
to get product B, too.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.470
Once the first two people
have gotten product B,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.060
then the third person
is going to have

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.290
to have a lot of
information to choose

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.550
one of the other products
because two people have ended

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.860
up choosing product B. I think
with respect to a large number

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.920
of social success stories,
including Rodriguez in South

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.570
Africa and Rodriguez
in the United States,

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.730
the deal maker or
the deal breaker

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:07.120
is whether you benefit from
an informational cascade.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.580
For many things,
including "Star Wars,"

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.550
there are reputational
cascades as well.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.910
If you didn't know, at certain
period in 1977, anything

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.250
about "Star Wars," and you
were, say, 17 years old,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.030
you are a loser.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.020
You had to know
about "Star Wars."

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.730
You would risk your reputation
among your peers if you didn't.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.980
And if you had seen
it and didn't like it,

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.060
you'd also risk your reputation.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.580
So you had to A, see
it, and B, like it.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.550
If you didn't like
it, you had to it

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.800
in the sense of
saying you liked it.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.950
And that put
reputational pressure

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.500
on members of the population.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.690
Some things, and I hope
this is very familiar here,

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.680
benefit from network effects.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.950
That people enjoy them because
other people enjoy them,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.840
that's a kind of a
loose generalization

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.120
of the idea of network effects.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.310
And for "The Force
Awakens," a lot of people

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.450
went because they thought
everyone was going.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:04.950
OK.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.550
Is that true for "Star Wars"?

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.340
Is that the full account?

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.130
Really?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.510
Seriously?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.550
Is "Star Wars" like
one of those kind

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.900
of average songs
in the music lab

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.920
experiment that exploded
because early people liked it?

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.260
I mean really and
seriously to be

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.450
doubting the fullness of the
explanation I've just given.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.870
Think, if you would, about
the Arab Spring and the fall

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.000
of communism.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.580
Surely the timing of
both of those events,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.030
highly unpredictable,
had a lot to do

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.570
with what we're now discussing.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.300
And there's terrific
empirical work

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.840
suggesting that informational
cascades and reputational

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.280
cascades were crucial
to when those happened.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.490
But the fall of
authoritarian governance

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.530
isn't just a product
of cascade effects.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.930
They're also
authoritarian governments,

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:05.020
and what is sought to
replace them by the rebels

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.790
is something that has higher
intrinsic quality, which

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.520
is to suggest that to attribute
the success of "Star Wars"

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.671
solely to the explanation just
given is probably a mistake.

00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:19.170
OK.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.810
Second idea.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.820
What "Star Wars" benefited from
is the appeal of the monomyth.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.070
So there's a guy named
Joseph Campbell, discovered,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.800
by the way, by Jacqueline
Kennedy, President Kennedy's

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.200
wife, as an editor.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.670
Joseph Campbell said that there
is a monomyth in cultures where

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.030
there's a hero's
journey-- Jesus, Buddha,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.110
Mohammad, and many
others show all

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.600
or many features
of the monomyth--

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.420
where people receive at
a young age a challenge.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.950
They decline it.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.520
They find a mentor.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.810
They leave home.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.140
They're tested.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.670
They face dangers.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.010
They get help.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.790
They reunite in some sense
with home, and they celebrate.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.160
Now, that has universal appeal.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.140
It's all of us.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.660
Every human being's
journey is, in a way,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.360
the hero's journey,
which helps account

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.920
for its spectacular
appeal in any country,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.240
basically, that you can name.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.100
Spiderman.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.400
Hero's journey.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.140
Jessica Jones, the
best heroic journey

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.570
in the last decade in my view.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.820
If you haven't seen it,
watch "Jessica Jones."

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.830
She is replicating the
monomyth in a distinctive way.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.000
And Luke Skywalker,
no doubt about it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.840
But there are a lot of monomyths
out there, and most of them

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.590
tanked.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.350
You haven't even heard of them.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.250
So it can't be sufficient
for "Star Wars"

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.650
success, though it's true
that it tracked the monomyth.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.150
OK.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.200
Third explanation.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.990
"Star Wars" has many
possible meanings.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.109
You can easily see it as an
essentially Christian tale

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.569
in which Anakin Skywalker
is a Christ-like figure who

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:15.480
dies, in a way, for our sins,
finds salvation, and guarantees

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:21.619
something like that to us
in a tale that in many ways

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.060
mimics the New Testament.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.690
You can see Luke's
journey in the same way.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.040
So the Christian
resonance in the tale

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.150
helps give it a kind
of cultural appeal.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.890
You can see it as Freudian.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.340
No question about that.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.730
Anakin is in love with
his mother, who dies.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.180
He falls for, in a
literal way, a woman who's

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.420
much older who
says Anakin, you'll

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.830
always be a little boy to me.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.090
Kind of Freudian.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:57.630
Both Luke and Anakin have
big-time father issues, and OK.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.650
You can see it as a
Jeffersonian tale that

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.420
would resonate in the United
States about rebellion

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.300
and the need for a kind of
monitoring of potentially

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.500
authoritarian governance.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:16.440
There are crazy theories about
Jar Jar Binks being a Sith Lord

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.770
or about Han Solo having
the force or about

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.220
the wonderfulness of the Empire.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.580
These are crazy theories,
but they're ingenious,

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.360
and they can fit the tale.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.160
Does that have
explanatory power?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.120
Some.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.790
But here's a pedantic word
on necessary and sufficient

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.710
conditions.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.770
If you want to explain
"Star Wars" success,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.725
we have to distinguish
between two.

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:46.140
It may be a necessary condition
that it have multiple meanings.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.360
Maybe that makes it intriguing.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.640
But it's not a
sufficient condition.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.490
There are a lot of
terrible things out there

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.950
that have many meanings
that don't make $30 billion

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:04.010
and probably what's being done
by the people who are focusing

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.740
on many meanings as
the source of success

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.740
is that they're committing
a statistical error called

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.060
sampling on the
dependent variable.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.010
That is, they take
a variable that

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.740
is connected with a bunch of
successful things, of which

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.970
"Star Wars" is one,
and then claiming

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.490
that that's causally
responsible for its success.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.420
But it turned out--
if it turned out

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.180
that the five culturally
most resonant things, let's

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.150
say, in the last 50 years
were all made by someone who

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.760
was born in December
or who had the letter

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.350
L in their last name, that would
not be causally responsible.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.500
And I think this is
suffering from that blunder.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.000
OK.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.360
Explanation number four.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.230
What a lot of people
all over the world,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.150
and certainly in the
United States, like

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.860
is tales of republics
and empires.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.990
The theory in the
saga, and its presaged

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.010
in the beloved original trilogy,
it's very clearly spelled out

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.790
in the underrated
prequels, is that democracy

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.260
falls to thunderous applause.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.930
And the idea is that republics
are vulnerable and fragile

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.610
and that they fall in a kind
of predictable, somewhat

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.310
stylized way.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:25.140
The fall of Rome, the fall of
Germany, Stalin's authority,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.010
all had something
to do with a theme

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.890
that "Star Wars"
is very alert to.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.120
This does resonate,
and I think it

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.470
is accounting for the beginnings
of what we're seeing now,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.670
which is a rebirth of
interest in the prequels

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.200
because they are saying
something that connects

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.240
at least with
developments in Europe

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.570
and possibly the United States.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.730
What I'm going to say
about that explanation

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.810
is it captures some of
the appeal of "Star Wars,"

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.860
but again, it's neither--
it's certainly not

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.750
sufficient for cultural success.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.610
You can tell a lot
of boring tales

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.990
about republics
falling to empires,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.870
and it's not necessary.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.370
OK.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.250
Here's a more interesting
explanation, I think.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.120
The zeitgeist.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.090
The culture.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.830
And here the idea is that
after the assassination

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.085
of the Kennedys, Martin
Luther King, and Malcolm

00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:20.900
X, and the tulmult
of the Vietnam era,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.860
and malaise, which was
Jimmy Carter's term for what

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:31.560
the country was in, the time was
kind of perfect for a new hope.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.080
That's what the country wanted.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.190
A new hope.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.150
A lift was needed,
and George Lucas

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.130
delivered in on a
silver spaceship.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.070
That's exactly what happened.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:49.380
And many of the sociologically
most attuned critics

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.420
of the question
I'm exploring now

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.440
put their finger on this one,
and they say this is the one.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.660
I'm going to be very hard on
this explanation in a way that

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.820
bears on "Star Wars" but
also on political success

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.980
and cultural success, Taylor
Swift and "Harry Potter."

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.460
I'm going to suggest that all
of these things that succeed,

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.380
this is a tempting but very
problematic explanation.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.040
The reason is it's always
possible to generate an ex post

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.320
zeitgeit explanation.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.240
It's child's play to say the
most popular thing X succeeded

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.090
because of cultural
factors A, B, and C. You

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.930
can say "Harry Potter"
after 9/11, of course.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.840
Taylor Swift after the
recession, of course.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.840
But is that true?

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.230
Here's a way to think about it.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.030
Imagine that "Star
Wars" did great

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:56.700
in the 1990s, the early
aughts, tomorrow, or the 1930s.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.780
We could easily generate
a cultural account

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.780
of why that happened,
and it would

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.440
be as plausible as the
ones that are out there.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.220
1930s, depression.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.000
They needed a new hope.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.160
1990s, Clinton.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.110
They needed a new hope.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.920
1980s, conventionality.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:24.720
Luke Skywalker, perfect for
the earnestness of the times.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.710
Plausible?

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.590
Yes.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.730
True?

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.800
No.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.970
A fairy tale?

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.710
Yes.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.620
OK.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.280
Here's explanation six.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.150
"Star Wars" engages
intriguingly with the light side

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.540
and the dark side.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.840
William Blake, the
great English poet,

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.840
wrote of the greatest religious
text in the English language.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.000
The reason John Milton,
who wrote "Paradise Lost,"

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.430
wrote in fetters when he
wrote of angels and God

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.940
and at liberty when
of devils and hell

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.130
is because he was a true
poet and of the devil's party

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.200
without knowing it.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.880
That's a mouthful, and
it does account for some

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.770
of the appeal of "Star Wars."

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.690
Notice, if you
would, Blake, it's

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.520
not clear if he
actually believed this,

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.990
but he's venturing the idea that
a true poet is of the devil's

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.040
party without knowing it.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.870
Blake also wrote in
one of his proverbs

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.170
those who restrain their
desires do so because theirs is

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.940
weak enough to be restrained.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.000
A brilliant essay on "Star
Wars" by Lydia Millet

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.175
says that Vader is the most
erotic figure in the "Star

00:24:34.175 --> 00:24:36.590
Wars" family, and
the only tragic one,

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.510
and because of this, he
had a terrible beauty.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.760
He had an erotic charge
because he gets what he wants.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.790
He makes the dark
side seem sexy.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.880
That's her explanation.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.520
Is that relevant?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.800
Oh, yeah.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.690
No question that's relevant.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.200
But remember the pedantic words
about necessary and sufficient

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.440
conditions.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.180
That's a caution.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.680
OK.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.370
Now we're going to get to
my preferred explanations.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.640
There's a son, Luke.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.790
Anakin saves his son.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.750
Told repeatedly
by Yoda that fear

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.890
is the path to the dark side
and you must be detached

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:23.260
and not fear loss,
Anakin is attached.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.250
Luke saves his father
because of attachment.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.630
Anakin, in the most
moving scene to date

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.935
of "Star Wars," and
he's called Anakin

00:25:32.935 --> 00:25:37.040
in the script for the first
time, says to Luke's plea,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.900
I must save you, father, Anakin
responds, you already have.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.550
"Star Wars" is all
about fathers and sons.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.690
It can be generalized to
mothers and daughters.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.530
But the original six, they're
all about fathers and sons.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.460
And that appeal accounts for the
kind of depth of the attachment

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.740
that "Star Wars" itself
produces in many of its viewers.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.130
Since my book came
out, I can't tell you

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.800
how often children--
mostly boys,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.440
but some girls--
who are grown now

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.220
have come up to me
misty-eyed and talked

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.700
about what "Star
Wars" meant to them.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:21.730
And even more, I can't tell you
how often dads, often 60s, 70s,

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.490
and 80s, have come
up to me and said,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:28.820
I saw this with
my boy when young.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.830
And that is a big part of
the power of the movies.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.220
But it would be possible to
say that the father-son thing

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.590
wouldn't work unless there
was a kind of dark mirror

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:50.320
in the saga which tells us a
lot about agency and freedom.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.100
George Lucas, mirroring
the tale of Luke

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.320
in "Return of the
Jedi," with Anakin

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.540
in "Revenge of the Sith,"
said-- this is Lucas-- Anakin

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.680
says yes to the dark side.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.320
Luke says no.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:11.230
And it's under very precisely
identical situations.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.040
There's a pervasive
disagreement in the saga.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.150
It has everything
to do with freedom.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.860
It makes these all-American
movies, I think.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.700
The emperor thinks that life's
trajectory is foreordained.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.800
Everything is happening
as I have foreseen.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.860
Yoda thinks differently.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.100
Always in motion is the future.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.850
Guess who's right?

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.310
OK.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.390
So here's what Star
Wars is really about.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.490
By their innocence and
goodness and by the power

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.320
of their faith and hope,
children redeem their parents.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.370
As every child wishes
and hopes, any parent

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.380
is likely to save the
child-- risk his life

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.690
to save his child's,
even if it means

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.360
a contest with the
emperor himself.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.100
And when he does,
the Force is going

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.810
to be right there with him.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.880
Lawrence Kasdan, very recently
describing his movie career,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.100
said it's the biggest
adventure you can have,

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.180
making up your own life,
and it's true for everybody.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.610
It's infinite possibility.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.380
It's like I don't
know what I'm going

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.530
to do in the next
few minutes, but I

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.310
feel I can get through it.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.690
It's an assertion
of a life force.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.160
"Star Wars" is primal,
and it is a fairy tale,

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.640
but it's not just
a retelling of what

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.830
Joseph Campbell had to say.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.730
It's real topic is the fork
in the road and the decision

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.370
you make on the spot.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.000
It's universality
comes from its focus

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.410
on the most essential feature
of the human condition,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.230
freedom of choice
amidst a clouded future.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.930
At the decisive moment, grown
children announce their choice.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.630
I am a Jedi like my
father before me.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.120
So sure, it resonated
with the time.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.410
No question it benefited from
cascade and network effects.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.630
But it was bound to succeed.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.910
It's too good.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.754
I like that, and I believe it.

00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:19.253
Thanks.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.720
The floor is open.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] your
own cultural artifacts,

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.780
what lessons do you take
from this of this crafting

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.835
and promotion [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:37.835 --> 00:29:38.710
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: Oh.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.520
So in promoting my own
products, most of which

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.090
do not get large
numbers of Americans

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:54.170
opening their wallet for them, I
kind of learned from the book--

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:59.400
from doing the book that kind of
early enthusiasm is important.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.020
But my own experience of
writing and especially

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.090
this book is doing
the book was kind

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.620
of more fun than I've ever had.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.080
And I thought really,
I wanted to write

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.020
a book that would be fun for
me, and I hoped for readers.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.400
And the marketing stuff I've
basically left to others.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.120
But my advice to
anyone would be be

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.580
like those successful products
in the music download study.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.570
That is, make sure that
there's a kind of echo chamber

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.810
of enthusiasm that is getting
louder and louder because

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.200
of the nature and numbers
of the early adopters.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.050
That's what I would advise.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.960
And if you look at the
successful movies or TV shows

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.090
or books, it's not clear that
they're a lot better than ones

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.340
that you've never heard of.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.550
They're usually good, but
the reason they get there

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.758
is what we're now talking about.

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.099
Yes?

00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:03.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.610
So I noticed that
most of your examples

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.300
that you proceeded
to somewhat tear down

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.160
about why "Star Wars"
succeeded connected both

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.930
the original trilogy
and the prequels,

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.030
as you noted these
partway through.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.650
And I'm curious how-- what
the analysis is like when

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.810
you try to separate them.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.220
A lot of the cases
where it seemed like it

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.178
was a lot stronger if
you include the prequels.

00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:25.960
Well, as far as I
know, "Star Wars"

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.720
was pretty big before
the prequels, too.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.632
And at that, if you think
about just the original movie

00:31:32.632 --> 00:31:34.590
versus the others, though
that was a little bit

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.870
before my time.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.710
So yes, I was wondering
what your thoughts

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.430
of the differences there are.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.220
CASS R. SUNSTEIN:
It's a great point.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.890
It's a great-- you're
completely right.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.340
So to say that "Star
Wars" succeeded

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.790
in a way that takes on all
six, that's probably a mistake.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.000
The one we want to
put a spotlight on

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.190
is "A New Hope," episode
four, and probably

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.600
episodes five and six.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.640
Not the first three.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.790
The explanations I gave,
rifling through in my mind,

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:10.240
they all are plausible
for the original ones,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.810
which are the ones to explain.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.420
The one that's hardest
to apply to those

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.590
is the Empire Republic
tale, which is there

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.080
in the original trilogy.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.900
But to say that's why it
succeeded, that's crazy.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.340
It's there, but it's
not the main theme.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.560
So that puts another nail in
the coffin of that explanation.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.170
But the dark side,
light side explanation,

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.730
the ones about cascade effects,
the idea of the hero's journey,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.280
that and all the
others, I think,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.045
work for the first three.

00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:47.950
Now, you could say, in the
spirit of your question,

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.700
that the success of the
prequels, the economic success,

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.840
they made a ton of money,
was essentially foreordained

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.680
because you had a built-in
audience of enthusiasts.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.160
And that's probably correct.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.230
And you could say the success
of "The Empire Strikes

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.280
Back" and "The Return of the
Jedi," that was pretty much

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.330
guaranteed, because "A New
Hope," as it's now called,

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.610
was the second most
successful movie-- wasn't, is

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.200
the second most successful
movie economically of all time.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.270
The only one that beats it
is "Gone With the Wind."

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.510
and I like to think, you know,
frankly, I don't give a damn,

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.360
because "Gone With the Wind"
was a very different era when

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.620
everyone was going to
the movies and also

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.470
has had decades more time.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.020
So plausibly, "A New Hope" is
the biggest success of all,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.510
and it paved the way
towards the others.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.730
And all of the explanations
would have to be applied to it.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.230
So the explanation on which
I'm converging, really,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.180
is that it was
fantastic, and there's

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.340
a puzzle about why
no one saw that

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.200
except Stephen Spielberg
and a couple others,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.740
but that it probably needed
the cascade and network

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.970
effects early so that it became
like Rodriguez in South Africa.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.810
By the way, my
explanation of Rodriguez

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.860
in South Africa and
the United States

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.760
is 100% the music
lab experiment.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.900
He's really good, Rodriguez.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.360
But he didn't make it
in the United States

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.250
because he didn't get
the early downloads.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.860
He could've been
someone everyone

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.568
would have heard of
in the United States.

00:34:27.568 --> 00:34:28.686
He was good enough.

00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:29.519
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.940
Thank you very much.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.070
One of the reasons I
really got into "Star Wars"

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.750
is this rich imaginary world.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.550
And I was surprised not to
see it as one of the reasons,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.350
because I feel like kids
everywhere sort of make up

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.810
these stories.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.300
And I wonder if you have
any thoughts around that.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.091
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: Oh,
that's a great point.

00:34:49.091 --> 00:34:54.640
So that would be a strong
candidate for an explanation.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.160
And what I'm puzzling
over is it does

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.640
have-- it is a whole
world, not just a galaxy.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.810
You can enter it
and puzzle over it

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.790
and imagine pasts and futures.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.290
That's one of its
fantastic features.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.220
Now, there are a number of
movies and television shows

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.500
that try to be whole worlds
and, in a way, succeed

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.070
but aren't that interesting,
and so they don't go anywhere.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.390
So this is both a whole
world and-- and then you

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.990
have to say some things probably
along the lines just described.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.270
But you raise a great point.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.000
"Star Trek," by the way-- I'm
also a fan of "Star Trek,"--

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.630
has a similar feature.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.180
"Harry Potter," too.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.980
And there's another science--
"Battlestar Galactica,"

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.310
a great TV show.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.950
The second one, not the
first, has that feature also.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.660
But there are other
successful things

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.600
that don't have the
whole world character.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.430
They're smaller.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.770
And I'm thinking science fiction
by it's nature, or fantasy.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.480
Tolkien.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.410
It's kind a whole world stuff.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.390
And so that would
suggest that that

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.960
might be a necessary
condition for success,

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.319
but not sufficient.

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:12.110
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of things to say.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.550
First of all, one of the
first surprises in "Star Wars"

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.710
is the fact that it
started with episode four,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.640
and you're-- you're confronted
with that on the very first

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.800
screen.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.150
So I'm wondering, certainly,
as I recall, I mean,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.840
as the series went along, the
very fact that it was part

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.890
of this ongoing saga and
that there were more episodes

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.010
to come and more that
had already happened

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.020
was probably a very intriguing
factor that probably

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.930
contributed to people's
continuing interest in it

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.150
over the years.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.380
But the other thing
I wanted to say

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.300
was about the
whole father theme,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.480
which, as I recall, by
the way, didn't really

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.740
surface in the first movie,
at least not very much.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.870
It took a couple before
that really got going.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:04.360
But it reminds me very much
of another series, which

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.340
is one of my favorite
operas, "Die Walkure."

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.080
And the final scene
in "Die Walkure" to me

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.770
is one of the most powerful
emotional moments in all

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:22.670
of opera, where Wotan carries
his daughter Brunnhilde up,

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.970
he puts her to sleep and carries
her up and puts her inside

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.930
a ring of fire which can
only be broken, ultimately,

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:30.920
by Siegfried.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.890
But the whole reason
that this has happened

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.990
is that Brunnhilde
has disobeyed him,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.870
but what makes it
really powerful,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.160
aside from just the
father-daughter thing-- I have

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.150
a daughter and
it's always really

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:49.790
hit me very directly-- is that,
yes, Brunnhilde disobeyed him,

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.660
but on one level, Wotan
encouraged her to disobey him

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.090
and had his own rebellious side
which he really on some level

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.430
wanted Brunnhilde to carry out.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.310
So this is very
complicated thing going on,

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:06.110
disobedience and
rebellion, but tied up

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.040
with the god actually being
conflicted about this as well.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:16.320
So I think that opera ties in
these themes that you mentioned

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.430
of the father-offspring
theme and the rebellion

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.700
versus obedience theme,
in a very direct way

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.500
and certainly, to me, a
much greater and deeper way

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.100
than "Star Wars" does.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.470
But you know, it goes back
to the whole Joseph Campbell

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.200
thing, and you know,
I was just wondering

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.320
if you had thought more
about other examples of this

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.215
throughout some of the
great artistic works.

00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:43.090
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: OK.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.690
That's great.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.670
So the only thing that I
stumbled over in what you said

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:50.240
was greater and deeper
than "Star Wars."

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.890
That really upset me, and I'm
going to try to overcome that,

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.110
because I like you
very much otherwise.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:07.110
You're right that the
mother-child, father-child

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:13.180
tensions are in cultures
of many kinds and things

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.290
that are iconic for us.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.400
King Lear is an evident example.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.470
Hamlet, in its own way,
is another example.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.050
So it goes very deep.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.430
I think I'll make a
little plea for one

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.220
point you made, and then a
little plea for "Star Wars."

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:33.410
So in "A New Hope," my view,
which I have researched

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:41.410
with baffling intensity given
it's not that important--

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.220
my view is that
George Lucas didn't

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.950
know that Darth
Vader was going to be

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.850
the father until
after "A New Hope,"

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:55.050
and it was a ingenious
burst of creativity.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.220
He has said on
multiple occasions

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.800
that the story was about
a father and twins,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.680
but the early drafts are
highly suggestive that that was

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.680
a late innovation on his part.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:15.200
So father stuff becomes deep
in "The Empire Strikes Back."

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.610
Who's the dad is a nice
mystery in "A New Hope."

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.110
Luke doesn't know
who his father is.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.870
That's intriguing.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.244
But you're right,
that's not kind

00:40:22.244 --> 00:40:24.820
of in the heart of the thing.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.340
I think that-- this may be
Kool-Aid drinking on my part,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:35.000
but I think "A New Hope" becomes
culturally and artistically

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.170
really major in that I
am your father moment.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.750
Because the I am your father
moment has a characteristic,

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.260
and it's hard to think of
something that is similar,

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:51.860
of instant incredulity on
the part of viewers, followed

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.970
by an immediate, of course.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.430
That's very hard
to pull off, where

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.370
it's stunningly surprising, but
also like a key that completely

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.360
fits the lock.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.950
And I think law is
often like that.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.750
And my guess is that creativity
in engineering and music

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.890
and literature is also often
like that, where you have

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:16.580
a burst of thinking that
sorts everything out,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.390
often in the direction of
greater simplification,

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.000
but two hours before,
you would have

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.320
thought that can't be possible.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.350
And the idea that
same-sex marriage

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.560
is constitutionally
required by all states

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.440
now, that's an I am your
father moment, where

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.940
at a certain
relatively recent point

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.540
that we've seen a quite
implausible rendering

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.470
of the narrative of our
constitutional tradition.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.280
Now it seems like an I am
your father moment in the best

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.410
possible sense.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.480
I'll tell you one thing that
is like this a little bit,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.530
and it's maybe not as
familiar as I wish it were,

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.670
which is, as by its great
novel, "Possession," which

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.870
has-- I won't give
away the surprise,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.150
but it has something
about parents

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.910
and familial connections
that is, I think,

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:14.320
it's this the greatest novel of
the last, I'll say, 50 years.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.660
And it has something along the
lines of what you were saying.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.000
It has more than one.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.840
I say no more.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.400
And while it's not as vivid and
arresting as "Star Wars," it

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.500
breaks my heart to say
so, it may be better.

00:42:31.278 --> 00:42:33.290
AUDIENCE: I had a
more general question.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.110
As more people get access
to internet and technology

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:41.250
to make network effects
it'll only compound them,

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.040
but as things like
instant gratification

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.780
and people's preferences
change, do you

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.450
see these principles holding
true over time in 20, 30 years

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.804
and continue to be
predictable in the field

00:42:51.804 --> 00:42:53.220
of behavioral
economics, or do you

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.930
see them changing drastically?

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.010
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: OK.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.070
So let's make--
thank you for that.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.480
Let's make a few distinctions
that might be useful.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.870
So behavioral
economics, I think,

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:08.650
is most usefully
understood as focusing

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:12.980
on how human beings depart
from economic understanding

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.770
as a rationality.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:19.580
So the fact that in New York
relatively recently, people

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.940
were really scared of getting
Ebola, even though at that time

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.340
more Americans had
married Kardashians

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.550
than had died of
Ebola, and people

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.590
weren't going around saying,
I might marry a Kardashian,

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.280
either with terror or hope.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.410
But the event of getting Ebola
was so available in the head

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.810
that probability
judgements went awry,

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.780
so people assess
probabilities often

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.350
by thinking of what recently
comes to mind-- what

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.040
most immediately comes to mind.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.580
That's a behavioral
economics finding.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.880
So departures from rationality
are people hate losses.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.880
They dislike losses more than
they like corresponding gains.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.420
We can do that in this room.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.300
Half of you, it's just
courtesy of the organizers,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.840
half of you at the
end of this talk

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.940
are going to have to put
$10-- sorry, sorry people--

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.940
$10 on this podium.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.140
That's the price of coming.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.740
But I'm not going
to pocket anything,

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.490
because the other half
of you, each of you

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.420
is going to get one
of the $10 they gave.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.080
I completely made that up.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.050
But if we did, that the utility
in the room would go down.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.750
Because it wouldn't be held
constant, even though the money

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.650
held constant,
because losing $10

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:34.330
is more sad-making than getting
out $10 is happy-making.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.140
So that's behavioral stuff.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.540
And that behavioral
stuff, it's just robust.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.130
That's how human beings are.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.460
I gave some examples.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.900
It doesn't matter
what technology

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:48.870
is, the behavioral stuff, that's
either hardwired or just homo

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.990
sapiens.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.950
The informational cascade
and network effects

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.610
and reputational cascades,
that also shouldn't change

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.920
in its nature as
technology changes,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.690
though you're completely
right, that's not behavioral.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.185
That's more standard economics.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.960
That shouldn't change in its
nature, though how it manifests

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.270
itself will change.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.200
So you can create an
informational cascade

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.240
of the most preposterous
sort in the political domain

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.320
on the internet easily,
whereas pre-internet,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.060
that was really hard.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.360
You can create a
reputational cascade

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.060
among a group of, let's
say, "Star Wars" lovers

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.920
easily on the internet.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.461
So if you say-- I'm a victim
of reputational cascade,

00:45:37.461 --> 00:45:37.960
by the way.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.720
I've said that the
prequels are under-rated.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.590
I love them, love
them, love them.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.810
And one of the nation's
leading newspapers

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.365
described that judgment on
my part as unforgivable.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.780
That's reputational
pressure, big time.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.400
The internet can create
people who find themselves

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.390
into groups of types, niches,
who are often linked tightly.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.840
And that will change.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.010
What I'm thinking is
fantastic in your question

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.820
is in 1970s, because the
universe of communications

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.120
options was so
much smaller, that

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.220
to create an explosive network
effect, as "Star Wars" did,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.620
so it was everywhere,
a lot easier.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.220
On the other hand,
in nominal dollars,

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.270
at least, "The Force
Awakens" beat "A New Hope."

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.165
it didn't in real dollars, but
that's probably a footnote.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.195
I think "The Force Awakens"
is very, very good,

00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:40.610
but "A New Hope" is kind
of world-historically good.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:44.090
And the fact that "The Force
Awakens" did so incredibly

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:49.050
well, it's good network
effects, cascade effects.

00:46:52.214 --> 00:46:54.540
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.150
My question is that I notice
that one of your explanations

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.630
is not just sheer
luck, that there

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:01.100
is something predictable here.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.296
And in the
entertainment industry,

00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:05.420
they for a long time have
been trying to figure out

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.794
is there this
predictable formula

00:47:06.794 --> 00:47:08.789
that we can bet
a blockbuster on.

00:47:08.789 --> 00:47:10.580
But the reality is
because subjective taste

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.067
is so unpredictable,
they need to put out

00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:14.400
a lot of different blockbusters.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.250
And if just one
of those succeed,

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.220
it will make up for
all of the failures.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.136
So is "Star Wars" just
simply that one magic bullet?

00:47:21.136 --> 00:47:22.010
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: OK.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:28.590
So as between the predictability
and unpredictability side,

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.280
I'm on the latter side.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:37.890
So the fact that the Arab Spring
occurred, at least when it did,

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.050
is something like the
music download study.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.710
That one or another
political candidate

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:48.040
becomes triumphant, a lot
of serendipity and stuff.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.400
So you need the thing to have
a certain level of quality.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.130
That's a necessary
condition for it to do well.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.740
But it's not sufficient.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.290
So I'm there.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.880
The-- what I'm hoping
to-- I can't prove that.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.640
So as a data person, I should
be very tentative here.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.770
But what I'd like to believe,
and therefore believe,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:19.210
is that not withstanding the
studios, I think explicable--

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.820
and I'll say something about
why it's explicable-- pessimism

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.400
about "Star Wars" is
completely amazing.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.890
It had to do well.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.280
Too amazing.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.020
Now, the true
unpredictability people,

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.950
and I'm part of
that family, do not

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.680
like what I'm saying right now.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.590
But what I'm saying right
now is just too amazing.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.400
There are many
things that succeeded

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.760
that are great, but were
not too amazing to be great.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.450
They needed something like a
network effect or a cascade

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.210
effect.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.050
But if you look at the opening
scenes of "A New Hope," when

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:59.190
there's the big ship, and
it goes on and on and on,

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.960
it's like a joke.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.040
And I was there in
the first month,

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.719
and I felt transfixed
myself, as if I was

00:49:08.719 --> 00:49:10.010
the only person in the theater.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.980
It was me and the ship.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.746
But I'm told by people who
weren't quite that transfixed,

00:49:13.746 --> 00:49:15.510
and it was probably
true in my audience,

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.479
people stood and cheered.

00:49:17.479 --> 00:49:18.520
They couldn't believe it.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.290
They'd never seen
anything like that before.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.550
So that leaves a mystery.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.950
Why did the studio not get it?

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:30.130
And the explanation
for that-- this is also

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.830
very tentative-- it was just
so foreign to their models

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:37.160
for explosive success.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.730
It wasn't like "Gone with
the Wind" in any way.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.470
It wasn't like any movie
that had broken out.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:48.656
It seemed like space fantasy.

00:49:48.656 --> 00:49:50.280
Could you think of
a space fantasy that

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.150
did great before "Star Wars"?

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.790
No.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.330
"Star Trek," on TV.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.220
But that's a different thing.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:01.320
So then the puzzle-- then
playing with this explanation,

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.730
and we don't have a
randomized control trial,

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.330
so I mean, tentative,
playing with this explanation

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.310
that it was too great to fail.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.420
Then the puzzle is not
why did it do well,

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.500
but why did the studio not
know that it would do well?

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.090
And then the idea
would be some things

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.250
just are not
anticipated to do well,

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.640
even though they're
astonishingly good,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.772
because they're so unfamiliar.

00:50:26.772 --> 00:50:28.730
Who would have-- and
maybe that's what happened

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:29.790
with "Harry Potter," too.

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.790
Who would have thought that
those things, even if they're

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:39.030
great, would become every
childhood's favorite reading

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.850
experience?

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.360
AUDIENCE: So I feel
like you're sort

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.200
of touching on
something that jibes

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.410
with my recollection
of seeing "A New

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.850
Hope" for the first
time, which is that--

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.629
but you didn't touch on
this in your sort of laid

00:50:54.629 --> 00:50:56.420
out explanations,
possible explanations why

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.560
this is doing good.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.930
To me, the movie felt fresh.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.060
It felt new.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.560
It felt like something
I'd never seen before,

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.140
like from the
opening credits that

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.350
roll by in this
three-dimensional view of space

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:12.660
all the way down to all the
special effects and so forth.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.450
Which, of course, now
feel kind of dated.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:19.050
But, I mean, don't you
think that had something

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.030
to do with popular
success in the same way

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.590
that if you look at popular--
if you look at the Beatles that

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.760
came out, right, even
though it was in some sense

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.520
recycling things that had gone
on before, as was "Star Trek,"

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.200
right?

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.579
Because they were recycling
sword play and old movie themes

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:34.370
and editing tricks.

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:37.490
But it still had this
freshness quality,

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.230
but it felt like something
we'd never seen before.

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.540
Of course, like, the
counterpoint to that is now

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.404
my kids see "Star Wars"
for the first time,

00:51:45.404 --> 00:51:47.820
they still think it's great,
even though it can't possibly

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.320
feel fresh.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.560
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: It's
really interesting.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:57.810
In law, the most fresh and
original and kind of as a law

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:05.110
student joyful of treatises,
if that's not an oxymoron,

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.840
is a book on torts by Prosser.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.650
It's outdated now but fantastic.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:15.600
And it seemed kind of like
the Star Wars of treatises.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.080
And the author Prosser
wrote movingly,

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.430
I think, in his
preface, "a pack rat

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:27.750
is at best a collector
and no heroic figure,

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.600
and the most that can be said
for him is that he sometimes

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.810
chooses well."

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.550
Now, the reason I have that
association as you talk

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:40.960
is that having studied
Lucas, he is a genius.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.920
But he's also a pack
rat and a collector.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.570
So I'm trying to square
that with your true point

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:49.530
that the freshness.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:53.930
He originally wanted to
remake "Flash Gordon,"

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.010
didn't have the money
to buy the rights.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:01.270
Then, he wanted to draw heavily
on a Japanese movie called

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:02.350
"The Hidden Fortress."

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:06.350
And that's very much in "Star
Wars" in the original script.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.290
Of what became "Star
Wars," it kind of

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:11.720
was plagiarism of
"Hidden Fortress."

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.750
And all of the elements
you could find.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:19.280
Even the opening crawl
went back to stuff

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.750
that Lucas loved
from a younger age.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:27.620
So you're clearly right
that it got the freshness.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:32.760
But I want to think more about
whether that was indispensable

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.360
to the success or is that
sufficient for the success.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.945
And it's true, there was
nothing ever like that.

00:53:41.945 --> 00:53:44.320
But there are a lot of things
that there was nothing ever

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.770
like that people said, oh
my god, that's terrible.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.830
So Lucas did another movie,
"American Graffiti," which

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.810
was spectacularly successful.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:57.430
He did science fictiony
kind of exploration movie.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.170
I just wrote a book
about "Star Wars,"

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:02.000
and I don't remember the
full name of that movie.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.720
I'm not going to guess.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.640
But I tried to watch it.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.450
I'm sure it's my failure
and not the great Lucas'.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:13.146
But it didn't do well, that
movie, and that was fresh.

00:54:13.146 --> 00:54:14.020
AUDIENCE: "THX."

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.310
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: Yeah,
that's it, THX-38.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.610
AUDIENCE: 1138.

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.730
CASS R. SUNSTEIN:
1138, there we go.

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:20.400
You cheated.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.540
You looked on the internet.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.040
Yeah.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.290
AUDIENCE: I've seen the movie.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:25.910
I remember how boring it was.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.450
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: OK,
great, so that attests to

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.780
it had to be fresh,
but also electric.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.780
So maybe the awesomeness
of the movie,

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.290
I haven't gotten into
enough in these remarks,

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.970
and I think that's
clearly right.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.917
So Lawrence Kasdan,
the coauthor, one

00:54:43.917 --> 00:54:45.750
of the things he said
about the movie is it,

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:49.440
the Star Wars movies is they
move like a son of a bitch.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.070
And that's part of the
freshness, just this energy.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.960
And Lucas said, to spell
out a little bit what

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.375
he loved-- not what he loved,
what he noticed in his movies,

00:54:59.375 --> 00:55:01.290
he said what defines
them is they have

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.820
a kind of giddy exuberance.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.130
And he said that's very
surprising because I'm not

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.280
at all like that as a person.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.880
And I've met him, and he's
a very present and intense

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.570
person.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.290
He's not giddy.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.310
AUDIENCE: I definitely
agree with you on the, um,

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.560
the second thing is it did
feel electric and it moved,

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.576
you know.

00:55:24.576 --> 00:55:26.510
And that was the
other, like, going

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.120
back to how I felt
about it as a kid,

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.470
that was the other thing
that was a [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:31.360
But like pulling
apart the themes

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.170
for me and the
father-son relationship,

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.121
doesn't resonate with how
I remember perceiving it.

00:55:37.121 --> 00:55:38.870
CASS R. SUNSTEIN: Well,
there's a question

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.310
of individual experience.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:45.430
And then, there's a question
of social aggregates.

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:50.550
So my contention,
which you know is

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.430
based on something
like thick description

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.000
rather than randomized
controlled trial--

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.840
thick description
of the phenomenon

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.000
and how it's been
experienced culturally

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.070
is that the father-son
theme really gets to people.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:07.720
And that the twist
on the monomyth,

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.690
about the power of agency, is
something people completely

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.224
resonate to.

00:56:13.224 --> 00:56:18.140
Though it may be for you, it
was the freshness of the images.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.120
And there's no
question that Lucas'

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.470
spectacular visual
imagination is

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:28.030
part of the secret sauce
that made this work.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:28.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.860
Thank you.
