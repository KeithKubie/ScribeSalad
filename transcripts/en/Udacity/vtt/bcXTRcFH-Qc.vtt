I want to start this with a question. What do you think are the most important

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.031
parts of social and emotional development during your teenage years? There is

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.926
no right or wrong answer here. Just take a minute to think about what you

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:14.786
believe is the most important aspect of our social and emotional development

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:18.280
during our teens. Fill in your answer here.
