00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.776
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.756
&gt;&gt; Here's the background
on Allegra Goodman.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.390
She was born in Brooklyn,
grew up in Honolulu.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.823
She went to Harvard and the day she
graduated was the day her first book

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
was published.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.296
And Allegra Goodman was off.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.300
She got a PhD in English
Lit at Stanford

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.193
where she wrote her second book.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.740
She got married, moved to Cambridge,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.053
Massachusetts where
she has had 4 children

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.293
and written 5 novels including
National Book Award finalist,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.303
"Kaaterskill Falls."

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.580
Her work has appeared
in Good Housekeeping,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.960
Slate and American Scholar.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.606
She was named by the New Yorker as
one of the 20 best writers under 40.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.566
She is also the recipient
of a Whiting Award

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.506
and the Salon magazine
award for fiction.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.263
Those are the details of
her very successful career

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.166
but it really doesn't tell
you much about the experience

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.460
of reading her work,
of immersing herself--

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.360
oneself in her vivid
beautifully realized worlds,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.536
because Allegra Goodman is a
writer who is observant and wise.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.040
She is a powerful writer who
gently lays out detailed mosaics

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.206
that reveal the inner workings
of small communities and she is

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.166
that rarity of fluid writer
who stays out of the way.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.570
I discovered Allegra Goodman
through the pages of the New Yorker

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.316
where her short stories about
the Markowitz Family gave notice

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.890
that this was a distinctive voice

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.590
who was an astute observer
bringing the complexities

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.473
of Jewish-American
family life to life.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.986
Her novel, "Kaaterskill Falls"
only confirmed her quiet authority

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.673
and keen perception as she
describe the daily routines

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.346
which create reassuring rhythms
for a small orthodox community

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.320
who vacationed each summer
in a Kaaterskill town.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.830
Examining religious life with
the subtlety rarely found

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.063
in recent fiction, she also
demonstrated with great tenderness,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.360
the comfort and limitations
of weaving the individual life

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200
into the fabric of
the larger community.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.023
Allegra Goodman brings that same
thoroughness in telling detail

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.610
to her latest novel, "The Cookbook
Collector" which looks at the 1999,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.276
2000 dot-com bubble
and its aftermath.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.603
At the center of this book are the
Bach sisters, 23-year-old Jess,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.450
an environmental activist working in
an antiquarian bookstore in Berkeley

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.986
and Emily, an overachiever
in Silicon Valley

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.190
who is making a fortune at the
crest of the dot-com craze.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.700
And yes, there's a playful
connection to Jane Austen's "Sense

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.046
and Sensibility" with
pragmatic driven

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.700
and rational Emily counterpoised
against dreamy idealistic Jess.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.920
And because there is a-- this
is a Allegra Goodman after all,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.493
there is also a Bialystok rabbi
whose hearty faith adds his own

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.616
particular zest to this novel about
appetite, temptation, and doubt.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.100
"The Cookbook Collector"
is a modern novel, however,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
set firmly in the digital age.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.110
It's a techy paradise

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.910
where a Microsoft fortune
is considered old money

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.456
and Goodman captures that
world with humor and subtlety,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.040
as well as a contagious affection
for the character she creates.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.316
Her character struggle with
questions about what really counts

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.150
in a confusing world where stock
prices soar and crash in the space

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.693
of months, redwoods
are ripe for the ax

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.930
and rare books are often
too valuable to read.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.626
Her descriptions of modern
life reveals its ambiguities,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.213
some subtle, others not so much.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.956
As in all her work, the question
of how to behave ethically

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.630
in a world filled with temptations
is central and for Allegra Goodman,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.773
it's always the questioning
that's important.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.906
She appreciates, I think,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.096
that neither the choices we make nor
the values we live by are perfect.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.050
They're flawed.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.716
Often the recipes we follow
don't work or the meal turns

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.116
out differently from what
we may have expected.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.450
That's the human condition and it's
one Allegra Goodman illustrates

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.170
beautifully in "The
Cookbook Collector."

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.403
With the searching moral
intelligence, a singular gift

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.216
for creating vivid
miniaturized worlds

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120
and beautifully nuanced prose.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.590
She's given us a novel that
ripens slowly like a summer peach

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.313
and it's our pleasure to
savor every juicy bite.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.673
Please welcome, Allegra Goodman.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.956
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for
that beautiful introduction

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.536
and thank you for coming.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.660
I feel a little breath of air coming
through this tent and I have to say,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.566
the stay in this little breath
of air reminds me of home

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.526
and I speak this is
a Hawaiian, you know.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.283
[Laughter] The little
trade wind coming

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.750
through in this hot humid day.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.680
Well, I'll you a little bit
about my book, my newest book,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.656
"The Cookbook Collector" and I'll
talk a little bit about my process

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.330
as a writer and how I went
about writing this novel.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.983
Then I'll read you one
paragraph from the book just

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.596
so you get a tiny taste of what
it's like and then I'd love

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.096
to answer any questions
that you might have.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.900
So, different books of mine
begin in different ways.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.246
Sometimes, I come up
with a first line

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.180
for a book, sometimes it's an image.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.646
In this case, my idea for
"The Cookbook Collector" began

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.780
with an observation, a personal
observation which is that,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.706
although I love to read
cookbooks and I collect them.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.763
I actually have a large
collection of cookbooks.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.043
I don't actually cook myself.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.153
[Laughter] I began to be-- become
interested in this phenomenon

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.193
of people who read and
love and buy cookbooks

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.376
but don't actually cook and, you
know, for me since I don't cook,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.810
you know, the harder the
cookbook, the better you know?

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.610
[Laughter] I love all
the hard steps,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.426
the rare ingredients,
you know, bring it on.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.743
I'm not actually gonna
go shopping for them, so.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.976
So I began with this idea of
what would it be like to write

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.736
about somebody, a character
who collects cookbooks

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.583
but does not cook, actually
doesn't go into the kitchen really.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.983
From this, I sort of-- this
idea grew into thinking

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.210
about rare cookbooks, not just the
beautiful coffee table cookbooks

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.506
or the ones that we--
the contemporary ones,

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.110
the new ones that you might be able
to buy here but early cookbook,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.216
rare ones, early women's
cookbooks, 18th century cookbooks,

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.330
17th century cookbooks, 16th century
cookbooks from Eastern Europe.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.056
I live in Cambridge,
Massachusetts and around the corner

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.780
from me is a library called,
the Schlesinger Library

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.446
which belongs to Harvard.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.060
Once upon a time, it
belonged to Radcliffe.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.500
And this library is-- has a world
class collection of cookbooks,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.130
so you know, this is in the
category of write about what--

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.983
you know, write local, think local.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.856
I went to this library and talked
to the librarian there and I said,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.156
"I'm a novelist and I'm interested
in doing research in this library

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.386
and research into rare cookbooks."

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.233
And she introduced me to a
scholar named, Barbara Whitten

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.953
who is a cookbook expert and I
sat down with Barbara Whitten

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.206
and I said, "You know,
I'm not a scholar.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.360
I'm not sort of a typical
kind of researcher."

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.653
I always tell people this to
disarm them when I do research.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.136
I say, "I'm not like a
journalist or historian.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.096
I actually work away from the
truth, you know, not toward it."

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.850
Sometimes, my attempts to disarm
people actually frighten them a

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.850
little I think.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.116
So Barbara Whitten and I sat down.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.450
She's here in 80s and a world
renowned authority on cookbooks

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.433
and I said, "Essentially what I'd
like you to help me with is to--

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.866
for my novel to help me curate a
fictional collection of cookbooks."

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.673
So Barbara said, "Oh,
what's your budget?"

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.783
[Laughter] And I said,
money is no object,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.730
you know fictional collection.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.420
So, we began talking about
what books I might put

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.193
in this fictional collection which
was going to become a character

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.226
and my, as yet unwritten novel
and I called this research--

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.906
it's also a form of procrastination
[laughter] which seems to be key

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.536
to my process, my writing process.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.006
And she said-- she began to sort of
get into the spirit of it and said,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.433
"This cookbook is so rare.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.930
There are only 2 left in the world,"
but if they were third, you know.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.866
"This cookbook is so rare that
the [inaudible] has a facsimile

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.340
you know?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.606
And at one point, as we
we're batting around ideas

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.073
and I was writing down titles
that I thought I could include

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:57.766
in this private mysterious
cookbook collection,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.180
she started fanning herself
with some papers and she said,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.623
"You realized, Allegra,
I'm consumed with lust."

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320


00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:09.930
[Laughter] Research is really fun
and I thought I want you in my book.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.890
I want you.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.023
I wanna import you into my book.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.510
Because really what I was interested
and when I was talking to her was

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.543
to think about and discover
the psychology of collecting.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.000
My subject is always
people, not things.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.953
That's why my book is called,
"The Cookbook Collector"

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.553
and not the cookbook collection.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.790
The collection is a character in the
book but what really interested me--

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.943
in me-- what really interested
me was the sort of lust

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.490
that the collector has
and what that's all about.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.303
Now at the same time that I was
pursuing this cookbook idea,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.450
I had another idea which had
been growing on me for sometime.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.893
I'd always been interested

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.476
in writing a novel set during
the dot-com boom and bust.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.113
&gt;&gt; So essentially, in
writing a historical novel

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.933
about the very recent past,
I'm talking 1999, 1998,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.616
a historical novel about a period
that we've all lived through

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.770
and think that we remember.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.616
And I started thinking about, how
did these 2 ideas fit together?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.130
How might they fit together
in a book and I thought,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.516
I'm writing a novel
that's really about hunger,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.626
the hunger for collecting,
the hunger for food,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.673
the hunger for money which was
very much part of that time period,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.636
the hunger for knowledge and new
technology, the latest thing,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.576
the next thing, the hunger
for fame, the hunger for love

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:41.650
and connection with other people.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.513
I was writing a book about different
sorts of hunger, different sorts

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.586
of desire, so that sort of where the
beginning of this novel came from.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:53.766
Once I had the idea for this book,
I began what I guess I could call

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.043
as my writing process which seems
to involve a year of floundering

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.150
around having no idea what I'm
doing which I take lots of notes.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.436
The more notes I take, the more I
feel that I'm getting things done.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.010
I write notes.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.676
I think about the names
of my characters.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.943
I write genealogies for them.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.836
I write down all kinds

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.703
of information that's not
gonna end up in the book.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.303
Somehow, it seems to help me.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:21.683
And I do charts with arrows
between the characters.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.130
The charts for this book
got bigger and bigger

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.250
until I actually got those
presentation-sized post-its,

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.753
the really big ones and--
that you can put on the wall

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.723
and I wrote the names of
the characters with arrows

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.593
so that the chart looks
kind of like a brain.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.263
And again, this made
me feel scientific

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.390
like I was doing something.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.273
And I did some research

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.176
in the Schlesinger
Library during this time.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:48.986
I went and looked at
some of those titles

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.056
that Barbara Whitten
had mentioned to me.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.170
I held these books in my hands,
these gorgeous rare cookbooks found

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.936
in leather with gilt-edged
pages, their archaic language

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.673
in this beautiful reading
room Harvard.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.643
So you know, I do-- I did a fair
amount of research in that sense.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.293
I would also say though
that 90 percent

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.700
of my research is really
in my imagination.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.273
It's just the tiny amount that
I do when I go to a place,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:20.780
look at a book, talk to a person.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.006
Most of it really has to do with--

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.493
most of it, I'm probably doing
when I'm asleep and dreaming.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.586
So it's an imaginative
research, an imaginative process.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.100
And I would say the relationship
between a research and the book is

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.540
like everyday life to a dream.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.540
The book is more like
the dream that develops.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.330
After I had floundered around for
quite a bit of time, I plunged in

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.820
and began writing my novel about
this 2 sisters, Emily and Jess.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.713
Emily the older pragmatic one
as Jill mentioned and Jess,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.700
5 years younger, much
more whimsical.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.636
Emily is the CEO of a startup
company in Silicon Valley.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.360
Her younger sister is a
graduate student in philosophy,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.160
still trying to find
her way in life.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.506
who works at an antiquarian
bookstore which is where she comes

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.523
across the rare cookbook
collection and also where she comes

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.570
across a book collector
and book dealer named,

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.136
George who is quite
interested in her.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.533
I began my work by
writing during the day.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.263
I have 4 children, so I write
while they're at school.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.903
And I write a lot of
notes and outlines

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:33.513
which is I say makes
me feel organized.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.916
It's a bit like when you
write all those to-do lists,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.203
it sort of makes you feel
like you're in control

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:40.900
of an uncontrollable process
or an uncontrollable life.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.973
And I changed all my
outlines all along the way.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.343
I have a lot of interruptions
in my life especially

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.213
because I have children and with
this book which is an ambitious book

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.040
with many layers, I found that a new
way of dealing with interruptions

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.603
that I hadn't found before
and I share with any of you

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:02.333
who are working on projects,
during-- when you get interrupted,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.006
long projects where you have to sort
of keep the faith and keep moving.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.746
I began everyday's
work writing this book

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.296
by rewriting what I had
written the day before,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.063
before I went on to the new--

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.663
to new work and I found that
this helped me keep going

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.146
and keep focused and also
maintain the continuity,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.323
the voice of the book as I went.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.640
During this period, when I was
writing the book, when I finally got

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.766
down to it, you know the first
hundred pages are always the

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:33.586
hardest, but I finally sort
of gotten my momentum going.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.306
I did a trip to Berkeley, California
where half of my book is set

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.140
and did some location
scouting there.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.100
I googled Bernard Maybeck houses,
this beautiful Californian architect

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.046
and went-- drove around in a rented
car up in the Berkeley Hills trying

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:53.853
to think about where George lived
and where he might park his car,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.816
what his house looked like in
relation to the neighborhood.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.876
And I began to write
in different places.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.970
Another thing that I would recommend
to those of you who might feel

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.383
like you're getting a little
stuck writing in the same place

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.583
at the same desk everyday.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.250
I began to go to the places
where I had set my work.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.376
Later on towards the end of
my book, there's an argument

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.296
between the 2 sisters which
takes place at a Home Depot.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:25.603
So, I drove to my local Home Depot,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.203
not far from my house
with my little netbook.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.436
And since the 2 sisters were
arguing there at the store,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:34.576
I wrote the scene in the store.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:36.663
I sat on one of those
orange rolling ladders.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.703
[Laughter] And with my little--
I was typing away, you know.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.830
And because I wanted to be
with the real paint chips

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.990
and the real fake terra cotta
flower pots and all of that.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.490
And a man did approach me as I was
sitting there on the rolling ladder

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.363
and say-- and he said,
"Do you work here?"

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.763
[Laughter] And I said, "Yes."

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.830
[Laughter].

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.163
But you know-- and like many of
the people who work at Home Depot,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
I couldn't help him anyway so.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.300
[ Laughter ]

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.300
[ Applause ]

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.050
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, like all
writers, I get frustrated.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.416
My work was slowly at
times and there were--

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.936
there are scenes in this book
that I rewrote many, many times.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.330
There're also scenes in this
book that came more easily to me

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.703
where I somehow got under the
surface and got into that sort

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.203
of underwater territory where I
was completely absorbed in my work

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.536
and I think that probably if
you talk to other writers here

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.180
at the festival, they would
say to you that there are sort

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.186
of these moments where you
are completely absorbed

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.190
and completely caught
up and it's in that--

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.116
those are the times when
writing is really fun.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.633
I work sometimes at a cafe near my
house and I had a moment like that

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.366
where I was writing a scene and
I really was into it and I looked

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.220
up from my table which was by the
window and it was a winter day

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.886
in Boston and it gets dark
very early and I looked up

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.343
and it was dark and I was really
thirsty and I looked around

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.823
and I didn't have a drink.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.220
So, I went to the barista,
the counter and I said, "Oh,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.916
I think a hot chocolate
and I didn't--

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.166
don't have it" and she said,
"When did you order it?"

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.780
And I looked at my watch and
I said, "Three hours ago."

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.206
[Laughter] And she said, "We called
and called for the hot chocolate

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.680
and nobody came so we dumped it."

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.183
And I said, "I'm sorry.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.383
I was really into my work.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.383
I lost track of the time."

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:34.803
And this woman or girl, she
looked like she was about 16,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.896
said, "Dude, I feel you."

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.696
[Laughter] And brought
me another one.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.976
[Laughter] So you know, I mean
you know, you should believe it

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:48.703
when people say writing is hard.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.636
It's also fun, if you
keep your sense of humor.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.523
After I'm done with the
whole manuscript and I've--

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.603
in revising as I go along, I do a
lot of revision especially cutting.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.950
I've got more and more
ruthless as I've gotten older

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.283
and I will cut and
trim wherever I can.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.943
I revised the whole thing a
couple of times before I send it

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.903
to my editor so I feel that--

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.770
you know, I feel I can
show my face to her.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.236
So, that's a bit about my writing
process and then I'm just going

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.483
to read you a paragraph from the
book, so you can hear what it sounds

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:28.050
like and then I'd love to answer
any questions that you have about,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:29.860
"The Cookbook Collector"
or any of my other work.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.093
So the paragraph I'm going to
read to you comes from a scene

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.303
where George, the bookseller
has had dinner with his friends

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.513
and they've left and it's late,
late at night and he's thinking

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:45.836
about Jess who works for him
who is much younger that he is

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.630
and he really likes her and he's
imagining-- he's imagining her.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.136
Sentimentally, George
thought of Jess.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.240
Irrationally, he imagined her.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.510
Sadly, he despaired of having her

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.243
but this was not a
question of pursuit.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.600
Raj would laugh at him and
Nick would look as scams.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.633
But his fantasies were
nurturing, not predatory.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.186
If he could have Jess,
he would feed her.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.033
Laughable, antique, confusingly
paternal, he longed to nourish her

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.860
with clementines and pears in
season, fresh whole wheat bread

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.780
and butter, wild strawberries,
comte cheese, fresh figs

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.780
and oily Marcona almonds,
tender yellow beets.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.636
He would sear red meat, if she would
let him, and grill spring lamb,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.983
cut the thorns off artichokes
and dip the leaves in fresh aoli,

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.610
poach her fish, thick Dover
Sole and wine and shallots,

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.876
julienne potatoes, and
roast a whole chicken

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.730
with lemon slices under the skin.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.220
He would serve a salad of heirloom
tomatoes and fresh mozzarella

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.673
and just-picked basil, serve
her and watch her savor dinner,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.086
pour for her, and watch her drink.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.953
&gt;&gt; That would be enough for him.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.353
To find her plums in season
and perfect nectarines,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.440
velvet apricots, dark
succulent duck.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.133
To bring her all these
things and watch her eat.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.890
Thank you.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.390
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.243
&gt;&gt; Anyone-- anyone with a question.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.736
I see somebody coming.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.926
&gt;&gt; Yes, Ms. Goodman, having
read Kaaterskill Falls

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.666
in which a book collection also
plays no small part and intending

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.133
to read this book and I mean also
just heard David Petroski talked

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.120
for 4 years and-- or Henry
Petroski talk, pardon me,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:47.773
in which time when
asked about e-books.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.793
I would like you-- to question you
as to what will it mean to lust

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.606
after electronic publishing.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.740
&gt;&gt; [Laughter].

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.063
What is it like to a lust
after electronic publishing.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.950
Ooh, I think it would
be a different sort of--

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.550
it might be a different
sort of feeling actually.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.710
I have to think about that.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.526
I don't think lust-- I don't think
lust really comes into it quite yet.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.356
And certainly that's what my
book collector, George would say.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.290
You know, I think there's
a reason that in Facebook,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.456
you've liked something, you
don't love something or lust

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:19.670
for something, you like it, so may
be we just like electronic fiction.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.963
We don't love it or lust for it.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.030
Yes?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.146
&gt;&gt; I was wondering who encouraged
you to write since you're

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:30.980
such a young writer, it's obvious

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.750
that there's gotta be many people
encouraging you along the way.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.276
&gt;&gt; Thank you for calling me young.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.150
[Laughter] I was encouraged
by my family

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.773
and when I was a really young
writer, I used to read my work aloud

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.860
to my parents and my sister and
especially funny stuff that--

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.470
which would them laugh and
that encouraged me the most.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.163
And I always felt the
best thing for me would be

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.270
when my mother was laughing so
much that tears were streaming

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.950
down her face and I thought,
Oh, I got something there.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680
[Laughter] Yes?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:04.980
&gt;&gt; I know that like
myself as aspiring writer,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.463
I always like a certain
character more than others.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.163
Is there any character
in your new book

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.830
that you like more than the rest?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.363
&gt;&gt; Oh, my children, my children,
I can't-- you know, she's--

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.406
I love all the characters here
especially the unsympathetic ones,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600
you know.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.196
I think perhaps George,
George in this book.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.270
I felt like the highest
praise for me

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:27.613
when I finished this book was my
agent read them book and she said

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.066
to me-- we're talking about
George, the antiquarian bookseller

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.106
and she said, "Where's my George?"

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.293
[Laughter] And I thought, "Hmm."

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.826
[Laughter] Good question.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160
Yes?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:44.293
&gt;&gt; Hello, good to see you again.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.360
I was wondering since in the
novel, "Intuition" is about science

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.093
and science post-docs and you

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.093
and your husband sort
of lived in that world.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.596
So, I was wondering how much
of that was based on you

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.373
and David's experiences and
how the novel was received

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.473
by the MIT science community?

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.436
&gt;&gt; Well, my husband is a computer
scientist and "Intuition" is

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.990
about biologist, so you know--
so I felt very safe and actually,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.220
my husband was a little offended.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.686
He said, "Why didn't you write
about computer scientist,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.153
we're so interesting, you know?"

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.620
[Laughter] And that was really the
feeling of a lot of his colleagues.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.713
But great interest
in the MIT community

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.050
and in the scientific community
in that book and it was a lot

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.803
of fun having written about
a laboratory in crisis.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.510
[ Pause ]

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
&gt;&gt; Anyone else?

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540
[ Silence ]

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.390
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so
much for having me here.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.780
Bye.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000


00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.890
[ Applause ]
