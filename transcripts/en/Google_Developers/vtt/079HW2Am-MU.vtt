00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.570
SPEAKER: This video describes
how you can create navigation

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
buttons for your KML.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
You can view KML in geobrowsers,
such as Google Earth and Maps.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.170
Using navigation
buttons in your KML

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
allows you to guide your
users through your content

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.490
in a meaningful sequential way.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.270
To create these buttons, first,
create or acquire graphics

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.250
for the buttons themselves.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.700
Make sure they are an
appropriate size such as 75

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.290
by 20 pixels.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.760
They should be JPEG,
GIF, or PNG format.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.970
Next code the HTML for
each of your placemark

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.320
balloons and embed this HTML
within the description element

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.970
in your KML.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.720
Consider using tables to
format the text and graphics.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.220
Be sure all HTML out appears
within the CDATA element.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.350
You'll need to give
each of your placemarks

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.140
an ID so you can reference them.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.060
Do this by using ID equals
X in each placemark tag.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.930
Note that your IDs must
start with a letter.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
In the embedded HTML,
use an a href tag

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.590
with each navigation image.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.130
But instead of a standard
URL, use balloonFlyto

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.710
to point to another placemark.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.190
As an example the code shown
here points to the A placemark.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.940
Use these links to create
a succession of placemarks

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.590
in your KML.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.020
In the initial and
final placemark balloon,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.565
you can omit one
of these buttons.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
To see additional compelling
examples of KML in action,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.010
visit the KML gallery at
earth.google.com/gallery.
