Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. We're still talking about addition to alkenes and we've looked at these various, uh, electro file come nuclear files and into alkenes. And now at the beginning of last time, we introduced the idea of Osmium tetroxide and we'll go on to per Megan aid as reagents for Di hydroxylation of alkenes. Then we'll go onto things involving transition metals, catalytic hydrogenation, and also metathesis and, and, uh, catalyzed polymerization. So last time we looked at the end that Oso for which looked a little bit like oh three and could do the same trick oh three could do to give this Awesomei Tester, which is like an asset towel. Uh, so it's possible to add water and get the osmium equivalent of a carpet eal group and the two a hydroxyl groups added to the Termini of the alkene. So, uh, the problem with this is always, oh four is a very efficient reagent for that, but it's poisonous and it's also very expensive.

Speaker 1:          01:11          So you have to figure out some way not to use so much of it. And the way you could do it is to use just a little bit of it as a catalyst and put hydrogen peroxide in there, uh, in order to convert the osmium equivalent of trioxide back to the tetroxide again so it can cycle around and keep doing, uh, the reaction. In fact, it was improved in, uh, in 1976 by using a different oxidizing agent. This n oxide, uh, uh, uh, uh, the morpholine oxide. And in fact it's called the Upjohn process, which is relevant because the guy who's picture is over here who a state gave the money for redoing this room a while back was the research director at Upjohn laboratories. Uh, so anyhow, that was a good way to do it. But then, uh, we should notice something about the stereo chemistry of this.

Speaker 1:          02:06          We showed here a trans to beauty. And of course, if it's like ozone, the two oxygens, we'll add at the same time, therefore it at the same face. So the configuration you get at the two carbons where the Oah adds a Oeh is ad are related to one another. They could be ss as shown here. Of course, the Osmium tetroxide could equally well have come in from the bottom or that or the, uh, to beauty and could have been turned over and then you would have gotten rr. So of course you don't get [inaudible] without starting with [inaudible]. That is a single car rally a, however you can start with it in a ligand that attaches to the, to the osmium. So if you use a chiral amine ligand, then you only get one of the two, uh, eat and teamers of the dihydroxy, uh, c Dye hydroxylated alkene.

Speaker 1:          03:01          And this you won't be surprised to hear was also invented by professor Sharpless when we talked about, uh, last semester with respect to, to, uh, adding, uh, oxygen. And so this is called the Sharpless asymmetric die hydroxylation. He invented it in 1988 and I think this room was the first place he talked about it in public. He, he, uh, he was standing right there and in fact he did a demonstration on the, on this table as I'm going to do at the end, but I'm going to do a different dis, uh, different demonstration because Osmium tetroxide which he uses very dangerous and poisonous and he went and he actually spilled it on this table. I think it's now long gone since that was 1988, but at least what I'm going to do just use as vinegar so you don't have to worry about that. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:47          So anyhow, this, here's, here's a specific example of using Sharpless, asymmetric dihydroxy colation. With that dying, it gives a 97% in anti more excess of the, of the indicated configuration here. Okay? Now that per Manga, Nate is much cheaper and looks very much like osmium tetroxide so it won't surprise you that it also can do this trick. Uh, and here you, you get a 85% yield with cyclohexene and again, it's a sin addition. The two o h has come in on the same face, but that's not one where there's a catalyst that will make it give only one and a half timer. Okay. Now onto catalytic hydrogenation. So we looked before at the idea of drawing, uh, two curved arrows and making h two add to an alkene and saw that the orbitals weren't set up for that homo would match Homo Lumo with Lumo. So there's no profit in that.

Speaker 1:          04:46          However, we said, even though that doesn't work, that it does work if you have a metal catalin [inaudible] like palladium or platinum or many other transition metals. So let's look a little bit at how it is that palladium does this trick. It does it by providing orbital variety rather than just having the orbitals that we showed before the sigma of sigma and sigma star of the HH Bond and the Pi and Pi Star of the alkene. You have lots of different shapes of orbitals on the metal. For example, in ethylene we have the Pi and the Pi Star, right? But in the metal, palladium has four d ten five s zero and five p zero. So, uh, the occupied orbitals of, of palladium then are this Dz square. Now is that set up to overlap? Well with a Pi Star, the homo below and the Lumo above. What do you think? Is that going to be a good reaction? Who's gotten opinion? Carl?

Speaker 2:          05:57          To get

Speaker 1:          05:58          one side of the rent overlap and then maybe on one side but not as shown there. Right? That's what you're saying that yeah, you're right. They're orthogonal as drawn. But there are other d orbitals. There are five of these d orbitals so we could check out others. How about the D, Y, z? Is that going to do the trick? Are you going to get overlap if you bring that up?

Speaker 2:          06:19          Okay. What do you say?

Speaker 1:          06:24          If you turn to, you could, but it has shown it's orthogonal.

Speaker 2:          06:28          Right?

Speaker 1:          06:29          Okay. How about that one?

Speaker 2:          06:32          That's going to do the trick. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:34          No, Chris is shaking his head right. Won't do it. How about that one?

Speaker 1:          06:39          Well, it's still one of them is symmetrical, right to left. The other is anti symmetric, right to left, so they'd have no overlap. How about that one? Ah, just right. Okay. So that one can come up and overlap and stabilize the electrons that were on the metal. And that new orbital shown there is in fact the homo minus four. It's gotten quite stable. Right? In fact, part of the reason it got stable is the nature of the orbitals changes as Adams come up and meet the geometry changes. So this is not all those two, although it looks very much like those two original orbitals and in a sense came from them. By the time it gets to this point, at the complex, it's 40% of that DXY or but along the bottom 47% actually on the top is Sigma Chi has, but 13% is still the Pi Star.

Speaker 1:          07:28          So that is, that's just to tell you the ugly truth, but the fact is that the reaction began and went through a transition state because of the mixing of those orbitals. So that's two electrons. But how about the other way around? How about if we use the homo on the top? Now of course we have all these d orbitals on the bottom and few of them would overlap. And even that one, which does overlap you don't care about because it's homo with Homo. Okay, we want unoccupied orbitals on the bottom, which means that five s and five p. So there's the five p, that's an unoccupied orbital. That's gonna overlap well, and there's the five s it'll overlap. So you use some mixture of those two. You'll use a hybrid orbital, an sp hybrid of some sort on the palladium, which will overlap with that homo and stabilize another pair of electrons.

Speaker 1:          08:19          And there it is in the complex and you see it's a hybrid orbital below and the Pi orbital above forming that new bond, stabilizing those electrons. In fact, if you look at the ugly truth of the on this one, by the time you get to the complex has changed the 67% of pie and it's uh, 11% of an sp hybrid, but it's also 15% of that d orbital that we showed at the beginning. So things have gotten mixed up, but that's the way it happened because you had these vacant orbitals that could overlap from below on the metal overlap with pie, you had the filled orbital, the particular one, the particular d orbital, that can overlap with Pi Star. So you stabilize two pairs of electrons. That means you make two new bonds to the alkene. Okay? So the palladium or platinum, or many of these transition metals can do this trick of adding, uh, at, at the two, at the same time to the alkene.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Now you can also do it to sigma bonds. So here's palladium reacting with h two. It's just sigma and Sigma Star now, right? But if that's the energy of the starting material and a pretty crummy calculation, so don't hang your hat on this, these are successive stages as you go left to right. First you, you begin to associate the age two with the palladium and bond to it. Then the h two gets even closer, and as it gets closer and closer, the, the hydrogen spread apart. And the reason I've drawn them up and down a little bit is to show, uh, energy minima and transition states. So first you get the h two associated with the palladium without very close contact, right? Then it gets closer, it goes over a transition state and becomes this one which is closer bonded. And then you the h the, the two hydrogens come apart and get quite far apart, right?

Speaker 1:          10:14          But notice, at least in this calculation and in some others, as you'll see, it goes uphill a little bit. So that would seem to be unfavorable. You could do it, you could split the hydrogen apart on the metal, right? But in terms of of out kilocalories per mole, it's up hill. However, once it gets up there, these hydrogens can move from one metal to the next because we're talking a solid metal in this case. Okay? So in fact, it dissociates on the palladium surface and then the high drives move. So you get into advantage from entropy, from the hydrogens getting apart. Even though it's uphill a little bit in energy, it's very favorable to move them apart in entropy rather than having to have them right next to one another. So it's possible to dissociate a hydrogen on palladium. Now let's, and here's, here's a a calculation, certainly better than the previous one, was published in the Journal of physical chemistry in 2004 and it shows the same thing.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Palladium approaching hydrogen above Palladian approaching methane below. And again, I don't think that these are great numbers probably, but it gives you the idea of what I showed on the previous slide and some specific geometries. Okay. Now, catalytic hydrogenation puts these two reactions together that we just looked at. You have what you call ox, what inorganic chemists call oxidative edition. That's where we do this, which we just saw as possible to electronics can get stabilized because of the orbitals that are available to form something like a three member during here. Right? And that's called oxidative addition. The reason it's called oxidative is the way in organic chemists, electrons, they say that the, if you have a bond to metal, those electrons belonged to the, to the league and not to the metal. So electrons formally had been taken away from the metal. We'll talk more about oxidation and reduction before too long, but anyhow, that's called oxidative edition.

Speaker 1:          12:11          But of course you could do the reverse as well. You could do reductive elimination and Paul, the owl keyed back off again. Okay, now you'd do the same thing with hydrogen as we just saw. So you could have oxidative addition. Those two arrows move like that. And then the to give that and then the blue reverse, the reductive elimination and you're back where you started. But now suppose you do both of these things. Okay? Let's suppose that we first do the oxidative addition, the insertion of palladium into the HH Bond, and one of the H's, let's say moves away and now we have room on the surface of the palladium there to bring in the alkene and do its trick.

Speaker 2:          12:54          Okay,

Speaker 1:          12:56          so now we have this form. Now, of course you could do reductive elimination again. Now, incidentally, in that form, the experts discuss just how much the different bonds are formed. Sometimes they draw it this way and just say the alkene is complex, but the, but that begs the question of what is it that's holding the arche in there? And it's those orbital interactions that we looked at. The electrons going one way, the electrons go in the other, so we'll abbreviate will, uh, for our purposes of our lecture today will will say that the bonds are completely formed even though they may not be okay. So you could do a reductive elimination that could come off again, but suppose you did the other reductive elimination. Suppose you did that one. Okay, now you're over here and you've put hydrogen on one carbon and palladium on the other. Right. Now suppose we that hydrogen that's wandering around the surface. Suppose we bring it back. Can you see what I'm going to do now, Chris, do you have an idea of what's that next?

Speaker 2:          14:11          What about the title of the slide? We want to put a hydrogen on each of the carbons. How are we going to do that? We've got a hydrogen on the right carbon already. How do we get a hydrogen on the left card, Lydia? Yeah, and the carbon is bonded. The palladium and what will we call the process that gets that? He gets the hydrogen bond with the carbon instead of the carbon and the hydrogen bomb at the palladium substitution. Nope, it's that.

Speaker 1:          14:50          Anybody got a name for that? That's the reduction elimination. The blue thing we've been talking about. All these, right? They come on, they come off, they come on, they come off. But if you put them on one way and take them off a different way, you've done the trick. Got It. Okay. Now notice that that addition of the palladium to the, the, the oxidative addition of Alkene to palladium happened too at the same time. So they come in on the same face. It's a sin edition and then when the hydrogens replaced, replaced palladium, they come in on the front side is not a backside attack. Okay. When we curve those two errors, it's not attacking backside. So they come in from the same side as well. So the overall product is sin edition. The H's came in on the same here, the bottom face of the double bond. And of course if you put methyl groups on there and it were to beauty and then you'd expect to get that particular isomer of the beauty and where the two hydrogens operated added on the same side. Of course you couldn't tell it because the other two things would be hydrogens as well. How could you tell, how could you tell that the two came in on the same side?

Speaker 1:          16:09          You wouldn't use hydrogen. What would you use? You use deuterium as you say. Yeah. So then you can tell this. There'd be, and here's an example from the book where they use Deuterium and, and uh, uh, platinum oxide in this case. And the two ds came in on the same side. Okay. That was not necessary in this case to tell because you also had the cyclohexane ring there. So it's a, it says here, the Deuterium is added in a sin fashion. It's a sin edition. And here's a typical passage from another textbook. The loud and textbook that we use several years ago about stereochemistry of this addition reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, and it says Stereo specific sin addition happens. It says for most alkenes and it gives us example, but this I'm, I'm actually doing this little bit to show you how to read textbooks, right? So it says most alkenes do this and give stereo specific second edition and it gives an example, but notice it doesn't say what the yield is.

Speaker 1:          17:12          It could be one of these things. Remember last time we said there was a 55 45 right? That was said to be specific or to favor one over the other. So it doesn't say what the yield is and it doesn't give any reference to the literature where you could look up and see what the yield was or how they did it or how much of the other isomer there might've been there. Now this is very typical for textbooks and I have no doubt that this happens with, with high specificity in this case, but on the other hand, you shouldn't be satisfied with that. So you would look in another book like this book from 1972 by house modern chemistry. Now this is a graduate level text. So it shows an example here using palladium on carbon is the catalyst. Palladium on carbon means you have palladium metal, but you don't want to have a big chunk of metal because there's not much surface.

Speaker 1:          18:02          So you want it to be very finely divided, but you want to be able to handle it. You don't have very much. So you put it on charcoal, it's absorbed on the surface of the charcoal. So that's what palladium on carbon is. So it's done in a Siddique acid with hydrogen gas at one atmosphere and you have that a double bond. And what do you notice about the stereo chemistry of the product? Is it ascend edition, which is the product of sin addition Sebastian, the one on the left or the right, the one on the left, the two came in on the same side on the right. One came in at the top, one on the bottom, and 90% of the product is the wrong one. The one the book tells you, or almost any book will tell you, it's us in addition. And it often is, okay. Now, uh, look at this example from 1948 what's going on here? This is a, this is Barton in 1948. Anybody else? Remember what Martin was talking about in 1948 or 49 from last semester?

Speaker 1:          19:06          He, that was the first confirmational analysis and it was molecules very like this. So this is what he was working on these steroids, okay. But notice these two compounds are Al Lilly isomers. They only differ in the position to that double bond. There are three carbons in a row and a double bond between two of them, right? That's an how lily system. So these are isomers where you move a hydrogen from the top to the bottom, and now you have a double bond here in a single bond here. So those are Al Lily Chi Summers, right? And now if you look at the details of this primary literature, it says that there's a rearrangement of one of these compounds to the other, right? And it says that it happens in 80% yield, 80% of the product has gone from here to here. This is what you would use for catalytic hydrogenation.

Speaker 1:          19:58          But instead of hydrogenating at first went by Alec Rearrangement. Now how did that happen? So let's look back again at the mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation. First, you have the oxidative addition to that of the double bond. And then you have the reductive elimination on the right to put the first hydrogen on, okay? And then you put the other hydrogen on the left and continue. But of course, that reaction would be reversible. You could have not only put this, you could have, uh, you could, uh, have taken this back off again in the wrong way, right? And instead of going there apartment, you could, you could go there, but the other thing you could have done is if there's an Al Lily hydrogen in the compound you're talking about. So dot. Only the allocate, but the next door carbon has a hydrogen on it. You're here, you're here, you're here, you're here, you get to there, okay. And now one possibility is to reverse that way. That's the reductive elimination, uh, are probably oxidative addition that takes you back here that undoes those blue arrows and would take you back. But what other option is there? Can anybody see another option?

Speaker 1:          21:17          Leon? Aha. That compound is symmetric if you have an Lla hydrogen, right? So it could unzip that way too.

Speaker 3:          21:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:31          And now instead of going back to this, you go back to this, right? And if that, uh, uh, does the reduction elimination, right? You come back here and now you'll notice that's has I saw him rise the Alkene, right? The double bond moved next door.

Speaker 3:          21:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:53          So it's all these oxidative addition, reductive eliminations. But if, but if you go through that symmetric intermediate, then you can take the wrong one off. I should go back towards starting material. Uh, so they started material is actually, I saw him rise product. So that's presumably how it happens. So catalytic hydrogenation can lead the aloe rearrangement. And now let's go back and look at that paper, right? And we see that if, if we had that rearrangement, this could go to this. In fact, it could go to four different eyes. It could be the double bond here or here, or here or here, right? So we could come back to this. And now once you're here, if you add hydrogen, even if you added from the same side, those two hydrogens, they could be the opposite side from where the first hydrogen was, right? So now you could expect to get this and you'd expect more of this than this because that form is more stable.

Speaker 1:          22:48          It's, it's uh, conformationally a better, uh, a better structure. Okay, so 90% there. Now the nice thing is you don't have to even look at the secondary literature going back to the primary literature because it gives a reference here. So we could look at that reference and see here where they give the table about studying these things. And down here in row seven, you see they're talking about compounds seven Delta nine, 10, [inaudible]. So the, the ring is numbered in a certain way, and the double bond is between nine and 10. Okay? Now if they started with that material, you see they got 90% of the Trans Product. That's this one. That's what show near 90% 10% okay. But if they, if they did only partial hydrogenation, they still got 90% of this, but they had a 100% after doing 80% of the hydrogenation. It says here they did at 80% after doing that, they have, they don't have any of this stuff.

Speaker 1:          23:50          It's all this stuff, right? So if these things could go back and forth, right? It must be that the equilibrium lies in this direction. And occasionally when you get over here, you go onto the product, right? And that's the explanation of it. But it's interesting to look even a little closer to look at what happened if they started with eight. So suppose they start with eight. If you start, if it started at seven and you can go through eight to get down here, you get 90% of the product. That's their explanation. Suppose you start with pure eight, what should you get?

Speaker 3:          24:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:32          In terms of the product. If you didn't have seven, if you start with eight, Debbie, you've got an idea,

Speaker 1:          24:41          you should get at least this much, maybe more, right? If the way you get here, if some of it goes this way and some of it goes this way and you start here and get 10 to 90 if you start here, you should get even more than 90 to 10 right? Because you don't have the chance of going here initially. Got It. Okay. What does it say? You get 80% so there's something rotten here, but no one's ever talked about it. It could be just that the experiments weren't done really carefully or maybe the catalyst was a different little bit different in one pace than the other. I don't know what the answer is, but it's when you go back to look at the dig in to where the real results are that you find things that are interesting. So evidently this isn't a hundred percent understood, but I have no doubt that this aloe lake arrangement rearrangement is a big source of getting what appears to be the wrong edition.

Speaker 1:          25:41          That it really is an addition, but it happens after you've rearranged things. So the product isn't what you would have expected naively. Okay. Now the a process called metathesis of an alkene. This was reported, uh, when I first came here to Yale the first year I was here and it was amazing. People were amazed by this reaction and the mechanism was quite on, uh, uh, speculative. Nobody had any idea what happened at the beginning. But in the subsequent, uh, whatever number of years, 45 years, it's been figured out. And what is involved is a double bond from the metal to carbon. Of course there are, there are two other things on the carbon, but this is called an owl Kyla deep and complex. And in fact, this process was, this was the basis for the Nobel prize in 2005, which went to grubs. Okay. So this is a metal al Kyla Dean complex.

Speaker 1:          26:42          We come in with an alkene and do the oxidative addition to form that and a reductive elimination. So it gives a Metalla, cyclo butane, a cycle of butane that has a metal in it, right? Just by the same processes we talked about on the previous slide. Now those processes are reversible. And what do you notice about reversing it? Leon? What about the intermediate here? It's symmetrical so you can reverse the other direction, right to go to there and then that can come apart. And you've put the central carbon, the one that's here changed it from being attached to this carbon to being attached to this carbon. So you can take effectively to alkenes and mix up their carbons, which is double bonded to which, okay, now, uh, you, you've heard of Professor Ziegler who teaches the other, uh, Hu last semester taught the other organic of course.

Speaker 1:          27:47          Uh, he's, I don't know if you've seen him around in the lab. They, but he's unusually tall. He's six, six or something like that. And I point out here that he's not professor Karl Ziegler. We'll talk about Professor Karl Ziegler a few slides later, but he was visiting Japan in 1986 in this delegation of a junior high. Girls thought he was so tall they should get their picture taken with him, which is here, but he wasn't the only tall guy visiting Japan at that time. Here he is touring together with professor grubs. The guy that got the Nobel prize in 2005 who is equally tall. In fact, professor grubs is a daughter, played basketball at Yale. She's quite tall. I think she holds the rebounding record for women's basketball. Yeah. So this will help you remember professor grubs, I hope. Okay. In fact, they took another picture together with their host at the professor more Ohashi.

Speaker 1:          28:39          So again, I underline that there unusually tall people. Okay. But grubs invented a process called romp ring opening metathesis, polymerization. Now here's a double bond where both of the carbons in the double bond are part of the same molecule, the same framework. So if you cleave that double bond and exchange partners with something else, right, you still have the two linked together through this other ring, right? So if you bring in this alkylating compound and do the trick of metathesis, you get that. And now if you do you, the product is still an alkylating, a ruthenium here. So you can do that with another one of these molecules. In fact, you can do it with n of the molecules and they'll all link together in a chain like this to give a polymer, right? So this ring opening metathesis was the, uh, was a very important part of this.

Speaker 1:          29:42          Uh, Nobel prize work degenerate. A polymer, okay. Now a catalytic hydrogenation we saw looked like this, but Ziegler, Nada polymerization. This is the other Ziegler Carl sealer. Uh, German, uh, looks very similar, so it has to Tanium with it, with an r group on it. Okay. And now an alkene comes in oxidative edition to give this reductive elimination on the other side. It was that, but now that we could just call a different art group, it's not the original art group at CR group with two carbons in between, right? That we just brought in. Now what can you do?

Speaker 1:          30:34          You could bring it back to start over again, right? And that'll be the r and then you bring it in and that's the r. And then you do it again and again and again, and you could make a very long chain of ethylene molecules. For example. Now Ziegler found this, I, I contacted grubs a yesterday in order to get permission to show his picture on to you, add more Ohashi as well. And Ziegler incidentally. But he told me an interesting story of how Siegler uh, uh, discovered this. He was trying, it was during the Second World War and in Germany they were short of lubricating oil. So he was trying to figure out how to use triethyl aluminum to add to alkenes and then Paul liberal rise on the basis of that to get things that could be lubricating oils. And after the war he continued that work, but sometimes they found different products rather than these oils they were trying to make and they traced it to the presence of metals in the reactor.

Speaker 1:          31:34          So then they tried all different salts and when they use titanium tetra chloride, they found that they had made a heterogeneous cutout catalyst for polymerization. The thing that I show in here now, I underlined that this is heterogeneous. You mix these things together, it's a witch's brew and nobody knows really exactly what's in there and it's, it's not. And the reason you don't know is because it's a solid, it's not a pure crystal and compound is not something in solution that you can do spectroscopy on to figure out exactly what it is. So it's very hard to study the mechanism with these heterogeneous catalysts, but that doesn't mean they're not useful. For example, high density polyethylene, the number two of your recycling thing, uh, with ends of from 800 to a quarter million chain length, it was made in 2004 to the tune of 25 times 10 to the sixth tons, 25 million tons, right?

Speaker 1:          32:30          Or polypropylene with up to 10 to the five units in a, in a chain. Again, 45 million tons in 2007. So this Ziegler not a catalyst was a really a revolutionary thing for making a polymers, but it was hard to do the mechanisms. Okay. Now, one thing that we'll see later that free radicals also can pull them arise thing can polymerize, uh, uh, alkenes. But the difference here is that these are ISO tactic that you get from, from Siegler, not of polymerization. Uh, so I should tell you what tactility is, okay? So if you have a polymer chain and the alkenes had, say methyl groups on it, propylene instead of ethylene, then you have a bunch of stereo centers. Okay? Now notice that every alkene went in head to tail. That is Cah two then ch, ch, ch, ch, ch three ch two ch ch three ch two ch ch three.

Speaker 1:          33:36          Okay? So it's head to tail, but it stereo regular, all the methyls are coming out at you and that's called ISO tactic. Okay? And alternative would be all had detail, but Syndeo tactic out, back out, back out, back every other one, okay. And of course it could be random out and back. So there are these three different, uh, fundamental types of polymers. Eissa tactic, sidio tactic at a tactic, right? And they have different properties and we'll talk about polymer properties in the next lecture and why they should be different. So depends. So for some purposes, you'd want one for some another. Okay. Now, there are two questions that would address here. One is how do you know which is which? How do you know whether you have an ice, a tactic, or a Cindy, a tactic or a tactic? And for that you got to wait until we get to Nmr.

Speaker 1:          34:32          It's coming very soon. It's a really neat way to figure out which is which. But if more fundamental question is, how do you control what you make? Right? So there's, there are these catalysts. Instead of using titanium, use these zirconium catalysts, which are homogeneous, that means they're dissolved there, not some solid that's in there. So it's possible to do spectroscopy on these things. And Kamensky the name associated with this Catallo esis has to do with his accidental discovery that adding Mao makes these very reactive. Mao is methyl aluminum taxane, which is a sophisticated name for something that nobody knows what it is, that you mix stuff together and you get that. And it's not always the same. But if you add it to the, uh, to the, these zirconium dichloride complexes, you get a very active catalyst. So this is there. There had been, I think since this was discovered in 1980 I think there've been something like 7,000 papers written on it or something like that and 2000 patents. Okay. Now, one thing that's pretty much agreed on is that what this methyl aluminum taxane takes the chlorides off, puts an art group like methyl on the zirconium and leaves it as a cad. I am.

Speaker 3:          35:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:55          Now what happens next? The alkenes approach, but they approached from alternate faces. Let's see what that means. So here we take propylene and bring it into the front to make one of these complexes and then the r group shifts across and you make a bond.

Speaker 3:          36:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:16          Have you ever seen a reaction like that where you have a metal with a group attached to it? Alkane comes up and you form a bond here and this thing comes over?

Speaker 3:          36:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:30          right. The Bh Hydro duration is exactly that same kind of thing. Okay. Now, so we'll call that new group our prime. The original one was our, but now the next alkene comes in and associates with the Sercos Niamh. But what's different from the first one? I drew. It's now in the back, right? The first Al King came in in the front. So it goes on the back. Now the our prime moves back there and then the next al comes in in front and it comes over there and so on and so on. And you build a long chain. But notice every, every other one is reacting in front, in, back, in front and back. Now let's compare the front and back of this, of this zirconium complex. Notice it has an axis of symmetry there. If you rotate 180 degrees about that access of symmetry, you get the same thing again.

Speaker 1:          37:26          So the front and the back are super imposable. They look just the same. So whatever happens in front with respect to stereochemistry will happen the same way in back. So that will give the, the two faces fronted back or homo topic. They're the same. So you'll get the same chemistry, the same stereochemistry at either one. Now how is it different in this case that instead of having an axis of symmetry has a mirror plane of symmetry, what does that mean about the front? And the back. Sebastian, what do you say? What's the relationship between the front and the back? Are they super imposable? So what would you call them? Right? So those are in Antio topic. So whatever one's face does, the other one will do the opposite. And as you bounced back and forth what product or you're going to get now it'll be Syndeo tactic,

Speaker 3:          38:23          right?

Speaker 1:          38:25          And now suppose you take this one, which has a horizontal plane, which means the top and the bottom are, are both accessible on the front. You can go either, either the top or the bottom equally. So there's no selection. So what do you think you're going to get now if it doesn't make any difference which way you go

Speaker 3:          38:45          right

Speaker 1:          38:47          now the faces are a chiral and you get an eight tactic product, so you can control which one you get by choosing the symmetry of the, of the a league. And that's attached to the zirconium. Okay. Now, as I said is I promised you can also do free radical polymerization. I said we'd discussed that. So, uh, uh, fruit, this was the earliest kind of polymerization studied in laboratories. Okay. So Al comes in. Bingo, another one. Bingo. Bingo, Bingo. Bingo. So we're growing along chain, but the difference is that in this case you can get rotation around this bond to get that form. And when you do that radical is close to this hydrogen. And you can go from a primary radical to a secondary radical. Hey, that's downhill. Okay. And now you can add an alkene to that.

Speaker 3:          39:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:47          So if you do radical polymerization as opposed to doing these metal catalyzed polymerizations, you can get branches, you get occasional butyl chains, c four chains stuck on your long chain. And that means that they don't pack together as efficiently. So it's not as crystal on, right? So that gives, since it doesn't pack as well, it's not as dense. So that gives low density polyethylene, the kind of stuff that you get in a dry cleaner bags, that flimsy stuff as opposed to what you would get in a supermarket to carry groceries in, which is tougher and, and uh, and opaque. Okay, now let's look at it again. And we start polymerization going fine. Free radical polymerization. But we may not want it to keep going because properties of the polymer, like its viscosity, it's melting point, depends on how long the chain is. We may want to control how long the chain is. How can we control the length of the chain, right? One way to control the polymer chain length is to add a molecule like carbon tetrachloride. There are many such reagents, not just carbon tetrachloride. Okay, now the radical could attack the chlorine like this,

Speaker 3:          41:05          right?

Speaker 1:          41:06          And now you have a try. Chloro methyl radical in your chain is done right? But you have the tri chloro methyl radical. So it can I add to another alkene and then that one can grow a new chain. So you see what you've done by this is used what's called a chain transfer agent. It doesn't destroy the, the kinetic chain, right? The radical still keeps working, but on a new molecule. So you shorten the polymer molecules without terminating the chain reaction. So if you add more of the chain transfer agent, you get shorter chains. So if you measure the rate of the transfer of the reaction with the carbon tetrachloride versus the rate constant for preliminary ization in the particular case of styrene and carbon tetrachloride, that ratio is 0.01, right? So if, if you don't have to worry about radicals finding radicals, they're fee rather dilute, then the molecular length will be how likely it is to react with styrene compared to how likely it is to react with carbon tetrachloride and terminate the chain.

Speaker 1:          42:18          But that depends on the concentration of styrene and the concentration. So if you know these, do, uh, if you have, you can, you can then work out, uh, since the, the, uh, the transfer reaction with this, this process here is only 1% as fast. So if you had equal amounts of styrene and carbon tetrachloride, you'd tend to go about a hundred molecules before you got a chain transfer. So you'd get on average about a hundred molecular, hundred units in a chain. If you had more carbon tetrachloride, you'd get shorter chains if you had less, you get longer chain, so you can control it. But not precisely. There's, uh, there's, uh, a property called dispersity, which is, they're not all exactly the same length. They're average that, but some are longer, some are shorter. And how wide is this, uh, determined something about obviously the properties of the material you get.

Speaker 1:          43:14          Okay. We won't go into that any further. Now. Alkene and dying oligomenorrhea, ization and polymerization using carbon electrified as the active reagents. Now all ago means a few. So Alla [inaudible] is putting just a few such units together. And so we're, we're going to use either a sigma star of our, with the leaving group or, uh, or, uh, our cad ions as the reagent to do the polymerization. So if you have a r plus as an electrified, will you do a really interesting reaction? Notice you can take ISO butane and isobutylene react them with h two, so four, and add the elements of the ISO butane. And I've colored them because you can do isotopic labeling to see what's what. Notice that what added to the owl Keane was this ch sigma bond. What do you like? How do you like that Noel? He see any problem with doing a reaction like that? What's the homo at Lumo of the, of the purple molecule here. There's no functional group there. How can you do it? Well, tell me what would happen first. If you have concentrated sulfuric acid and react with this mixture. Where do you, what do you think would happen

Speaker 3:          44:37          first?

Speaker 1:          44:43          Where is there a functional group? The five on? So, so the Proton would attack the Pi electrons. And what, at which end would it attack? Would you put the Proton here or would you put the dot on the more substituted

Speaker 3:          44:57          carbon?

Speaker 1:          44:59          It'd be more cognitive of, you'd want to get a t beautiful cat. Yeah. Okay. So we'll, so we'll do that. Incidentally, this product was not irrelevant because that's what they mean when they say octane. That compound is defined as 100 octane for the engine performance. So this was, uh, we had worked on during the Second World War to try to make high quality fuel for airplanes. Okay. So we put the, we'll follow what Noel says and put then make the tea butyl cad ion. And now the t beautiful cat. Diane can react with the Al keen to give this. And now you'd say, why don't we just keep going? Well it depends on what the, on what the situation is and you'll see it can do that. But, but another thing it can do is react with this. Watch this, right? This is a tertiary cad ion, but it's rather hindered, right?

Speaker 1:          45:54          This one, if you transfer this with its electrons, curved Arrow there, right? That's a hydride shift. We've seen hydride shifts before the differences. This is happening between two molecules rather than for one car over to the next to the same molecule. But it was shown by Bartlett in 1944 that this process that happens, use it isotopic labels, right? So it gives ISO octane and what's the other product? What's the purple product? The h one, the hydride, not Proton. Hydride the h with its electrons. What up here? What was left behind the TV at OCAD iron. But that's what you need here. So this is a chain. It could go round and round. So you add ISO butane to isobutylene right now, uh, if you, if you don't have the ISO butane in there, then it turns out that it could do this polymerization. Right? I had another one and another one, et Cetera, et cetera. And that gives poly isobutylene, which is called butyl rubber. And it's not a very strong material, but it has the virtue of being air tight. So that's what's made to seal a tires when they made inner tubes and those days they were made out of butyl rubber, right to hold the air in.

Speaker 1:          47:17          Okay. So now these electro files in terpene and steroid biogenesis. Uh, now I've got to get onto this next time, but I want, but since I brought stuff here, I'm going to entertain you with a show and tell. It does, it comes after this set of slides, but uh, but since I got it here, I'm going to do it. So we'll turn on the light here. And what I have here is water and vinegar, diluted Siddique acid and this stuff that I bought down at the art supply store called mold builder. But if I read here, it says it's ammonia, a 100% natural latex. That means that came right out of the tree and water. So all that's in here is tree, SAP and water and ammonia, right? So I want to pour some into the water here. I'm going to take my jacket off and took my tie and actually make that white fruit,

Speaker 3:          48:34          okay?

Speaker 1:          48:35          So we're going to open it up here and I'll pour some in there. Okay? Now the ammonia keeps, the molecules will talk about this next time, uh, apart from one another of this light tax.

Speaker 3:          48:59          All right?

Speaker 1:          49:04          But if we add some vinegar, it'll get rid of the ammonia. Obviously I didn't measure it very carefully. Oh, there we, we're doing it. So now the molecules are coming together,

Speaker 3:          49:29          okay?

Speaker 1:          49:30          So if I reach in here and grab it, get rid of that water

Speaker 3:          50:00          drive a few times here.

Speaker 1:          50:22          So we've made a rubber ball. Good. Okay. That anybody wants to make a rubber ball, you can done and do it. Thank you.
