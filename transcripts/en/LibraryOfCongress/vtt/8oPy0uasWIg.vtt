00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.560
&gt;&gt; So in your experience,
what would people be surprised

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.570 position:61%
to learn about the Library of Congress?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; Well-

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.470 position:61%
&gt;&gt; I would say that it's their library.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
That, that, that it's just
not Congress' library.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.580 position:58%
That it's really the nations library.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.930 position:69%
And that anyone 16 or older is welcome here.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.490
And these are their collections.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.790 position:58%
And we've been collecting a long time
and have wonderful things for them.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.150
&gt;&gt; Right and if you can't
make it to the library,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.350
you can also contact us through
"ask a librarian".

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.550 position:69%
So, the library is literally open to anyone,
anywhere, all they need to do is ask.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.840
&gt;&gt; And I guess I would say,
there was this 20th century myth

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.150 position:73%
that everything was in the Library of Congress.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.650 position:72%
We had everything in the world ever published.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.560
Not quite true [laughter].

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.140 position:67%
And then the 21st century version of the
myth is that everything has been digitized.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.340 position:59%
Everything in the Library of Congress.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.660
Everything in the world is out
there, freely available on-line.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.110
And that's not true either.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.230 position:59%
So, as we said the "ask the
librarian', but also really worthwhile

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.890 position:58%
to talk to librarians where you live.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.200 position:58%
You know, to, to use your school
libraries, use your public libraries.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.090 position:66%
Often people can go to public universities

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.200
and they can help you find
all that we're finding too.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.050
So, we all work on this together.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.930
And I would just remind people.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.810
This is your library and those
are all your libraries too.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.430
So make use of us.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.530
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.130 position:58%
&gt;&gt; I think one thing that has really
surprised me, is really what you said

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.640 position:69%
in the sense that "it's everyone's library".

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.630 position:61%
And I'll have a lot of people from
home say "Well how do I get in there?".

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.720 position:70%
And not only can you get in there, but I keep
running into amazing librarians and staff,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.340
who go above and beyond to
help you find information.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.840 position:73%
That as you all kind of referenced today, I
didn't even necessarily know I was looking for.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.890
But they helped me on that path
and they put things in front of me

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.940
that I am always surprised to see.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.010 position:56%
And I've been in, I just counted up
today, a dozen of the reading rooms.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.290
For different research purposes.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.030 position:66%
And continue to be amazed at not only what
is there, but how easy it is to access

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.460
when you take advantage of the
librarians and the reading rooms.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.700
&gt;&gt; So as a science teacher.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.370 position:59%
And a high school science teacher, I
think it'd be easy to fall into a trap

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.050 position:75%
that I only need to teach photosynthesis, right.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.410
And or teach about mitosis.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.530
And then here, I'm starting to
look at these collections that are,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990 position:56%
I mean humanities collection, right.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.080 position:61%
What can I learn from historical texts,
where scientists maybe wrote this?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680 position:73%
Or maybe I'm looking at historical photographs.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.510
Or I'm looking at old newspapers.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.730
And so, the boundaries within
science and that separate science

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.630
from history class, for instance.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.440 position:58%
They start to disappear in some ways.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.430
So being here at the library
is really challenged me

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.430
to think a little bit beyond
the text book, right.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.280 position:56%
And think beyond some of the
standards that can be pretty narrow.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.870 position:70%
And to really exercise a creativity that got
me into teaching, I think in the first place.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.590
And that makes me a learner
and makes me love learning.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.360
And so being here at the library's
really allowed me to rekindle,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.820 position:67%
or just even expand, my thinking even more.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.650
Just because the collections there.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.290 position:73%
These are documents that humans created, right.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.960 position:61%
And humans, human history very complex.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.520
And human thinking, right.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.070
And so, I think that's been
really exciting for me to see.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I bet Peter could find you a poem
about photosynthesis [laughter].

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
