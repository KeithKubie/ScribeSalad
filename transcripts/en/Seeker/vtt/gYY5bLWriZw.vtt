00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.290
How can a man who fathered a child also not
be that child’s father?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.120
Nope, there’s no secret funny business with
the neighbour involved.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.070
Just Chimerism.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.070
Hey guys!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.300
Amy with you on DNews today digging into the
totally fascinating world of chimerism!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.310
In Greek mythology, Chimera is a fire-breathing
monster with the head of a lion, the body

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.410
of a goat, and the tail of a snake.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.430
It is, in short, something that blends multiple
species and thus can’t possibly exist in

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.430
reality.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.430
Except that chimeras do exist.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.960
Scientifically speaking, a chimera is someone
with have multiple sets of DNA.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.480
But if each individual has their unique DNA
signature, then a chimera is… two people…

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.570
rolled into one?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.620
Actually, that’s kind of what’s happening.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.830
It happens when an embryo takes in its twin’s
cells -- and therefore genetic material — in

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.910
utero.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.730
Twins happen when a zygote splits.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.300
But the moment of twinning — when the zygote
splits — is actually really important because

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.149
the later zygote separation occurs, the more
the two fetuses CAN share.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.330
Two fetuses that don't entirely split can
become conjoined twins, but ones dies, it’s

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.850
the same thing as losing a pregnancy early
on but the remaining baby can be healthy.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.540
It’s twin death in the first trimester that
we’re interested in looking at.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.829
When one twin dies, its material is sometimes
absorbed into the surviving embryo causing

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.899
tetragametic chimerism.

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.680
This is more commonly known as Vanishing Twin
Syndrome.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.649
The surviving embryo will develop with both
its and its twin’s DNA, meaning the child

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.020
will effectively be born its own twin.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.780
This sounds nuts, but Vanishing Twin syndrome
is way more common that you might think!

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.249
In 1945, Dr. Stoeckel was the first to suggest
that the rate of multiple conceptions was

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.999
greater than multiple birth rates, that more
zygotes divide than grow into fully formed

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.200
twins and the dead twin material is reabsorbed
by the living twin without a trace — except

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.749
for the DNA trace.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.329
Modern technology backs this with a rise in
two placentas detected early on with ultrasound

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.130
and only one heartbeat heard later on with
a sonogram.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.570
It’s estimated that about one in every eight
single childbirths start as multiple pregnancies

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.789
with cells from the miscarried sibling occasionally
absorbed by the survivor.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.810
Because our DNA is so fundamental to who we
are, there are some really interesting implications

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.820
with chimerism.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.299
Like proof of parentage.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.379
Two women — Lydia Fairchild and Karen Keegan
— didn't pass a maternity test.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.900
They're not genetically the mothers of their
own children even though they physically gave

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.959
birth to them!

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.650
The same thing can happen with fathers.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.890
In 2015, a US man failed a paternity test,
though he did seem to be his son’s uncle.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.780
Doctor’s found that the DNA in his sperm
was different than the DNA in his saliva.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.000
His vanished twin had fathered his child.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.410
Like maternity and paternity testing, the
legal system relies heavily on DNA evidence.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.180
In 2005, American cyclist Tyler Hamilton used
tetragametic chimerism as a defense against

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.569
positive blood doping results, claiming the
positive doping test was false because it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.750
was actually his vanished twin’s blood.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.800
And imagine if a chimera murdered someone.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.219
DNA evidence on the scene could exonerate
the perpetrator even if circumstantial evidence

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.489
offers definitive proof of their guilt!

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.780
Our DNA is pretty fascinating, and if you
