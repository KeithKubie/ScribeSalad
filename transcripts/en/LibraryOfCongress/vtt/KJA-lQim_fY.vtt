00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: I'm
Carolyn Rapkievian and we're here

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.680
at the Library of Congress today.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.170
We've been enjoying the music of
Zulal and Ara Dinkjian and I'd

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.660
like each of them to
introduce themselves.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: I am part of
Zulal, the Armenian a cappella trio.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.450
My name is Teni.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.890
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: I'm
Yeraz, also from Zulal.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.500
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: And I'm Anais.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I'm Ara Dinkjian.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.480
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: So
I'm going to ask all of you,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.260
what are your earliest
memories of singing or playing

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.120
or even hearing Armenia music?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000
Who wants to go first?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.300
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: I
don't remember a time

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.240
when I didn't listen
to Armenian music.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.600
I feel like it was
playing in the car,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
playing in the home,
from when I was born.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530
I don't remember a
time when it started.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.830
I feel like it was always there.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.140
It was part of parties and we
heard opera and we heard classical

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.550
and we heard all different
versions of it,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.120
but I don't remember
a time when it began.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.420
I feel like it was always there.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.720
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: When
did you start singing it?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.910
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: I think
I started singing when I was

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.780
about six or seven years old.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:35.660
And I stole some tapes from my
dad's library and I willed myself

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.320
to learn these songs the way
the singers were singing them.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.940
And I feel like I burned
through these tapes to the point

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.630 position:56%
where my parents were just listening
to the songs over and over again

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.370
and I think I started
around that age.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.360
Yeah.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.550
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
Anais, what about you?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.720
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: I think it was
-- I'm no longer religious now,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.380
but as a child because
of my grandmother I went

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.630 position:56%
to Armenian church and because I
had a sweet little voice they put me

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.220
in the choir and so I started
singing there, and from the age

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.120
of 11 until I went off to college.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.740
So it was mostly liturgical.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.210
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: And Teni?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.990
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: Mine
was a mix of everything.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.160
We went to church every Sunday so,
you know, at that time it wasn't

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.020
like now I have a sort of a
light version for my kids,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.640
but when I was a kid it was
a full two hour commitment

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.120
and I remember really
attaching myself to the melodies

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.660
and the rituals and all
of those things combined.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.720
The folk music probably came a
little bit later or in school

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.410
and I don't really have a precise
moment that it started, but yeah.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.180
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: And Ara?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.480
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Yeah.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.780
For me the most obvious
answer is the fact

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.440
that my father is Onnik Dinkjian, a
very renowned Armenian folk singer,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.140
but beyond that, like the
ladies said, Armenian music was

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.760
in the house in that
-- We went to church.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.960
So there's the liturgical music.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.860
My parents sang in the choir.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.140
I eventually became the organist.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.370 position:56%
All their social activities revolved
around choruses and dance groups

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.280
and so there were rehearsals and
there were concerts constantly.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.560
And when they socialized,
when people came over,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.220
they just spontaneously
started to sing in the house.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.070
So just like the ladies
said, there was never a time

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.680
when music was not in the house.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.270
That's how we all grew up.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.630
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Ara, you
were saying that your family was

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.010
from Dikranagerd on your
father's side and [inaudible]

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.340
on your mother's side,
and each of you --

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.290
I haven't had a chance to ask you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.150
where your families
were from originally.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.450
Do you know?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: Well, my -- I'm
Armenian on my dad's side and I know

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.800
that my grandmother's
family is from [inaudible].

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.850
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: And I'm also
half Dikranagerdzi on my mom's side

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.210
and on my father's
side I'm [Vanadzi?].

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.580
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: My mom's
father was from [inaudible]

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.300
and on my dad's side it's
[inaudible] and [inaudible].

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.360
So a mix.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.240
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
So I wondered --

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.730 position:56%
I know in one of the songs that you
sing you sing in different dialects.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.320
How did you come to do that,
and how did you research that?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.650
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: Well, we were
speaking with Ara earlier about,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.180
you know, the beauty of
music of the Caucasus,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.780
and how different cultures have
informed each other's music,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.600
but what's happened even
within Armenian folk is

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.940 position:56%
because the melodies were passed on
orally they usually weren't written,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.740
especially in the villages.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.690 position:56%
Ideas and melodies ended up shifting
a little every time it traveled,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.130
every time it went
to a different place.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.820
So this was lucky.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.210
I mean we listen to a
lot of archival songs.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.090 position:56%
So this happened to reveal itself
to us which was a little bit of luck

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.650
and a little bit of collecting

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.720
of which Ara is much more the
collector, but it happened to be

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.660
that we found these three
different archival melodies

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.160
and then the fourth one which was
a [speaking foreign language].

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.250
It was, right?

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.360
Yes. It was.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.550
So we ended up doing feeling
the need to pair these melodies,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.070
and we ended up through

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.920
that research finding the
different regions and figuring

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.200
out the different dialects
and putting it together.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.620
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I
think the question

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.900
of dialects is a very important
one because many of them,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.930
if not most of them, are on
the verge of being extinct.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.080
In particular, for example, there
has not been an Armenian born

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.630
in Dikranagerd in over 50 years.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.890
And the absolutely unique
dialect of Dikranagerdzi Armenian,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.560 position:56%
when it's spoken in its purest form,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.580
those of us who understand
Armenian will not understand it.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.570 position:56%
So the fact that when the generation
that knows it, and they are now

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.460
in their eighties and
nineties -- When they are gone,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.750
that dialect will cease to exist.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.700
This is obviously a result
of events from 100 years ago,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.780
but it's also a product
of the technology,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.820
how the world has gotten smaller
and you're not just confined

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.940
to your one area and
your one way of speaking.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.050
So this is all just part of the
transitions in life, I guess.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.350
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Ara, you're
a collector of old recordings.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.130
How have these inspired your work?

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.360
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: One of the
reasons that I collect music is

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.760
because when I'm learning
something I want it to be --

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.790
at least the foundation of it,
to be as accurate as possible.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.240
Not that I want to copy it as if
I'm some kind of a museum piece,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.720
but before you learn to
interpret something you should try

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.500
to learn the origins of it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.470
And, frankly, the earliest sonic
evidence we have of our music is

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.010
in -- If they're not on cylinders,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.180
then they are on the
flat 78 RPM records.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.630
And so I -- Since I was a young kid
I've been fanatically collecting

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.700
them because there
might be a fourth verse

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.390
that simply people
don't know anymore

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.330
or there may be an
instrumental introduction

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.850
to a piece that we simply don't do.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.150
Well, they're preserved there.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.090
And to me these are
cultural treasures.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.340
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
Do you incorporate

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.930
that in to your music sometimes?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.740
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I absolutely do.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.660
If I'm performing a piece that has
existed for, let's say, 100 years,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.740
I go back to those recordings.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.770
Again not to try to copy
them, but to be aware of them

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.460
and in some cases,
yes, incorporate them.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.220
As far as my own personal music
is concerned, my own compositions,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.560
all of that has deeply
influenced what I do.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.130
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: And you
also mentioned your father.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.680
Talk a little bit more about how he
has influenced your musical style.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Well, I learned the
folk music and the classical music

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:40.340
from the fact that back when I was
a kid you didn't use babysitters.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.730
If there was chorus rehearsal,
you'd take the kids with you.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.000
And there was every week.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.730
So I wound up bored out of my mind
because I want to play with a toy

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.160
or something and I have
to wait for two hours

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.810
for this rehearsal to be over.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.300
But without realizing it I learned
all of this great repertoire

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.290
and also I would sit with my
mother in the sopranos, you know,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.960
and learn that part, and then I'd
go sit with my father in the tenors

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.260
and I'm learning that part.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.620
But again kind of not realizing
what a rich treasure this was.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.920
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Some

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.000
of your work is original
work too, a lot of your work.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.870
How do you go about creating
your original pieces?

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.560
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I don't like
to think of myself as a creator.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.840
I think that's very pompous.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.380 position:56%
And I've found this phrase that
more accurately describes how I feel

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.630 position:56%
about that creative process which is

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.850
that I describe myself
as a song finder.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.330
And what I mean by that is the
best songs come fully formed

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.400
and you just hear them.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.790
You don't have to fix them
or add to them or edit them.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:05.130
And if that's true, then it means
they already exist somewhere.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.000
So I feel like, wow, I
found this beautiful song.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.650
So that's how it comes to me and
sometimes it's in the shower,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.410
sometimes it's in a dream.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.420
My wife even knows sometimes I
wake up in the middle of the night,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.610
turn a light on, and she doesn't
anymore say, "What are you doing?"

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.720
Because she knows he hears
something and he's writing it down

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.150
and then going back to sleep.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.140
So I don't want to take
too much credit for it,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.220
but I'm lucky that
I hear it sometimes.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.200
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: How
do you find the material

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.440
and how do you choose the
material that you decide to sing?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.740
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian:
It's so complicated.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:48.850
I think we -- Similar to what Ara's
talking about, we hear something

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.080
in a song that speaks to us.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.240
And the songs that we
choose are really the ones

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.410
that touch us in some way.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.960
We sing these songs
because we have to.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.160
We know that there's no choice.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.570
We -- They're coming through us.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.810
We're holding on to them
the best that we can.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.050
But they're sort of speaking
to us through history.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.540
A lot of times we hear an
old archival recording.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:18.300
A lot of times we -- Sometimes
we might hear another performance

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.970
by another artist of an old folk
song and there's something about it

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.560
that speaks to us in some way.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.450
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: I mean for
us I feel like many things are

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.200
about the balance of three.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.550
So it's not only the vocal
blend, but it's also, you know,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:43.520
our different approach maybe to
a harmony or what comes from --

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.680
What's, I think, interesting about
our group is that any one of us

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.420
by ourselves are not anywhere
near what we are together.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.500
And a lot of our song choices end
up being revealed in that process

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.130
because although we may be very
different, and we may have sort

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.080
of a different idea of things,
when it comes to music all three

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.080
of us will very clearly be
able to define what we --

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.570
what is evocative and
what speaks to us.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.280
So I feel like the music
cuts through very clearly

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.120
and when there's a song that
maybe two of us like and one

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.450
of us doesn't, then
that means something.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.910
So we end up doing the things
that speak to us across the trio

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.590
and those end up being the
ones that we're meant to do.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.900
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: And how do
you work out your arrangements?

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.780
How does that happen?

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.080
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: Very collectively.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.780
Yeah. Very much a process
that we do together.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.080
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian:
It's a little bit

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.080
like birthing a child
as well, you know.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.320
We go through some trials
and tribulation sometimes.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.600
Sometimes things come
very easily and quickly.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.230
Each song has its own spirit,
in a way, and we follow it.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.700
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: Some songs want
us to sing them and some don't.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.000
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: Yeah.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.300
Those -- There will be a song maybe

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.290
that collectively we
each individually love,

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:04.000
and yet when we try to sing it
together something doesn't happen

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.030
and we're sad and we
have to let that go.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.680
That song wasn't meant for
us for whatever reason.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.730
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: How has
your music or your thinking

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.390
about music evolved over the years?

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:20.290
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: When I
was younger I wanted to --

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.760
I'm a little embarrassed to say it.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.450
I wanted to show what I
know or what I can do.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:31.290
And I no longer feel that need now.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.820
I want to hit one note and have
people say, "Oh, I love the oud."

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.700
Not necessarily, "I love
the way he plays the oud."

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.120
But, "Oh, I love the
that instrument."

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.740
And ultimately I'm looking for that
perfect song which will be one note

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.450
and people are going to say, "Yeah.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.200
He found it.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.600
He finally found it."

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.120
So short answer might -- I think
my music is becoming simpler.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.590
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: I don't know.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.120 position:56%
I mean our music is -- Like anyone's
music, right, is an extension

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.440
of themselves, their
spirit, their relationship

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.890
with each other, and themselves.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:15.110
So for us, you know, within this
trio, we've grown into women.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.620
We were girls when we started and
for us Zulal has been very much,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.040
you know, the -- There's the music

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.080
and then there's like
our relationship.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.760
And I think the music
is very much --

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.810
The evolution of the
music is a representation

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.070
of our journey together.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.740
We started when we were
younger and now we've gone

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.980
through many evolutions personally
within that time together

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.890
and the music, if anything,
is a reflection of that.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.190
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Can
I ask a question?

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.490
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Absolutely.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.790
I was about to say -- Yes.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.550
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Has
motherhood affected your music?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.850
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: Of course.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.830
How could it not?

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.130
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: In what way?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.000
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Thank you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.190
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: Well, I
know just as an artist I know

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.560
that I have developed a lot
since becoming a mother.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.060
I feel like when I went back on
stage after becoming a mother

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.040 position:56%
and living through grief before that
and so forth things have opened.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.500
So, it's a little bit perverse,
but things have opened up in a way

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.030
that I had to work at before that.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.670
And I think that comes out in
the voice too since, you know --

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.140
for any musician or artist
it comes out in the work.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.450
But there's an openness
and there's both a strength

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.120
and an extra vulnerability

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.900
that I don't think you necessarily
have before experiencing a lot

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.240
of life's big experiences.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.890
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: Motherhood
has also made me,

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.970
and I'm sure for you guys it's
the same, more grateful to be able

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.840
to do this when you have
given so much to your children

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.510 position:56%
and it's -- you've experienced that.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:53.140
To be able to come and really
sit inside this music and be able

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.820
to share it with other
people, there's a new a feeling

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.050
of gratitude to be able to do that.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.540
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: And I think
there's something about it

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.940
that makes me want
to work harder at it.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.370
I'm giving up a lot.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.550
I'm leaving a lot at
home, as we all are,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.470
to be here and to be doing this.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.220
And so we want to make
it count every time.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.900
We want to make every song hit
somebody in the heart or feel right

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.750
for somebody or touch
somebody in some way.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.330
We want to communicate what
we're holding from our ancestors

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.950
and to be able to relay that
to someone somewhere sitting

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.440
in the room and for
them to feel that.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.930
And we want to be able
to do that every time

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.540
because we're giving
up a lot to be here.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.980
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
What about fatherhood?

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.390
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Fatherhood
inspired me to write lullabies

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.950
for my children and to think

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.730
about what I'm leaving them
when I'm no longer here.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.180
And the older you get the more
you realize time is so precious

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.730
so you have to do things.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.150
You have to do them now.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:59.480
If there's things you want to
accomplish, don't procrastinate.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.780
It will never be ready.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.130
It will never be perfect.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.050
You have to do it now because
when you're gone that's what

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.350
you're leaving.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.900
So yeah. Fatherhood
changed everything for me.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.410
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Is there
anything else in particular

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.510
that really changed what you do?

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.100
Parenthood obviously.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.800
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I think every
event in our lives affects us.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.960 position:56%
I mean as a composer, you know, I've
always kind of lamented the fact

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.670 position:56%
that music used to be for a purpose.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.840
And what I mean by that is there
was the song that you would sing

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.270
to ask God to make it rain so that
you can eat or there was the song

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.480
that you sang when somebody died
or there was the song that you sang

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.410
to put your baby to sleep.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.750
We've kind of lost
that in our society.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.330
Music has become something
that you're on the stage,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.060
you're physically separated
from your audience,

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.110
they're doing something up there,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.620
and then when they're
done you express,

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.400
you know, yourself by clapping.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.490
And then they go back stage and --
That's not what music used to be.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.790
As a matter of fact,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.940
in some cultures there's
not even a word for music.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.170
It's just what they do
when they're hunting.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.870
They sing these things.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.590
And I kind of lament the
fact that we've lost that.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.820
So I try to get that back
in my own personal way,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.010
writing songs for a reason.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.390
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: You know,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.370
you're all very accomplished
musicians and I want

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:37.720
to ask you why you have
chosen to focus on folk music,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.110 position:56%
Armenian folk music, as what you do.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.650
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian:
We tried other genres.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.950
Didn't we?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.500
From the very beginning --

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.320
We've been doing this over 10
years now together, and we tried.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.470
We experimented with different
styles of music, if I remember,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.000
and it was something -- When I
said that we sing these songs

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.280
because we have to, there is
something about the folk music

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.340
and just imagining that, as
Ara said, people created music

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.640
for a purpose and also
to express themselves

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.800
and to express what
was happening for them

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.910
in that moment whether it was
grief, whether it was joy,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.620
whether it was struggle
or hardship or love

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.780
or yearning, whatever it was.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.690
They used music and song
and voice to express that.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.290
And so there was something
about that quality

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.650
of communicating what was happening
for you internally in your soul

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.340
and to be able to share that with
somebody, there was something

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.650
about that, that spoke to us.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.980
And we couldn't do anything else.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.610
I don't know that it was a choice.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.360
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: Also for us
there's something very unifying

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.630
about it because we settled
on Armenian folk music

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.750
for reasons being all of, at least
part, Armeinan extraction and --

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.380
But we're all very
different aesthetics.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.010
Different aesthetics in general.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.550
Visual and even in terms
of what we like to listen

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.850
to outside of Armenian music.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:05.310
But somehow we came together and
we melded our different styles

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.640 position:56%
in to this thing that works and we
created our own little thing that --

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.990
It just -- It works for us

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.560
and somehow Armenian folk
was the unifying element

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.870
for the three of us.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: For myself, I would
never impose what I'm about to say

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.920
on anybody else, but for me the
brain is the great enemy of music.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:37.000
And what I mean by that is
music touches me the most

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.250
when I'm not conscious of it,
when it's touching my heart

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.320
as opposed to stimulating my brain.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.240
And so if that's true, I can
tell you that I responded even

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.330
as a little boy -- I physically
and emotionally responded

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.100
to Armenian folk music without
understanding why or anything.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.280
Now I want to give you
a specific example.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.220
I always found myself gravitating
towards these folk songs

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.680
in the 10/8 time signature.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.500
And it wasn't until
I was in my twenties

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.660
that I made the connection that,
wait a minute, my ancestors are

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:19.870
from Dikranagerd and [inaudible]
and 10/8 is the beat there.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.770
And I know that that
is not a coincidence,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:30.220
that it is I'm carrying the
genetic blood of my ancestors.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.660
And instead of intellectualizing
it, my body and soul just responded

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:41.890
to it and it confirms that you
need to trust your heart even

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.080
if you don't understand why
you think that girl is pretty

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.660
or why you don't like
that food or whatever.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.510
You need to trust what your body
and soul is telling you because all

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.190
of that history is inside of you.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.090
And so that's what I trust.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:05.380
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: I
want to ask all of you also,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.120
is there something else
that you would like to talk

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.780
about that I haven't asked you?

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.330
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Well, I'm
never at a loss for words.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.630
I'm sorry.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.990
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Go for it.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.630
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: I want to mention
that we had a rehearsal last week

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:31.500
and I told the girls that not only
of course I admire what they do

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.210
and I like what they do, but
I wanted them to understand

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.420
that they can't minimize
their accomplishments

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:46.410
because they don't know
who they're reaching

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.660
and what effect that's having.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.230
Their CDs can be copied and
travel all around the world

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.340
and somebody somewhere is listening
and it's changing somebody's life.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.320
So that's not to say that
they should have a big head,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.380
but it was my way of telling them

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.920
that they are influencing younger
generations by doing something

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.590
that is firmly rooted in
their history and yet is fresh

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.420
and contemporary and very positive.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.830
And I think that's a great service

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.600
that they're giving back
to their great history.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.390
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
Ara, talk about playing

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.710
in Turkey on April 24th this year.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:37.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: It was a decision
that actually came quite easy for me

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:45.130
because to go to the land where
the atrocities were held I think

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.070
in some ways is more
powerful than, you know --

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.980
In America we are geographically

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.430
and therefore emotionally
kind of isolated.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.730
There's something going on
over there across the ocean.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.530
There's some -- We don't know.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.830
We don't feel it.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.900
We don't even understand it.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.960
But to be there was
of course emotional,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.860
but I think most importantly
there are Turks, Kurds,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.660
and of course Armenians that know
the history and that are anxious

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:22.080
to reveal what they know.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.930
And in many cases to great danger
for themselves, for their lives.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.610
Not us here in America, but for
them because they live there

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:38.020
because they know that the truth,
while it is at times very painful

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.370 position:56%
and ugly, it's really our only hope.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.250
And for me it would
be unconscionable not

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:51.310
to support the risk that
they're taking to say, "Yes.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.650
There was a genocide.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:59.460
And we need to face that and
then we need to move forward."

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.530
I needed to go there
and support those

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.430
who are putting their own
lives at risk for our cause.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.810
I say our cause, but the very fact

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.300
that they're doing it means they
understand it's not an Armenian

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.820
Turkish issue.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.010
It is a humanity issue that
in some cases, for example,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.140
the Kurds are now living
through all over.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.630
And so it was vital to be there
and emotional beyond words.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.920
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: And you
were playing with other musicians

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.980
of different backgrounds.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.280
Is that --

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.580
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Absolutely.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.190
There were -- Everybody was
represented on the stage.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.550
And that's what it's got to be.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.640
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Tell me a
little bit more about that concert.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.660
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Well, the
concert was in Istanbul

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.860
and it was a four hour
concert and it was attended

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.430
by I think over 5,000 people.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.460
It was broadcast live
throughout the world.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:07.990 position:56%
And there were I don't know, maybe
over 100 different artists, singers.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.500
And everybody was represented.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.240
When I say everybody, Armenians,
of course, but also Turks and Kurds

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.960
and -- as well as Europeans and
everybody kind of uniting to say

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.520
that again it's not a
Turkish Armenian issue.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.110
It's a human issue
that we need to resolve

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.340
so that we can prevent
it from happening again.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:41.890
And everybody was -- really
put their egos to the side

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.980
and performed from their heart.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:50.250
And I know I was very
proud to be part of that.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.260
And I hope -- I hope that world
was watching because sometimes

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.860
who history teaches you
is your enemy if you get

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.240
to know them they might
not be your enemy.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.170
They might actually want
to be working with you.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:11.830
And I think it's very important
to keep those doors open

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.410
because actually you
can accomplish more

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.120
that way than remaining isolated.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.180
And that concert was I think
a perfect example of that.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.980
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
And it was recorded?

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.280
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: It was recorded.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.220 position:56%
Actually you could go on YouTube and
watch the whole four hour concert.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.780
Yes. And the concert
is called In Memorium.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.750
So I think you can YouTube that
and watch the whole concert.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.090
And there's an array of stars
again from around the world.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.210
And so many different
languages were represented.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:47.990
But all for that united
message that we have to somehow

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:53.050
as a species prevent these
things from happening again.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.400
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: You
know, our music crosses borders

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:01.800
and in many ways historically just
because we were at a crossroads

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.730
of cultures and because

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.330
of our recent history maybe you
could talk a little bit more

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:15.640
about influences back and forth and
in your music or in the folk music.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.250
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: It's best done
looking at a piece of music

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.680
across different cultures.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.430
[Inaudible] is one.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.190
[Inaudible] which you have in
Iran there's a Turkish version.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.490
There's a [inaudible] version.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.000
There's an Armenian version.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.360
I mean I feel like in a way the
music is the clearest example

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.900
of this idea is -- I
mean we were speaking

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.540
about this earlier backstage.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.840
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: Yes.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.880
You can take a melody and then
you can have 10 different cultures

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.190
arguing as to, you know, what
is the origin of this melody.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.520
And it's -- It can get serious,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.160
but in the end it's --
It can get silly also.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.990
Really I think for us to be an
Armenian is just to have a sense

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.890
of your history and what your
obligation towards that history

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.990
in to the future is all about.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:14.350
If you ask about specifically
influences, you know, in our music,

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:19.530
just speaking on behalf of
myself, the mere fact that I'm born

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.700
in America, well, that
changes everything.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.740
And just to get a little
specific, I hope it's not boring,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:35.270
you know Armenian folk music does
not employ harmony traditionally.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.390 position:56%
And it employs microtone, microtonal
modes, etcetera, etcetera.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.460
Harmony is a Western
European concept.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:55.090
So my life's work is how do I
wed the microtonal ancient modes

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.890
with western harmony, because I'm
born in America, I can't ignore

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.580
that part of who I am
-- I'm an American.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.220
How do I wed those in a way

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.500
that neither is offended
and both are elevated?

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.810
It's a challenge and it's a
challenge that is my life's work

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.320
and it's -- I treasure
trying to accomplish that.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.880
In some cases it succeeds.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.210
In some cases it doesn't.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.440
But then we have the Zulal trio who
are singing Armenian folk melodies

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.950
with rich deep harmonies.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.410
And the interesting thing, if
you don't mind me saying this,

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:37.000 position:56%
is that especially with Komitas, he
established and defined and declared

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.070
that there is a unique thing called
Armenian harmony which is different

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.640
than Georgian or [inaudible] or
Western European or what have you.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.670
And the girls are a great
example of helping to define that.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.310
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: Just this idea
of being in America and all three

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:04.490
of us sang a cappella in ensemble
form in college and yet Anais was

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.470
in Slavic a cappella
choir, I was in a sort

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.980
of modern pop a cappella group,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.320
and Teni was in a jazz
a cappella ensemble.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.210
And so just even our
own musical upbringings

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.210
and of course more
diverse than just that --

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.070
But just even coming from
a harmony point of view,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.040
it also brings in all
of those pieces.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.860
Again, you know, we were born
and raised here, all three of us,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.850
and we're reaching back through
time to try to elevate or connect

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.990 position:56%
with this music in a way and be
true to who we are at the same time.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.090
So I think that everything
that I sing I agree with.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.550
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: I just want to
add one more thing to this idea

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.160
of music across cultures.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.290
So we got an email a couple of days
ago, I don't know if you saw it,

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.120
from a guy in Turkey
who said, "Your music --

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:56.460
" It was in kind of funky English
and it said, "Your music touches me

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:02.240
or makes me feel something the same
way our Turkish folk music does."

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.540
In the same way.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.100
And he said, you know,
"You're welcome here.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.620
I personally welcome you to come."

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.770
But in a way it touches
back to what Ara was saying

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.300
about trying to find simplicity.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.690
And I think what, you know -- The
truth behind this music moving

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.670
across peoples and cultures is

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:25.230
that when it's right it touches
the most simple parts of us

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.190
that are the same across
countries and ethnicities.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:34.040
And so real folk music I
think really is borderless

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:40.280
because it evokes something that
-- in the part of us that is human.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.480
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: So
what are you all thinking

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.130
about for the future now beyond
getting simpler and simpler?

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.430
[laughter]

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.330
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: To be the
John Cage of folk music.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.520
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
Until there's nothing left.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:00.070
&gt;&gt; Yeraz Markarian: Well, we're
working on our third album

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.880
which will be titled
"Seven Springs."

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.340
And we're close to wrapping it up.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:11.600
We have finished off a bunch
of songs and we're just sort

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.340
of recording the last few pieces.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.190
So it should be out soon.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.490
That's our big thing.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.030
And we're performing in
Germany at a music festival.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.140
Our hope is to travel more
outside of the U.S. One

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.970
of our dreams has been to travel
back to our historic lands

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.850
and do one on one, you know,
archival collecting of songs,

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.390
to meet those people
that are still there

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.120
and are still singing those
songs however old they are

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.410
and if they can remember the words
we'll be all the more grateful

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.270
for it, and if they can
remember the melodies.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.860
But that's been one of our dreams
for a long time is to be able

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.080
to continue to collect and
maybe save a few more songs

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.000
that haven't already been recorded.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.850
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian: Ara, what
are you dreaming about still doing?

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:59.180
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: My dreams have all
been fulfilled and then again some.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.350
And if I have any more,
it would be to continue.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.960
I have all these projects
in my mind.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.200
I've done so many projects and been
so fortunate to have realized them,

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.500
and if I can continue and
do more at this point it's

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.280
for me the cherry on the cake.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.890
I'm just grateful for whatever I've
been able to experience so far.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.990
&gt;&gt; Anais Tekerian: I think we just
still have a lot more to express

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:29.730 position:56%
in the same line of what we've been
doing, but it does evolve with time,

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.640
with who we become musically.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.240
Things change.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.340 position:56%
Subtly maybe to other people's ears,

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.620
but we know how things
are changing for us.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.290
And that's -- It's always exciting.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.570
The more things start to
happen for us creatively,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.070
the more things start to happen.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.770
And that's a -- It's
a fun place to be in.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:53.720
&gt;&gt; Ara Dinkjian: And you will go
to the historic lands and sing.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.020
You will.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.370
&gt;&gt; Teni Apelian: We believe a
lot in, you know, the muses,

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:01.950
and the things higher than
us that control our ability

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.820
to find songs and all
of those things.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:12.800
So we just pray that they keep
giving us that ability really.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.210
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Rapkievian:
Thank you very much.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:19.070
Zulal and Ara Dinkjian were here
at the American Folk Life Center

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.530
of the Library of Congress.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:28.240
It is May 28th and we've
enjoyed music and conversation.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.550
Thank you again.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
