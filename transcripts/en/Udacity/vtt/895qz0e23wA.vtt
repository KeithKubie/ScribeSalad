00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.130
So let's compare the Simultaneous Multi
Treading and Dual-Core processors.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.420
Let's say that we have two threads
to execute, one is floating-point

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.480
intensive, most of the stuff it does, it
does on floating-point execution units.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.410
And another thread that is integer-only,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.870
it has no floating-point
operations whatsoever.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.200
Let's say we have 4-issue core that
can issue two floating points and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.650
two integer instructions per cycle.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.130
Do we get more performance per
hardware dollar we put in with SMT

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.490
added to a core like this,
or with two such cores?
