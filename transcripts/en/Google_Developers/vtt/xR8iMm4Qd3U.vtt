MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.310
interesting developer community.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.390
has asked this question.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.980
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.015
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.700
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.950
would like to ask questions.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.390
JAN KLEINERT: Hi there, I'm
Jan from the Apps Script

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.110
Developer Relations team, and
this is Developer Chat, the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.270
first one that we've
been doing of this.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.235
We have Andrew Stillman
with us today.

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.330
I'd like to introduce him a
little bit, and thanks for

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.280
joining us.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.420
So, Andrew provides
instructional design,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.180
technology support, project
management, planning services,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.800
execution support, all sorts
of other things for

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.390
implementing blended learning
strategies across multiple

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.590
schools as part of his job at
New Visions for Public Schools

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.570
in New York City.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.370
He works across multiple schools
there, and one of his

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430
primary accomplishments at
New Visions has been the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.930
conception, creation, and growth
of UPD, which is an

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.069
ecosystem for teachers to share
creative solutions to

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.440
problems that they face and to
build things called hacks,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.920
which I think are basically
the solutions to those

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.570
problems so they can share
solutions and promote things

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960
through challenges and
participate and present at

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.790
professional meetups
across the city.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.440
So he also works on developing
scripts that can be used for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.790
educators who are Google Apps
for EDU customers as well, and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.150
that's part of his work with
New Visions' Cloud Lab.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.650
So Andrew, thanks
for joining us.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.000
ANDREW STILLMAN: Thanks
for having me.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.840
JAN KLEINERT: We're really
excited to do this.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.210
I also want to mention
my favorite part.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.790
Andrew is also one of the
probably most prolific

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.010
developers, publishers in the
Apps Script script gallery.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.910
You've written many of our most
popular scripts that are

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.220
in the gallery, things like
autoCrat, Doctopus, which is

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.910
my favorite name, and FormMule,
which are really

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.120
useful scripts that we're seeing
a lot of uptake with.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.750
So I wanted to start by asking
you how you got involved with

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.330
Apps Script.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.880
So what prompted you
to start using it?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.050
ANDREW STILLMAN: Really, I
credit most of this work, in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.200
fact, most of the inspiration
for this work, to one of our

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.440
most high achieving principals,
a man by the name

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.340
of Mark Dunetz, who is at a
school called the Academy for

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580
Careers in Television
and Film.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.760
But he and his planning team
started the school four years

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.000
ago, and they came at the whole
planning process through

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.830
the use of Google products
and just found that the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.240
collaboration environment they
were in ended up being one

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.460
layer after the next, the best
way to solve a lot of their

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.020
planning and systems
problems in school.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.270
And so like layers of an onion,
they just kept building

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.760
and sharing spreadsheets and
forms and various systems

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.780
around everything from
purchasing to tracking student

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.260
behavior issues to keeping a
live copy of their online

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.800
grade book and mashing it all
up, integrating it, and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.030
basically creating
their own custom

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.150
dashboards and work flows.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.310
And so he was using Apps Script
in a rudimentary way

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.030
just to run basic document and
email merges off of triggers,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.860
usually form triggers.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.690
And I came along, and then he
pushed my organization to say,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.320
look, more schools should
be doing this.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.365
We're getting results here.

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:38.570
And his school has gotten
insanely good results.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.100
They just graduated their first
cohort, and they're at a

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.580
97% four-year graduation rate,
which is 30-plus points higher

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.460
than the city average.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.520
And they're a non-selective
New York City public high

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.400
school, which means their
student population is very

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.140
much like the rest
of the city's.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.070
And so it's just an
off-the-charts achievement.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.490
And so Mark pushed us to support
the work, which meant

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.420
that I had to spend some
late nights learning.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.960
And initially, we had
subcontracted someone to do

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.950
some scripting for us.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.209
And I don't have a coding
background, or not a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.560
particularly strong one, and so
initially, I was hesitant,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.100
and I just assumed we needed
to find a professional

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.240
developer to do the work.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.810
And gradually, I started hacking
away, and I had a run

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.090
in with some folks on the
Docs engineering team.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.850
And they were like, dude,
you can learn this.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.520
Do it.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.950
And so I started writing
scripts, and it blew my mind

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.530
how quickly I could be up and
running with things and just

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.250
how fast the development cycle
was, particularly with the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.960
code editor.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.110
It was the first time I had a
code editor that was saving

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.280
all my revisions, letting me
debug in a very clear cut way,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.360
and so it just transformed
my own learning process.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.660
And so suddenly, I was producing
like the first

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.850
really robust document merge
utility for Google Docs, and I

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.397
had fan mail.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:19.840
And it was just an unexpected
journey that just came about

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.760
through a demanding and
successful principal who

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.500
pushed me to figure out how to
make these things better.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.560
So a lot of my challenge
has been, ultimately--

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.850
like New Visions supports
76 New York

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:34.840
City public high schools.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.710
So if we're going to take the
esoteric script-based

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.730
workflows that exist in one
school and move them into

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.610
other schools, we have to think
about how to make them

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.490
as user friendly as possible.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.120
And so my first step was to
really learn UI App and figure

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.290
out how to put everything
a menu.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.280
So if something needed to be
configured or a document

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.890
needed to be connected to the
script or whatever, there was

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.390
no hard-coded dependencies.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.630
And so I quickly got into trying
to engineer Apps Script

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.150
solutions that would be
accessible to nontechnical

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.900
users, and that was the
motivation for the design of

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.320
most of the scripts
I've developed.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.460
JAN KLEINERT: And that's one of
the things that strikes me

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.460
when I try your scripts.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.020
I find that they are easy
to set up and use.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.190
You don't expect your users to
be going into the code editor

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.060
and changing values and setting
it up that way.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.490
You have these nice,
menu-driven, almost like a

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.380
Wizard-driven setup flows,
which, I think, make life a

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.530
lot easier for your users.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.520
Even though it's probably more
work for you as the developer

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.180
to put that system into place,
I think it's pretty helpful.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.330
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yeah, I mean,
I'm just not going to get

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.390
adoption, at least not by the
people that I want adopting

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.990
the scripts, unless
I put it in a

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.110
drop-down menu or a widget.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.680
So, yeah, and initially, I was
using ScriptProperties mostly.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.400
We started using ScriptDb a bit
more for storing, but just

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.980
figuring out how to
store values and

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.890
have persistent memory.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.100
We're also now using
UserProperties a fair amount,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.100
because we're interested in
actually having analytics on

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.060
usage by school.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.920
So those have been really
important things to learn.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.040
JAN KLEINERT: Cool.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.620
So can you tell us a little
bit about some of these

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.520
scripts that you've created?

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.580
ANDREW STILLMAN: Sure, yeah,
and maybe a screenshare at

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.560
this point would make sense.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:35.080
I want to show some of these
what I would call modular

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.720
building blocks.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.900
We've tried to think about--

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.010
I love LEGOs.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.185
I feel like most good softwarers
like LEGOs.

00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:47.790
So just the idea that we have
these flexible core building

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.750
blocks, two of which are
merge utilities.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:59.090
So anytime you see this mule
icon, which I'll cut away to a

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.920
version-- oh, wrong one.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.045
that's the autoCrat.

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:08.400
So this mule, which kicks and
neighs and what not, is just

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.170
an animated GIF.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.900
But this is the formMule, and
this script is responsible for

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.560
taking form data on a trigger,
or spreadsheet data, and

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.910
generating merged emails.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.520
And there's a bunch of email
merge utilities already in the

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.110
script gallery.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.180
But this one, in particular, has
the UI to configure it in

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.530
lots of different ways.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.179
And currently it can send up
to three templated emails.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.860
The templates are totally
configurable.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.400
They can be sent
on conditions.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.940
And so ultimately,
this becomes a

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.190
really important staple.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.640
The other thing this does is
it will create a merge

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.410
calendar event on a calendar
ID of your choosing.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.400
So if you want to have a
combination of an email sent

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.750
and an event created, it
can let you do that.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.820
The last thing this script does
that ends up being really

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.025
important is that it lets you
select columns in which, when

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:08.990
the form data comes in, a
formula can be copied down

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.550
from row to row automatically.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.030
And what's powerful about that
is that it means that your

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.270
forms can have a validated
drop-downs of items that then

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.320
get looked up in
another sheet.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:30.170
And that little stitch ends up
making any Google Form into

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.320
something that behaves much more
like the front end of a

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.720
relational database, so things
like student name, teacher

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.320
name, class period, anything
that is a validated piece of

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.840
information that might have
things looked up on.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.370
So, student email, teacher
email, start time with period,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.420
end time with period, those
kinds of things can be

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.910
referenced in secondary sheets
that are running in the same

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.930
spreadsheet as the form.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.280
And so what formMule does is
it allows you to copy those

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.710
values down from row to row
every time a form trigger

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.070
runs, and it means then that
your merged emails suddenly

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.540
take on a whole new power.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.080
Because you can email particular
people based on

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.370
incident type, or you can only
trigger a calendar event when

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.880
a particular drop-down is
chosen in the form.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.020
It just radically changes
the power of what a

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.380
Google Form can do.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.650
So that's one of the scripts.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:37.220
The other big merge script is
a document merge utility

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.190
called autoCrat.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.400
And the reason it's called the
autoCrat is so you don't have

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.580
to be the bureaucrat.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.430
But that is Stalin's mustache
that's twitching

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.070
around on the autoCrat.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.040
And those little tags that you
see on his chest are the

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.800
notation that we use
for the merge tags

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.180
in a document template.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.190
So this is a Google document
merge utility.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.410
It basically produces either
a PDF or a Google Doc.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.670
It merges in rows of data.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.130
It merges into the header,
the footer, the body.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.390
It preserves formatting.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.740
It's fairly robust, and the
field mapping is all

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.530
accomplished through a UI.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:29.550
So when I'm storing field
mappings in a JSON string, and

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:36.980
then those settings are
persistent, and it just works.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.350
It also brings in sharing, so
you can, in the process of

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:46.790
merging a document, also merge
in Collaborators and also

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.340
organize the document in a
folder of your choosing.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.580
So it means the schools can
now do things like have a

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.600
mastered lesson plan generator
where lesson plans are

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.110
deposited in a lesson library
for the school, pre-shared

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.130
with the teacher, and
yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.100
So this is the second
big building block.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.290
I'm just going to cut away
to this workflow.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.520
This is an example system.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.720
This is one of the more
sophisticated systems that

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.540
schools I work with
are playing with.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.640
And again, these are designed
as part of an initiative

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.950
called the Cloud Lab, which was
something we just launched

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.240
this summer.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.110
But it's essentially engaging
schools as design partners in

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.760
systems rethinking.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.850
And I think for the first time
in the history of software, we

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.070
actually have enough flexibility
and usability in

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.100
the basic systems building
blocks that school level

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.270
people can actually
make these things.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.020
JAN KLEINERT: Well, that's
interesting.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.410
So the people that are working
with these building blocks

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.260
that you've put together
are not programmers.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.870
They're teachers who just have
an interest in making their

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.190
lives a little less
complicated.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.660
ANDREW STILLMAN: They're
power users at the

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.260
school level, right?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.930
So they're going to the script
gallery saying, I've got a

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.450
Google Form that I want to
have generate a document.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.040
The secretaries need to have a
way to generate a lateness

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.500
letter, blah, blah, blah.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.180
There's a million and one
different systems in schools

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.335
that there are no essentially
provided systems for.

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.570
And a lot of the essentially
provided systems, especially

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.100
in New York, are antiquated.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.220
So many schools operate with
tremendous inefficiencies.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.100
And as soon as they start to see
what these building blocks

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.560
can do, it opens up 50,000
different things that they

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.450
suddenly are like, why are we
using a triplicate form with

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.390
carbon copy?

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.390
Ugh.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.470
They just start cobbling
these things together.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.480
So this is a workflow that shows
the logic for what's

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.240
called a conduct intervention
communication log, which is a

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.010
catcall form for logging
everything from school home

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.910
attendance outreach calls, to
behavior incidents, to parent

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.520
teacher conferences,
to whatever.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.130
So it's like an anecdotal
capture point.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.080
And then it has all these
emails triggers.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.460
So we have all these
conditionals built that have

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.940
to do with, do you want to
notify the kid's adviser?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.980
An adviser is usually, in most
small New York City schools,

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.460
the point person
for most social

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.720
emotional issues for kids.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.970
So keeping that person in the
loop is really important.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.840
This radically changes the
way you can do that.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.580
JAN KLEINERT: So I have a
question for you about this.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.840
So prior to having a
script-based solution like

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.330
this, the script in Docs and all
of this workflow, how was

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.780
this process being managed?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.990
Or was it being managed?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.980
ANDREW STILLMAN: Prior
to scripts?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.330
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, what
was happening before?

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.640
ANDREW STILLMAN:
It was a mess.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.095
Oftentimes, it just
wasn't happening.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.010
If I have a behavior incident
with a child in one of my

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.650
classes and I want the adviser
to know about it, it would

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.590
mean often physically finding
that person in the midst of a

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.540
busy school day or sending them
an individual email which

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.540
then gets lost in an inbox
somewhere and that doesn't

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.370
have a clear counting
attached to it.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.120
So there was no centralized way
for anyone to look at a

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.590
single student and understand a
history of interactions and

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.180
a history of home contacts
that might have happened.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.200
It'd be like calling your credit
card company and having

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.710
them not know anything about
you, whereas in most other

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.990
industries, you have a
persistence and a coherence of

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.280
just information management.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.160
And this kind of stuff just
doesn't exist in public

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.340
schools for the most part.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.780
So this really changes the
underlying fabric of how a lot

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.450
of these schools are
able to work.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.680
JAN KLEINERT: Great.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.360
Cool.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.450
So this one seems to use not
just autoCrat and formMule,

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.230
but another one as well.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.970
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yes,
the pushData.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.000
JAN KLEINERT: My
favorite icon.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.233
ANDREW STILLMAN: So we
need to show off

00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:02.490
that icon for a second.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:10.100
So pushData uses a hamster
because one of my favorite

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.080
things about Apps Script is it
works almost at the speed of a

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.070
human being.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.800
It literally looks like
a screen macro running

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.840
when you see it.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.890
And so this script, in
particular, it does

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.640
essentially the job
of ImportRange.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.030
ImportRange is a function
that's unique to Google

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.760
Spreadsheets that lets you bring
a specified range of

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.780
data into another spreadsheet
just using

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.120
its spreadsheet key.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.915
But it's limited in terms of the
number of rows of data it

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:43.480
can handle, and it can really
slow down your spreadsheets if

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.290
you're working with
larger than 2,000

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.760
rows of data or something.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.800
So pushData is a replacement
for that that

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.180
pushes on a time trigger.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.200
And it lets you choose a source
and a destination

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.340
sheet, and it becomes a console
for mapping all the

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.960
relationships between
spreadsheets in a root folder.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.060
So if you have a folder for a
system that has, let's say, 10

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.770
or 15 different spreadsheets
involved, I could maintain,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.869
for example, a master student
list in one location, and then

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:18.230
I could have certain columns of
that pushed out to as many

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.450
other locations as I want on
a regular time trigger.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.670
So it then allows you to do
things like VLOOKUPs on

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.340
student name in 50
different forms.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.755
You could have as many different
systems as you want

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:36.600
that are all keyed on the same
up-to-date, synchronized

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.020
master list.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.020
So it in some ways is a
substitute for having a true

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.650
relational database.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.040
School-level people are not
going to be able to set up a

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.360
relational database.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.780
They need a flexible spreadsheet
environment.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.778
JAN KLEINERT: Something where
they don't have to worry about

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:53.630
hosting and all of that.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.320
ANDREW STILLMAN: Exactly.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.900
Right, so this is an
underlying piece of

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.890
infrastructure for that.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:04.400
So in this system here, pushData
is syncing the master

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.560
student list and the master
teacher list with these two

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.070
other spreadsheets, one of which
is the back end to the

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:17.000
actual form, and then the other
which is an attendance

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.990
tracker, which basically is in
this case allowing the school

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.460
to easily see on a one-to-one
basis whether a phone call

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.950
home was made by the advisers
for any given the absence.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.540
So it lets you really maintain
a lot of transparency around

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.770
what kind of outreach is
happening around attendance.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.260
So anyway, really,
what is that?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.600
Three scripts that
do all this.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.530
JAN KLEINERT: That's
fantastic.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.400
So do you find that there have
been any particular challenges

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.490
in getting teachers or
schools to adopt

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.590
these types of workflows?

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.840
Or do you find that once they
see one working, they kind of

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.820
get the value right away?

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.600
What are some of the challenges,
I guess?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.250
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yeah, some of
the challenges have been--

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.700
I mean, initially when we were
using these scripts--

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.320
make a copy of a Google
spreadsheet that

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.950
has a script in it.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:14.960
And the script comes with it.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.090
And that's great.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.110
But these scripts are
all dependent on

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.765
ScriptProperties being set.

00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:21.180
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.250
ANDREW STILLMAN: And the
configuration of these scripts

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.250
is not obvious to--

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.020
I mean, even though it's run
through a UI, you have to

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.530
figure out what it's
even asking you.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.840
Like what is a field mapping?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.355
Your average school employee,
there's a learning curve.

00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:39.590
JAN KLEINERT: Sure.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.030
ANDREW STILLMAN: One of the
things we had to overcome was

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.420
the fact that ScriptProperties
don't copy with scripts.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.420
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:51.630
ANDREW STILLMAN: And so, I
developed a way to get the

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:57.680
ScriptProperties to output as
a code string, essentially,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.020
that could then be pasted back
into a function that would run

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.670
on install.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.020
JAN KLEINERT: Oh, interesting.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.340
OK.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.550
ANDREW STILLMAN: These are
self-configuring scripts.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.170
So once someone takes the three
or four hours to build

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.650
one of these systems, it can
then be packaged in such a way

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.600
that the next person who comes
along and has to set up that

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.110
system has a copy doesn't have
to do any of the configuration

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.250
steps in the scripts.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.260
The scripts are preconfigured.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.050
So that was a really important
implementation shift that we

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.650
had to make.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.690
The other has been in preserving
relationships

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:36.540
between spreadsheets.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.800
Like many of these systems
require multiple spreadsheets.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.320
So you've got to have pushData
sending things across

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.910
spreadsheets.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:50.450
And any dependency on
document ID was

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.280
creating a huge problem.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.270
Because you could go to set up
the new system, and everything

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.630
would be pointing to
the old system.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.880
JAN KLEINERT: Right, I see
what you're saying.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.670
ANDREW STILLMAN: In creating
pushData, what I did was I

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.790
made it refresh all of
the document IDs on

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.850
install using file name.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.530
So I was referencing the root
folder that it was sitting in,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.260
quickly going through all the
files and pulling in their

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.930
document IDs so that every
single mapping that exists in

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.380
pushData is valid
in the new copy.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.490
Those kinds of things ended
up being really important.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.790
And then lastly, just making
the distribution of these

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.920
things really super easy.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.340
Like if you ask someone to
download six different

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.620
spreadsheets and put them
in a folder, you've

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.060
already lost them.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.625
So we built, recently something
called the Cloud

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:48.870
Labs Systems Replicator.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.480
It's kind of an intimidating
name.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.360
JAN KLEINERT: I like it.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.050
ANDREW STILLMAN: I should
probably change it.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:58.980
But essentially, this is a
private login-only web app,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.450
which I recently learned
how to make.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.070
And it's essentially accessing
a subset of

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.780
folders in my Docs list.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.550
And these are folders that each
contain a fully packaged

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.240
system, including
documentation.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.950
So I can go, for example, into
After School Credit Recovery

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.470
and Attendance System, which
is the system we were just

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.120
looking at.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.360
Oh, no, this was a
different system.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.290
And you can see underneath the
documentation is previewed, so

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.120
you can make a decision
about whether this

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.550
system is for you.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.670
We try to include systems
diagrams, because we find

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.020
these are really helpful for
less technical users to

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:42.040
understand, and installation
instructions, so making all

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.340
this stuff abundantly clear.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.040
And then the other thing we
did is this is a single

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.140
function that copies
an entire folder's

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.630
contents to your drive.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.930
So there's no folder
copy native to

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.750
Docs, as far as I know.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:02.360
So when I click this,
it literally will

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.680
generate the folder.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.750
And you can see--

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:12.130
I'll blow this up for the
sake of our users.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.340
You'll see the system being
replicated right into the

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.015
person's drive.

00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:18.550
JAN KLEINERT: Oh nice, OK.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.370
ANDREW STILLMAN: So this is
another way that we have kind

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.380
of lowered the barrier for
adoption for schools.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.540
JAN KLEINERT: Reducing the
chances of user error,

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.470
forgetting to copy one of the
important pieces of the

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.860
puzzle, and things like that.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.710
ANDREW STILLMAN: It also means
that any school is now

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.425
potentially a publisher
of a system.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.580
It completely shifts
the innovation.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.070
We'll call it an ecosystem.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.810
You no longer are dependent,
necessarily, on a software

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:50.090
developer to do the systems
thinking side of it.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:55.680
You have LEGO building blocks,
and then you have people on

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.970
the ground working with the
kids who understand the

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.090
problems deeply and who can then
design the system the way

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.740
it needs to be.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.510
JAN KLEINERT: And
then share it.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.760
ANDREW STILLMAN: Right.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.620
And there's no delay.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.820
There's no six months of waiting
for the issue queue to

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:14.140
be updated or for the big
student information company to

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.890
decide that this
is a priority.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.330
The school has it tomorrow.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.135
JAN KLEINERT: That's exciting.

00:24:19.135 --> 00:24:21.150
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yeah,
it's a lot of fun.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.070
JAN KLEINERT: Awesome.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.980
So we have a few minutes left,
and I have one more

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.330
question for you.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.480
But first I just want to see
if there's anything on our

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.660
Moderator page.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.140
Let's see.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.220
This morning, we didn't have
anything specifically about

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.020
this session.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.130
It looks like we still don't.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.200
There is a support-related
question there that we'll

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.880
answer separately.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.530
So my last question for you was
what would you like to see

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.880
from Apps Script
in the future?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.910
What are some things-- oh, I
see your eyes twinkling--

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.500
that would make your life easier
in developing these

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.460
types of solutions?

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.900
And specifically since you
specifically seem to work

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.050
mostly with educators, what in
that area would make your

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.300
development life easier?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.630
ANDREW STILLMAN: Honestly, at
this point, there is much more

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.962
for me still to learn about
Apps Script than

00:25:14.962 --> 00:25:17.740
I've had time to learn.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.860
I mean, I'm not just
a developer.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.800
So I spent a lot of my
time in schools, and

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.300
I still want to learn scriptDb
inside and out.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.170
I've had the pleasure of working
with some Google

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.990
Summer of Code interns
this summer.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.270
My understanding is that there's
still some reliability

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:40.250
issues with scriptDb, not major,
but in particular, when

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.235
dealing with large
batches of data.

00:25:43.235 --> 00:25:45.400
And I think there's already an
issue in the tracker on this,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.810
but it sort of severely hampers
the way it works when

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:52.150
you can't write large
numbers of rows.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.000
A lot of what I want to be able
to do is allow the user

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.210
to maintain their data set in
a spreadsheet, but have a

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:04.970
secondary warehouse where that
data is stored for longevity.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:05.190
JAN KLEINERT: Interesting.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.120
OK.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.850
ANDREW STILLMAN: There are
limits to the number of rows

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.830
in a spreadsheet.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.060
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.410
ANDREW STILLMAN: In particular,
when you start

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.410
adding formulas, and the
performance of spreadsheets

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.300
degrades so that they become
almost unusable beyond like, I

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.990
don't know, 6,000 or 7,000 rows
if you have things like

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.690
VLOOKUP running.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:22.850
JAN KLEINERT: Very
complicated.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.130
ANDREW STILLMAN: It's just
impossible, yeah.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:29.690
So I would really like to make
sure that scriptDb can do

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.480
things like that.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.940
And I almost feel like there
needs to be a clearer library

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.080
where you can just literally
just send a spreadsheet range

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.010
into ScriptDb, and
pull it back--

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.248
JAN KLEINERT: I like
that idea.

00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:41.640
That's a nice one.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.770
ANDREW STILLMAN: --without
having to think too much.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.140
And I'm sure there's already a
library written to do that,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.980
and I just don't
know about it.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:54.040
But I guess the other thing I
would love to see is just a

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.360
ready-made HTML editor
UI element.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.050
Because a lot of what I'm having
folks do is develop

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.540
things like an email merge
template, or a document merge

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.250
template, or whatever.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.700
And particularly in the email
side of things, it would be

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.600
really cool if people
could author HTML.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.320
And I know this is now
possible through--

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.240
I think it's through
HTML service.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.930
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, it should
technically be possible, yes.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:21.260
ANDREW STILLMAN: Right.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.530
So I would love to see proof
of concept on that.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.460
JAN KLEINERT: So like a rich
text editor that you could--

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.240
ANDREW STILLMAN: Rich
text editor that--

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.550
JAN KLEINERT: Widget that you
could just stick in there.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.680
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yeah. because
right now, I have folks

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.870
editing email templates
in a spreadsheet cell.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.910
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.100
ANDREW STILLMAN: Which is really
tricky for folks who,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.830
even figuring out how to get a
hard return in a spreadsheet

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.460
cell is not self-evident.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.870
Because I want to allow HTML,
I'm having to have them create

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.550
break tags.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:53.460
And I don't want my end users
to have to code in HTML to

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.680
produce their templates.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.660
So that's a big one.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.670
And then I think lastly
we depend so

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.575
much on Google Forms.

00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:01.510
JAN KLEINERT: Yes.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.110
ANDREW STILLMAN: And often, the
response I get when I say

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.760
Google Forms needs to have
things like range-dependent

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.720
drop-downs.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:17.160
Like hugely important for us,
because we're dealing with

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.200
ever-changing student
registers.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.060
We want to be able to validate
form data when it comes in.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.770
And so we can't just have
open text fields.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:32.010
And to be able to preserve a
3,000-student list in such a

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.480
way that it's always exactly
a match with our student

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.770
register in a school requires
all kinds of ludicrous

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:40.400
workarounds.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.790
ANDREW STILLMAN: Right.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.930
I can imagine.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.950
So more powerful forms and
then better integration.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.430
ANDREW STILLMAN: Yeah, I think
the Forms product itself, but

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.070
then yeah, to be able to modify
Google Forms through an

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.820
API would be phenomenal.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.500
I mean, that and additional form
widgets, like date, be

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.160
able to validate something
like an email.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.080
So yeah, I mean, forms
are huge for us.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.220
JAN KLEINERT: Right.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.300
Every time I've talked to
somebody who's even remotely

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.970
in the education world, they
always mention Forms.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.810
And wishing Forms could
do x, y, or z.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.440
So we definitely hear the--

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.310
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, I mean, I
was showing someone a Google

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.000
Form the other day.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.150
And they were like,
oh, so this could

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.195
replace Microsoft Access?

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:27.410
And I was like, yes, it can.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:31.420
But there's a number of
workarounds you have to

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.780
develop still.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.590
And so getting rid of those
would be awesome.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.020
JAN KLEINERT: OK.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.470
Well, we'll definitely
pass that feedback

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.240
along to the team.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.040
Well, thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.010

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.310

Script community, and for all
these teachers out there.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.737
ANDREW STILLMAN: Thanks so much
for having me. it's been

00:29:48.737 --> 00:29:48.890
a pleasure.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.790
JAN KLEINERT: Thank you.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.390
All right.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.190
ANDREW STILLMAN: All right.
