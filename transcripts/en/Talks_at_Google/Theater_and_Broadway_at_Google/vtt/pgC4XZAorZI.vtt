00:09:15.697 --> 00:09:20.687
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:24.082 --> 00:09:25.540
CLIFF REDEKER:
Thank you very much.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.590
That was an amazing show.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.860
It's an honor to have
you back at Google.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.930
I'd like to introduce
our panel for today.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.105
So we have Heather Riley, the
company manager for "Luzia."

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:34.980
HEATHER RILEY: Hello.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.536
Thank you.

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:36.660
It's good to be here today.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.420
CLIFF REDEKER: And we
also have Laura Biondo,

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.170
the freestyle football artist.

00:09:41.202 --> 00:09:41.910
LAURA BIONDO: Hi.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.210
Thank you.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.380
CLIFF REDEKER: We have Rudy
Janecek, the amazing juggler

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.310
that you just saw.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.040
RUDY JANECEK: Hello, everybody.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.919
CLIFF REDEKER: And
we have Majo Cornejo.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.710
MAJO CORNEJO: Majo.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.180
CLIFF REDEKER: Majo.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.680
Almost.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.390
MAJO CORNEJO: Hi.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.980
CLIFF REDEKER: And then
finally, we have Abou Traore.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.976
ABOU TRAORE: Hi, everybody.

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:03.656
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:07.180
CLIFF REDEKER: So at Google,
we consider ourselves

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.140
a bit of a family.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.750
And I thought I'd start
by asking each of you

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.090
how you wound up running
away with the Cirque

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.340
and joining the Cirque family.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.548
HEATHER RILEY: Well, I've
been with the Cirque family

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:18.670
now about 15 years,
just over 15 years.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.240
And my original career, I was
an elementary school teacher.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.909
So not much of a difference
between classroom and working

00:10:24.909 --> 00:10:25.450
with artists.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.430
But-- no.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.510
With all due respect.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.170
No.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.586
It was actually a
company I worked

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:33.640
for before, a nonprofit company
called Up with People, which

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.520
was a different format,
but also in the performing

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.470
arts and leadership.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.845
And it was a
colleague from there

00:10:38.845 --> 00:10:41.064
who called me at the end
of 2001 and said, Heather,

00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:42.355
I think you should join Cirque.

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:43.901
And I've been here ever since.

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:45.400
I've been with five
different shows,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.150
and spent a few years
at our headquarters,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.692
and now working with "Luzia."

00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:49.650
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.015
Laura?

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:52.390
LAURA BIONDO:
Well, I started off

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.770
playing soccer here in the US.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.837
I used to live in Miami.

00:10:55.837 --> 00:10:57.920
Then I moved to Italy where
I played professional.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.390
And as I was there
recovering from an injury,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.130
my brother started to
get into freestyle.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.960
And I started to
see videos with him.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.300
And I would try to do
things like he would do,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.170
because I was really bad.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.070
But then I just kept going
out to a parking lot nearby,

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.900
kept training and training.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.700
I got into competitions, live
performances, TV hosting,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.390
TV shows.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.240
And then through a
competition, Cirque

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.040
approached me to be part
of this amazing show.

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:29.510
RUDY JANECEK: Hello.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.400
I come from Czech Republic.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.440
I work for "Luzia" show.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.620
And I since six
generation circus.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.000
And I do all life my circus.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.652
And now I perform
in Cirque du Soleil.

00:11:40.652 --> 00:11:41.960
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.590
True family.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.930
MAJO CORNEJO: Hi.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.620
I'm Majo Cornejo.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.460
I'm the singer.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.930
I'm from Mexico.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.430
And I'm so proud
to work in "Luzia."

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.590
It's a show of my country.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.310
And I'm so happy to be
here with all of us--

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.310
all of you.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.679
CLIFF REDEKER: Abou.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:02.470
ABOU TRAORE: Hello.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.900
I'm from Guinea.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.680
And I play the football
when I was young.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.720
Now it is like 20 years I
playing football soccer.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.770
And in my family we
love the football.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.910
My mother, she's the first.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.620
She's my first fan.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.250
And that's true.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.940
And my brother taught
me the football.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.550
That's why I start the
football freestyle now.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.850
And I love to play football.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.800
And now I'm in Cirque du Soleil.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.339
And I'm so happy.

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:41.011
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.510
CLIFF REDEKER: And this is, in
fact, Cirque's newest touring

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.030
production.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.040
So I was wondering
if you could walk me

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.150
through some of the stats.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.305
We have some Guinness record
holders, even on this stage.

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:51.430
HEATHER RILEY: We have two
Guinness record holders,

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.590
actually, right beside me.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.207
Laura set a record
not so long ago.

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.790
You're going to have
to describe that.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.206
And Rudy, when we
were in Toronto.

00:12:58.206 --> 00:12:59.680
So what was your--

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.207
LAURA BIONDO: Well, I
just did in San Francisco.

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.790
It was my fifth
Guinness World Record.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.130
And it was the most amount
of clippers in one minute.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.900
So all of the records
that I hold all

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.930
are one trick, the most
amount of that trick performed

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.660
in one minute.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.210
HEATHER RILEY: And Rudy,
when we were in Toronto.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.770
Rudy was speed juggling.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.520
RUDY JANECEK: Yes.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.380
I make a record in Toronto.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.880
I juggling five clubs,
three turn, for 30 seconds,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.840
428 turns.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.170
HEATHER RILEY: And it took--

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.050
I felt very sorry for the judge
for Rudy's, because it took him

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.910
45 minutes in slow motion video
to count all the rotations.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.920
We were on pins and-- he
went across the street

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.960
to the hotel to count
and count and count

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.139
and validate and such.

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:43.930
But yeah, Rudy smashed
the previous record.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.220
So it was a lot of fun.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.840
We opened last April.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.220
We're just about a year old.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.800
This show has done
about 360 performances.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.520
We started in Montreal, Toronto,
San Francisco, and then here.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.650
And this is the
beginning of a 10

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.210
to 12-year journey for "Luzia."

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.024
So we have a long,
long way to go still.

00:14:00.024 --> 00:14:01.190
CLIFF REDEKER: Great, great.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.760
And also, Abou, as well,
you and your brother

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.720
are stars on YouTube.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.492
So thanks for
using our platform.

00:14:07.492 --> 00:14:10.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.950
So as we saw during the trailer
before everyone got on stage,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.960
"Luzia" is really a triumph
of technology, as well.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.140
There's this massive
conveyor belt.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.540
There's this 3-D
printer for water almost

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.520
that comes down from the stage.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.900
How do you source that stuff?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.820
Is there a procurement office?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.840
HEATHER RILEY: We
couldn't bring the water

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.460
as one of our main
features in this show.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.251
Obviously, we couldn't
bring it here today.

00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:34.730
But we do have the--

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.090
the technology is
actually off-the-shelf.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.570
For the rain curtain, there are
spigots that open and close.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.240
And as they open and close
and just gravity takes effect,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.448
that's what makes the
different patterns in the water

00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:46.210
that you see.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.043
It's used several times
throughout the show.

00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:49.810
And then we also have
a pool in our stage

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.770
that's about 8 feet wide and 18
inches deep that we also use.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.610
So 2,000 gallons of water.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.900
First time we've traveled
with water in a show.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.806
So it is an
off-the-shelf product,

00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:01.180
but we use it in
a different way.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.459
The conveyor belts that you
see in the opening scene

00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:07.000
and then the opening number are
actually from the coal mining

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.580
industry in the UK.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.890
Their original purpose is to
take coal out of the mines

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.230
and into their crushing
factories and such.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.660
So yeah, we've repurposed
them and turned them into--

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.464
they've branded them
as tumble-ators.

00:15:18.464 --> 00:15:19.630
CLIFF REDEKER: Tumble-ators.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.129
All right.

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:22.300
Well, we'll have to
do a market analysis

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.646
and see how many we
can bring to market.

00:15:24.646 --> 00:15:26.020
And it's really
interesting, too,

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.890
with just how these are found.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.640
I mean, there's obviously
Cirque du Soleil

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.410
infiltrating the coal
industry, or something,

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.370
to come up with that.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.661
HEATHER RILEY: I'm not quite
sure where the coal mining

00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.630
link came from.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.730
It takes about two years
to create a new show.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.120
So when the concepts are
first developed and are first

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.740
put out on the
storyboards, from there

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.680
it's how do we find what
it is to make that real

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.205
and bring those
dreams to reality.

00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:50.830
CLIFF REDEKER: And
how do you vacuum up

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.337
all the water between acts?

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:54.670
HEATHER RILEY: It's actually--
there's a little machine.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.580
There's two ways.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.204
One, there's a giant
funnel underneath.

00:15:57.204 --> 00:15:59.170
There's 100,000
holes in the stage.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.240
So the water first of all
goes through the stage

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.240
into a giant pan funnel
and then back out

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.740
to our filtration
system in a truck.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.570
But we also have these little--

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.280
they look like giant
lawnmowers that

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.892
are rolled around on the stage.

00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:12.850
It was the invention of
one of our technicians.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:13.790
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, cool.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.680
HEATHER RILEY: The
first version looked

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.055
like it was from
the Flintstones,

00:16:16.055 --> 00:16:17.250
quite made of wood.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.930
But there's a squeegee on the
front that pushes water in,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.324
and then there's super
absorbent fabric in the middle,

00:16:22.324 --> 00:16:23.740
and then there's
fans on the back.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.480
So these get rolled
around on the stage.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.438
Sometimes you see them.

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.370
Sometimes you don't.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.840
But that's our last ditch.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.420
And then we also have towels
that the artists bring out

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.810
and wipe down the last spots.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.030
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.190
Does technology
inspire the acts?

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.096
Or are the acts inspired by the
technology catalog available?

00:16:40.096 --> 00:16:41.970
HEATHER RILEY: I think
it's a little of both,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.095
because some of our acts,
our most beautiful things

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:46.260
here take no technology at all.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.240
And others are sort
of tied to that.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.940
So I think it's a
little bit of both.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.730
CLIFF REDEKER: And there's
also an historic pattern, too.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.760
This isn't the first Cirque
show to use Russian swings

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.130
or aerial acts or silks.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.276
How do you decide which ones
to go to, how to keep it fresh,

00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:03.900
and how to make it
work with the story?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.319
HEATHER RILEY: That's one
of the biggest challenges

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.740
is taking acts that
are traditional circus

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.319
or traditionally Cirque
and modifying them.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.040
We changed them.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.525
Our Russian swings are
bigger, higher, heavier

00:17:13.525 --> 00:17:14.400
than the other shows.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.700
So we can do different
types of tricks.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.780
And that that's really
the evolution of circus

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.260
as it continues to grow
and be modified from there.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.859
And it really is a combination
of the vision of the creators

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.510
and what's going to
be the best means

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.750
to make that result happen.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.874
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, awesome.

00:17:29.874 --> 00:17:32.370
And there's eight shows a
week, which is a pretty--

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.245
HEATHER RILEY: Or 10.

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:34.119
CLIFF REDEKER: Or 10.

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:34.800
Or sometimes 10.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.950
Or even a show at Google,
to make it up to 11.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.880
As company manager, how do
you keep track of things?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.570
What are you really looking
for when the show is live?

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.166
HEATHER RILEY: Well, my role
is very much behind the scenes.

00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:50.040
I have an artistic
director and artistic team

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.209
that are much more
responsible for the quality.

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:54.750
But it's really about balancing
the schedule for the artists,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.210
making sure that they have
the time to train and warm up,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.250
and making sure
they're taken care of.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.230
We have an artistic
team that consists also

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.060
with PMeD therapists,
or sports therapists,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.490
that work daily with them,
and coaches for training.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.840
So its about creating
that balance.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.730
We have Mondays off.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.260
That's our one day off a week.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.130
And it depends if it was a
rainy day like last week,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.600
I bet everybody stayed
home and in bed last week

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.789
and enjoyed a rainy day.

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:19.080
Otherwise, we're out exploring,
seeing what's going on.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.371
CLIFF REDEKER: And I guess
really for the artists, too,

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:22.830
feel free to jump in.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.990
What are you looking
to achieve every night?

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.420
The routine is
always very similar.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.820
When you go onstage,
is there a checklist

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.440
in your mind of things to do?

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.850
Or is there like an end goal?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.360
Or how do you approach
every night and every show?

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.330
LAURA BIONDO: Well,
every show is unique.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.250
So every show is like
the first show you do.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.880
So every time-- even though you
have your same routine to warm

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.890
up and get prepared
for your show--

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.670
the main goal as a
human being on a stage--

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.520
on a Cirque Du Soleil
stage-- is to share something

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.620
with the audience and
transmit something,

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.100
if there is happiness, or
passion, or excitement,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.900
whatever it is.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.184
So every time you just try
to give your best on stage

00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:05.850
and make it unique
for those people that

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.280
are watching the show, which
might be the first time they

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.860
see something like what we do.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.650
So that's mainly I think
what all of the artists

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.990
like to portray onstage.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.630
CLIFF REDEKER: And there's even
improvisation on the music side

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.420
as well, because I think
the total length of the show

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.290
varies by five minutes or more.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.484
So what are you paying attention
to when you do your singing?

00:19:29.484 --> 00:19:31.770
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.280
HEATHER RILEY: It's very handy
to have a multilingual cast.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.296
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.940
MAJO CORNEJO: Yes.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.590
All the musicians,
always we use in ears.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.970
And the bandleader, if something
changed during the show,

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.790
he is like, super-focused.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.540
And he always tell
us like, hey, guys.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.995
We will change this
part, or vamos to A to B.

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:10.230
And it's like, OK.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.590
And we have televisions.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.690
And it's super--

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.690
HEATHER RILEY: If something
happens in the show,

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.100
sometimes we repeat
something, sometimes we don't.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.630
It depends on where it is
in an act or something.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.960
The show can also vary just
on the nature of some things

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.460
get more quick or not.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.049
But it's pretty
well choreographed.

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.340
There's not too much variation.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.540
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, cool.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.410
Awesome.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.580
And how do you deal with fatigue
and exercise and warm-ups?

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.607
Like, is the time onstage
the exercise and warm-up?

00:20:38.607 --> 00:20:39.940
Or is there time during the day?

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.530
HEATHER RILEY: I
think for some people

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.770
the amount of time-- when
we have 10 shows a week,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.855
there's not as much
training as there is when

00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:46.980
there's eight shows a week.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.855
So that's part of it.

00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:50.040
We make sure that we
balance that schedule.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.720
But then everybody
has their own routine

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.300
of what to do on a day
off, or how to relax.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.700
Abou spends a lot of time
behind a video camera.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.720
And Rudy out exploring.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.470
So there's different
things for everybody.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.970
But that's really our
coaching staff also

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.805
that works with that.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:04.805
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, cool.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:05.670
Awesome.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.290
And so I should also say we
have a Google Moderator set up

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.790
as well.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.050
So there's go/ask-luzia if
you want to ask a question.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.282
We'll have time for audience
Q&amp;A towards the end, as well.

00:21:17.282 --> 00:21:18.990
I wanted you to tell
me a little bit more

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.690
about the Cirque hiring process.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.470
Hiring is one of the
most important things

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.160
we do at Google.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.130
And I'm sure the same
is true for Cirque.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.470
So how does one get started?

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.020
How does the audition
process work?

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.561
HEATHER RILEY: I
think it is a little

00:21:30.561 --> 00:21:33.810
different from my experience
to an artist's experience.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.750
For me, it's apply for
a job, and away we go.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.465
But for the artists, it's
really a casting process.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:41.990
And it's different
also for every act.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.610
Some people are
found on YouTube.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.650
Some people are found
through talent searches.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.870
Some people send in
their videos to us.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.740
We could create our own reality
show of Cirque's Got Talent

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.184
kind of idea.

00:21:53.184 --> 00:21:54.850
Some people think
they're very talented.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.683
Some people, we think
they're very talented.

00:21:56.683 --> 00:21:58.130
So it really varies.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.170
We also have scouts
that go to the Olympics

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.000
and go to national
championships and such.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.010
We partner with circus schools.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.280
We have across the street very
conveniently from the Cirque

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.830
headquarters is the Canadian
National Circus school.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.980
So they can just come right
across and join us from there.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.480
And this show
actually has a number

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.940
of artists who have
come from the circuses.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.210
Others, like Rudy, have come
from traditional circus.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.200
So there's a number of
pipelines to get in.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.015
Our goal is to find the best of
the best, or the most unique,

00:22:24.015 --> 00:22:26.390
or the most different, based
on what it is we need to do.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.306
CLIFF REDEKER: And there's
18 shows right now.

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:29.870
There's two on the horizon.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.627
So is it increasingly hard
to find artists as the--

00:22:32.627 --> 00:22:33.710
HEATHER RILEY: Absolutely.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.251
It's changed.

00:22:34.251 --> 00:22:36.830
We've become a bit of our
own competitor in that sense,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.800
because we're all searching
for certain things.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.490
That said, the circus
arts are also growing.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.630
It's a lot more common now.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.930
When Cirque started in
1984, you would never

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.930
see circus arts at a concert
or in a performance like that.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.670
Whereas now some things have
become quite mainstream.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.410
So that's both good and
bad for us in that sense.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.820
I think one of
the amazing things

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.501
too is artists are now taking
the traditional things that we

00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:03.500
use, and they're taking
them to that next level,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.250
like I mentioned before.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.069
So that's also helping
us in that sense.

00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:09.110
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, even
like freestyle football

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.690
is an up and coming discipline.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.160
There's a federation.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.660
HEATHER RILEY: Never
knew it existed

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.330
before I met these guys.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.950
So, yeah.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:15.740
Absolutely.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.820
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.640
And I also understand that
folks that apply to Cirque,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.910
they apply with a specific
act that's their specialty.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.080
So how specific does that go?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.570
You know, is it better
to be a generalist that's

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.474
able to do all manner of--

00:23:31.474 --> 00:23:33.140
HEATHER RILEY: I
really think it varies.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.348
And again, depending on who
the artists that come in.

00:23:35.348 --> 00:23:37.707
For us, we have some very
specific disciplines.

00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:40.040
There's only one show at
Cirque that has football dance,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.706
and that's here.

00:23:40.706 --> 00:23:42.650
So these guys, they
want to stay at Cirque.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.150
This is where they're
going to stay.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.610
Singing is something that's
much more multi-disciplinary.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.200
So there's a little more
options for a singer.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.408
And we have a lot of juggling
in our different shows.

00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:53.420
So it really depends a
lot on what people do.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.817
And we can-- artists
can transfer from show

00:23:55.817 --> 00:23:57.650
to show based on their
different disciplines

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.900
if that exists somewhere else.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.570
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, cool.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.840
And also, there's cross-training
once you're a part of the show,

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.340
as well.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.190
So you have-- well, in
"Corteo," for example,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.870
you have artists
becoming singers,

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.640
singers becoming artists.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.590
How do you manage that
training and bring people?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.100
HEATHER RILEY: We always start
with the core of the show.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.050
So for instance,
right now in "Luzia,"

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.510
we have our framework
that's set for the show.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.444
And as the artists--

00:24:22.444 --> 00:24:24.110
now they've done--
it sounds like a lot.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.670
300 performances
sounds like a lot.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.539
It's not in the grand
scheme of things.

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:29.330
But there is a routine
that gets developed.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.010
And it gives them
the opportunity

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.480
to try other things backstage.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.462
So whether it's during
the day in trainings

00:24:34.462 --> 00:24:36.170
or in the evenings,
people are encouraged

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.470
to learn different disciplines.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.219
And if we can incorporate
that in the show

00:24:39.219 --> 00:24:41.750
or create a rotation,
then that's good for us.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.460
We do have some acts
where we already

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.960
have that rotation built in.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.180
For instance, the second
number of our show

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.550
is an adagio number.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.890
There's three men and one woman
doing this very acrobatic style

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.180
of dance.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.330
The woman is literally tossed
between these gentlemen.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.049
And we already built
into the plan--

00:24:58.049 --> 00:24:59.340
we have two women that do that.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.150
So they rotate
all the time, just

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.070
for their own sakes and such.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.160
But others, you may see an
act that has seven people.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.610
We can do it with
as few as five.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.180
Or we can modify acts and
things along those lines,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.020
too, to build in a little bit
of that security if we need to.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.853
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:25:14.853 --> 00:25:17.100
And it's also a lifetime
career, as well.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.970
So as your artistic
endeavors continue and peak,

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.300
there is roles behind the
stage that a lot of artists

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.840
will go to in Cirque.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.214
HEATHER RILEY: We've had
artists become coaches and stage

00:25:26.214 --> 00:25:28.980
managers and go into that
side of the management.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.860
A lot of people will
return afterwards

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.467
maybe back to their homes
and go into coaching.

00:25:33.467 --> 00:25:35.300
But we also have artists
who go on to school

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.800
and do completely
different careers.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.442
So really, the wide
scope of what's possible.

00:25:39.442 --> 00:25:40.275
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:41.340
Awesome.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.490
I'd like to also talk a
little bit about the show

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.210
specifically.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.130
It is a waking dream of Mexico.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.320
So I wanted to learn
a little bit more

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.180
about the origins
of that theme, how

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.574
you developed the story,
what emotions you're trying

00:25:53.574 --> 00:25:54.740
to convey through the piece.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.031
HEATHER RILEY: Well, the idea--

00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:58.130
Daniele Finzi Pasca is
the creator of the show.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.896
He also created
"Corteo" for us in 2005

00:26:00.896 --> 00:26:03.020
and has stayed in touch
with Cirque over the years.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.354
Daniele and his wife
had lived in Mexico.

00:26:05.354 --> 00:26:06.770
He's from Switzerland,
originally.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.540
She's Canadian.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.460
They lived in Mexico
for more than 10 years

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.079
and were really taken by
the culture and the people

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:14.120
in the different regions.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.860
And that's what we
do in this show.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.710
It's not a stereotypical
Mexican show.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.300
It's really-- and
I think Majo can

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.680
attest-- it's about the beauty.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.640
It's about the differences.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.181
It's about the things
you don't think

00:26:24.181 --> 00:26:26.470
you're going to see,
especially at a Cirque show.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.260
It's the first time we've
gone so thematic in something.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.960
People often wonder, well,
it's all sung in Spanish.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.670
And will I understand?

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.310
Well, for years Cirque was
in gobbledygook and everybody

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.660
understood.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.800
I think you got the
passion from Majo when she

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.060
was singing for you earlier.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.270
There was no question whether
or not you understood any of it.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.560
The emotions come through.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.300
And that's the same with this.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.640
We take people on
a journey that's--

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.610
every act is a different
setting or a different part

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.480
of the country.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.180
So whether you're
in a field of 5,000

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.790
flowers with hummingbirds, or
whether you're in a cantina,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.890
or whether you're in
the desert, or a cenote,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.029
every scene changes.

00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:05.820
And with it that image
changes of the show.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.477
So that's really the dream
idea of taking us through.

00:27:08.477 --> 00:27:10.560
CLIFF REDEKER: And there's
even an airplane flying

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.430
metaphor at the very beginning.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.470
HEATHER RILEY: And there's an
airplane and a parachute that

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.011
goes horribly wrong
at the beginning,

00:27:15.011 --> 00:27:16.050
but it all ends up OK.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.200
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.210
It all works out.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.680
The umbrellas are the way to go.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680
HEATHER RILEY: Umbrella.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.388
Take an umbrella.

00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:23.102
If you're ever going to jump
out of a plane, it's very handy.

00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:24.810
CLIFF REDEKER: And
then the scuba diving.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.620
It just all comes together.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.380
So as the tour evolves, is
Latin America on the horizon

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.627
for "Luzia" and--

00:27:32.627 --> 00:27:34.710
HEATHER RILEY: Plug your
ears, because they're not

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.880
supposed to-- no.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.620
Yes.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.330
The idea, again, I said the
show will travel 10 to 12 years.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.670
So we have the entire
world ahead of us.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.604
We'll start in the States now
through mid-2018 is confirmed.

00:27:45.604 --> 00:27:48.020
And then after that, we're
still working on the tour plan.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.489
So we'll go from there.

00:27:49.489 --> 00:27:51.030
But yeah, certainly
down into Mexico,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.660
Latin America, South America,
Europe, Australia, Asia.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.520
We have a long, long,
long road ahead of us.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.353
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:27:57.353 --> 00:28:00.450
And of course, it encourages
people to make the trip down.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.880
HEATHER RILEY: Not in that
order, just so you know.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.590
Everybody-- Heather,
where are we going?

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.280
Where are we going?

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.030
They would ask me.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.250
Are we going--
not in that order.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.630
Lots of places to go, though.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.410
CLIFF REDEKER: The passports
for Cirque artists are huge.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.760
And the show evolves
as time goes by.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.300
So some of the existing
shows have found their way

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.070
into an arena format.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.994
Acts come and go.

00:28:20.994 --> 00:28:22.660
How do you approach
that with the story?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.460
HEATHER RILEY: The
show will evolve.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.040
Certainly, the core of the
show will stay the same.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.790
That won't change.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.172
"Luzia" will always be "Luzia."

00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:30.630
But as artists come and go,
they bring in their own flavor.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.929
They bring in their own
different tricks and ideas

00:28:32.929 --> 00:28:33.720
to things, as well.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.900
So that can modify over time.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.680
And then the lifespan
of a big top show--

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.520
we started in 2006 with
the show "Saltimbanco."

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.500
It had traveled all over.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.122
And it was going to be retired.

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:50.580
It was going to be put away
and literally put on the shelf.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.160
And our executives were
like, it's too good to stop.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.380
So we stripped away
all the infrastructure.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.150
And we just toured
with the show.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.710
So that launched a
whole new division

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.300
for us-- our arenas division.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.240
And now that's become
the natural transition

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.390
to go from a big top
version to an arena version.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.550
And that opens another
three four or five years

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.080
of touring to a lot of places.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.720
We're too big.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.930
We're a show that
takes 65 trucks

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.610
to move from city to city.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.810
And so we're one and a
half 747s when we travel.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.530
So we can't go to a
lot of smaller places.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.230
And the arena version now
goes into smaller performance

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.780
venues-- sporting venues,
hockey rinks, that kind of idea.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.279
So it's opened a
lot of opportunity.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:32.200
CLIFF REDEKER: And you see
Cirque storytelling tradition

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.340
inside, also on cruise
ships, and even on TV.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.545
HEATHER RILEY: And there's
a lot of new projects

00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:40.670
that are coming our way,
and a lot of growth that's

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.370
happening in our company.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.930
It's a pretty
exciting time for us.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.310
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, cool.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.226
So if you have any questions as
part of the Googler audience,

00:29:47.226 --> 00:29:48.600
please go ahead
and take the mic.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.730
We'll go to those as well.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.780
There's a few more that I
wanted to cover on my side.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.840
This has been a pressing
question of mine.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.565
It's been on my mind for
years of watching Cirque.

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.250
HEATHER RILEY: I'm ready.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.300
CLIFF REDEKER: What is
it with the Quebecois?

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.410
It seems like the entire
circus culture of the world

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.177
is based out of the sort
of genius in Montreal.

00:30:10.177 --> 00:30:11.010
Like, how did that--

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.950
HEATHER RILEY: Only for
the last 35, 40-plus years.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.450
No.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.680
In fact, yes, it
started in Quebec.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.530
And yes, there's a very strong
circus culture in Montreal

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.120
and in Quebec as a whole.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.524
But really the roots
aren't in Canada

00:30:23.524 --> 00:30:24.940
by any stretch of
the imagination.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.080
The traditional circus
has been centuries old.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.230
You know, the Chinese have been
doing it long before any of us.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.540
But I think what's happened
is that incubator started.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.550
And when you get
that little core,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.290
then it grows and
grows and grows.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.629
I've worked with artists
who are coincidentally

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:41.670
Quebecois who've left
Cirque and gone and started

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.840
their own small companies.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.150
So that just sort of
feeds upon itself.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.542
Success feeds on success.

00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:48.000
There's now a
festival that happens

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.350
in the city in the summer.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.420
And it is the
English translation

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.620
is completely Cirque.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.519
And everywhere, every street
corner, every little park

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:57.310
has some sort of stage
and people juggling.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.650
And we were lucky
enough, we were

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.566
in Montreal last year
when that was happening,

00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:02.820
and to be at the sort
of big headliner of it.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.834
But it's fun.

00:31:03.834 --> 00:31:04.500
It's really fun.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:04.885
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome.

00:31:04.885 --> 00:31:06.580
I think we have a question here.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.050
HEATHER RILEY: Yes, sir.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.730
AUDIENCE: First of all,
congratulations and thank you

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.870
for coming to Google.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.810
Now, what I want to know is
what's the origin of the name?

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.570
Because I'm from Mexico.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.822
Lucia is actually
with C, not with Z.

00:31:16.822 --> 00:31:18.780
HEATHER RILEY: Do you
want to explain the name?

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.070
MAJO CORNEJO: En espanol?

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.990
AUDIENCE: Si, en espanol.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:29.444
MAJO CORNEJO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:31:29.444 --> 00:31:31.110
AUDIENCE: So it's not
based on the name,

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.889
because there is a name Lucia.

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:35.430
HEATHER RILEY: It
is a person's name.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.980
So in English form,
it's the combination

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.940
of the word for light
and the combination

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.260
of the word for rain.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.210
And we mash them
together to give that.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.050
It is also a person's name.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.470
But our show is thematic--

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.540
the light and the rain
play off of each other

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.700
throughout the entire show.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.020
CLIFF REDEKER: OK, cool.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.870
And as you mentioned before,
a very international cast.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.534
Is French and English
sort of the lingua Franca?

00:31:59.534 --> 00:32:00.950
HEATHER RILEY: Our
main language--

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.010
our first language
is all English.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.440
And as people come in,
we have everything.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.300
We have 24 different
nationalities.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.376
But of course, that's broad
cultures that come with that.

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:12.250
So English is our daily
operational language.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.730
But on our site, you'll hear
all sorts of things on the go.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.950
A lot of Spanish,
a lot of French.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.100
Nobody for Rudy.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.480
Rudy's got English now.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.780
But their English has
improved so dramatically, too.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.810
Because Rudy was
actually the first artist

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.110
I met when I arrived in Montreal
to start the project last year.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.940
And English has come a long way.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.230
Same with Abou-- from French
to very, very little to now

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.310
very, very good in that.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.120
So day to day.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:37.750
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.880
We have some
questions over here.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.900
HEATHER RILEY: Yes, sir.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.525
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:43.120
So first I just want to say
that was an amazing performance.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.790
Thank you so much.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.730
I'm actually on the Android
Wear Smart Watch team

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:49.460
here at Google.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.610
So I'm wondering
how do wearables

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.560
come into your
performances if at all?

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.675
And are there any
plans for that?

00:32:55.675 --> 00:32:57.550
HEATHER RILEY: That's
a really good question.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.560
If you want to give us some
to try, I'd be happy-- no.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.770
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.900
Underneath your
seat as you exit.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.870
HEATHER RILEY: Where
do I find that?

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.550
Actually, we do have
different technology

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.560
that we've incorporated
in our show.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.330
And one of the most
amazing pieces of that

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.610
is a dress that Majo wears.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.910
Not this particular one, but
she has an electronic dress

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.450
that's covered in flowers.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.440
And when she comes out on
the stage, they're all--

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.980
red.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.480
Her other dress is white.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.820
And it's covered in
flowers that are closed.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.030
And they're all electronically
coordinated, much more

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.150
in your field than mine.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.230
But they're programmed to open.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.650
And as she goes through
the song, the dress blooms.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.990
And it's spectacular
how that happens.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.270
And the programming itself
has a certain pattern,

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.380
but that can be modified.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.060
We can have it go in lines or
straight or back and forth.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.090
So that's one of the
biggest uses of technology

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.950
that we have right
now in our show.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.330
And the first time in a big
top show, not the first time

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.160
in other shows.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.290
"Michael Jackson: The
Immortal World" tour

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.470
had electronics built into their
costumes, and a lot of LEDs

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.220
and such as well.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.220
The hardest part for us
is-- how do you wash it?

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.860
So if you can work on that,
and my head of wardrobe

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.460
is back here.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.440
She'll be happy to talk to you.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.564
How do you wash it?

00:34:12.564 --> 00:34:13.980
That's what I need
you to work on.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.940
CLIFF REDEKER: Well,
Google Daydream

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.199
uses performance fabric.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.804
It was a very important
search for us.

00:34:18.804 --> 00:34:19.929
HEATHER RILEY: We can chat.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:20.110
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.443
And I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:34:21.443 --> 00:34:25.330
I think the dress is really one
of the most beautiful, subtle

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.389
notes in the whole show.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:30.400
And there's aerial vehicles
in "Paramour," I think,

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.350
in New York.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.040
HEATHER RILEY: Any way we
can use that combination

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.060
of technology and arts.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.280
We do a lot more with
video than we ever used to.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.340
And again, for us on
tour, it's about being

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.650
able to transport it easily and
be able to clean it afterwards.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.750
Another question.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.170
What did you just do?

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.554
LAURA BIONDO: He just
changed the microphone.

00:34:50.554 --> 00:34:52.929
HEATHER RILEY: You just messed
up the people in the back.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:53.719
OK.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.581
Another question.

00:34:54.581 --> 00:34:56.330
AUDIENCE: Sort of as
an extension of that,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.350
one of the things that's always
impressed me about Cirque

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.340
is how every little
detail is explicitly

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.460
designed for maximum visual
impact, down to the belt

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.010
buckles, the makeup, color
coordinating the mics even,

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.550
just now.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.390
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.700
AUDIENCE: And I'm curious--

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.200
what is the design
process for that?

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.020
And also, how much of it is
done to the individual artist

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.030
to decide what they
want specific details

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.512
of their aesthetic to be?

00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:18.970
HEATHER RILEY: The
original concept

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.890
is all done as part of
the creation process.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.840
And we have an extensive
team that does that.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.180
Everything from the acrobatic
elements, costume, makeup.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.300
There's individuals who take
care of all of those things.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.910
When we are in the
creation phase,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.265
and everything is done
sort of at a mock-up level,

00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:35.140
that's when the artists
are trying things on.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.810
Does this work?

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.393
Does this not?

00:35:36.393 --> 00:35:37.450
Can I stretch in it?

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.140
Can I juggle?

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.460
Can I spin?

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.810
So all of those--

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.440
people had input on that.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.860
And Rudy's buckle, as much
as it looks metal, it's not.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.580
It's flexible.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.659
It's made of a rubbery
kind of material

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:52.450
so that the artists
aren't getting injured.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.460
So there's a lot of that sort
of research and development

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.570
that goes into it.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.420
And then the wear and tear, we
learn things as we go along.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.280
And maybe they need
to be modified or not.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.010
Or it's too long.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.760
Or it's too short.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.660
Or Majo's dress was too
heavy in the beginning.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.010
It weighs about 25 pounds.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.020
So that needed to be modified.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.750
It's literally lowered--
she stands underneath,

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.680
and it's lowered from
above with her arms

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.960
to get into that dress.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.420
So there's a lot of those
details, you're right,

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.585
are taken into effect.

00:36:17.585 --> 00:36:19.960
And also, what's it going to
look like from the audience?

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.340
You know, you're sitting
there in the dark.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.390
We've got to change
the lighting.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.473
How is that going to look?

00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:25.989
That all factors into
how we design something.

00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:28.030
CLIFF REDEKER: And it's
all very customized, too.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.010
I mean, these are like one-off--

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.275
HEATHER RILEY: Oh, they're
one-offs of everything.

00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:30.760
CLIFF REDEKER: --pieces.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.176
HEATHER RILEY: The artists,
we measure them literally head

00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:35.170
to toe, every dimension
you can imagine.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.750
They're custom done for
them, for the most part.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.434
The fabrics and stuff, even
the dyeing, the patina--

00:36:41.434 --> 00:36:42.850
this would have
all started white.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.730
And we do the painting in
Montreal at our headquarters

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.500
so that we can control
the quality of it.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.440
So everything is
pretty much in-house.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.720
Shoes-wise-- those
are off the shelf.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.891
Majo, what shoes do you have on?

00:36:54.891 --> 00:36:55.390
No.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.290
Majo's shoes are designed
by us, made by us.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.331
Rudy's are ours.

00:36:59.331 --> 00:36:59.830
So yeah.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.300
It depends that as well.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.797
Even from that level,
we do it ourselves.

00:37:03.797 --> 00:37:04.630
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.445
Question there.

00:37:05.445 --> 00:37:06.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.067
So I've been to a
bunch of Cirque shows.

00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:08.650
They're great.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.320
But I've noticed over the
years that every so often, I

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.530
guess, the performances
that you're trying

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.020
are so difficult that
every so often, you--

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.772
something-- you mess up.

00:37:18.772 --> 00:37:19.730
You do something wrong.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.271
And then you usually
sort of redo it.

00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:23.050
And I think even
a couple of things

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.580
when I saw "Luzia" this time.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.420
So are you always sort of
trying to push and do things

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.810
that you can just sort of
barely do most of the time?

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.450
How do you get that balance
between having something

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.647
that you can do repeatedly,
and having something

00:37:38.647 --> 00:37:40.480
that's challenging
enough that you're really

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.910
pushing the envelope?

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.884
CLIFF REDEKER: And
what's perfection?

00:37:43.884 --> 00:37:46.300
HEATHER RILEY: Well, I think
errors are part of perfection

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.050
in what we do.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.050
Because if it's too good and too
perfect, A-- it looks simple.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.640
And B-- it doesn't
look like it--

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.100
we must be fooling you somehow.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.590
So to drop something
or to miss something,

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.480
there's often a bigger
cheer after the fact

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.312
when we do it right
the next time.

00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:02.770
I'll let you in on a secret--
in some shows they're stunts.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.640
So we do it on purpose for you.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.180
But then you get the wow factor.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.950
It's like, oh, there
is a risk element.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.980
So it really is that
balance of things.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.520
To be perfect all the
time-- that's not our goal.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.200
To entertain, to give people
what they're looking for--

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.312
that's what's
important in the shows.

00:38:19.312 --> 00:38:20.770
CLIFF REDEKER: And
it's pretty easy

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.260
just to put an extra beat,
an extra stanza in the music

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.530
so that people can keep--

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.905
HEATHER RILEY:
Well, and that's--

00:38:25.905 --> 00:38:27.700
as Majo mentioned
before, our band

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.239
can go back and do
something again.

00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:30.530
Some tricks they will do again.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:31.660
Some things they won't.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.220
But we have that
flexibility as well

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.679
to be able to make
it happen again.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.720
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.630
I think we may have
also had some questions

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.280
on Google Moderator as well.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.010
I know one that I
read before the show--

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.110
Rudy, do you offer lessons?

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.570
I can barely do three balls.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.980
HEATHER RILEY: Can you
teach people how to juggle?

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.355
CLIFF REDEKER: An instructional
YouTube channel, perhaps.

00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:56.132
RUDY JANECEK: I can, little bit.

00:38:56.132 --> 00:38:57.090
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.430
We, in fact, have a very,
very gifted team of--

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.000
RUDY JANECEK: You want try?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.180
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, maybe.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.730
It's beyond my-- are there--

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.290
[AUDIENCE CHEERS] are there
jugglers in the house?

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.665
HEATHER RILEY:
Give me your iPad.

00:39:07.665 --> 00:39:09.130
There you go.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.400
It's always good to have a
volunteer or be volun--told.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.880
CLIFF REDEKER: So
these are weighted.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.400
RUDY JANECEK: OK.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.510
So when you try to juggling,
you need to hold it

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.750
in your hand at right angle.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.750
CLIFF REDEKER: OK.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.375
RUDY JANECEK: That
you can a good spin.

00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:24.951
When you put more higher, you
can try behind or in front.

00:39:24.951 --> 00:39:25.700
CLIFF REDEKER: OK.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.241
RUDY JANECEK: And
don't move so much.

00:39:27.241 --> 00:39:28.158
Only twist your wrist.

00:39:28.158 --> 00:39:29.032
CLIFF REDEKER: Twist.

00:39:29.032 --> 00:39:29.740
OK.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.630
All right.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.530
I'm gonna start with the one.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.390
This is on my demo reel
for Cirque du Soleil.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.920
They're still
getting back to me.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.960
But-- whoa.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.800
Almost.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.910
It's heavy.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.190
HEATHER RILEY: We've got more.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.460
CLIFF REDEKER: And
then you can do--

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.120
yeah.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.140
And then just bring
in some speed.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:47.960
RUDY JANECEK: Very good.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.220
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.030
Well, thank you.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.468
Thank you.

00:39:50.468 --> 00:39:52.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:52.114 --> 00:39:52.940
All right.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.967
And so--

00:39:53.967 --> 00:39:56.300
HEATHER RILEY: I'm responsible
for the artist contracts,

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.280
so we can talk later.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.321
CLIFF REDEKER: All right.

00:39:58.321 --> 00:40:01.124
Well, actually, my suit was
inspired by the musicians.

00:40:01.124 --> 00:40:02.290
HEATHER RILEY: There you go.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.581
We have to paint your collars
red, and make them look--

00:40:04.581 --> 00:40:06.129
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:40:06.129 --> 00:40:07.420
And actually, the snake, right?

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.910
You get to walk around with
a snake for half the time.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.200
It's pretty cool.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.242
All right.

00:40:13.242 --> 00:40:13.950
Another question.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.320
Go ahead.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.100
HEATHER RILEY: Go ahead.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.391
AUDIENCE: Can you walk us
through the creative process?

00:40:17.391 --> 00:40:18.380
How long does it take?

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.250
And do you typically start
with an idea or theme

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.960
and then find artists to fit in?

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.174
Or does it ever start with
you find a set of artists

00:40:25.174 --> 00:40:26.590
that you really
like and then find

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.090
a theme to fit around them?

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.430
HEATHER RILEY: The actual
creation of the show

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.130
starts with the ideas
from the creator.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.430
I mentioned Daniele before.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.670
And he knew that he
wanted to do this.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.340
He's very good at visualizing
what he wants, and truly

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.020
just draws out the
storyboard of where

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.060
he sees the creation happening.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.640
That's pretty normal for
most of our creative process.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.250
From there, it's how do we
make that act come true?

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:52.000
What's the best
representation of that image?

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.370
I'll use an example
from another show

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.260
that Daniele did was "Corteo."

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.152
And in there he had
visions of his childhood

00:41:00.152 --> 00:41:02.110
and two things that stood
out in his childhood.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.610
One was always
bouncing on a bed,

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.470
because kids always
bounce on a bed.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.950
And two was his grandmother
had a giant chandelier

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.206
over her dining room table.

00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:12.580
And he and his brother used
to always joke about swinging

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.500
on grandma's-- or
Nona, in that case--

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.430
chandelier.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.096
And in that show, we
built queen-sized beds

00:41:18.096 --> 00:41:19.720
with trampolines
instead of mattresses.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.160
And we had giant
chandeliers that

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.620
were used as spinning
apparatus for aerialists.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.080
So it's kind of a
combination of the two.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.070
When we're looking for the
artists, and they come in,

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.330
we work together with them.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.100
There's a process.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.720
About two years
before we open is

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.570
when all of this
visionary process happens.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.850
The research and
development technology

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:43.060
starts about a year before,
a year and a half before.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.120
So six, eight months
in that process.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.439
We bring the artists in
sort of the summer prior to.

00:41:49.439 --> 00:41:50.980
So there's about
six months that they

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.770
work on the acrobatic elements.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.630
And then the real
push comes starting

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.950
in January of the
opening year where

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.910
the choreography and
the scenic elements

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.530
are all brought together.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.330
And that process
is very intense.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:05.620
It was a lot of long hours.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.470
So that started for us the
beginning of January last year,

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.876
and very intense until April.

00:42:10.876 --> 00:42:13.000
So a lot of long hours, a
lot of hurry up and wait,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.810
a lot of try this, do this,
move that, so all of that works.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.090
Moving acts around, oh,
we like that better there.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.090
So that process is very
intense for those months.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.800
And even once we
open, we're still

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.390
making modifications to things.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.720
The show is much tighter
than it was a year ago.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.182
We've removed some elements.

00:42:30.182 --> 00:42:31.390
We've added some elements in.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.120
So that little bit is
ongoing until we really have,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.280
all right, this is what
we're going to stay with.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.520
So the whole process, a
little over two years from

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.110
thought to reality.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.330
CLIFF REDEKER: And are
the different shows

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:44.380
siloed from each other?

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.720
Like, if you're
designing "Luzia," is

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.270
part of the required reading
to go to Vegas to see

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:50.290
what's going on there?

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.970
Or is it kept
completely separate?

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:53.261
HEATHER RILEY: Not necessarily.

00:42:53.261 --> 00:42:54.820
It depends on who
the creator is.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.530
Some have done more than
one production for us

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.988
and have been
involved with Cirque.

00:42:57.988 --> 00:43:00.172
Other people, the show
that's being created now,

00:43:00.172 --> 00:43:01.630
which is called
"Volta" and opening

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.750
in April, that creation team
had never done anything before.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.850
So they did go around and
look at different shows

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.170
and different productions.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.780
Not so much from the
inspiration idea,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.550
but what are my limitations?

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.890
Some people who come
to us forget the fact

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.600
that we have to pack
this all in a truck.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.030
We have giant
props in this show.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.020
Those conveyor belts
and the Russian swings,

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.060
they're massive.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.790
And we have a horse that's
one and a half times

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:28.030
the size of a normal
horse that's a puppet.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.830
It takes up almost half a truck.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.470
So they forget those things.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.940
So that's what we need to sort
of remind the creators-- it

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.200
has to fit in a box.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.490
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, and
sometimes the technology

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.080
from one show makes
its way into others.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.829
You know, like the
fishbowl in "Zumanity."

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:42.640
You can take that on the
road, and the puppetry

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.450
you see in multiple
ones as well.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.100
Cool.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.391
There's a question here, ma'am.

00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:47.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.800
I want thank you very
much for coming here.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.030
Listening to particular to
you singing in my language

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.510
was very moving and touching.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:56.270
So thank you.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.186
MAJO CORNEJO: Gracias.

00:43:57.186 --> 00:43:59.220
AUDIENCE: And I--
gracias a usted.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.020
And I have two questions
for the artist.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.020
Number one, do you ever
think that you are not

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.100
going to make it?

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.980
And how do you
overcome that feeling?

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.680
And number two, what
keeps you motivated?

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.430
I have the feeling that
it's like, you're always

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.010
about to reach perfection.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:22.150
And at the same time,
in every show, you do.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.710
But still need to keep
getting better and better.

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.494
So how do you deal with
the motivation every day?

00:44:29.702 --> 00:44:31.410
HEATHER RILEY: Start
with the second one.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.493
How do you keep motivated?

00:44:32.493 --> 00:44:35.790
How do you keep going every
day, different shows, what's

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:36.660
your motivation?

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.310
MAJO CORNEJO: OK.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:46:04.767
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:06.350
LAURA BIONDO:
Basically, what she says

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:11.645
is that what motivates her
is the people, because--

00:46:11.645 --> 00:46:14.829
and she gave the example when
she met someone in Montreal

00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:15.620
in the supermarket.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.300
And she was wearing
the "Luzia" sweater.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.520
And they asked her,
you're from "Luzia."

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.250
You're the singer, right?

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.880
And she goes, yes.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.796
And then the person
basically just thanked her

00:46:21.796 --> 00:46:23.720
because he was
having a rough day.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.680
And that day she was--
to make an example,

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.770
there's a part of
the song where it

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.310
says that even if
the sky is raining,

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.880
you don't have to
be sad, kind of.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.960
So it's like you never know
when you can make a person's

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.160
day with what you do.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.190
And we perform every
day, as she said,

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.580
in front of 2,500
people every day.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.679
And you never know.

00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:48.470
If you do something
good or bad, you always

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.350
transmit a message to the
people that are watching you.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:56.330
So the fact that you go on
stage to share something

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.420
with somebody, that's what keeps
her motivated as an artist.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.200
And if I can add to it, I mean,
that main thing is the people,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.912
because we are sharing
something to an audience.

00:47:05.912 --> 00:47:07.370
We're not doing
this for ourselves.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.930
We're just transmitting through
what we do something to you.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.640
Also, on the other side, yes.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.540
We are acrobats.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.530
We're athletes.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:20.360
And another part to keep that
motivation is the fact that you

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.880
work with people
that are talented

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.980
and always want to do more,
always want to improve.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.580
And we live literally
in an environment

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.280
that allows us to become
better at what we do.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.110
So that attaches to that
fear of never making it.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.200
It's not much of a fear
that never making it.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.014
It's more like overcoming
that kind of a doubt,

00:47:42.014 --> 00:47:43.180
but it's not really a doubt.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.180
It's just like you don't
know what could happen.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.840
Or like, you don't know
what the boundaries are.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.306
So it's more that excitement.

00:47:51.306 --> 00:47:53.180
I see it more as an
excitement than as a fear

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.055
that I can't make it.

00:47:54.055 --> 00:47:55.310
It's not like, oh, wow.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:56.180
This is hard.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.220
But it's like, I can
do it if I want to.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.080
I have to push myself.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.640
So it kind of goes from
the motivational part

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.480
to not having a fear to also
saying, like, oh my God.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.280
I can inspire someone.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.100
Like, I don't know.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.760
Maybe a kid sees Rudy juggling,
and is like, I want to do that.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.151
Or a girl-- for me-- she sees
me does football, like, soccer

00:48:18.151 --> 00:48:18.650
tricks.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.990
And like, if you come from
other parts of the world,

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.282
soccer is mainly
like a guy thing.

00:48:23.282 --> 00:48:25.490
But then you-- maybe just
a girl who does skateboard.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.948
It's like, I'm going to become
a professional skateboarder.

00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:29.073
So it all kind of loops in.

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:31.698
HEATHER RILEY: I think with the
artists, too, one of the things

00:48:31.698 --> 00:48:32.574
that they can add--

00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:34.490
the show that we did a
year ago, although it's

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.020
the same "Luzia,"
now that they're

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.470
more comfortable
with the basics,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.930
they can push themselves
that much further.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.596
There's the next step
and the next step.

00:48:40.596 --> 00:48:42.290
Even though the act
is the same, there's

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.300
how can I give that
little bit more,

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.030
how can I-- for themselves,
as much as for the audience

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.780
itself.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.610
So there's all sorts
of little things

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:52.230
that are happening
there every day.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:54.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.550
CLIFF REDEKER: Go ahead.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:00.090
AUDIENCE: For the
freestyle footballers--

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.740
what's your favorite trick?

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.360
And what's the hardest trick?

00:49:07.887 --> 00:49:09.220
ABOU TRAORE: My favorite tricks?

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:09.720
OK.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.178
I will show you.

00:49:11.178 --> 00:49:14.142
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.540
[KISSING SOUND]

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:28.468
This is-- and I love dancing.

00:49:28.468 --> 00:49:32.914
That's why I mix
this with the ball.

00:49:32.914 --> 00:49:34.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:37.515 --> 00:49:39.140
LAURA BIONDO: For
me, my favorite trick

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.640
is called the
Clipper, which is also

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.990
the last record that I broke.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.445
And it's like this.

00:49:49.295 --> 00:49:51.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:51.235 --> 00:49:52.710
Thank you.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:54.190
Answering to the
second question,

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.280
which is the hardest trick.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.730
In freestyle, there's not
really exactly a hardest trick.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.580
There's levels of tricks.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.474
There's like you
can divide them.

00:50:04.474 --> 00:50:07.140
If it's like one revolution, two
revolutions, three revolutions.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.530
But the hardest part--

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.510
it's always different
for everybody.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.250
But definitely the
most challenging thing

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:17.880
is to try to do as
many tricks as possible

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.970
without juggling in between,
which is called a combo.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.092
So it's personal.

00:50:22.092 --> 00:50:24.550
Some people find it harder to
learn things with their feet.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:27.962
Some people find it harder to
learn things with their heads.

00:50:27.962 --> 00:50:29.670
But definitely, the
most challenging part

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.240
is doing as many as
you can together.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.120
ABOU TRAORE: And for
me, the hardest tricks

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.510
is a back salto--

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.070
back flip-- with the ball.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.480
Because I take like
two years to really--

00:50:47.537 --> 00:50:48.620
CLIFF REDEKER: Perfect it.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.023
Yeah.

00:50:49.023 --> 00:50:49.830
LAURA BIONDO: Perfect it.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.500
ABOU TRAORE: Perfect it.

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.410
To take two years to
really perfect this trick,

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.670
because sometimes I drop.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:01.980
And I have the injury
with this trick.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.080
And I never give up.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.420
I training every day.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.450
Some time after the show I stay
like, one hour to training,

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:13.440
because every time I want
to make the new tricks.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.610
This is my challenge every day,
because when the people come,

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.050
they don't know what is
the football freestyle.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.660
And I want to give
something they never see

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.220
and the originality.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:31.500
And sometimes I make the
football dancing and acrobatic.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.510
That's why people say, OK.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.700
I don't like the
football-- and soccer,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.480
for the American people.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.840
Sometime people tell me,
I don't like the soccer,

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.730
but you mix the
football and dancing.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.750
This is I never see it before.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.390
And that's why I love your act.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:56.250
And this is giving me the
energy to make something strong.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.580
HEATHER RILEY: For us,
that scene in the show

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.720
is an urban street
scene, because there's

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.970
other members of our
cast are behind them,

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.220
kind of the other
teams-- guys and girls.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.524
And we also incorporate rain.

00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:08.190
So not only are they
doing those tricks,

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.148
but then we also make it
rain during their act.

00:52:10.148 --> 00:52:11.970
So we add another
level of difficulty,

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:13.596
in case it wasn't
hard enough to start.

00:52:13.596 --> 00:52:15.803
CLIFF REDEKER: And even cast
is building their skills

00:52:15.803 --> 00:52:16.730
in freestyle football.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:21.620
Speaking of that as
well, you [FRENCH].

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.110
You've both played the
game of football-- soccer.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.810
So now that you've
moved into freestyle,

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.970
do you ever move back
into an actual match?

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:34.530
Like, are those tricks
applicable on the pitch?

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.254
Do you incorporate that when
you play the game of soccer?

00:52:38.254 --> 00:52:38.920
ABOU TRAORE: No.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.884
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.275
HEATHER RILEY: Not just
English and Spanish, ladies

00:52:44.275 --> 00:52:44.858
and gentlemen.

00:52:44.858 --> 00:52:45.610
French too.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.578
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:57.990
ABOU TRAORE: Is different
than the tricks.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:03.680
But some tricks, when
you're playing the soccer,

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.710
is like sometimes I can
jump the ball with the hand

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.180
and not in soccer.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.540
And soccer is not--

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.986
you can't make this, because if
you do this, is like the foul.

00:53:16.986 --> 00:53:19.264
That's why.

00:53:19.264 --> 00:53:21.930
LAURA BIONDO: We normally on our
days off-- there's not only us,

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.450
but there's other
artists, like Rudy himself

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.550
and part of the musicians,
we all like to play.

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.040
So we organize little
games among ourselves.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.740
And we go out to play, because
we're passionate about it.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.040
In fact, during like
World Cups or Europeans,

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.630
we have like projecting
things on the walls of Vizio.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.640
But you can use some
tricks in the game.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.220
It depends.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.970
But mainly, freestyle helps
a lot on the ball control

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.320
and in your confidence.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.270
So when you go play,
even though you're not

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.790
going to do a bunch
of crazy tricks,

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.734
you do have a confidence
in trying things.

00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:58.400
CLIFF REDEKER: And
then in agility, too.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.452
LAURA BIONDO: Yeah.

00:54:00.452 --> 00:54:01.410
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, yes.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.060
One final audience question.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
you're constantly pushing

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.312
the boundaries of the body.

00:54:07.312 --> 00:54:08.520
And that comes with injuries.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.603
I was wondering how often
do acrobats get injured?

00:54:10.603 --> 00:54:12.884
And how do you deal with that?

00:54:12.884 --> 00:54:14.550
HEATHER RILEY: More
often than we'd like

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:18.742
is one answer, but not as often
as people think is the other.

00:54:18.742 --> 00:54:20.700
Injuries can range from
anything that's little.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.200
It can be lots of
bumps and bruises.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.420
People always have
bumps and bruises.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.630
That's pretty normal.

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.960
If it's something that's
more serious or significant,

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.080
we partner with the local
medical community in case

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.777
we need that level
of intervention.

00:54:33.777 --> 00:54:35.610
As much as we can, we
manage things in house

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.710
with our sports therapists
that are with us.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.787
And you know, if necessary,
yes, there's surgeries.

00:54:40.787 --> 00:54:42.870
There have been broken
bones and things like that.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.200
But we really try and mitigate
that as much as we can.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.760
If somebody is out of the show--

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.810
it could be for
a couple of days.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:50.226
It could be for a
couple of weeks.

00:54:50.226 --> 00:54:50.780
It depends.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.560
And if they're going to be out
for an extended period of time,

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.230
we send them home, because
the best place to get better

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.149
is usually with mom
taking care of you

00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:58.440
and doing those sort of things.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.880
We send people home
for their rehab,

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.290
and then they come back when
they're ready to train again.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:03.270
CLIFF REDEKER: And
on-site massage

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.490
therapy, just like Google.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.800
HEATHER RILEY: Oh, yeah.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.591
They have massages.

00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:07.060
We saw your haircut
truck out here.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.400
That's what I was jealous about.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.860
But yeah, we have
massage therapists also

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.610
that come with us.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:15.030
And again, we get the
support of the community.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.620
It's one of our
benefits, I guess,

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.280
because we're so well known,
we use the same doctors

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.810
as the sharks kind of idea.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.650
You know.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.400
CLIFF REDEKER: OK.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.865
The last audience question.

00:55:24.865 --> 00:55:27.240
AUDIENCE: With so much that
you create at so many levels,

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.910
from the footwear design to
repurposing mining equipment,

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.368
I'm really curious if you could
talk about what your design

00:55:32.368 --> 00:55:35.280
shop is like at the technical
and physical creation level.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.580
You've got to have a lot
of interesting people

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.200
with diverse backgrounds.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.970
HEATHER RILEY: Our studio
is a lot smaller than this,

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:39.840
let me tell you.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.580
There's about 2,500
employees that

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.680
work at our headquarters
in Montreal.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.050
Everything from lawyers and
accountants and that side

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.830
to our creative team.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:50.440
Our headquarters is kind
of designed as a factory.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.350
So it also has an
industrial look to it.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:57.120
And one wing is completely
that creation side--

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.057
from the costume shop, one
floor has all the fabric work

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:01.890
and the sewing and the
hats, another floor's

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.820
got more of the patterning
and does wigs and shoes.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.940
The opposite side is a
technical creation shop.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.590
So I think there's probably
about 500 to 600 people that

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.565
work on that full-time for us,
working on the different shows.

00:56:16.565 --> 00:56:17.940
And they work
project to project.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.489
So we have a team that does
the maintenance for our show.

00:56:20.489 --> 00:56:22.530
And then there's teams
that do creations as well.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.020
So they rotate back and
forth on different things.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.160
CLIFF REDEKER: And in each
show, as well, there's

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.577
a complete mirror of the stage
backstage for practice too.

00:56:28.577 --> 00:56:29.909
HEATHER RILEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:31.800
So what you don't usually
see from the front.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.840
You come in the entrance
tent in the big top itself.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.881
And behind that's what we
call the artistic tent.

00:56:35.881 --> 00:56:37.680
And in that tent is
their dressing rooms,

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.490
the training area.

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:41.484
So during the show people are
warming up or cooling down,

00:56:41.484 --> 00:56:43.650
depending on where they are
in the series of things.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.280
They can watch from monitors
of what's happening,

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.030
so they know when to
go on and off stage.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.497
We have our wardrobe team.

00:56:49.497 --> 00:56:50.580
I have a head of wardrobe.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.950
And she has two assistants
plus local staff,

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:55.740
plus the physios and such and
coaches are all back there

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.630
making that happen.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.770
So it's kind of our
beehive backstage.

00:56:58.770 --> 00:56:58.875
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome.

00:56:58.875 --> 00:57:00.690
So the last question
that I had-- and you

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.690
touched on Majo's dress.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.940
But for anyone on
the stage as well,

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.589
what's one detail that
the audience may not

00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:11.130
be paying attention
to that they need

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.213
to tilt their gaze when
they're watching the show.

00:57:13.213 --> 00:57:17.010
Like what's one little
trick or little homage

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:19.380
that you wish people would
pay more attention to?

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:20.460
HEATHER RILEY: You want
to go down the line.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:20.960
We'll see.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.427
What's something that people
need to watch for in the show?

00:57:23.427 --> 00:57:24.510
Something they might miss?

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.220
CLIFF REDEKER: I like
the little robot guy

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.594
that mows the flowers.

00:57:33.594 --> 00:57:35.562
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.974
ABOU TRAORE: For
me is the smile.

00:58:00.974 --> 00:58:04.560
The smile-- because
it's important

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.990
when you give the
smile with the people,

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.750
and people can
remember everything.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:13.090
And when they come to
home, they say, OK.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:14.110
I saw the show.

00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:19.010
But the guy, when
he played soccer,

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.390
it gave me the
motivation of the smile.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:27.160
And then I can keep this
for the memory every time.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.240
And that's why I
love playing soccer.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.990
And I share the smile
with the people.

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:39.360
CLIFF REDEKER: Anyone else?

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.810
LAURA BIONDO: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:49.120
CLIFF REDEKER: Well,
the dress is amazing.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.460
HEATHER RILEY: Your dress
is pretty amazing, though.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.380
MAJO CORNEJO: This
show, it's so beautiful.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.600
HEATHER RILEY: I think one
thing if I can recommend

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.080
is, if you can, come
see a show twice.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.610
Because the first
time we're going

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.650
to make you look
certain directions.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:05.230
We're going to force you to
watch something on that stage

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.080
while we're doing something
over here to clean up or change.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.560
So we draw the attention one way
to make something else happen.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.810
What I suggest to people if
you can come a second time

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:15.560
is don't watch the main thing.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.879
Watch the other place, because
that's the other little magic,

00:59:18.879 --> 00:59:20.170
like those machines that clean.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.500
We do that in the dark.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.020
But we focus on
something in front.

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.910
So there's a lot of those
little tricks that happen.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:25.870
CLIFF REDEKER: And
even the artists

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:28.930
that are spotting each other and
conversing in the background.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.600
HEATHER RILEY: Try-- again,
you need to come twice.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.725
CLIFF REDEKER: Three times.

00:59:32.725 --> 00:59:33.750
HEATHER RILEY: Or more.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:37.205
But if you can, don't
watch the main thing

00:59:37.205 --> 00:59:38.830
if you can take your
eyes away from it.

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:39.800
That's my suggestion.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.260
And then you see those
other little moments

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:42.010
that are going on.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:44.200
And often, a lot of little
interactions and jokes

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.270
that these guys have on stage.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.790
They're playing with each other
even more than what you see.

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:49.660
So no, it's fun.
