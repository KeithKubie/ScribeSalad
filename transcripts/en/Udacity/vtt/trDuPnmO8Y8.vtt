00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.060
And that's how Map Reduce works. let's summarize. The

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
Mappers are just little programs that each deal with

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.840
a relatively small amount of data, and work in

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.220
parallel. We call that output the Intermediate Records. That's what

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.160
we were writing on our index cards. Hadoop deals

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.270
with all data in the form of key and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
value. So these records are actually keys and values.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.450
In our example, the key was the store name and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.080
the value was the sale total for each

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.740
particular piece of input. Once the Mappers have finished,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
a phase of Map Reduce called the Shuffle

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.290
and Sort takes place. The Shuffle is the movement

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.870
of the intermediate records from the Mappers to

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.650
the Reducers. The Sort is the fact that the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.440
Reducers will organize these sets of records, in our

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.300
case these piles of index cards, into sorted order.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.130
Finally, each Reducer works on one set of records at a time, or one pile of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.850
cards. It gets the key and then a list of all the values. In our case, a store

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.260
like New York City. And in all the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.730
sales for that store, it processes those values in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.530
some way. In our case, we were adding up

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.450
the sales. Then it writes out the final results.
