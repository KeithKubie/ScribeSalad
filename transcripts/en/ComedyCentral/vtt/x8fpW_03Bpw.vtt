00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.869
- Ladies and gentlemen,
The Opposition premiered

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.838
 last night, and I'm in hour
 25 of reviewing our reviews.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.474 size:88% position:44%
  So again, these are again
  real life press clippings.

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.378 align:start position:0%
We start at the so called
Daily Beast which misquoted us.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.081 size:88% position:44%
  We said Alex Jones
  is a raging bull,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.250 size:84% position:42%
  virile, masculine, feral,

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.521 size:88% position:44%
 but they said Jones
 is a raging bowl,

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.057
B-O-W-L.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.025 size:88% position:44%
 And you might think
 it's just a typo,

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.728 size:84% position:42%
  but The Beast hyperlinked

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.697
to a picture of a bowl.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.067 align:start position:0%
 And it's not just any
 bowl, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.501 size:88% position:44%
  it's a salad bowl.

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.371
 So obviously The Daily Beast
 is in the pocket of big kale.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:41.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And since we first
 discovered this error,

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:45.178 align:start position:0%
  I mean, message, The Daily
  Beast has subsequently

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.416 align:start position:0%
 taken down the bowl language,
 and erased the hyperlink.

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:52.051
 Coincidence?

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.019
 I think not.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.054
Next we go over to the AV Club.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:58.257
 More of an AV cult connected
 directly to skull and bones,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.893
and free masons,
and the Beyhive.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.929 align:start position:0%
 And they say, quote, Niccole
 Thurman seen whooping

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.231
it up as a long black
person at a trump rally

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:08.034
where she's habitually
posed by Trump staffers

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.302 size:84% position:42%
  right behind the
  podium every time

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.971
 is an analogist, is an analog.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.242 size:88% position:44%
 Those conspicuously
 few non-white faces

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start position:0%
 Trump habitually trots out
 to refute charges of bigotry.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:23.216
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 that was one sentence.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.117 size:88% position:44%
 One

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.118
 long

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.186 size:84% position:42%
  sentence.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.823 size:88% position:44%
  They used the word
  habitually twice.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
Almost as if this
writer has some kind of,

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:38.164
 I don't know, routine using
 that word whatever it means.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.466 align:start size:88% position:13%
 These are the lies
 the main stream media

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.102 size:84% position:42%
  is trying to tell you and
  every single one of them

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.404 size:88% position:44%
  has since been taken down.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:46.472 size:84% position:42%
  Redacted.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.141
 Hidden from your view.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:52.378 size:84% position:42%
  But we at Oppo Radio know
  how to take screen shots.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.616
 We're screen shooting for you.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.586 align:start position:0%
Next we move over to this
review from The Chicago Tribune.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.356 size:88% position:44%
 Which refers to a fictional

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.258 size:88% position:44%
 MSNBC host,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.126
 Christ Hayes.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.930
 Now, my colleague Laura Gray
 says that this is a typo,

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.166 align:start position:0%
  but ladies and
  gentlemen, you and I know

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.168
there's no such thing as a typo.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.136 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Freud's theory was
  that if you put

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.672
 it down on paper you meant it.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.108 align:start position:0%
  So this is a class example
  of the mainstream media

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.012 size:88% position:44%
 trying to slip its
 cultish iconography

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.347 size:84% position:42%
  into our reviews.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.383
 So be on the look out,
 ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.654 align:start position:0%
 For other examples of deities
 paired with MSNBC hosts.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.191
 It starts with Christ Hayes,

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.494
but look out for Buddha Maddow.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.863 size:88% position:44%
 Or Vishnu Matthews.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
  When you see those
  symbols in your tribunes,

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:50.303 size:84% position:42%
  and your heralds,
  and your timeses,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.905 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's how you know that
the mainstream media

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:57.177 align:start position:0%
 is trying to brainwash you
 with their religious symbols.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.116 size:88% position:44%
  Oh, I see how it
  coulda been Chris.
