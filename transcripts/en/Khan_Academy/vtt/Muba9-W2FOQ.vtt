00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.660
Below are ordered pairs
that represent the first six

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.290
terms of two given patterns.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.310
The first value in each pair
is a term from pattern A.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.750
And the second value is a term
from pattern B. In the answer

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.820
box, there are different
statements about the two

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.530
patterns.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.281
Choose all correct statements.

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.030
So let's think about
what's going on here.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.470
They said the first
term is pattern A.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.750
So the first term in each of
these coordinates is pattern A,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.530
or in each pair is
pattern A. So pattern A

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.390
goes from 1, to 2, to
4, to 8, to 16, to 32.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.970
So it looks like
pattern A, to go

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.050
from the first term
to the second term,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.595
we multiplied by 2.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.020
And then to go from the
second to the third term,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.350
we also multiplied by 2.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.284
And we just keep
multiplying by 2.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:55.450
And we just keep doing that.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.230
8 times 2 is 16.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.140
16 times 2 is 32.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.580
Now let's think about what's
going on with pattern B.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.960
So pattern B is the second
number in each of these pairs.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.986
And it's just always 3.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.110
So there's a couple of ways
you can think about it.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.930
You could just say,
pattern B's always 3.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.710
You could say pattern
B starts at 3,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.910
and we're just
adding 0 every time.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.790
Or you could say that
pattern B starts at 3,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.850
and we are multiplying
by 1 every time.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.730
Either of those
would give you just 3

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.630
showing up over and over again.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.020
So now that we've
looked at these pairs,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.280
we show the corresponding terms
for pattern A and pattern B,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.470
let's look at the choices here
and see which of these apply.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.710
In pattern A, you can get
from any term to the next

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.962
by multiplying by
a constant number.

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:46.920
Well, that looks right.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.870
We go from the first
term to the second term

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.900
by multiplying by 2.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.840
Then we multiply by 2 again
to get to the third term.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.090
Then we keep multiplying by 2.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.210
So that constant number
that we're multiplying by

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.710
to get to the next term is 2.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.600
So this looks right.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.610
The next pair should
be 52 comma 3.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.030
So let's think about this.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.565
If we keep doubling
for pattern A-- so this

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:07.785
is going to be times 2.

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:11.090
32 times 2 is 64.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.860
And then if we'd say that this
is 1 times the previous term,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.580
we're just going
to get a 3 again.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.640
So it should be 64 comma
3 should be the next one.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.760
They say the next pair
should be 52 comma 3.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.860
So that's not right.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.130
If we graph the
pairs, the points

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.436
will be on the same line.

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.060
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.250
Let's think about that.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.870
So this is my vertical axis.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.760
This is my horizontal axis.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.800
On the horizontal axis,
I will graph pattern A.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.430
And on my vertical axis, I will
graph pattern B. And let's see.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.160
Pattern A goes all
the way up to 32.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.090
So I'm going to
try my best here.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.770
So let's say that this is 32.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.856
Then half of that
is going to be 16.

00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:02.242
Half of that is going to be 8.

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:05.000
Half of that is going to be 4.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.540
Half of that is going to be 2.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.870
And half of that
is going to be 1.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.840
So these are all the points on
pattern A. But for any of them,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.130
the corresponding term
on pattern B is 3.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.970
So we have, when pattern A
is 1, pattern B is 3-- 1,3.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.460
When pattern A is
2, pattern B is 3.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.400
When pattern A is
4, pattern B is 3.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.500
When pattern A is
8, pattern B is 3.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.670
When pattern A is 16, pattern--
this is like a tongue-- when

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.350
pattern A is 16, pattern B is 3.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.910
When pattern A is
32, pattern B is 3.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.850
And you see, they
all sit on a line.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.590
They all sit on this horizontal
line, or at least the way

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.140
that we've drawn it.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.070
They all sit on this
line that you probably

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.580
can't see in yellow.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.250
So let me do it
in this red color.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.910
They all sit on this
line right over here.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.126
So this looks right.

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:06.500
If we graph the
pairs, the points

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.670
will be on the same line.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.110
So I'll go with that one.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.560
In pattern B, you can get
from any term to the next

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.034
by multiplying by
a constant number.

00:04:14.034 --> 00:04:16.200
Well, yeah, even though
every term is the same term,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.550
but you can get from a 3 to a
3 by always multiplying by 1.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.089
1 is a constant number.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.110
So we're just multiplying
every term by 1.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.139
So that also seems to be right.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.180
So all of these are right,
except the second one.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.550
The next pair isn't 52 comma 3.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.810
It's going to be 64 comma 3.
