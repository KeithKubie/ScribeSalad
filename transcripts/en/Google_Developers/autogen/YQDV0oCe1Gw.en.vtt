previous experiences developing software

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
previous experiences developing software
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980
previous experiences developing software
and designing software have changed if

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
and designing software have changed if
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.070
and designing software have changed if
you had cloud so I guess I'm quite

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080
you had cloud so I guess I'm quite
 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.710
you had cloud so I guess I'm quite
experienced in like designing software

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
experienced in like designing software
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.770
experienced in like designing software
and developing a little bit and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
and developing a little bit and
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.580
and developing a little bit and
experience probably to the length of it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

and you know joins the dots so for
example it might be would build a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
example it might be would build a
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.100
example it might be would build a

before we get developers involved you
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.550
before we get developers involved you
know would draw this up and then we

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
know would draw this up and then we

okay and that that was the cloud and I
can remember like you know for me the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
can remember like you know for me the
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.970
can remember like you know for me the
next step is once I've designed this and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
next step is once I've designed this and
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.410
next step is once I've designed this and
I figured out all these feeds and where

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
I figured out all these feeds and where
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.270
I figured out all these feeds and where
I'm getting all this data like I would

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
I'm getting all this data like I would
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.030
I'm getting all this data like I would
bring the ops people in and I remember

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
bring the ops people in and I remember
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.009
bring the ops people in and I remember
specifically the best ops guy I've ever

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019
specifically the best ops guy I've ever
 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.720
specifically the best ops guy I've ever
worked with Mike I remember his name I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
worked with Mike I remember his name I
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.430
worked with Mike I remember his name I
remember it will Scott something is not

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
remember it will Scott something is not
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.410
remember it will Scott something is not
scott guthrie I remember Scott something

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
scott guthrie I remember Scott something
 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.809
scott guthrie I remember Scott something
and I remember having this conversation

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819
and I remember having this conversation
 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.580
and I remember having this conversation
with him and presenting the thing to him

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590
with him and presenting the thing to him
 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.259
with him and presenting the thing to him
and he looked through and I thought I'd

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269
and he looked through and I thought I'd
 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.509
and he looked through and I thought I'd
done a fabulous job of pitching my

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
done a fabulous job of pitching my
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.729
done a fabulous job of pitching my
architecture to him and his job would be

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
architecture to him and his job would be
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.650
architecture to him and his job would be
then to think about how many servers do

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
then to think about how many servers do
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.180
then to think about how many servers do
we have running this how do we secure

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190
we have running this how do we secure
 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.280
we have running this how do we secure
that how do we make sure the servers are

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290
that how do we make sure the servers are
 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.410
that how do we make sure the servers are

all this kind of stuff I remember like
doing this fabulous presentation that I

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
doing this fabulous presentation that I
 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.280
doing this fabulous presentation that I
prepared like four weeks and giving it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
prepared like four weeks and giving it
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.229
prepared like four weeks and giving it
to this guy to get him on board and he

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239
to this guy to get him on board and he
 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.990
to this guy to get him on board and he
said four words to me

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
said four words to me
 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.540
said four words to me
and these are words that I can share on

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550
and these are words that I can share on
 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.060
and these are words that I can share on
video don't worry sir so what do you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
video don't worry sir so what do you
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.060
video don't worry sir so what do you
think the four words were um I love it

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070
think the four words were um I love it
 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.850
think the four words were um I love it
he's it forwards where there is no cloud

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860
he's it forwards where there is no cloud
 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.300
he's it forwards where there is no cloud
wait okay okay listen this is ten years

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310
wait okay okay listen this is ten years
 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.590
wait okay okay listen this is ten years
ago yeah bat ok about that so where is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600
ago yeah bat ok about that so where is
 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.150

he coming from with that so where he was

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160
he coming from with that so where he was
 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.380
he coming from with that so where he was
coming from when he was exactly right

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390
coming from when he was exactly right
 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.330
coming from when he was exactly right
was because if you think about the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340
was because if you think about the
 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.950
was because if you think about the
complexity of running an application

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960
complexity of running an application
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.230
complexity of running an application
like this ok security and manageability

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240
like this ok security and manageability
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.880
like this ok security and manageability
like I same virus scanning even like the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890
like I same virus scanning even like the
 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.650
like I same virus scanning even like the
number of servers that you need to run

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
number of servers that you need to run
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.090
number of servers that you need to run
this thing we had actually do a

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100
this thing we had actually do a
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.470
this thing we had actually do a
calculation that would look at our

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480
calculation that would look at our
 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.210
calculation that would look at our
traffic and then would say this was

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220
traffic and then would say this was
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.530
traffic and then would say this was
going to be a java application running

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540
going to be a java application running
 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.900
going to be a java application running
on a weblogic app server i would say ok

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
on a weblogic app server i would say ok
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.880
on a weblogic app server i would say ok
we looked at our the traffic that would

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890
we looked at our the traffic that would
 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.290
we looked at our the traffic that would
have and looked at the number of users

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300
have and looked at the number of users
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.630
have and looked at the number of users
would figure out how many you know like

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640
would figure out how many you know like
 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.460
would figure out how many you know like
based on the cpu based on the networking

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470
based on the cpu based on the networking
 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.050
based on the cpu based on the networking
activity so he's thinking just like

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060
activity so he's thinking just like
 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730
activity so he's thinking just like
straight logistics like how do you get

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740
straight logistics like how do you get
 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.140
straight logistics like how do you get
the hardware you need to do that like

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150
the hardware you need to do that like
 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.460
the hardware you need to do that like
what networking infrastructure do you

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
what networking infrastructure do you
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.620
what networking infrastructure do you
need like out of the switches workload

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630
need like out of the switches workload
 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.300
need like out of the switches workload
balancing how much storage do we need

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
balancing how much storage do we need
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.860
balancing how much storage do we need
yeah you can't just hand wave that away

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870
yeah you can't just hand wave that away
 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.690
yeah you can't just hand wave that away
and like I draw I did behind a fluffy

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700
and like I draw I did behind a fluffy
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.340
and like I draw I did behind a fluffy
cloud gosh ok well how does that change

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350
cloud gosh ok well how does that change
 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.210
cloud gosh ok well how does that change
now like listen so that's not really

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220
now like listen so that's not really
 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.469
now like listen so that's not really
what we think of as cloud now but it

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479
what we think of as cloud now but it
 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.630
what we think of as cloud now but it
kind of is what and I think that's the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640
kind of is what and I think that's the
 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.550
kind of is what and I think that's the
main thing and that's like the magic

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
main thing and that's like the magic
 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.500
main thing and that's like the magic
that the perceived magic that I is an

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510
that the perceived magic that I is an
 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.330
that the perceived magic that I is an
architect would do is like draw a fluffy

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340
architect would do is like draw a fluffy
 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.770
architect would do is like draw a fluffy
cloud and hide away all and then likes

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780
cloud and hide away all and then likes
 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.450
cloud and hide away all and then likes
it all just works yeah and it all just

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460
it all just works yeah and it all just
 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.330
it all just works yeah and it all just
works like that is a reality now it's no

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340
works like that is a reality now it's no
 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.700
works like that is a reality now it's no
longer a perceived magic right because I

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710
longer a perceived magic right because I
 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.409
longer a perceived magic right because I
mean we work with the Google cloud

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419
mean we work with the Google cloud
 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.540
mean we work with the Google cloud
platform and I'm gonna go do my superman

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550
platform and I'm gonna go do my superman
 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.550
platform and I'm gonna go do my superman
thing go you know we work with the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560
thing go you know we work with the
 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.010
thing go you know we work with the
Google cloud platform now and so the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020
Google cloud platform now and so the
 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.540
Google cloud platform now and so the
nice thing about that is if we build

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
nice thing about that is if we build
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.420
nice thing about that is if we build
applications that run for example on App

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430
applications that run for example on App
 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.100
applications that run for example on App
Engine yep and it was funny that was

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110

talking about was javon weblogic and
brave engine supports Java which makes

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229
brave engine supports Java which makes
 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.950
brave engine supports Java which makes
me very happy and you know then all of

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960
me very happy and you know then all of
 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.409
me very happy and you know then all of
those complexities of scaling up and

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419
those complexities of scaling up and
 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.050
those complexities of scaling up and
when you need it and scaling down when

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060
when you need it and scaling down when
 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.909
when you need it and scaling down when
you don't need it god you're only paying

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919
you don't need it god you're only paying
 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.190
you don't need it god you're only paying
for what you use so now that's all real

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
for what you use so now that's all real
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.290
for what you use so now that's all real
that's all real you know because in his

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300
that's all real you know because in his
 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.120

to go back to my friend who said there

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130
to go back to my friend who said there
 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.340
to go back to my friend who said there
is no cloud you know he would look at

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350
is no cloud you know he would look at
 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.110
is no cloud you know he would look at
the amount of traffic that we need will

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120
the amount of traffic that we need will
 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.850
the amount of traffic that we need will
calculate the number of servers that we

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860
calculate the number of servers that we
 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.010
calculate the number of servers that we
need for that and then we had like an

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020
need for that and then we had like an
 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.719
need for that and then we had like an
algorithm based on like a

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729
algorithm based on like a
 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.879
algorithm based on like a
tub curve type thing and what you call

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889
tub curve type thing and what you call
 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.100
tub curve type thing and what you call
that a binary curve to say him and I

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110
that a binary curve to say him and I
 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.659
that a binary curve to say him and I
think we calculated the average number

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669
think we calculated the average number
 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.279
think we calculated the average number
of servers and we multiplied that by 2

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289
of servers and we multiplied that by 2
 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.379
of servers and we multiplied that by 2
root 2 and that would give us like the

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389
root 2 and that would give us like the
 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.600
root 2 and that would give us like the
ninety-five percent estimate for you

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
ninety-five percent estimate for you
 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.089
ninety-five percent estimate for you
know for traffic and so like we might

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099
know for traffic and so like we might
 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.309
know for traffic and so like we might
need 10 servers for traffic but would

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319
need 10 servers for traffic but would
 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.850
need 10 servers for traffic but would
end up with 28 servers and for the times

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860
end up with 28 servers and for the times
 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.369
end up with 28 servers and for the times
like from outside of nine to five you

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379
like from outside of nine to five you
 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:47.799
like from outside of nine to five you
know that goes 28 notes till sitting

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:47.809
know that goes 28 notes till sitting
 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:49.989
know that goes 28 notes till sitting
there not being years average times

we're using 10 and 18 of them were
 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.769
we're using 10 and 18 of them were
unused and for the sake of like peak

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:53.779
unused and for the sake of like peak

like now it cloud like now we can talk

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789
like now it cloud like now we can talk
 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.639
like now it cloud like now we can talk
about that kind of fluffy thing and all

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:00.649
about that kind of fluffy thing and all
 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.559
about that kind of fluffy thing and all
of that magic is going on for it really

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569
of that magic is going on for it really
 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.629
of that magic is going on for it really
exists and it really really exists so

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639
exists and it really really exists so

I'd love to have I'd love to have Scott

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889
I'd love to have I'd love to have Scott
 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.649
I'd love to have I'd love to have Scott
on a future show and I asked him is

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659
on a future show and I asked him is
 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.350
on a future show and I asked him is
there a cloud now like my job okay so I

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360
there a cloud now like my job okay so I
 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.279
there a cloud now like my job okay so I
had kind of a related experience you

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.289
had kind of a related experience you
 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.100
had kind of a related experience you
know like so I spent many years working

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110
know like so I spent many years working
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.700
know like so I spent many years working
on a system for distributing files

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710
on a system for distributing files
 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.769
on a system for distributing files
around many locations so that they were

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:23.779
around many locations so that they were
 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:27.369
around many locations so that they were
always available from all of these sites

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:27.379
always available from all of these sites
 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.070
always available from all of these sites
that the organization worked at and you

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080
that the organization worked at and you
 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.089
that the organization worked at and you
know we were trying to create the

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:31.099
know we were trying to create the
 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.709
know we were trying to create the
illusion that all of these files were

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:32.719
illusion that all of these files were
 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.540
illusion that all of these files were
available everywhere and realistically

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
available everywhere and realistically
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.579
available everywhere and realistically
you know you would keep a hot set of

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:36.589
you know you would keep a hot set of
 

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.369
you know you would keep a hot set of
files or recent things or some subset of

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:39.379
files or recent things or some subset of
 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:40.480
files or recent things or some subset of
what you could actually afford to keep

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.490
what you could actually afford to keep
 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.800
what you could actually afford to keep
their at some sites and maybe other

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810
their at some sites and maybe other
 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.420
their at some sites and maybe other
sites would have everything and you have

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430
sites would have everything and you have
 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.409
sites would have everything and you have
like too many copies of everything

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419
like too many copies of everything
 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:45.909
like too many copies of everything
really because you don't need the ball

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919
really because you don't need the ball
 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.230
really because you don't need the ball
Asset Management's a difficult problem

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240
Asset Management's a difficult problem
 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.070
Asset Management's a difficult problem
exactly and and you know you look at at

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080
exactly and and you know you look at at
 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.679
exactly and and you know you look at at
things like Google Cloud storage which

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:53.689
things like Google Cloud storage which
 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.019
things like Google Cloud storage which
is you know blob storage service in the

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029
is you know blob storage service in the
 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:59.110
is you know blob storage service in the
cloud and it essentially is that entire

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120
cloud and it essentially is that entire
 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.589
cloud and it essentially is that entire
system that we built like just ravey you

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599
system that we built like just ravey you
 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:06.610
system that we built like just ravey you
as a service as a service right so so if

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620
as a service as a service right so so if
 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.389
as a service as a service right so so if
I was in that yeah i think the entire

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:10.399
I was in that yeah i think the entire
 

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.339
I was in that yeah i think the entire
product doesn't even need to be built

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:12.349
product doesn't even need to be built
 

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:15.489
product doesn't even need to be built
like in that way so i would save a huge

00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:15.499
like in that way so i would save a huge
 

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.499
like in that way so i would save a huge
amount of time so you could have really

00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:17.509
amount of time so you could have really
 

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:18.939
amount of time so you could have really
focused on building out the user

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:18.949
focused on building out the user
 

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.799
focused on building out the user
experience exactly instead of the

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:20.809
experience exactly instead of the
 

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:22.570
experience exactly instead of the
plumbing in the infrastructure yep and

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.580
plumbing in the infrastructure yep and
 

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.860
plumbing in the infrastructure yep and
you know what we wanted to build on top

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:23.870
you know what we wanted to build on top
 

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.529
you know what we wanted to build on top
of that good it was all just necessary

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:26.539
of that good it was all just necessary
 

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.059
of that good it was all just necessary
foundation to get to what we were trying

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:28.069
foundation to get to what we were trying
 

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:28.930
foundation to get to what we were trying
to do you

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:28.940
to do you
 

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.240
to do you
and so with ya there are only so many

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.250
and so with ya there are only so many
 

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.190
and so with ya there are only so many
hours in the day and so if you're

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200
hours in the day and so if you're
 

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.630
hours in the day and so if you're
spending all that time and all those

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640
spending all that time and all those
 

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.520
spending all that time and all those
cycles building that plumbing it's like

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:36.530
cycles building that plumbing it's like
 

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.779
cycles building that plumbing it's like
think about the things that you're now

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:37.789
think about the things that you're now
 

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.520
think about the things that you're now
building exactly and particularly

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.530
building exactly and particularly
 

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.830
building exactly and particularly
nowadays I feel folks have much more of

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:41.840
nowadays I feel folks have much more of
 

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.690
nowadays I feel folks have much more of
a demand for a rich user experience than

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:43.700
a demand for a rich user experience than
 

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.550
a demand for a rich user experience than
they used to have you know things that

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560
they used to have you know things that
 

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.320
they used to have you know things that
are where acceptable 10 years ago

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.330
are where acceptable 10 years ago
 

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.830
are where acceptable 10 years ago
completely unacceptable today and

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:49.840
completely unacceptable today and
 

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.570
completely unacceptable today and
because now you have the luxury of being

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:52.580
because now you have the luxury of being
 

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.860
because now you have the luxury of being
able to hide behind that big fluffy

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:53.870
able to hide behind that big fluffy
 

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.660
able to hide behind that big fluffy
cloud you know with the cloud storage

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:55.670
cloud you know with the cloud storage
 

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.370
cloud you know with the cloud storage
then now you can focus on building a

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.380
then now you can focus on building a
 

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.470
then now you can focus on building a
better user experience and such a thing

00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480
better user experience and such a thing
 

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.450
better user experience and such a thing
like that totally so it do you have a

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:01.460
like that totally so it do you have a
 

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.220
like that totally so it do you have a
feature of cloud that kind of gets you

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:03.230
feature of cloud that kind of gets you
 

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.470
feature of cloud that kind of gets you
excited yeah so like there's there's a

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480
excited yeah so like there's there's a
 

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.390
excited yeah so like there's there's a
bunch of things like so many things

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:07.400
bunch of things like so many things
 

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.820
bunch of things like so many things
about cloud that gets me really excited

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:09.830
about cloud that gets me really excited
 

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.250
about cloud that gets me really excited
i mean like big picture like the whole

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:12.260
i mean like big picture like the whole
 

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.650
i mean like big picture like the whole
cloud space is super exciting right now

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:14.660
cloud space is super exciting right now
 

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.470
cloud space is super exciting right now
i think we've gotten to the point where

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480
i think we've gotten to the point where
 

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.410
i think we've gotten to the point where
you can create a a model of the hardware

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:20.420
you can create a a model of the hardware
 

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.850
you can create a a model of the hardware
we used to have to run all these things

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:21.860
we used to have to run all these things
 

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.870
we used to have to run all these things
so you've got your servers and you got

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880
so you've got your servers and you got
 

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.160
so you've got your servers and you got
your networks and switches and and

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.170
your networks and switches and and
 

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.390
your networks and switches and and
everything that used to have to go to a

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:25.400
everything that used to have to go to a
 

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.520
everything that used to have to go to a
data center in do by hand there's an API

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:27.530
data center in do by hand there's an API
 

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.520
data center in do by hand there's an API
for and that is super useful incredibly

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:30.530
for and that is super useful incredibly
 

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.240
for and that is super useful incredibly
exciting and and allows a layer a level

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.250
exciting and and allows a layer a level
 

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.530
exciting and and allows a layer a level
of automation that just wasn't possible

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:35.540
of automation that just wasn't possible
 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.690
of automation that just wasn't possible
before and you know speaks is like but I

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
before and you know speaks is like but I
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.890
before and you know speaks is like but I
don't think we're done there right like

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:38.900
don't think we're done there right like
 

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.020
don't think we're done there right like
this is the this is the next step of

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.030
this is the this is the next step of
 

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.150
this is the this is the next step of
figuring out okay now that these are

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160
figuring out okay now that these are
 

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.770
figuring out okay now that these are
these things that used to be physical or

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:44.780
these things that used to be physical or
 

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.840
these things that used to be physical or
abstract concepts yeah are they the

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:46.850
abstract concepts yeah are they the
 

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.580
abstract concepts yeah are they the
right abstractions we want for billing

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.590
right abstractions we want for billing
 

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.890

software in the future mmm and I think

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:50.900
software in the future mmm and I think
 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.260
software in the future mmm and I think
you know I think we can do better right

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:53.270
you know I think we can do better right
 

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.060
you know I think we can do better right
oh absolutely and you know so there's

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.070
oh absolutely and you know so there's
 

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.680
oh absolutely and you know so there's
things that are really exciting right

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:56.690
things that are really exciting right
 

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.850
things that are really exciting right
now you know so App Engine is really

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:57.860
now you know so App Engine is really
 

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.010
now you know so App Engine is really
interesting in that space I think docker

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.020
interesting in that space I think docker
 

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.140
interesting in that space I think docker
is super exciting as a bunch of stuff

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.150
is super exciting as a bunch of stuff
 

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.360
is super exciting as a bunch of stuff
going on there so cloud is a whole super

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
going on there so cloud is a whole super
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.940
going on there so cloud is a whole super
exciting I think in the in compute

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:06.950
exciting I think in the in compute
 

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.880
exciting I think in the in compute

it's super consistent and that's like

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:20.540
it's super consistent and that's like
 

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.090

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:23.990
great for running databases on and
 

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.050
great for running databases on and
things like that but i think if i want

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.060
things like that but i think if i want
 

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.880
things like that but i think if i want
to just like i like something pick one

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:27.890
to just like i like something pick one
 

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.380
to just like i like something pick one
pick one i'm actually going to put a

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.390
pick one i'm actually going to put a
 

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.670
pick one i'm actually going to put a
gopher to your head and it's good to

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680
gopher to your head and it's good to
 

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.520
gopher to your head and it's good to
pick one only one okay i think i would

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.530
pick one only one okay i think i would
 

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.720
pick one only one okay i think i would
have to pick

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:34.730
have to pick
 

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.329
have to pick
notifications in cloud storage so so

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:37.339
notifications in cloud storage so so
 

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:38.980
notifications in cloud storage so so
cloud storage is this blob store in the

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:38.990
cloud storage is this blob store in the
 

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.710
cloud storage is this blob store in the
sky you can you can push files to it and

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720
sky you can you can push files to it and
 

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.000
sky you can you can push files to it and
you can get them back from anywhere in

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.010
you can get them back from anywhere in
 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.759
you can get them back from anywhere in
the world and it has essentially

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:45.769
the world and it has essentially
 

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:47.350
the world and it has essentially
subscription notification so you can say

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360
subscription notification so you can say
 

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.750
subscription notification so you can say
at this HTTP endpoint that's my

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760
at this HTTP endpoint that's my
 

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.759
at this HTTP endpoint that's my
application I want you to send the

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:51.769
application I want you to send the
 

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:53.290
application I want you to send the
metadata for every single change that

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300
metadata for every single change that
 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.259
metadata for every single change that
happens in this bucket nice so you can

00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:56.269
happens in this bucket nice so you can
 

00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:58.509
happens in this bucket nice so you can
build workflow and you can build deep

00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519
build workflow and you can build deep
 

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.550
build workflow and you can build deep
integration between cloud storage and

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560
integration between cloud storage and
 

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.530
integration between cloud storage and
any application whether that's running

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.540
any application whether that's running
 

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.350
any application whether that's running
on google cloud or not nice so so like

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360
on google cloud or not nice so so like
 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.240
on google cloud or not nice so so like
it go back to your video scenario so if

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.250
it go back to your video scenario so if
 

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.650
it go back to your video scenario so if
you're building a video app and you've

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:08.660
you're building a video app and you've
 

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.509
you're building a video app and you've
got people all over the world shooting

00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519
got people all over the world shooting
 

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.009
got people all over the world shooting
footage for a movie or something like

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:12.019
footage for a movie or something like
 

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.360
footage for a movie or something like
that and then somebody put some new

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.370
that and then somebody put some new
 

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.040
that and then somebody put some new
footage everybody's going to be notified

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.050
footage everybody's going to be notified
 

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.750
footage everybody's going to be notified
so you can get like notifications to

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760
so you can get like notifications to
 

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.160
so you can get like notifications to
tell people about it you could kick off

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.170
tell people about it you could kick off
 

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.079
tell people about it you could kick off
a transcoding process you can just

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:20.089
a transcoding process you can just
 

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:21.310
a transcoding process you can just
deeply integrate it within your whole

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320
deeply integrate it within your whole
 

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.930
deeply integrate it within your whole

and how expensive it was for you to put

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:07.940
and how expensive it was for you to put
 

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.269
and how expensive it was for you to put
java stuff publicly oh right right like

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279
java stuff publicly oh right right like
 

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.519
