00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:20.230 position:75%
&gt;&gt; So now it is my sincere pleasure to introduce
Lee Ann Potter, who will be speaking to you

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.300 position:72%
about what's new from the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.470
A little bit about Lee Ann.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.520
She leads a dynamic team, committed
to developing educational programs

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.540 position:61%
and materials based on primary sources.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.800 position:70%
Before coming to the library, she created
and directed education and volunteer programs

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
at the National Archives in
Washington, D.C. for 16 years.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.530
Prior to that, Lee Ann worked
at the Smithsonian on a project

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.490 position:56%
to build museum-school partnerships.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.130
And before that, she was a high
school social studies teacher.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.330
She has conducted hundreds of
presentations and is the author

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.530
of numerous articles promoting
teaching with primary sources.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.560
Lee Ann, thank you so much.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.030
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.610
And Cheryl, I have to say I love
it when you use that introduction

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.010 position:61%
and you indicate I lead a dynamic team,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.100 position:61%
knowing full well that you are
absolutely a part of that dynamic team.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.460
So thanks for the introduction.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.470
And to all of you, thanks
so much for being here.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.410 position:59%
I especially appreciate those of you
who have spent the entire day teaching

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.670 position:63%
and have made a commitment to your own
professional development in the evening.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.630 position:73%
You rock, and your students ought to know that.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.500
So welcome to what's new
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.470
As Cheryl said, I'm Lee Ann.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.380 position:73%
I direct educational outreach at the library,
and I'm really excited to have this opportunity

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.970 position:75%
to give you a little sneak peek into some
things that are new at the library and resources

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.590
that will soon be coming your way.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.970 position:61%
To get the ball rolling and to make
sure that the chat function is working,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.140 position:64%
which I obviously see that it is, because
now I know where you are all sitting.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.470 position:75%
I hope you are all in your slippers, by the way.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.370 position:59%
I'd like you to use the chat function,
and a few of you could just chime

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.880 position:69%
and tell m what the word "new" means to you.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.550
When I say "new."

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.280
[laughter] Rachel, it's great,
because you're in your robe.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.010 position:64%
I've got my slippers on, I have to admit.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.620 position:63%
When I think of the word "new," mostly
what I think of is what you had in mind.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.340 position:56%
I think of new and improved, and new
and different, new meaning unusual

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.590
or not existing before, or recently
discovered, or just beginning.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.010 position:75%
And I suspect that your interest in this
session had something to do with the word "new."

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.540 position:75%
We all do seem to like things that are new, and
there is a lot of talk about things that are new

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.470
or just beginning, in terms of
things going on at the library.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.030
Resources, programs, and more.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.700 position:59%
And in the next 40 minutes, I plan to
tell you about a wide variety of them.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.020
Got a couple of objectives tonight.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.670 position:66%
I'd like to spend some time describing the
teaching with primary sources philosophy.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
How do you participate in a
primary source analysis activity?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.130 position:64%
Identify some new materials, and describe
some new programs and collaborations.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.850 position:69%
And my real hope is that you won't just
keep them to yourself, but you'll share them

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.620 position:64%
with others during and after the session.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.190 position:69%
I know many of you are already familiar with
the teaching the primary sources philosophy.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.090 position:69%
But in a nutshell, we at the library believe

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.030
that primary sources are
powerful teaching tools.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.960 position:61%
They can inspire, fascinate, and engage
learners of all ages in every subject,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.390 position:73%
and I'm going to show you some of that tonight.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.970 position:64%
So you have to put your thinking caps on.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.120 position:63%
I'm going to show you a very interesting
source from the library's collection.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.200
I went to the library's website,
and as I was thinking

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.550
about this session, I simply
typed in "what's new?"

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.260 position:73%
And what came up was this source, and I thought
you'd spend a little bit of time looking at it,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.120
focus your attention on it
for a couple of minutes.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.080 position:73%
And if you could indicate, or in the chat there
type what you observe, what you think this is.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.640 position:56%
If you'd indicate what you see,
what you think, and what you wonder.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.830 position:66%
That probably sounds familiar to those of
you who've worked with the library before.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.400
I could just as easily ask you to
observe, reflect, and question.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.880
And I've got a really good reason
for sharing this one with you.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.540
Yes, Kristen, you're right.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.990 position:61%
It is a cover page to some sheet music.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.430
Matt wants to go dancing.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.330
This is great.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.400 position:70%
Musical piece in three-quarter time, love it.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.390
Turn of the century.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.110
Ah, I love this.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.060
What makes you think it's
the turn of the century?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.160
I'm just curious.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.410 position:73%
Is it the font, or can you read the fine print?

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.690
Good, there you go.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.140
You guys are good.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.320 position:59%
And by the way, everything on all my
slides, I have hyperlinked everything.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.230 position:66%
So if you start clicking, you will end
up, you know, with the sources themselves.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.980 position:70%
And know that this session is being recorded,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.980
so you can certainly go back to
it and poke around some more.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.700
I'm scanning the chat.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.590
These are great.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.670 position:59%
So here's that primary source analysis
tool that I was making reference

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.440 position:70%
to that's available on the library's website.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.860 position:69%
For those of you who are not familiar with
it, questions about observing and reflecting

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.410 position:67%
and questioning are on the sheet and really
does serve as a nice way for students

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.920 position:64%
who are just getting used to working with
primary sources to focus their attention.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.430 position:63%
Let me tell you a little bit about this.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.540 position:61%
So here's the bibliographic record for
that piece of sheet music, and from it,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.490 position:67%
we do learn that it is a piece of sheet
music, and it was published at the tail end

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.620
of the 1800s, and it was published
by a company in Philadelphia.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.500
But when you look at this
particular bibliographic record,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.180 position:72%
there's a section I want you to note, and it's
right over here in this little area over here.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.870
It says that it's part of
a particular collection,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.060
and it says that it is part
of the "Songs of America.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.870 position:64%
I'm wondering if any of you have poked
around the "Songs of America" collection.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.830
I want to tell you about it.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.650 position:61%
It launched about a year ago, and it
is truly a treasure trove of resources.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.120 position:66%
In addition to sheet music like this one,
there are also recordings and short videos

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.210 position:61%
that feature curators from the library.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.970 position:61%
As the site says, it allows you to see
and hear American history through song.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.120 position:70%
And like I said, if any of you have
explored the "Songs of America," I'd love you

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.990 position:61%
to indicate in the chat what you found.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.420
My favorite item in the "Songs
of America" site falls

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.430
under a section called Articles
and Essays, right in this area.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.900 position:73%
There are these curator talks that I mentioned.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.100
They last about five minutes long.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.980 position:58%
They're videos that highlight special
items that are in the collection,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.960
and a couple of illustrated
songs are also there.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.600 position:66%
One of those illustrated songs, what
they've done is they've taken a recording,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.830 position:70%
and they have augmented it with images of
sources from across the library's collection.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.190
One that they have done is sort
of a sample, features a recording

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.910 position:58%
of a song about the Titanic disaster.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.390 position:69%
And like I said, it's accompanied by
related items from the library's collection.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.480 position:56%
It's really a great model of an
activity you might have students do.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.140
You know, I have a 12-year-old at
home, and she loves making movies.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.660 position:56%
And I keep thinking, "Oh, I gotta
have her do one, just as an example,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.710 position:63%
in the same vein as what they've done in
'Songs of America.'" It's really clever.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.250
I think you will enjoy that.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.610 position:58%
I encourage you to poke around there,
and see what else you can find.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:33.260 position:63%
During our Summer Teacher Institute
this past summer, we hold an open house,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.520 position:58%
and during the open house, colleagues
from across the library are invited

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.100
to meet our teachers, and share
ideas and resources with them.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.070 position:75%
The room is set up almost like an exhibit space,
and we do assign teachers a particular table

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.310 position:59%
to start their exploration at, so that
participants are evenly distributed,

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.400 position:64%
and all of our colleagues, you know,
have somebody to talk to from the get-go.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.700 position:66%
The teachers eventually do move around the
whole room, and each day of the institute,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:05.150 position:69%
we ask participants to complete an exit card
that describes a highlight of their day.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.850
This image, this drawing here,
it's a little index card.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.770
Imagine it being a little,
you know, three-by-five card.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.820 position:73%
It was drawn by one of our teachers, one of our
science teachers last year, describing a change

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.530 position:70%
of heart that she experienced when she met
one of our colleagues from the music division

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.140 position:70%
who told her about the Songs of America site.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.610
Note on the left, she says, "Silly
Kate," before she meets this guy.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.010
And she says, "My sheet says
to start at performing arts.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.570
Oh, I love music.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.800
Musical theater, dance, film, all
that, but I'm just going to smile,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.960
till I get to go to a real table,"
and then of course she meets James,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.670 position:70%
and James tells her about "Songs of America."

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.220 position:59%
And it occurs to her, "Duh, of course.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.930
Music fits everywhere.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.220
That's why I love it."

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:55.860 position:61%
And then she describes herself again as
smaller headed, less condescending Kate

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.560
after having chatted with the guy
from music, and I just love it.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.240 position:73%
It's -- how many of you already are using music
in your classrooms and finding great success?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.000
I hope many of you are.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.050
Scanning the chat area.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.220
These are great.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.050
Cheryl, thanks for including
[inaudible] including the links.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.060
These are great.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.870
Good observations, yeah.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.000
Awesome.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.980
All right.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.490
So I wanted to start this
session with the What's New?

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.810 position:69%
[inaudible] sheet music, not only to tell
you about the "Songs of America" collection,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.520 position:75%
but also they tell you about an effort involving
the library's educational outreach team

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.950
and a few of the professional
organizations that serve teachers.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:04.320 position:67%
We recently began writing a regular feature
in the journals of the National Association

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.350
for Music Education, the National
Council for the Social Studies,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.130 position:72%
and the National Science Teachers Association.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.230 position:70%
You're also writing periodically for other
publications, including Cobblestone Magazine,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.920 position:56%
which is published by Cricket Media.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.610 position:64%
The National History Day Teacher's Guide.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.050
You may have seen some of our
materials, as well as materials

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.990 position:66%
that are supporting the NCSS C3 framework.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.700
I hope you've noticed some of these
articles, and I am also curious

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.350
if there are other journals
we ought to be writing for.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.950 position:73%
Are any of you subscribing to other journals or
are members of other professional associations,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.380 position:75%
and you think, "Oh, the library absolutely needs

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.000
to have a presence amongst
some of these other resources"?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.300
Outstanding.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.270
Again, scanning this chat area.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.460
Stephanie, I'm delighted
that you're participating.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.100
I am anxious to hear what you
think of "Songs of America."

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.380
All right.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.650 position:58%
A couple of minutes ago, when we were
looking at this piece of sheet music,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.180 position:56%
I asked you to observe, reflect, and
question, and you may have noticed

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:26.670 position:66%
that I also asked you what do you see,
what do you think, and what do you wonder?

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.360
My team has been working on some
new primary source analysis tools.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.650
One of them is specifically
for very young students.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.280
We've been doing some pilot
testing with kindergarteners

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.570
through second graders using both
these words, the "what do you see?

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.160
What do you think?

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.300
What do you wonder?"

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.820
as well as related icons.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.720
And I'm not sure if up here on the
top right-hand side of my slide,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.760 position:58%
if you can really see this, but these
are some of the icons we were trying

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.500 position:70%
out with the five-year-olds, to ask them when
they see images, what do they mean to them.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:06.680 position:61%
And we were pretty happy that "think"
was something that came to their minds.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:13.070 position:63%
We've also just drafted an article about
this pilot testing for the NCSS journal,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.170 position:61%
"Social Studies and the Young Learner."

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.340 position:58%
We absolutely do believe that primary
sources are powerful teaching tools

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.690
across the grade spectrum.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.200
Oh, good. I'm glad that -- good.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.900
Thanks, Pete.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.780
Very good.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.180 position:70%
We also just released a new primary source --

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:48.790 position:70%
another primary source analysis tool
specifically focused on analyzing newspapers.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.000 position:67%
Again, the links are hot, so if you click
on it, you'll end up on the teacher's page,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.670
and you'll see the teacher's guide
as well as the student iteration.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.620
Speaking of newspapers, we came out
with the analysis tool just in time

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:13.660
for Chronicling America to
celebrate its one millionth page.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.550
Many of you already familiar
with Chronicling America.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.230 position:64%
It is really an amazing website that is
supported by both the Library of Congress

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.500 position:72%
and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:32.140 position:72%
What's new with Chronicling America is that
the site did just post its ten millionth page,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:38.470 position:70%
and on the site you can, like it says, you
can search America's historic newspaper pages

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:49.770 position:61%
from 1836 to 1922, or use the U.S.
newspaper directory to find information

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:55.740 position:61%
about American newspapers that were
published between 1690 and the present.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.060
Cindy, I'm with you.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.910 position:61%
I love, love, love Chronicling America.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:06.400
I encourage all of you to check out
tomorrow evening's 6:00 pm session

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.440
as part of our online conference.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.770 position:70%
It's entitled "Teaching with Historical
Newspapers," and it is being presented by one

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.950
of our colleagues who works
in the periodicals divisions

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.400 position:73%
at the library, describing Chronicling America.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.790 position:67%
Just for fun, when I was preparing this, I
did a search on October 27th, today's date,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:34.110 position:56%
and stumbled on this complete Sunday
magazine of the New York Tribune,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.170 position:58%
featuring Mark Twain's autobiography.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.510
I thought it was great.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.960 position:61%
Those of you who have used Chronicling,
and I'd love to hear your experiences.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.020 position:63%
If you want to chat in the type area
and describe some of the things that you

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.510
and your students have done,
that would be great.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.360 position:69%
Oh, and Rachel, thank you for the
suggestion about the school library journal.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.370
Great suggestions.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:04.360 position:75%
I find Chronicling America to be just
extraordinary, and what's amazing is when you're

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.800 position:75%
in Chronicling America, you can do full text
searches of what's in these historic newspapers.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.440 position:73%
And you can search on not only historical
events and famous people's names, but every now

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.580 position:64%
and then -- I was going to family reunion
earlier this summer, and I did a search

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.900
on our family name and the location
where some ancestors have lived

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:34.530 position:73%
and was really quite tickled to find some
pretty good information in these old newspapers

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.750
about family members, and
their travels, and so forth.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:46.640 position:75%
But the other day, I was in Chronicling America,
and in addition to the articles that we find

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.640 position:61%
in the newspaper -- old newspapers have
terrific advertisements, as you know,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:59.180 position:70%
and they have fabulous cartoons and images,
and I was doing a search on children's books,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:05.660 position:63%
and I came across this ad from the Omaha
Daily V. Anybody out there in Nebraska?

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.890
[inaudible] Omaha newspaper,
December the 8th, 1912.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.460 position:66%
And one of the books that it was promoting

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.930
for little folks was a book
called "The Rocket Book."

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.700
And I know it's really small.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.320
You probably can't see it here,
but in this little section.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.480
The book called "The Rocket
Book" was being promoted.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.880 position:59%
And the reason I got all excited about
it is because "The Rocket Book" is

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:42.380 position:75%
in the library's collection, and it has recently
been digitized, and it's available at read.gov,

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.470 position:66%
a special section of the library's website
that is supported by the library's center

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.590
for the book, along with many
other classic children's books.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.450 position:58%
I see that a bunch of you are typing,
so I'm going to type for a minute.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.840
The rest of you can write
down things about, "Oh, wow.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.410
That's fabulous.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.070 position:67%
I didn't know there were children's books."

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.000
There you go.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.790
Yes, digitized children's book.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.070
How did I not know this?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.940
I love it, Kristen.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.760
And there's lots of them.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.580
And not only are they available
through read.gov, they are also --

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:36.050
you got a new Library of
Congress presence on Pinterest,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.600 position:61%
and quite a few of the children's books
are also available through Pinterest,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.920 position:69%
and the formatting's a little bit different,
but the scans, of course, are the same.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.570
Oh, I love this.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.150 position:67%
You guys are liking these children's books.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.790
This is good.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:06.720 position:73%
So for -- we had a group of teachers at the
library a year ago April, and we had asked some

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.850 position:69%
of our colleagues who work in cataloguing of
rare children's books to do a little display

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:18.830 position:59%
for our teachers, to show them some of
these classic, rare children's books,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.380
and the teachers got very
excited, and we did too.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.130 position:63%
And of course, we all felt a little
deflated when we learned that, you know,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.540
we were having this great chance
to see these terrific objects.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.840 position:73%
But at that moment, they hadn't been digitized.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.190
And so I'm really tickled that
we can really share with you

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.500
that these are now available,
and there are more on the way.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.210 position:73%
Yes, they are absolutely available to download.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.120 position:73%
Everything that the library is digitizing in
terms of the classic children's books are books

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.150 position:67%
that are beyond copyright, so we don't have
to worry about any restrictions on them.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:57.110
And we're also trying to find some
new ways to make them available.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.210 position:64%
I mentioned earlier that we've been doing
some writing for [inaudible] Magazine,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.320 position:58%
which is an implant of Cricket Media,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.670
and Cricket Media has an app
that's available called Story Bug.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.970 position:66%
We've been having some great
conversations with them about getting some

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.570 position:72%
of these children's books available through
that app so that folks can use them, you know,

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:26.050 position:67%
the way we use electronic books, as opposed
to simply using them as scans on a website.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.170
So be on the lookout for that.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.900
We're hoping that that will
happen sooner rather than later.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.310
Very good.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.470
Again, scanning the chat here.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.550
Are the books available?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.530
Yes. Do they include illustrations
that may have been in these --

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.020 position:56%
yes, they are all there, full scans.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.580
They are absolutely the digital
images of every page of the book.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.530
This is great.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.970 position:61%
Miriam, I'm glad you're going to share.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.930 position:59%
Awesome. Maybe we will revitalize some
of these fabulous children's books.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.780
And I have to say, that "Rocket
Book" is really very clever.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.390
You're going to love it.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.900 position:66%
So that can be your bedtime story tonight.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.220
Hey, there's an idea, Cheryl.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.950
You could start doing bedtime
stories for teachers on webinars.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:20.930 position:59%
Okay, speaking of ebooks and social
media channels, this past school year,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:30.130 position:69%
we published 12 free student discovery sets.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.860
And these are ebooks available
through the iBook store.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.300 position:73%
They feature primary sources from the library's
collections that have all been included

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.000 position:61%
in our popular primary source sets that
are on the library's teachers page.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.750 position:75%
So if you're already familiar with the primary
source sets, the student discovery sets are kind

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:55.980 position:75%
of student iterations, and we know that a lot of
teachers were using the primary source sets in,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.620 position:73%
you know, some pretty tangible ways, where
teachers would download or print out the images

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.940 position:59%
of the specific documents they
intended to share with their students.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.680 position:63%
And we got more and more requests for
resources for teachers who were teaching

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.290 position:69%
in classrooms where tablets were being used.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.440 position:63%
So that's exactly what these ebooks are.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:23.360 position:59%
They are the same primary source sets,
only on the student discovery sets,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.980 position:61%
they don't include the teacher's guide.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.860 position:66%
So all they are are the documents that you
want your students to share and work with.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.340 position:72%
And we've added some functionality to the
ebooks that make them quite a bit interactive.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.500
We've got a function where students
can annotate the primary sources.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.260 position:58%
They can also take notes on them, and
they can capture what they're doing

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.510 position:70%
and email their notes back to their teachers.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:55.590 position:73%
We're very excited about these ebooks and fully
intend to be making more of them available.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:01.760 position:56%
Some of the titles include the Great
Depression, the Harlem Renaissance.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.320
There's one on symbols of America.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.450 position:61%
The most popular one, I'm happy to
report, is the one on the Constitution.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:16.950 position:66%
And we do hope to make them available for
Android devices in the coming school year.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.070
The reason we started with
the Apple platform was simply

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:28.320 position:72%
because the Apple iBooks author software was
a free download that we could experiment with.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.220 position:66%
Currently, there are 12 of them available.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.290
And if you just go on to the iBook
store and do a search on "Library

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:41.410
of Congress student discovery
set," all 12 of them will come up.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.460
Earlier, I mentioned the library
now has a Pinterest account.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.630
The library also supports
a bunch of Twitter feeds.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.560 position:63%
We have one especially for teachers, and
we hope that you are followers of ours.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.640 position:75%
Next month, we will be using Twitter for a game.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.710 position:73%
And I am really excited now that I see how
many of you are excited about children's books,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.480 position:72%
now I'm really excited to tell you about this,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.220
because the game that we're playing
has to do with children's books.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.390 position:58%
So next month, the month of November,
the library's CYAC program --

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:18.890 position:64%
and CYAC is one of those silly government
acronyms, but it stands for the Children

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.780 position:56%
and Young Adult Cataloguing Program.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.610 position:75%
They will be celebrating their 50th anniversary,

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.980
and we want to draw attention
to some of their work.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.690 position:61%
By the way, these are the catalogers of
the library who write the annotations

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.710
for children's books that
appear on card catalogs.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.950
So if you go to your library,
and you go onto your school --

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.150
into the card catalog, and you
identify a children's book,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.160
the description in the children's
book -- or, excuse me.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:54.470 position:72%
The description on the card that describes the
children's book, that description was written

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.770 position:61%
by one of our colleagues at the library
who works in this CYAC division.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:05.480 position:66%
So the game we're going to play on Twitter
is we're going to share the descriptions

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.250
of children's books, and we're
going to ask our followers to see

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.160 position:59%
if they can guess the children's book.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.440
So we're going to do two right now.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.240
We're going to see how you do.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.520 position:61%
So I'm going to give you some examples.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.410 position:69%
You're going to have to type in your answer.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.330
So here's the description.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.230
Mr. and Mrs. Mallard proudly
return to their home

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.060
in the Boston public garden
with their eight offspring.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.230
Yes, that book.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.020
Multiple attendees are typing.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.620
I love that.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.230
Yay, Rachel.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.330
"Make Way for Ducklings."

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.230
Alison, you got it.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.620
Annette, you got it.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.780
Rebecca, you got it.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.370
I love this.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.840 position:64%
I have a feeling Carol's about to get it.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.820
This is terrific.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.180
Yes, "Make Way for Ducklings."

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.400
It was written by Robert
McCloskey and published in 1941.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.500
All right, we got another one.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.250 position:58%
Again, the description written by
one of our colleagues at the library.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.310 position:73%
When a bus driver takes a break from his route,

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.810
a very unlikely volunteer
springs up to take his place.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.010
Any guesses?

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.580 position:73%
When a bus driver takes a break from his route,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.780
a very unlikely volunteer
springs up to take his place.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.590
Yes. Margaret and Annette.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.910
[laughter] This is great.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:33.350 position:70%
What I love about this is those of us who've
had children in the last, you know, 20 years,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.340 position:73%
we know our children's books well, I think,
and we certainly have memories of them as well.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.650 position:73%
But "Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus" is
truly a classic, written by Mo Willems in 2003.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.800
And if you haven't read it,
I highly recommend it.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.340
So how many of you are going
to play our Twitter game?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.100 position:75%
We're going to do it the first week in November.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.190
This is great.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.260
Cheryl, we're learning a
lot about our audience here.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.720
I love this.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.470
This is great.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.800
Okay. And I'm going to keep going.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.120 position:73%
So we've been talking about ebooks and Twitter,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.670
and now I can tell you a
little bit about YouTube.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.000
The Library of Congress also
has a YouTube channel.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.800 position:63%
Some of the content, you may be familiar

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.150 position:56%
with from the library's professional
development modules

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.550
on the teacher's page are
also now available on YouTube.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.570 position:59%
We are adding some curator talks,
like this one from a colleague of ours

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.370
in the geography and math division.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.810 position:67%
And after this session is over, I encourage
you to check out what Mike has to say.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:40.980 position:67%
I think you'll enjoy what he talks about in
a really interesting World War Two era map.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.550 position:66%
On the library's YouTube channel, you will
also find a great deal of content related

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:54.580 position:63%
to a recent exhibition at the library
related to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.060
And this reminds me of another new
resource on the library's website,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.330
and that new resource is the
Civil Rights History Project.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.420 position:64%
And I'm going to pause for just a second,
because there's a lot going on over here

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.650 position:75%
in the chat I want to make sure I'm not missing.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.990
Oh, good. You guys are all
going to play the Twitter game.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.850
I love it.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.370
I love it.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:20.170
[laughter] I love -- Rebecca,
I kind of feel like you do.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:25.640 position:61%
I'm not -- I have to say we use Twitter
more for work than personal accounts.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.930
This is great.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.540 position:58%
But Kristen, you're absolutely right.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.280 position:56%
It is a great place for professional
development.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:38.520 position:61%
Okay. And then Cheryl's telling me I've
only got, like, 12 minutes to talk,

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.800 position:66%
so I'm going to have to speed up, I guess.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.920
Okay, this is great.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.910 position:66%
Okay, so the Civil Rights History Project.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:52.700
It features oral histories of
individuals who were involved

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.840 position:63%
with the Civil Rights Movement during
the 1950s and '60s in the United States.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.220 position:75%
Colleagues of ours from the library's American
Folklife Center have been working in partnership

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.190 position:56%
with colleagues from the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.110 position:72%
of African American History and Culture, the
one that's going to open in a couple of years,

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.480
to gather these interviews
and make them available.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.520 position:72%
What I really love about this site is that all

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.670
of the interviews have transcripts
that are keyword searchable.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.280 position:59%
And using such resources in the
classroom is really just like bringing

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.360
in a guest speaker in so many ways.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.970 position:72%
If you do a search in the Civil Rights History
Project on individual names, or on locations,

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:45.020 position:59%
or on specific dates, or just keywords
that, you know, you go through --

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.480 position:61%
you know you've got maybe three whole
days to teach the Civil Rights movement

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.620 position:69%
in a U.S. history class, and you really want
to hit some high points, but you want to do

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.140
in a way that is meaningful,
and substantive, and powerful.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.040
These voices are absolutely that.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:06.930
When I was in the classroom, I used
to love bringing in guest speakers,

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:12.240 position:56%
and when I look at these interviews,
I just think how extraordinary it is

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.580 position:66%
that these recordings have been made and
that we really can bring these individuals

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.700
into our classrooms.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:29.470 position:63%
The project, the American Folklife
Center, continually is adding interviews

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:35.180 position:66%
to this project, and I really -- you know,
I think there's a tendency in so many

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.650 position:64%
of our history classes, where we focus on
-- you know, we all know the big names,

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.800 position:75%
but we don't know the lesser known participants.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.600
That's one of the things I
really appreciate this site,

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.600 position:75%
is some of these people we've heard of, and some
of these people, we've never heard of before,

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.740
but the role that they played in
the movement is really significant.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.600
The recordings, Karen, they range.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:04.380 position:56%
Some of them are two hours long, and
some of them are much more brief.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.260
That's the thing that I'm saying.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.070
They all have transcriptions
that are keyword searchable.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:14.690 position:67%
So if you -- for example, you want to share
with your students a description of things

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.520 position:61%
that happened, you know, in Selma, you
could just simply do a search on Selma,

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.650
and it'll narrow down for you those
individuals who speak, you know,

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.770
specifically about events in Selma.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:33.440
So there are ways to widdle
down the amount of time.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:44.360 position:73%
Also, in the Articles and Essays section of
the site, some of our colleagues have done some

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.280 position:61%
of that work for us, where they have
told us, "Hey, you might want to listen

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.740
to this particular recording
if you're interested in this."

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.080
Again, that helps.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.110 position:72%
Of course, you can always send your students
to these sites, and ask them to find excerpts.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.600
And I guarantee you, they will
get sucked in to listening to more

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.190 position:70%
than simply what they've been assigned to do,

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:11.730
because these recordings
really are very powerful.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.770 position:63%
It's hard to not continue watching them.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.980
Again, I'm scanning here.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.670
Yes, Pete, you're exactly right.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:27.660 position:72%
The American Folklife Center, one of the --
what you're thinking of is the StoryCorps app,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.410 position:64%
and you may have heard about that on NPR.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.210 position:75%
The -- I'm happy to tell you about it right now.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:39.510 position:61%
The StoryCorps recordings do make their
way to the Library of Congress by way

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.570 position:73%
of the American Folklife Center, and StoryCorps
is encouraging everyone this Thanksgiving

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.010
to use their new app and
interview family members

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:55.020 position:58%
over the Thanksgiving Day dinner
table, and it really is a great idea.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.100
I think I may actually be roping
my parents into doing that,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.560 position:75%
so I'll just give them a heads-up at some point.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.360
Excellent.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.220
All right.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.760
So back to the topic of these
first-hand accounts.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.820 position:70%
The Rosa Parks collection came to the Library
of Congress last November, and our colleagues

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.890 position:75%
who work in prints and photographs, and who work

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.090
in the manuscript division
have been working really hard

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:26.420
to get these materials processed
and ready for researchers.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.580 position:63%
Right now the photographs and the
manuscripts are available to researchers

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:36.200
in the reading rooms, and all of
the materials are being digitized.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.670 position:59%
We did a Summer Teacher Institute this
past summer, focused on civil rights.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.530 position:70%
And we had hoped that, of course, the whole
collection would have been digitized in time,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.530 position:56%
and that was a little too ambitious.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:53.680
But fortunately, we were able to
describe what our real hopes were,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.710 position:56%
and we were able to get a subset of
the much larger collection available

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.440
as a special primary source set.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.590
These materials all come from
the Rosa Parks collection.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.070
This particular letter that
begins -- it's not a letter.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:17.230 position:63%
It's a recollection of Rosa Parks about
what happened to her in December of 1955

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.020 position:73%
at the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.560 position:64%
And she writes, "I had been pushed around
all my life, and I felt at this moment

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.560
that I couldn't take it anymore."

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.590 position:69%
And she goes on and describes what happened.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.870
And it is her first-hand
account, and it just tremendous.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:38.680 position:70%
If you go to that particular link, what
you'll get is a small collection of materials

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.960 position:69%
that we identified this summer and used with
our Summer Teacher Institute participants.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.920 position:61%
They are just a small fraction of what
will ultimately be made available right

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.510
around Rosa Parks' birthday
at the beginning of February,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:59.120
so be on the lookout for
an announcement about that.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.410
Very good.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.450 position:56%
Oh, and I love the way this
technology works, because, you know,

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.960 position:66%
Cheryl's over there having this great
conversation, and Kristen's sharing ideas.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.210
This is good, very good.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:09.800
Some more things.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.990 position:64%
And I know I'm running low on time, so
I'm going to try to speed it up a little.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.020 position:72%
So I've mentioned our Summer Teacher
Institutes a couple of times during this talk.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.920 position:72%
These images do a good job of illustrating
some of the elements of all of our institutes.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.460
We try to get our teachers up close
and personal with the collections.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.250 position:73%
That image at the top are some science teachers

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.860
who are pretty much blown
away by primary sources.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.760 position:69%
And I have to say, I just love that, because
some of you who know me know that I'm trying

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.850 position:56%
to infiltrate science classes with
good history, and we have colleagues

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.020 position:69%
who are absolutely onboard with this effort.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:49.560 position:70%
I think, at that moment, our colleague Mark
Dimunation was showing the science teachers a

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.980 position:67%
Galileo item from the rare book collection.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.820
You also see in those images our
teachers working collaboratively,

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.980
working on an activity there
that involves some maps.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.970
And we do lots of sharing.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:13.680 position:64%
And there are extraordinary opportunities
just to connect with other teachers,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:19.380 position:69%
and to learn about the library's resources
and some strategies to use in the classroom.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.070
We learn so much from one another.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.410
I'm going to keep moving.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.380
Okay, so here, here, this
is a teacher last summer.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.940
I love these index cards.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.970 position:69%
This was another teacher who was describing
what the Summer Teacher Institute experience

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.290 position:58%
and meeting all of these colleagues
from around the institution was like.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:42.260 position:63%
She said, "If I could draw an
artichoke, that would be my illustration

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.250
of the gallery of presenters today.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:50.670 position:72%
Layer after layer of amazing, and we are still
not at the heart of the Library of Congress.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.720
So many layers."

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.040
I really like that.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.980
And what's new.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:05.260 position:66%
I also want to emphasize that not only
are summer programs for teachers available

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.730 position:64%
from the library in D.C., but year round,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.950 position:59%
professional development opportunities
are available from our teaching

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.940
with Primary Sources partners
around the country.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.870
If you visit loc.gov/teachers/tps.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:24.200
Or you just click on these
links, because they all work.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.160 position:64%
[chuckles] You can find out what is
available near you from our 28th Teaching

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:36.520 position:64%
with Primary Sources consortium partners,
who are located in 17 different states.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.290
Keep in mind that even though there
may not be somebody in your state,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.790 position:67%
that doesn't mean they won't work with you.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.320
They absolutely will.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.980
There are summer opportunities.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.710 position:73%
There are during-the-school-year opportunities.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:58.800 position:73%
Each one of our partners has website resources,
and many of them do webinars of their own.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:05.090 position:66%
There are often videos and other resources
that I encourage you to take advantage of.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:15.310 position:66%
This past year, the library received some
sort of surprise funding to make available

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:22.570 position:66%
through a grant procedure to organizations
who would make online interactive

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:28.710
and mobile apps related to
Congress and civic participation.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.570
We just announced three winners
of those grants last month,

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.930
and we're real excited to
see what they come up with.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:42.740 position:59%
Their grants will span over a two-year
period, and during those two years --

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:49.060 position:67%
by the end of the two years, they will have
created apps for use in K to 12 classrooms,

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.960
again, that focus on Congress
and civic participation.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.810
One of the grantees, by the
way -- I should announce them.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.450 position:66%
One of them is at George Mason University.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.480 position:58%
One is the University of Indiana's
Center for Representative Government.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.160 position:58%
And the third is Muzzy Lane Software.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.950 position:67%
And what we were so excited about with
these grantees is that they are all working

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:18.460 position:69%
in partnership with other organizations that
are really committed to civic education.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.570
So all of them, you know.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.320 position:75%
Some of them are working with Circle [phonetic].

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.650
Some of them are working
with the Center for Civic Ed.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.840
Some of them are working
with National History Day.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.790
Some of them are working
with pre-service teachers.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:34.880 position:69%
Others are working with pre-service
teachers specifically focused on elementary.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.570 position:58%
I mean, we just -- we're real excited
about the strength of these proposals

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:47.210 position:73%
and what we think will come out of them, simply
because there's so many potential partners.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:52.240
In the same vein of civic
education, congress.gov.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.500 position:56%
I know lots of you are familiar with
THOMAS, and I know that you know

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.600
that congress.gov is replacing
the THOMAS website.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.610
It seems as though every
month or every other month,

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:12.590 position:69%
our colleagues in our web services division,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.340
they will come up with something
new in congress.gov.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.490 position:70%
And we will hear about it, and we'll be like,
"Oh, can't wait to tell teachers about this.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:20.650
This is really neat."

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:27.840 position:75%
I circled one little section, only because we
often mention it to teachers, and they say, "Oh,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.710
I've been using congress.gov, but
I didn't realize that was here."

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:38.580 position:70%
So what I have circled on the site is some
videos that are colleagues in the Law Library

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.520 position:67%
and in our web services division have
created related to the legislative process.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.880
So if you're looking for
resources or ways to, you know --

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.380
how to approach how a bill becomes
a law, that's another resource.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.680
Congress.gov has a function.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.340 position:75%
So if you're on the website, and you do a search
on current legislation, and you just do a search

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.760 position:64%
on something like healthcare, or campaign
finance reform, or the environment,

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.110 position:58%
or you're going to pick your subject,
you know, what will come up is a page

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.710 position:72%
that will list all of the current legislation.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.490 position:63%
And when you select one piece of current
legislation, you can follow that piece

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.600
of legislation through the process.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:26.070 position:59%
And there's a bill tracker that really
-- and I know this may sound horrible,

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.150 position:56%
but it's really true, and I love it.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.160 position:69%
It reminds me of the Domino's pizza tracker.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.810 position:69%
So when a bill is introduced, it tells me
that it's introduced, and then it goes into,

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.950 position:64%
you know, it was introduced in the House.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.000
It passes the House.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.030
It goes to a committee.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.560
It makes its way -- the whole
process is identified,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.370
and if you've got your students
following pieces of legislation,

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.530 position:64%
it's really a terrific resource for that.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:56.130 position:73%
When you're on a piece of legislation's site,
you have a terrific encapsulation of that piece

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:03.410 position:72%
of legislation, a very nice abbreviated
version, a synopsis of the bill, is available.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.100 position:66%
And another resource that, again, it's new

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.240 position:73%
to congress.gov is now the entire Congressional
record is available through congress.gov,

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.640 position:69%
and you can search the Congressional record,
again, by topic, by date, and so forth.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.330 position:66%
And we had a couple of our teachers during
the Summer Teacher Institute mentioned

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.500 position:72%
in the Congressional record this summer, and
we all got a kick out of seeing them in there,

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.800
and we could use them as an example

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:35.330 position:58%
of what fascinating information you
can find in the Congressional record.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:42.790 position:72%
We have two teachers in residence working with
our team this year, and they are dynamite.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:46.380 position:69%
Up on the top right-hand side is Trey Smith.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.610
He's a science teacher from
the Philadelphia area.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:55.460 position:56%
And Tom Bober is on the left, and
he is an elementary school librarian

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.650
from Clayton, Missouri.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.900 position:59%
And they are both absolutely terrific.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.810
Tom is focusing his attention
on audio-visual resources,

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.140
and Trey is focusing his
attention on science resources.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:11.220
And we will certainly have another
teacher in residence opportunity

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:18.710 position:70%
for the 2016/17 school year, and we will make
an announcement about that probably right

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:26.110 position:58%
around early January, so please be
on the lookout for that announcement.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.910 position:56%
The library has a new poet laureate.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.050
He has a fabulous effort underway.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:41.160 position:66%
His project, "La Case de Colores," invites
all Americans to contribute a verse

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.600 position:72%
to an epic poem about the American experience.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.820 position:56%
Again, another terrific opportunity,
brand new from the library.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.680 position:59%
As of, I think, two weeks ago, the
Alan Lomax collection is now available

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.230
on the library's website.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.780 position:56%
This particular object is a piece
of correspondence from Woody Guthrie

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.280
to Alan Lomax that caught my eye.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:13.020 position:72%
And if you want to continue finding out what's
new at the library, be sure to go to loc.gov,

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.790 position:56%
and on the far left-hand side,
where it says News from the Library,

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:23.270 position:69%
you can just scan press releases almost on a
daily basis to find out what new collections

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.800 position:56%
and new opportunities are available.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.750
And I see what Marcy is suggesting.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.200 position:56%
She wants me to see that link again.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.520 position:56%
Yes, the link for the poet laureate.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.820 position:70%
If you just go to loc.gov poetry, that'll get
you straight to Juan Felipe Herrera's site

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:44.930 position:64%
and the "La Case de Colores" opportunity.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:51.310 position:67%
And again, this entire presentation will be
available as a recording in just a couple

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:56.190
of days, so you can certainly
come back and refer to it as well.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.900
Finally, we are doing lots of
collaborating at the library.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:05.290 position:63%
We have a small staff, but we work very
effectively with partners on the outside

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:12.150 position:69%
who have very similar missions to our own of
reaching teachers w high-quality resources

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:17.160 position:58%
and opportunities, including teaching
tolerance and National History Day,

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.610 position:67%
the Civic Renewal Network, Share My Lesson.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.060 position:69%
And down there, you see National Geographic.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.290 position:59%
We're going to work with colleagues at
National Geographic on a special issue

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:32.050
of social ed related to teaching
geography with Primary Sources

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.280 position:66%
that we hope you'll be on the lookout for.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.350
&gt;&gt; So thank you everyone for
joining, for participating,

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:39.360 position:63%
for the lively and wonderful discussion.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.600
Thank you Lee Ann for such a
rich and wonderful speedy tour

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.750 position:75%
through what's new from the Library of Congress.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.690
We have a three-question survey.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.080 position:56%
The link on the screen is hot, and
I'm pushing it out through the chat.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.500 position:59%
It does help us shape our programming,

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.660
if you could take the time to
answer those three questions.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:07.930 position:69%
For completing this session, you have earned
a certificate for one instructional hour,

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:13.480 position:66%
and look for an email within five business
days with directions to access that.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.860
Thank you so much for joining,
and this session is ended.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.950
Bye bye, everybody.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much everyone.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:22.340
This was fun.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:26.450 position:64%
I admire your tenacity, sticking with us.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.860
Thanks.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.870
