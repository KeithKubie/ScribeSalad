pillar of the neo-marxist strategy is to
demographically replace the indigenous

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
demographically replace the indigenous
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.020
demographically replace the indigenous
people of Europe London it's less than

people of Europe London it's less than
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.340
people of Europe London it's less than
half ethnically English okay so let's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
half ethnically English okay so let's
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.130
half ethnically English okay so let's
take that question apart first of all it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
take that question apart first of all it
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140
take that question apart first of all it
isn't self-evident to me that it is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
isn't self-evident to me that it is
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.380
isn't self-evident to me that it is
specifically a neo-marxist strategy to

specifically a neo-marxist strategy to
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.120

demographically replace the indigenous
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.939
demographically replace the indigenous
peoples of Europe and I don't think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
peoples of Europe and I don't think
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009
peoples of Europe and I don't think
that's the strategy anyways even if

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
that's the strategy anyways even if
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389
that's the strategy anyways even if
that's the outcome because you have to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
that's the outcome because you have to
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.229
that's the outcome because you have to
distinguish between strategy and outcome

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239
distinguish between strategy and outcome
 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.880
distinguish between strategy and outcome
the strategy and principle is to bring

the strategy and principle is to bring
in immigrants to balance out declining

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
in immigrants to balance out declining

birthrate now I'm not saying I agree

birthrate now I'm not saying I agree

birthrate now I'm not saying I agree
with that I'm just saying that that's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
with that I'm just saying that that's
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.510
with that I'm just saying that that's
what the strategy is and then the next

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
what the strategy is and then the next
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540
what the strategy is and then the next
part of the question is predicated on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
part of the question is predicated on
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510
part of the question is predicated on
the assumption that identitarian ISM is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
the assumption that identitarian ISM is
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.920
the assumption that identitarian ISM is
necessarily the answer to the problem of

necessarily the answer to the problem of
 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.260
necessarily the answer to the problem of
the problem that's being identified

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
the problem that's being identified
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090
