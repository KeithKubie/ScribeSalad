00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
Tom: We tend to think that numbers are a universal language

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.660
like if there was a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.760
extraterrestrial single the hit Earth, that
it would start with one plus one is two

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.190
and it would work up from there and work
from there and work up from there and then eventually

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.540
we're building a machine

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.279
opens a wormhole to Vega. And that's a really good idea

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.570
for formal mathematics and formal logic
it might work...

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.119
but the way that humans actually use
numbers and we talk to each other it is not

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.210
nearly as universal as you might think

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.400
I mean I should say I'm a linguist not a
mathematician. I've kind of moved over to numberphile

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.440
briefly here but to my background's
linguistics and the number of ways

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.190
that humans use numbers... The number of ways
that humans use numbers? Doesn't even make sense...

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.489
And you might say okay this there's some weird
examples where

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.180
English is base 10, but it's not
entirely because we still have dozen

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.789
which is based 12, we still have Gross,
which is 12 times 12, which is 144

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.739
that's all base 12 that's duo-decimal
we still have 'score' in the language

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.899
in the language, we still have 'four score and
seven years ago' with Abraham Lincoln

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:03.989
he meant eighty-seven

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.969
but 'four score and seven' resonates because we used to have base 20 counting. We used to have

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.010
vigesimal, and that still resonates well in the language today. We still have all of that.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.920
I looked up specifically one linguist
called Glendon Lean who spent

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.479
twenty years touring round Papua New
Guinea, Oceania, all kind of south

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.170
eastern areas he found languages that were base 6. He found languages that were base 15.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.690
He found all sorts of outliers that you would find if you have isolated populations on isolated islands.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.310
They're not that weird though. I mean you've done a
French video before

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.909
right you have 'quatre vingt sept' which is
four 20s &amp; seven.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.310
That's strange before you even get

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.689
outside Europe. Hindi is so
irregular

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.809
that for the numbers 1 to 100 you
essentially have a hundred different words.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.930
There is a pattern in there behind them
but the forms are so irregular and they change so

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.830
much that you basically have to learn a  hundred
different words.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.540
Danish ... Danish is an astonishing one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.610
the Danish number for 58 is

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.240
I'm totally not going to pronounce this
correctly

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.730
'otteoghalvtreds' I think I apologize
to the people of Denmark

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.220
'otte' is eight, that's easy, I think the 'o' is in there as well

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.650
ignore the 'g', that's just to link things together, and then you've got this, which is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.220
'halvtreds' -- 'half third'

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.020
now hang on, that's meant to mean 'fifty'
so what's going on there?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.760
so dot is the freebie action that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.940
so that is an abbreviation, it's 'halvtredsindstyve'

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.560
again I'm sorry but that is 'half thrice times 20'

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.410
which still doesn't make any sense
because how can you manage, half times three times ...

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.740
how does that make fifty?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.660
well then you get another catch because this
bit here 'half thrice' is like Roman numerals

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:03.570
what you got there is 'half away from thrice'
this literally means 3 minus 1/2 times 20

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.740
which if you actually do the maths is
two-and-a-half times twenty which is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.750
50 so you finally have 58 you have

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.650
half thrice two-and-a-half times twenty plus eight, 
58

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.400
so the complete opposite end of the scale is Tonga. 
Which is wonderful

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.120
there there are a few more formal
ways you can say them but essentially if

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.830
you're saying

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.730
a really complex number like 771,216

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.230
you say the numbers for 7 7 1 2 1 6

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.660
in order that's it. It is as simple as
that you just say the numbers

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.950
for one thing I suspect most of your viewers will think
is that at least we've agreed on

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
Arabic numerals now. At least we've
we've got the standard

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.750
5, 6, 7, 8 standard 0 to 9

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.900
that everyone uses. Ehm, Not Quite

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.769
someone languages, particularly those in India and China still use

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.230
their own numeral system particularly for formal things 
like we still use Roman numerals

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.000
for clock faces they might use them in similar places 
Brady: And the SuperBowl

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.080
Tom: And the SuperBowl!  Of course, yes. 
although SuperBowl 50

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.940
is going to be SuperBowl 50 (five zero)  
because Super Bowl L

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.950
doesn't really sound all that impressive. 
There's a few other obvious

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.150
points mainland Europe

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.360
uses a comma for the decimal point and a
full stop

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.140
to separate thousands 
UK and US are the other way around

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.630
If you're using currency then there are a whole
load a different ways to say

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.700
'and no cents' you might put a slash. You might put a comma and a slash, you might put

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.020
dot double '0'. And then there's the big one 'cos
I said

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.750
thousands separator a while ago and
that's not universal either

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.390
and I really got surprised by this when I looked it up

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.690
there is not a universal thing for how
many digits

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.190
should be in each group if you go to
South Asia

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.270
to India to Pakistan to areas around there

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.940
you will find they don't use, I mean they
do, they can use that as well but

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.200
frequently the system that is used is the 'crore' and the 'lakh'

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.690
watch a British guy try and explain
'crore' and 'lakh'

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:15.070
your lack is 10^5 and your crore is 10^7,
and here's the thing

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.710
they are written like this

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.410
your least significant group is three
digits

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.790
and each group that's more significant than
that is two

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.370
so you can have a lakh crore,
which is going to be 10^12

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.230
and watch me mess this up

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:50.350
that's 5, that's 7, that's 9, that's 11
which is going to be written like that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.260
that's a trillion and there's no reason why that should be a trillion instead of a lakh crore

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.120
its just what we happen to decide

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.400
you might be able to argue that constant threes is

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.650
maybe a bit more understandable but
that's coming from a really English

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.330
perspective. I would be absolutely certain
that someone who grew up with this system

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.890
would have just as good a reason why
theirs is more logical

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.250
let's say all written spoken language
fails, let's say you have

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.750
someone who you have about absolutely nothing in
common with at all

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.580
at least you can gesture. At least you can say, you
know, 8, 9 these are ... no

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.020
... no. I even thought that was universal

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.039
until someone I know came back from China

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.639
and told me that if you are going to
be in certain regions in China

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.960
you are going to be using hand gestures
that are complete different

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.020
so you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.300
I'm gonna try this, and I know someone in the comments is gonna call me out for hand positions

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.009
being a little wrong, but it is roughly

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.720
6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.029
or sometimes 10 are which are based

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.099
on the shapes of the original Chinese
characters for those numbers

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.289
that kinda blew me away but then I found

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.830
the paper from Glendon Lean I mentioned right at
the start about

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.390
Papua New Guinea and languages in that area
who use a brilliant thing called a

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.669
body count tally system so they will go

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.580
1, 2, 3,4 5, 6

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.349
7, 8, 9, 10

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:28.250
and then depending on which language
it will follow different points around the face

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.550
of it might go across and down the other side

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.710
okay there are a lot differences between
languages but the majority who use that system?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.089
base 27 because you have 27 points that
that they refer to

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.960
to keep tally. We're not going to be
doing advanced calculus in this

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.610
we're going to be you know during
everyday conversations but that means

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.409
you can do things like

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:51.500
one man and here. 37.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.250
you can start keeping tally with things and
that's wonderful because that

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.430
is something but I hadn't even thought

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.649
of. I haven't even come up with
before reading about it that wasn't

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.599
something that my

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:07.029
my mind was open to. 
What I wanted to do here, kind of a grand finale,

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:11.110
was to look at what science fiction
writers have done with alien languages

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.629
but they're nowhere even close to that. I
looked up

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:19.560
Klingon, from Star Trek
Klingon on is base 10

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.919
with words for thousands and millions

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.229
it's clearly written by an English
speaker and it's more English

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:29.349
and more normal for us

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:31.510
for those with over here than

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.890
half the languages i've talked about! And it's meant to be an alien species and I know

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.680
in Star Trek they're all meant to have come from
a common ancestor but

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.630
we did come from a common ancestor and
we've got much

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.910
much weirder numbers in our own

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.380
human speech than science fiction has ever come up with. I think that's one of the

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.530
best things about linguistics, about
being human,

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.440
about all of this is that someone on the
other side the world

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.330
something that they will consider
absolutely normal

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.190
can completely blow your mind

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.500
