00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.083
LES: So welcome to our hangout
for Google TV. Let's shoot.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.861
I'll start with Will.

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.087
We know that he's
gonna at least

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:25.161
have a technical question.

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.230
WILL: Oh.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.510
LES: Or not.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.720
I can move on.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.910
WILL: I tried to put marketing
questions in my list today.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.505
LES: OK, that's cool.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:38.780
WILL: Let me get to your post.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.900
LES: OK, maybe I can get
reminded [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.320
scroll down there too.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:59.130
Let's see, you asked
app review hangout?

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.030
WILL: Oh yeah, that was just me
trying to promote myself.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.665
We were thinking with Google TV
friends about doing an app

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:09.940
review, hangout type of thing.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.345
For developers who wanted to
just talk about their app.

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:15.520
Kinda patterned after,
there's an Android

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.490
developer one that I saw.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.046
It started last Friday.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.180
It looked pretty cool.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.130
And it would be fun to do one
specifically for Google TV, so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.410
that was just me saying,
wondering if anyone would be

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.300
interested to talk to myself
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.050
Chris.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.590
OSAMA: That's a good idea.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.150
Maybe we should theme
one of these

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.300
hangouts as an app review.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.140
LES: Yeah, cause we do app
reviews pretty regularly too.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.270
So we could give some guidance
and some help.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.010
WILL: Cool.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.790
LES: And maybe that's what
Christian could do next week

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.940
while I'm away.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.560
WILL: Sounds good.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.460
OSAMA: Awesome.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.320
LES: OK, let's see.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.520
I see Chris on there,
so he could probably

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.470
have similar stuff.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.320
And I hate my cursor.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.110
Ah, cool.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.180
All right, then I'm gonna
go to the next person.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.185
Magnus, you have a question?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.480
Or not.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.730
OK.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.120
Chris, do you have
any questions?

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:35.300
CHRIS: Just one.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.150
It's pretty much back to the
market issues again.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.740
Two things.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.210
One is still the downloading of
the apps or the uploading

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.910
of the apps just doesn't work.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.270
And the other one is you can't
leave a review of an app from

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.880
the Google TV. At least
I can't, using

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.080
the Logitech reviews.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.226
It just doesn't work.

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:03.080
LES: Does it error out, or?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.310
CHRIS: No.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.220
I can't enter anything into the
boxes, and then when I do

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.020
it's all capitals.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.950
And if I mess up, there's no way
to backspace, delete the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.110
text, so it's just there.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.770
And I either have to cancel, and
if I submit it, it's just

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.350
gonna look all messed up.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.760
But that may be just
on my device.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.170
So I have to go back onto the
laptop, go into the market,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.620
leave a review that way.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.936
I can't do it through the TV.

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:36.590
LES: OK, we know people
are doing reviews.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.790
You're welcome to join us, AK.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.040
Yes, come on in.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.764
OK, so I'll take a look.

00:03:46.764 --> 00:03:49.195
I don't think we've recieved
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.612
like that before.

00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:59.960
But, yeah, and you wouldn't
have a Sony

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.885
box or just a Review?

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:03.620
CHRIS: Just the Review.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.420
LES: OK.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.108
Cool.

00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:09.730
All right.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.610
Then we'll take a look.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.340
That's a problem in the market
that you can't leave reviews

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.590
on a Review.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.800
So I'll move on to Dustin.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.410
DUSTIN: OK, my question was in
regards to the in-app billing.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.590
And I'd like to switch from the
developer account on the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.230
Review over to the test account
that we set up, but I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.870
don't see an easy way of doing
that without factory resetting

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.440
the device.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.710
LES: Can't you just add another
account and use that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.490
for your market account?

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.930
You go into Settings, then
Accounts, and Add Account.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.980
OSAMA: And then in market--

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.880
DUSTIN: Honestly, I haven't
tried, so--

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640
OSAMA: You can switch
the primary account.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.220
LES: Yeah.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.560
That would be how you'd do it.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.680
DUSTIN: OK.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.355
Great, thanks.

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:01.800
LES: OK.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.200
Cool.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.560
DUSTIN: Easy.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.700
LES: Yeah.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.900
Brian, you're next.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.150
Do you have a question?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.050
OK.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.120
You can type it into the
chat window too.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.873
And Brad had a couple points
and questions.

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:24.970
BRAD: Hey guys, it's Brad
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.720
Sorry it's kind of dark.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.740
But I guess my first question
was obviously at some point,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.450
we're gonna see whatever you
want to call it, fragmentation

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.860
or units left behind.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.100
Is that going to happen with the
Review on 3.2 or is that

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.860
gonna get updated?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.280
I know you can't tell us when,
and I know there's politics

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.430
and other things involved
in that.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.010
But is it gonna see the
HLS capability--

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.805
LES: Yes.

00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:54.960
BRAD: That we have now?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.980
LES: Yeah, the reviews
will see HLS.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.100
BRAD: OK.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.960
So they're gonna get the
full 3.2 update?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.620
LES: Yes.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.170
BRAD: OK.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.110
So obviously that brings some
functionality that I know a

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.000
lot of Review users
will find useful.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.925
Obviously with, for streaming
video and things that'll bring

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:17.326
a lot of capability.

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:18.604
LES: Oh yeah.

00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:19.930
BRAD: So that's pretty
important.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.340
LES: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.990
BRAD: I had another question
and I don't

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.960
remember what it is now.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.070
It's been a couple days.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.120
LES: OK, that's cool.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.075
We'll come back.

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:27.310
BRAD: But that's really great.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.435
I appreciate you letting
us know that

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:30.390
that will get updated.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.940
CHRISTIAN: Have you mentioned
the SDK level, 12, 13?

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.740
BRAD: Oh!

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.630
I asked something about the--

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.234
I'm sorry, it was
about the NDK.

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.970
LES: I have at times.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.800
Yes sure, there's no NDK
for now and not for the

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.116
foreseeable future.

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:51.366
BRAD: OK.

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:56.720
LES: Is there anything else
you are concerned

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.790
about the NDK about?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.260
BRAD: Well, I guess my question
was that it appeared

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.200
that OnLive may have used some
kind of NDK functionality to

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.770
write their app.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.180
And I could be wrong, is
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] what I said.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.570
LES: There are some people who
have figured out how to get

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:22.254
native code on Google TV.
And they are in market.

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:24.559
It is--

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:25.710
CHRISTIAN: So, I mean--

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.360
LES: not compatible with
anything, and there's no

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.270
guarantees.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.133
And it will break soon.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:33.040
BRAD: OK.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.100
OSAMA: As with any undocumented
APIs, we

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.860
recommend you don't use them.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.350
And we may change those at any
point, so your apps may break.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.150
BRAD: That's understood.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.280
LES: The app will break.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.920
We actually know
that as a fact.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.820
BRAD: Yeah, I guess the only
reason I ask, Les, is because

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.290
I know that sometimes some
developers get early access to

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.480
things because they
are big time

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.840
developers like OnLive is.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.410
And I know that there's a
partnership with OnLive

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.650
bringing the the gaming to
Google TV, so I just was

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.700
wondering if they got a preview
view of an NDK, and it

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.750
was coming sooner.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.490
Because I know that I've
listened to every hang out,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.000
and you've said multiple
times no NDK right now,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.335
no NDK right now.

00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:17.300
But it just looked
like they were

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.060
utilizing some native code.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.410
LES: [INAUDIBLE] me now.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.310
Yep.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.230
OK.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:29.450
Yeah, no there is no, there's
no seeding of an NDK at this

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:36.064
point, because we can't
have an NDK.

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:39.814
And I can't really explain
it too much today.

00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:41.064
BRAD: That's fair.

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:46.610
LES: OK, I'm going to
move, as soon I find

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.844
my cursor, to Amir.

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:53.094
Do you have a question?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.266
Or you could just type it into
the chat window if you'd like.

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:05.010
I'm gonna move on to
Alexander, and

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.560
then I'll come back.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.275
ALEXANDER: Hey.

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:10.095
LES: Hi.

00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:13.140
ALEXANDER: I was wondering, I
posted my question up on your

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.730
original post ages ago, what do
you think the legitimacy of

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:23.780
using console style controllers,
or using PS3 or

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.880
XBox 360 controllers
with Google TV

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.140
will be in the future?

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.000
Do you think it's something we
should look at for games in

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.011
particular?

00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.520
LES: So, you mean
the controllers?

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.770
ALEXANDER: Mmhmm.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.840
LES: Just everyone remember
to mute your mics

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.375
when you're not on.

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:49.920
Cause we're hearing some
feedback somewhere.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.860
Christian?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.490
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.970
CHRISTIAN: Right now, the
controllers out there are the

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.580
ones that are out there.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.690
For the new generation TVs that
were shown at CES, the

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.160
OEMs are experimenting with
new generation of remote

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.180
controls They are not final
yet, and we haven't really

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.330
seen anything really
reliable there.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.900
I think what's possible is,
people can plug in USB

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.295
controllers.

00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:25.850
We've experimented a little bit
with basically plugging in

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.870
USB game console controllers.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.110
It's OK.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.702
It's workable, the USB drivers
will recognize it.

00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:36.573
But the challenge is that--

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:39.920
I'm trying to make room here--

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.420
your users may or may not have
the same game controllers that

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.420
you have. And it gets, I wanna
say you limit your audience a

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:48.900
little bit.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.020
So I would say at this point,
the best is just rely on the

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.510
controllers that come with
the devices, with the

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.260
Review or the Sony.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.630
Or another alternative is we
really would love to see

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.880
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.000
as remote controls
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.723
but we've also seen some
developers that have

00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:16.034
successfully written
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:16.880
remote control.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.442
Then you can use gyros and all
kinds of stuff with it.

00:11:24.733 --> 00:11:25.700
LES: OK.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.700
I'm going to go on to
Will's question.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.760
I muted Alexander just cause
we were picking up stuff.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.240
And Will was asking about
in-app billing.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.570
WILL: OK.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.190
I'm working on in-app billing
right now today with my app

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.210
and I'm not stuck, really.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.070
But my question is, I have it
basically working where I can

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.360
charge myself and I can see
the charge in the console.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.650
So that's working.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.280
But my idea then is to just
write to a flag and a shared

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.740
preference to say that this
purchase was made.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.950
And then rely on that flag
within my app to behave

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.630
differently based on a
purchase situation.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.190
So is that OK to use?

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.540
Is that what I should
be using to do that?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:19.210
Could somehow you could change
the shared preferences packet

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.510
somehow to find that flag
and say I've paid.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.230
That's my first question,
and then--

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.300
LES: Well, you can think
of it as a cache.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:34.780
So if the flag is there, again
people could try to defeat you

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:40.760
by, they could try to defeat
that, but you can think of it

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.550
as a flash.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.000
And if it's not there, rather
than assume that it's not

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.130
paid, you might want to
request of the license

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.410
verification library.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.330
WILL: Right, yes.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.230
LES: [INAUDIBLE] somebody.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.530
And see, there's two kinds
of in-app billing.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.330
There are permanent licenses,
which is probably what you're

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.880
gonna want to use.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.820
And there's also temporary
licenses, which is for game

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.680
[? components ?]

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.340
to get reused.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.080
WILL: I gotcha, OK.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.900
LES: That are expendable.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.780
And so you use the flag
to begin with just for

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.470
performance reasons.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:26.440
Which actually probably isn't
that significant on a TV. And

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.320
then you use the license
verification library.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.400
WILL: OK.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.160
All right, yeah.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.720
I'm just sort of getting into
it today, so that was, I

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.820
wasn't particularly stuck.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.260
But I wanted to throw a
technical question out there,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.930
so thank you.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.910
LES: All right.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.852
Let's see.

00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:52.860
Does anybody have a question?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.630
We've also been joined, we
have AK, who's one of our

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.750
project managers.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.570
And Vincent, who founded
the Google TV project.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.506
Is that a good introduction?

00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:08.526
VINCENT: We can give-- hi,

00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:09.990
LES: Let's get Vincent.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.310
VINCENT: I'm Vincent.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.510
That's OK.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.350
KIM: AK, I'm Kim.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.630
VINCENT: Oh, we don't
mind hiding.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.180
LES: Think we're good.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.700
VINCENT: That's all right.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.150
Don't worry.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.240
AK: Hi, I'm AK.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.140
I'm hiding on the side here.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.920
LES: Yeah, so if you've
got any--

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.170
AK's really the one, actually
both of them are good ones to

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.950
talk about what you want with.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.650
You know, features you'd like.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:33.620
Not features that are
coming, but so if

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.940
you have any of those.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.350
And--

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.960
BRAD: Hey Wes?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.325
LES: Yes?

00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:38.720
BRAD: Real quick.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.840
In the past you had mentioned
that you were gonna check in

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.590
to seeing if the market
could be updated

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.720
outside a firmware update.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.545
Obviously, we all know the
market has a bunch of issues.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.990
Been able to find that out?

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.835
And I know that you said
there's a lot of people

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:56.595
working on getting--

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.095
SPEAKER 1: I think before we
talk about the market,

00:14:59.095 --> 00:14:59.390
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.690
I think market could
be operationally a

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.530
outside of the [? OPA. ?]

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.322
But what kind of issues do you
have with market right now

00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:09.526
that we should fix?

00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:12.170
BRAD: I think a lot of us feel
that there's probably some UI

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.680
issues, but also it doesn't
show the installed apps.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.380
A lot of times it has trouble
updating apps.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.710
A lot of times, let's see.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.210
Installed, let's see.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.910
It doesn't show installed apps,
has issue updating apps.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.670
I know that I personally had
some issues with paid failures

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.830
just failing out, so I just
[INAUDIBLE] the market's got

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.080
some issues that probably
need to be rethought.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.160
And I thought that Les had
mentioned that you guys were

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.776
looking, that there was people
working on that.

00:15:46.776 --> 00:15:48.620
SPEAKER 1: They're actively
fixing bugs

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.770
in those areas also.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.300
You would likely see an update
whether through an [? OPA ?]

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.830
or through other means.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.770
You would see an update, but I
can't talk about timelines.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.750
BRAD: Yep.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.965
No, understood that you can't
talk about timelines.

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:05.550
LES: What he was asking though,
is can market be done

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.564
through other means
besides an OTA?

00:16:08.564 --> 00:16:11.100
SPEAKER 1: You could put
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] outside of

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.210
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.390
As it is done on
phones as well.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.400
BRAD: Right.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.950
Well, that's good because I hate
to see, especially the

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.850
Logitech side of the house.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.330
Obviously, those guys are a
little slower with their OTAs

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.920
than other people.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.450
Hate to see a market delay.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.230
SPEAKER 1: At the end of the
day, the question is, are we

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.160
gonna keep updating market?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.520
And the answer is yes.

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:35.240
LES: OK.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.025
I think we're--

00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:37.255
BRAD: Thank you.

00:16:37.255 --> 00:16:38.975
LES: Are there any other
live questions?

00:16:38.975 --> 00:16:42.055
Or I can start reading some.

00:16:42.055 --> 00:16:43.885
Ah, Amir is back.

00:16:43.885 --> 00:16:45.520
AMIR: Yes, can you hear me?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.610
LES: Yes.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.610
AMIR: All right, so my question
comes with the

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.970
arrival of the ARMADA1500 Google
TVs that are hitting

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.460
the market.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:17:00.910
And the fact that it's just the
ARM CPU that's coming out.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.670
My question comes in to the
people, the early adopters who

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.060
had purchased the Reviews and
the Sony line of devices.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.390
Are we going to be left out
when, if you all do decide to

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.230
enable native code?

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.119
Because I mean I heard you all
mention just recently that

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.660
native code will break.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.060
Of course it's gonna break cause
you're gonna be on a

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.450
different architecture.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.710
But I'm assuming the reason
y'all are going to the other

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.069
architecture is so that you can
enable that native code

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:32.380
and expand the marketplace to
a wider, bring in a wider

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.050
marketplace to the TVs. Because
right now it's kind of

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.940
being hurt by the fact that the
developers aren't really

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.930
siding y'all's way right now.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.310
SPEAKER 1: Some of this
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.610
is dependent on the OEMs,
as you've seen in

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:47.865
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:51.125
We would want most of these
devices to be updated, but a

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:52.780
lot of it is dependent on OEMs.
It's difficult for us to

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.080
predict how different devices
would get updated.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.910
AMIR: Well, it's not really
updating, because it seems

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.250
like the Google TV platform is
moving to an ARM architecture.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.160
So I mean, my main question
is do you leave the early

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.770
adopters out in the dust when
this new line of Google TV

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.640
devices come out?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.660
Because we're all
gonna be on X86.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.370
We may get a lack of updates, we
may get poor market support

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.080
if you do choose to enable
native code.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.230
Just along those lines.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.650
It's not really anything that
you could really change, other

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.330
than having some type of low
level bytecode emulator.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.790
But I mean, I was just looking
for some hope.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.730
SPEAKER 2: We have this
bytecode emulator.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.440
We call it a Dalvik
virtual machine.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.020
AMIR: Right.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.901
LES: It works really well.

00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:48.470
SPEAKER 3: The question
is, so--

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.660
AMIR: I'm talking about
native code.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.580
SPEAKER 3: in general, as we
shift new devices on the

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.720
market, what about the earlier
generation devices, right?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.880
AMIR: Right, right.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.480
SPEAKER 3: So on our end,
obviously what we want to do

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.270
is, we want to keep those
devices alive

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.145
as long as we can.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:06.890
AMIR: Right.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.170
SPEAKER 3: We have
two dependencies.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.940
We have one dependency
on Intel, or whoever

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.770
builds the chip set.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.420
AMIR: Right.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.616
SPEAKER 3: And another
dependency is on, in this

00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:18.380
particular case, Sony
and Logitech.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.260
AMIR: Right.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.570
SPEAKER 3: And so
we need support.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.040
Depending on how much we do,
we need support from either

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.570
one of them, which would
be Logitech or Sony.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.870
Or in some cases, both Logitech
and Intel to continue

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.334
to support the platform.

00:19:33.334 --> 00:19:38.480
AMIR: I see everything moving
to ARM, and it seems like a

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:44.640
platform decision, as opposed
to a OEM decision.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.530
'Cause I mean, I don't see any
more X86 second generation

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.540
Google TVs. It seems like
that's almost dead.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.985
SPEAKER 3: It's not our
migration to, I mean, the fact

00:19:55.985 --> 00:19:59.110
that the new generation devices
are ARM based, I don't

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:05.950
think you should read it
as a platform decision.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.220
It's really, we were actually
guided by the OEMs who

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.120
actually built those, who were
building those second

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.210
generation devices.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.820
So they're the ones who made the
decision in terms of which

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.730
chips that they're using.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.643
It's the guys that use the
chipset that decided which CPU

00:20:23.643 --> 00:20:24.550
they're using.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.050
That's really how it happened.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:32.094
And as Christian pointed out,
you should think of Android,

00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:34.180
Android is a virtual machine.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.500
It has a bytecode interpreter
precisely so that we can stay

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.322
away from those CPU
dependencies.

00:20:41.322 --> 00:20:43.110
AMIR: But am I or am I not
correct that that's

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.110
only for Java code?

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.000
The native code still has
to be compiled to the

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.476
architecture.

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:52.220
SPEAKER 2: That's partially
correct.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.520
So I mean, we really recommend
using Android right now, and

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.380
using the Java code in
Android, of course.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.050
But if you want really high
performance in your

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.970
application, I would really
like you to take a look at

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:06.960
Renderscript.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.330
It's very close to C code.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.940
It's very efficient, and it gets
executed directly on the

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.430
graphics hardware.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:21.330
So if you do any visual effects
or anything in games,

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.720
we've seen a lot of good
performance actually in

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.930
Renderscript.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.280
For business logic type
applications, things that you

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.330
really do more like a UI and
input output operations,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.010
Dalvik is really an
excellent choice.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:43.180
It makes it very easy to have
compelling user interfaces and

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.610
compelling apps.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.690
I know there is a lot of people
who have legacy code,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:52.050
and who want to use basically
native Intel

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.250
or uncompiled libraries.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.990
That's one of the areas we are
aware of, but unfortunately,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.480
there is really not much
that we can do.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.940
And as Vincent pointed out,
the consumer electronics

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.480
market is really very heavily
driven by the audience.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.110
If they make a chipset decision
based on their needs

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:17.060
and requirements, that was one
of the reasons why Android was

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.580
invented, so to speak.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.550
Is really to enable developers
to create applications across

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.180
a broad range of different
consumer electronic devices.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.390
AMIR: That's very fair.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.380
And I do understand that ARM
chips are generally cheaper

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.240
than anything Intel puts out.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.925
So I do understand the cost
aspect that we all saw with

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:43.625
the price drop of the Review and
the Sony devices, that you

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.810
all have to stay competitive.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.840
Which means going to
those ARM chips.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.300
I have another question that's
not related to that.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.600
But it is a time
frame question.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.025
You said you didn't
want those?

00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:57.755
LES: Well, ask it, and I'll tell
you if we can't do it.

00:22:57.755 --> 00:22:59.470
AMIR: OK, that's fair.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.670
Really I was just looking to
see if there's progress or

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.630
really if there's consideration
on seeing

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.730
extensions on the Google
TV anytime soon?

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.750
LES: You mean, extensions,
you mean--

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.010
AMIR: Chrome extensions,
I'm sorry.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.090
LES: Chrome extensions.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.250
AMIR: Yes sir.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.970
SPEAKER 1: No plan
yet on those.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.215
AMIR: OK.

00:23:18.215 --> 00:23:23.186
LES: By the way, you and
I are the only two who

00:23:23.186 --> 00:23:25.460
have asked for that.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:32.610
SPEAKER 3: Well actually, I
mean I think that from a

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.630
philosophical point of view, I
thing we need to worry about

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.080
consumers, right?

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.730
So if we provide too many
application frameworks that

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.220
also means that at the same
time, integration is not gonna

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.680
be seamless.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.860
So that means that, I ran into
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.140
issue, which is, you can create
a webapp, you can

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.516
create an Android app.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:56.396
If you want to get to the
webapp, you go one way.

00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:58.050
The Android app,
the other way.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.305
We tried to do a few things to
make that more seamless, but

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.720
it's still different, right?

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.520
So if we create yet another
application framework, which

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.522
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:06.522 --> 00:24:09.650
enabled on the platform, which
is called extensions.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.780
Which by the way, competes also
with Android Widgets in a

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.150
way, that for users it's gonna
be really, really confusing.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:23.420
They'll get different
experiences depending on what

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.560
we chose, what you guys chose
as the application

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:26.970
environment.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.040
I mean, I already
get confused.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.730
The other day, I was looking
for TuneIn Radio, and I

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.520
couldn't figure out why
it was not on Market.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.720
It's because, as a
user, I didn't

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.750
remember it was a webapp.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.130
And why should I remember,
right?

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.760
So I think that at the end of
the day we don't support

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.250
Chrome extensions because it's
work, frankly speaking.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.725
But even if it was not a lot of
work, I think we'd have to

00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:55.104
think hard before we enabled
yet another application

00:24:55.104 --> 00:24:56.072
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:56.072 --> 00:24:59.160
AMIR: Well, you did mention, I
heard Les mention that he was

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.640
one of the only ones that
had asked for it.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.470
But this probably won't make the
content providers happy,

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.380
but I am really just looking for
Adblock Plus on my Google

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.550
TV. As when I visit sites the
performance of the Chrome

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.550
browser is just really
lacking.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.060
And I don't know if it's the
box, or anything else.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.330
But I feel like getting rid of
some of these motion banners

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.165
and video ads and whatnot
would definitely help.

00:25:23.165 --> 00:25:26.760
LES: You'll see an improvement
when you get the update.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.730
AMIR: The 3.2?

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.370
LES: Yes.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.280
AMIR: OK.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.000
LES: Chrome is a little
bit zippier.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.700
But we understand what
you're interested in.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.660
I'm going to move on to a couple
of written questions.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:50.960
Steve Whitney asks about input
options for his apps on Google

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.880
TV. It would be really helpful
to know what the possibilities

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.860
are in terms of input devices.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.230
Will we always have touchpads,
arrow keys, alphanumeric

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.070
keyboards, et cetera?

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.970
Will the keys always be
arranged the same way?

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.620
I'd like to assign keys in
logical ways, layout wise,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.425
that won't break
future devices.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.860
Hi Vincent!

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.615
Aren't you glad you came?

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:24.600
VINCENT: Yeah.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.180
Don't do that.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.020
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:34.130
I think input device for TVs
is really not a science.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.710
I think at this stage, it's
really interesting when we

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.980
look at user feedback.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.625
It's very polarized.

00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:41.590
Believe it or not, there
are people who love

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.400
the Logitech keyboard.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.920
And there are people who love
the Sony keyboard, and there's

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.820
a lot of people who hate both.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.140
And so we made it clear that
we're gonna keep experimenting

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.642
with device manufacturers
about the input devices.

00:26:57.642 --> 00:27:02.123
So if that happens, going deep
and making assumptions, in

00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:05.880
particular about locations of
keys, and I understand why you

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.217
would want to do that from a
usability standpoint, but I

00:27:09.217 --> 00:27:14.040
think that at this stage, I
think it'd be really, really

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.730
premature to make that
kind of optimization.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:20.700
LES: On that front, are we
going to publish our

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.980
requirements documents
that we give to OEMs?

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.530
Android publishes their
requirements so that

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:36.140
developers can know what's
direction of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.330
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.290
SPEAKER 1: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
direct requirements.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.050
That [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
really is for OEMs.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.530
LES: Right, but it's still
published so that developers

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.935
can look at it and figure out,
this is an area I can go into

00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:49.560
and where I can't.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.190
There are certainly stuff in
ours that developers would

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.960
find interesting.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.430
SPEAKER 1: So I'm not sure if
we publish the requirement

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.680
documents [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.060
But what we can do is, we
can publish some type of

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.320
developers, on our
developer page.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.080
On where things are going.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.705
So as we have these things made,
we can put it on our

00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:09.416
developer page.

00:28:09.416 --> 00:28:11.360
LES: OK, we'll take
that offline, and

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.310
I'll come see you.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.180
All right.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.550
And any time any of you have
a question there, speak up.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:28.200
But I'm gonna read from the
various written questions for

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.450
a little bit.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:43.656
OK, there's a question
about ESPN and ESPN3.

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:44.680
OSAMA: That's not really
a developer question.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.700
LES: It's not really a developer
question, and it's

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.090
not really anything we can do.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.030
Let's see.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.140
SPEAKER 2: So maybe, while you
find another question, just

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.170
dovetailing into the last user
input device question.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.210
Do we have any information
that we want to share yet

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.670
about international
input devices?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.570
So I would assume QWERTY
is very US centric.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.730
So if Google TV launches in
different regions, I would

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.760
imagine that for example, the
basic keyboard layout of the

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.392
QWERTY keyboard is also going
to be adapted, right?

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:25.564
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, but that
will happen [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:29.460
It's not [UNINTELLIGIBLE] and
definitely that's not, should

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.105
be trans-- well, yeah so.

00:29:31.105 --> 00:29:33.910
SPEAKER 2: Should be, but if
somebody relies for game input

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.520
that whatever, the Z
is in the corner--

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.210
SPEAKER 3: That's a good point,
they need to worry

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.450
about that.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.270
LES: Yeah, that's why they,
that was what that earlier

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:43.110
question about formatting, is to
figure out what they should

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.360
do for games.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.060
And because we already have that
developers do one thing

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.400
for the Sony controller
and something

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.326
else for the Logitech.

00:29:56.326 --> 00:30:00.480
SPEAKER 3: Well then, but even
more so to your point, I mean

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:07.270
definitely as far as the letter
part of the keyboard,

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.550
definitely there'd
be some impact

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.210
depending on the locale.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.500
As I said, in general for the
time being, the physical

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:24.110
location of the mandatory keys
on the keyboard is gonna be

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.635
something relatively
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:30.880
LES: We have a question from
Alexander [? Kolychev ?]

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.820
asking about, he'd like to be
able to download the IOS

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.650
remote app from outside
the US.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:43.280
Currently, it's region locked.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.105
And I sent you an email
about that earlier.

00:30:46.105 --> 00:30:48.230
SPEAKER 1: It's been removed.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.370
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.900
Today [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.150
device in the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:59.364
US, and that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:30:59.364 --> 00:31:06.200
LES: And then Jeff Deskines
asks about the issues of

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.465
designing websites for Google
TV versus apps.

00:31:12.446 --> 00:31:15.550
OSAMA: So I think both are great
approaches for getting

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.570
content on TV. In general, if
you want the discoverability

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:21.810
and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.090
features of Android market,
you should build Android

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.890
applications.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:34.360
So that users discover apps in
one of two ways currently.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.020
There's the spotlight section
on Google TV and there's

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.270
Android market.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:47.510
In general, Android market is
more familiar to users who are

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:57.650
just approaching the TV. And
there's more, we found people

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:05.530
go to Android market first. So
if you want an app to get as

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.120
much visibility as possible,
I'd recommend

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.550
launching in Android.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.280
LES: Yeah.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.800
But if you already have a
website, it's not difficult to

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:22.700
adapt it to Google TV. We have
two libraries for one

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.840
extension to jQuery that will
let you quickly add d-pad

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.100
navigation to your website.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:38.360
And if you're interested go to
developers.google.com/tv/web.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.680
SPEAKER 1: And it's also
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.170
I mean, if all your expertise
is in web and you only are

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.545
doing web, it's probably easier
for you to stay with

00:32:47.545 --> 00:32:49.466
web rather than
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:32:49.466 --> 00:32:53.054
It's probably a little bit of
a personal decision also, in

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:57.040
terms of what's easiest for
you to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.316
SPEAKER 4: So what about having
your cake and eat it

00:33:00.316 --> 00:33:05.390
too, which is developing an
Android app that's just a big

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.740
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:12.120
OSAMA: Yeah, so we've seen
a lot of good Android

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.315
applications that are
a hybrid of the two.

00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:18.850
So they use WebView,
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.460
typically to build out
their user interface.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.886
One great example of this
is the Redux app.

00:33:25.886 --> 00:33:28.670
And then they delegate to
Android framework for things

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.620
like video playback.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.270
It's very easy with the WebView
to have callbacks that

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.000
tie into Android
and vice versa.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.605
So if you do have expertise in
web development, and already

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:45.230
have a code base, you can still
leverage the features of

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.430
Android market by building
this sort of hybrid

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.910
application.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:53.210
LES: Yeah, there are some tricks
to WebView that make it

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.320
challenging.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.270
The back button doesn't
always behave well.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:01.770
OSAMA: Yeah, I mean it's things
that you have to test.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:07.310
But if you already have the HTML
site, then it goes a long

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.135
way to building an app
and launching it.

00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:20.719
LES: OK, so Bill Bradley asks
about is Android and Google TV

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.350
going to converge into
a single platform?

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.840
I doubt if anybody wants
to take that, but I'll

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.763
throw it out there.

00:34:28.763 --> 00:34:31.545
OSAMA: I think, let's
stay away from any--

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:32.325
LES: Futures.

00:34:32.325 --> 00:34:33.653
OSAMA: future questions.

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.010
LES: OK.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.280
Bradley, actually we covered
Bradley's question about

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.530
Android market.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.630
Actually Will's got some
marketing questions.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.199
Do you want to ask those live?

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:56.719
WILL: Yeah.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.880
Yeah, I will.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.270
First one is about once you make
your app free, there's no

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.970
going back.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.150
And I'm wondering if that can
be changed in the future?

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.310
So maybe it could support if
you had a special over the

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.810
weekend, maybe your app was
specific to a holiday, you

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.666
want to do something on that day
to make it free, and then

00:35:16.666 --> 00:35:18.480
be able to go back and forth.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.910
That'd be something I'd be
interested to know, if it was

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.330
going to be possible.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.740
I also have an idea for an
app, but I think it has

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.410
copyright issues, and
I'm not sure.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.940
I'm not a lawyer, so I don't
know how it works, but it has

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.670
to do with video.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.680
I can't say anything, because I
signed an NDA, but is there

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.070
someone I could talk to there?

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.370
Or can you give me a resource
that I could ask to say, is

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:39.835
this illegal?

00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:42.405
Is this idea illegal?

00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:45.820
LES: We can't answer
that that way.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:51.930
We can give you some non-legal
advice, but we can't give you

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.200
legal advice.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.200
WILL: All right, I just, I'm
pretty ignorant on copyright

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.475
law, so it'd be like--

00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:01.500
JOHN: This is John Blossom.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.717
I'm not a lawyer, but if you
need somebody to bounce things

00:36:04.717 --> 00:36:06.525
off of, just drop me a line.

00:36:06.525 --> 00:36:07.200
WILL: OK.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.370
Appreciate it, that's cool.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.740
I've gotta check it out with my
partner, but I will be in

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.430
contact with you.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:18.810
And I think the last one I
really cared about was a guy

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.530
reviewed my app recently.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.280
And he seems to be, in his
review, he was talking about

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.260
problems with his hardware, but
he really took it out on

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.815
the app, and he gave it
a one star review.

00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:33.095
And basically it was my free
version, there was no way I

00:36:33.095 --> 00:36:36.540
could help him or respond to
him, as far as I could tell.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.150
So I was hoping there'd be a
way that I could help the

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.430
person who has a problem
maybe, in that way, and

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:46.180
encourage him don't rate
me, rate the hardware.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:46.960
Just some sort of--

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.654
OSAMA: It's good feedback.

00:36:48.654 --> 00:36:53.956
It's good feedback that both you
and other people have. I

00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:54.960
mean, it's just general Android

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.490
feedback on Android market.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:02.820
So we understand that developers
want a way to

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.070
respond to reviews.

00:37:06.595 --> 00:37:10.930
But that's all I can
say about that.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.840
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.524
market [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:15.524 --> 00:37:19.280
get your feedback in
there, so it's--

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.810
WILL: How about the going
back and forth

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:21.833
between free and paid?

00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:24.276
Will that be something
that'll be in there?

00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:29.110
LES: Being able to give a
special, it certainly should

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.830
be a feature market, but that's
really taking it to

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.606
market team.

00:37:34.606 --> 00:37:35.710
WILL: OK, thank you.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.375
OSAMA: We'll give them that
feedback as well.

00:37:37.375 --> 00:37:38.290
WILL: All right.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.230
I appreciate it.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:44.140
LES: OK, I'm gonna go on to--

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.910
are there any other
live questions?

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:53.380
OK, I'm gonna go on to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:53.380 --> 00:38:02.830
TV asked about send system
logs check box.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:06.620
Basically, and using the
read logs permission.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:11.860
And wondering about, every time
you ask for a permission,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.250
you should explain to your
users why you want it.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.910
That's in Android
best practices.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.910
And in the case of read logs,
since it's possible that

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.980
another app, not yours, might
make the mistake of putting

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.770
personal information in the log
file, you really should

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.760
encrypt it before you
send it to you.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:37.960
But explain it to your users and
ask them for permission.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.250
They're granting that
permission.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.750
Ask it in a way that that
permission is separate, and

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.000
you bring it out.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.740
And your users will
like you better.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.270
And let them decline and
still run your app.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.530
Christian?

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:04.140
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I'm not a big
fan of read logs, but I agree

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:04.675
with your answer.

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:09.100
I mean, if the app really
requires it there better be a

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.290
good reason for it.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.480
And explaining it to the
user makes sense.

00:39:16.704 --> 00:39:18.085
LES: Let's see.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.900
OK.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.990
Michael [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:37.090
asks a whole bunch of questions
that really come

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.710
down to overlaying
live television.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.330
And my rule is I'm happy to talk
about that, but I'm not

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.800
going to talk about
with you not here.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.280
So join the hangout.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.170
OSAMA: We've also, you probably
heard of this last

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.210
week, but based on feedback
we did launch a

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.870
public issue tracker.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:01.770
And a place where you can go
file feature requests.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.880
So I believe that feature
request is

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.645
already filed for there.

00:40:05.645 --> 00:40:10.070
And you can find it on
developers.google.com/tv. It's

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.835
on the left side,and I have no
issues that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:18.390
Yeah, but we heard this a
lot from many different

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.060
developers.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.000
But we're hoping that interested
developers go to

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.230
the issue tracker, and
if the issue isn't

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.300
there, file the issue.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.970
If the issue is there,
star the issue.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.190
That way we can get a better
idea of how many developers

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.655
are interested in the
specific features.

00:40:35.655 --> 00:40:37.870
And of the list of features,
which ones we should

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.980
prioritize.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.255
It will also enable us to to
reach out at the developers

00:40:42.255 --> 00:40:43.100
who are interested.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.070
So when we do launch the
feature, if we do launch the

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.070
feature, we can let you know.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.490
Or if we want some feedback
from developers on how to

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.540
build a feature, we can
reach out to you.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.230
So please do use that
issue tracker.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.520
It is something we do
take seriously when

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.615
prioritizing features.

00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:11.200
LES: And a gentleman with
an Islamic name.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.080
And I do not read Arabic,
so I will--

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.406
OSAMA: Arabic name.

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:18.514
LES: Arabic name, excuse me.

00:41:18.514 --> 00:41:21.760
OSAMA: Are we going to have
VPM for Google TV?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.736
LES: That's right,
you can read it.

00:41:23.736 --> 00:41:24.730
OSAMA: I can't read Arabic.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.070
LES: Oh, OK.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:32.580
Yeah, that's really not
something that's probably a

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.980
big feature, but as Osama
just mentioned--

00:41:40.116 --> 00:41:43.020
OSAMA: I'm sure it's maybe
something that an app

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.075
developer can do
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:41:47.075 --> 00:41:49.690
LES: Is that your name, Amir?

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.940
OK.

00:41:53.786 --> 00:41:55.036
Yeah, OK.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:04.835
Let's see, plug for
the hangout.

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:06.080
We've already had a
question on that.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.320
OSAMA: Yeah, I do
like that idea.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.244
I did hear very positive
feedback about the Android--

00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:15.245
VINCENT: What's the idea?

00:42:15.245 --> 00:42:18.670
OSAMA: The Android did
basically a feature

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:29.200
went through apps that they
liked and they didn't like,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.070
and apps that were suggested to
them and then gave feedback

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.864
based on what could make
this app better?

00:42:35.864 --> 00:42:39.190
What could take it to the
finish line of being a

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.880
featured app?

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.535
So that's something I think that
we probably wanna run in

00:42:42.535 --> 00:42:43.475
one of these hangouts.

00:42:43.475 --> 00:42:47.730
And certainly, if you wanna do
it as a community thing, I'd

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:50.980
encourage you guys to do it.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:57.850
LES: OK, at South by Southwest
we're going be talking about

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:06.050
some experimental
tools to access

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.680
high res YouTube videos.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.820
And there should be
a public invite.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.980
It's not an after party.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.080
And it is at Eisenhower's.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.300
There will be a whole section
of Google stuff at

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.980
Eisenhower's.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.700
And in that neighborhood there's
like four buildings,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.130
restaurants that we're
taking over.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.310
Bars.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:39.760
There will be a--

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.621
OSAMA: I believe it does
require a South by

00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:44.165
Southwest pass, or?

00:43:44.165 --> 00:43:45.091
LES: No.

00:43:45.091 --> 00:43:45.812
OSAMA: It doesn't?

00:43:45.812 --> 00:43:45.940
OK.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.340
LES: It's basically you come.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.010
The event that I'm talking about
is an invite only, but

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.190
there is a link to a
request an invite.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.125
But the bar is open.

00:43:58.125 --> 00:44:00.010
OSAMA: Where is the link?

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:00.970
LES: I don't know.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:06.550
It's the Google South
by Southwest page.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:11.490
And then we are also gonna
have open office hours.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:16.570
Fifteen minutes, you can ask any
developer relations person

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.010
there any question you
want for 15 minutes.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.660
Everything from technical
questions, marketing

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.870
questions, how do I get
hired at Google?

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:29.440
I want to join developer
relations, we'll talk

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.690
to you about it.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.120
OK, any other live questions?

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.030
I don't know about the League of
Extraordinary Hackers event

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.280
with Chris [? Last. ?]

00:44:45.566 --> 00:44:48.450
OK, live questions?

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:52.080
SPEAKER 5: It's not technical,
but did anybody invite Leon?

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.540
It's very uncommon for him
not to be here today.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:00.296
LES: Yeah, he's on my invite, so
yeah, I was surprised he's

00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:00.760
not here today.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.580
But I know what he's working on,
so I expect that he's busy

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.800
working on that.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.910
SPEAKER 5: And then, as far as
Will, with his app there, you

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.630
should just do what most of the
other top developers do.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:18.070
They put a big note right on the
description page of their

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.860
app saying if you have issues,
contact you first before you

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.080
leave a bad review.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:24.900
WILL: Yeah.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.580
Yep.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.200
SPEAKER 5: I didn't see that
on your description page.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.490
I just saw your Google
Plus profile.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.440
WILL: Yep, that's a
really good idea.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.000
I'm gonna update my description

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.200
very shortly, actually.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.450
That's gonna be part
of it, so.

00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:52.630
LES: All right, I will give a
plug for, I'm doing events in

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.550
New York and in Toronto.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.090
There's a public event
in Toronto, two

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.190
public events in Toronto.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.650
If you're there, please
sign up and come.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.930
Oh, have there been talks
about devices

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.180
with open boot loaders?

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.600
There haven't been talks
about these things.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.260
That's good.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.130
All right, any other
questions?

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.290
Going, going.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.836
Thanks everyone for coming.

00:46:21.836 --> 00:46:23.820
We'll call [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.290
early.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.140
OSAMA: Thanks guys.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.420
SPEAKER 3: Thanks guys.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.700
LES: Oh, I betcha I
didn't do that.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.640
I'm here.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.570
Let's see.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.820
Close.
