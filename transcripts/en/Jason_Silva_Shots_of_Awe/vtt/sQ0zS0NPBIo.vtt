JASON SILVA: So I'm really
fascinated by the way

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.980
that context affects
consciousness.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.510
Where set and setting meet
awareness and consciousness.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.610
So why do people like sunrises?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.460
Why people love sunsets?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.230
And I think it's because it's a
moment in which we can actually

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.770
witness the transformation--
the transition from day

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.320
to night, or from night to day.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.215
In ordinary waking states, we
cannot perceive the passing

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:38.410
of the moment.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.280
And so this perception--
this increased juxtaposition

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.650
of day and night-- forces
us to be more present.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.980
It forces an experience
of time, dilation,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.040
that transforms how we
perceive the moment.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.670
The moment becomes impregnated
with a sense of importance,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.360
with a sense of meaningfulness.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
The sunset context
essentially frames the moment

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.810
and induces, hopefully, a
transformative experience.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.760
And thus we are left
with that feeling of,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.340
oh, that was really meaningful,
or oh, that was really special.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.980
We crave these moments, and we
work hard for these moments,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.070
and we strive to
author these moments.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.950
But a lot of times, they are
right there for the taking.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.550
If only we were aware enough
to open our eyes and plug in.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.900
