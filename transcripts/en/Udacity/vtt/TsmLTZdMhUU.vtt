00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.080
Okay, the answers of these questions are that the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.700
trade is sex-linked with regards to its inheritance pattern and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.920
it appears to be recessive. Now how do we know

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.410
this? Well, as fas as inheritance pattern is concerned, it

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.360
looks sex-linked, because only males are affected. That's a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.590
hallmark sign that we have a gene traveling on an

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.320
X chromosome somewhere. It can't be maternal inheritance because maternal

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.700
inheritance means that it's passed down through the mitochondria and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.210
so if a mother was affected all of her children

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.190
would be affected. And in this case we have an

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.000
affected son who doesn't have an affected mother, so that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.440
can't be right. Now while it's still plausible that it might

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.400
be autosomal. The big skewing here of only males being

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.340
affected is our big hint that it's most likely sex-linked.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
In reality, we'd really need a pedigree that's bigger than

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.910
this. We'd need more information, but for our intents and purposes

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.210
here, this is the sort of size of pedigree

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.160
we're looking at, and this is a good enough

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.920
indication that it's more likely sex-linked than autosomal. The

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.070
trait also appears to be recessive, not dominant. Because

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.570
it doesn't show up in every generation, which is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.660
a hallmark of recessive traits. And we have unaffected

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.320
parents giving rise to affected offspring. And dominant traits,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.820
we see the opposite. Where affected parents have affected offspring.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.410
And it doesn't skip generations. So we

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.590
know dominant's most likely not the right answer.
