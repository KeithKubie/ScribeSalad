00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.966
Soil eriosion is a major
ecological problem and
construction challenge,

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.885
which typically requires heavy machinery to mitigrate. 

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:18.435
To address these problems, engineers at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University are developing Romu, an autonomous robot that drives sheet piles into the ground.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:26.484
Romu maneuvers through natural territory on its four wheels.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:41.416
It then leverages its own weight with a vibratory hammer to drive interlocking
steel sheet piles into the soil.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.372
The structures that such robots build could one day function as retailing walls or check dams for erosion control.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:36.387
The researchers also envision teams of Romu robots operating collectively to stabilize soil in a set area more efficiently than an individual robot.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:57.659
Soil stabilization with automatically deployed sheet pile driving robots could help sustain ecosystems and aid in land management for construction, mining, and agriculture.
