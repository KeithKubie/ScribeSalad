00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.100
The snooze button, one of man's best
inventions...until nine minutes later when

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.329
the dreaded alarm strikes again.  Except
now you feel even more tired, so do you

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.219
hit it again?  Are those extra minutes
really helping at all? Or is it the

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.250
beginning of a never-ending cycle that
ends in you being late and still dead tired.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.330
In an unimaginable world without alarm
clocks our bodies would simply wake up

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.630
naturally, seems crazy right?  But our
bodies have many chemical mechanisms in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.499
place to not only put us to sleep, 
but wake us up as well.  The body begins

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.410
preparing in the hour before you
naturally wake-up, body temperature rises

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.859
sleep becomes lighter and hormones such as
dopamine and cortisol are released

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.629
which give you energy to start your day.
 But the problem with alarms is that they

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.210
often interrupt your sleep cycle and cut these processes short.  Particularly if you

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.940
don't have a regular sleep rhythm or
schedule, the alarm goes off, but your body

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.179
isn't quite ready.  This groggy and tired state is known as "sleep intertia"

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.799
and its strength is related to which
sleep stage you are waking up out of.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.819
The deeper the sleep the more potent the
sleep inertia and so the snoozing

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.159
begins.  But the snooze button can do more
damage than good, as you fall back asleep

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.869
the body be restart its sleep cycle and
enter into deeper sleep stages.  So

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.670
instead of your body prepping to wake up,
it's going in the opposite direction and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.320
as a result the second alarm may cause
you to feel even more tired

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.630
and so continues the viscious cycle.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.549
Ultimately. you would be better off setting your original alarm later and not

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.440
interrupting your sleep.  Many studies
have found that fragmented sleep is much

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.500
less restorative

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.910
and leads to sleepiness related daytime
impairment.  So by breaking up those last

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.070
thirty minutes or so of sleep, you are
more likely to feel tired and perform

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
poorly during the day.  What else can you do?
Try adopting a more regular sleep

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.470
schedule, being tired is not only a
product of sleep deprivation or waking

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.830
up out of a deep sleep, but also lacking a
consistent schedule.  The body loves

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.900
predictability, wake up at the same time
every morning, including the weekends, and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.360
after a few weeks your body should adapt
to the timing and be less inclined to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.660
require an alarm in the first place.  And
if you do wake up feeling a little

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.209
tired, try to resist the snooze
temptation and just get up,

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.359
because as the saying goes "you snooze you lose".

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.789
