00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
&gt;&gt; As to the question of role models in the
Middle East, I'm far from an expert on the

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.450
Middle East, but I do know that in the US
having role models is extremely important.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.230
When I went to college, the school I went
to had very few women on the faculty, there

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.119
were very few women in some of the classes
I took and it was a struggle to kind of figure

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.399
out how to, how to research, how to be a person
with a certain kind of role when there weren't

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.010
women there ahead of me. And I'm sure the
same kind of example will hold for other groups.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.670
If you're, you look at a type of work and
you see no one there who's like you, not only

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.030
does it make it harder for you to get a job
buit it makes it harder for you to see yourself

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.839
in that position. So I think bringing together
people who have similar interests and encouraging

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.670
people to know other people who are doing
that kind of work or that kind of research

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.969
or that kind of thinking, but who are can
identify with can make a huge difference in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.202
young people and people moving up in their
careers.
