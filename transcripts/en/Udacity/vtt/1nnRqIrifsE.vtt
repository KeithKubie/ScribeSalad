00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
Great!

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.020
Now, you've written an application
that gets continuous updates.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.570
And you've converted an application
that gets a single update

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.690
to one that gets continuous updates.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.560
You've see all about different
ways to access the location

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.829
services available to you.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.670
But as well as location,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.110
you can also do context, where you
can detect what the phone is doing.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.120
Is it on a bike?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.850
Is it in a car?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.230
Are you walking?

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.380
Are you running?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.130
You can detect this type of activity
using the activity recognition APIs.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.710
Let's take a look.
