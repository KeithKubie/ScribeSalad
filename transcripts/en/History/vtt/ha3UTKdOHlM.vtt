[metal detector beeping]
- --isolate that clump.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.210
NARRATOR: In the
northern Philippines,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.880
John Casey and Manny
Paez are inside a cave

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.960
searching for what they hope
is Yamashita's treasure.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.880
After running into problems
at their first dig site,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.210
Breach 6--

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210
How the hell would
silt get in here?

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.540
NARRATOR: --they turned
to advanced technology

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.830
to find another way
into the mountain.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.080
This right here could
be a cave entrance.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.210
NARRATOR: Inside the
cave, they've discovered

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.000
a group of coded symbols.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.420
Markers on these rocks.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.920
NARRATOR: And after
triangulating them together,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.420
the team found a rock
marked with a distinct X--

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.880
There's a chisel mark
in this thing of an X.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.080
NARRATOR: --which John
believes could be concealing

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.330
a small treasure,
a larger chamber,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.250
or possibly even the entrance
to a network of tunnels.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.750
It's a marker telling
us, get the shovel.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.710
We're going to dig right now.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.330
[metal detector beeping]

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.040
NARRATOR: Before
breaking ground,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.920
John gives the area one last
sweep with his metal detector.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
We got a pretty
decent-size target.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.540
When I cross over
the center, I'm

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.120
getting a really decent hit.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.620
It could be a barrel
of anything, you know,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.290
a barrel of coins.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.120
Yeah, this rock could be marking
the entrance to a tunnel,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.750
for all I know.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.250
Hey, Manny?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.750
MANNY: Yeah.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.460
I'm super suspicious that
it's too easy, you know,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.420
that that marker is just way
out right in the blatant open.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
That marker over there,
it's just alone by itself.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.790
Why?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.380
Then why does it line
up to that one almost

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.750
in a perfect triangle?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.710
There's something very
suspicious about it.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.330
Maybe they're
trying to trick you.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.290
The giveaway marker, the
triangulation and the X marker,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.790
line up way too easy.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.670
There's something about
it that's a little fishy.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.620
It's making me a
little nervous--

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.330
hesitant to go forward.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.290
My gut is telling me it's--

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.580
there's something wrong here.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.290
Just digging on it
could be disastrous.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.170
So don't put a shovel
in the ground just yet.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.620
We've just got to
be smarter than them

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.750
and figure it out safely.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.960
MANNY: All right.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.120
In all my years
of treasure hunting,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.290
I've never seen
X marks the spot.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.330
We have to look around a
little further because there's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.330
just something not right.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.500
I'm getting a bad feeling.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.120
Oh.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.920
That's a flower.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.790
In the Yamashita
codes, that means bomb.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.880
[explosion]

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.290
That's no good.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.710
I'm not going to
take any chances

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.170
in triggering that bomb.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.880
NARRATOR: In order to
investigate the cave safely,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.540
the team has invited
an explosive ordinance

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.380
and military expert
to the mountain.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.380
Somebody call for a bomb guy?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.380
Chad Higginbotham.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.290
Pete Struzzieri.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.000
Good to meet you.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.880
John Casey.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.620
Good to meet you, John.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.330
NARRATOR: John and Manny lead
Chad to the top of the mountain

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.210
so they can get
his expert opinion

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.500
about what they're possibly
dealing with inside the cave.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.170
JOHN: I've been dying to
get back into this cave

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.250
and keep exploring, but
it's been too dangerous.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.580
So now that Chad's here,
we can get back in there

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.380
and safely explore
what may have been one

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.040
of Yamashita's headquarters.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.420
Let me take a look
around for a minute.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420
Y'all just kind of
hang out right here.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.330
JOHN: Sure thing.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
[music playing]

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.880
NARRATOR: General
Yamashita is reported

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.580
to have placed booby
traps within all Golden

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.540
Lily treasure sites.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.210
Using his years of ordnance
disposal experience,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.250
Chad explores the cave
interior for signs

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.250
of old World War II explosives.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.540
All right, I don't
see anything obvious.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.790
NARRATOR: With Chad's approval,
John and Manny start digging

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.620
around the X-marked rock.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.460
Whoop.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.790
Oh, hold on, boys.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.620
Hold on a second.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.210
What do you got?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.710
Oh.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.290
Look at that.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.080
[laughs]

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.790
We found a coin, boys.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.790
Look at that.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.710
That's definitely a coin.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.620
That's not garbage.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.540
Yep, it is.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.880
You want to clean it up?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.210
Yeah, we got some water?

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.040
Oh.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.620
Can I see it?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.250
It's the first piece of
treasure we found on this site.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.420
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.330
Where there's one,
there's two, baby.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.460
Oh, that's freakin' killer.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.290
Let's see it a little closer.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.670
CHAD: Finding something
like that in here,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.170
it's a pretty good sign for you.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.830
No doubt.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.460
Finding this coin is great.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.500
But what the hell is it doing
5,000 feet up a mountain

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.330
buried next to a
rock with an X on it?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.500
Oh, Manny.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.170
We have to share it with Pete.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.670
He's going to be stoked.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.330
Put it somewhere safe now.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.670
MANNY: It's a good site, John.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.120
It's a beautiful day.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.330
