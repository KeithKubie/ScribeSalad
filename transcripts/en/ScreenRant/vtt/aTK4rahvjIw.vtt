00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.970
Film production can be a dangerous business.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.140
As we discussed in our video about 10 Incredibly
Hard to Shoot Movie Scenes, getting the perfect

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.480
action shot can sometimes mean pulling off
very risky stunts that have the potential

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.320
to go disastrously wrong.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.880
Fortunately most productions will have plenty
of precautions and safeguards in place, which

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.820
means that on-set deaths are very rare, but
there are still some famous cases of actors

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.570
who died while filming, and others who died
before they could finish their current projects.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.090
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Actors Who Died
During A Movie’s Production.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.090
Heath Ledger

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.610
The Dark Knight actor Heath Ledger sadly didn't
live to enjoy the critical acclaim and the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.820
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor that
the role earned him, as he died of an accidental

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.600
prescription drug overdose six months before
The Dark Knight arrived in theaters.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.370
The Joker wasn't Ledger's final role, however.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.900
At the time of his death, Ledger was a little
over a month into filming Terry Gilliam's

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.390
fantasy film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,
in which he played a central role.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.570
Following the actor's death, Gilliam came
up with the idea of having Ledger's character

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.759
change his appearance, and enlisted the help
of Johnny Depp, Jude Law and and Colin Farrell

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.719
to take over the role in scenes that Ledger
hadn't yet got around to filming.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:23.090
With their help, The Imaginarium of Doctor
Parnassus was completed and became the final

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.369
piece of Ledger's legacy.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.369
Jon-Erik Hexum

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.340
There's a dangerous misconception that guns
loaded with blanks are harmless, when the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.450
truth is that blanks can do a whole lot of
damage when fired at very close range.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.499
This was the fate that befell Jon-Erik Hexum
on the set of CBS action-adventure series

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.829
Cover Up, in which he played a CIA agent working
undercover as a model.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.959
During a filming delay, Hexum began jokingly
playing Russian roulette with a .44 Magnum

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.000
loaded with blanks.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.520
The gun was pressed right up against his temple
when it went off, firing the wadding from

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.909
the blank into Hexum's skull and causing a
massive brain hemorrhage.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.039
After being declared brain dead, Hexum was
eventually taken off life support.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.039
Brandon Lee

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.939
Alex Proyas' vigilante superhero movie The
Crow has become a cult classic since its original

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.280
release in 1994, but the film is notorious
for another reason.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.000
Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee, played the
movie's main character, Eric Draven, a rock

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.310
star who is brought back from the dead to
avenge his own murder and the death of his

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.310
girlfriend.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.370
In a scene where Eric returns home to find
his girlfriend being attacked, actor Michael

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.500
Massee fired a prop gun at Lee, not knowing
that the prop crew had accidentally left a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
fragment of a real bullet inside it.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.090
The bullet struck Lee in the abdomen, and
despite being rushed to hospital and undergoing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.610
six hours of surgery, the wound cost him his
life.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.950
Lee was just 28 years old.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.950
Paul Walker

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.530
Paul Walker was a mainstay of the Fast and
Furious franchise from the very beginning,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.750
and his appearances in the movies spanned
over a decade - from his first appearance

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.480
in The Fast and the Furious to his final portrayal
of Brian O'Conner in Furious 7.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.920
Two months into production on Furious 7, Walker
was killed when the driver of the Porsche

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.830
he was travelling in crashed the car into
a lamp post and two trees at high speed.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.500
Following the accident, Universal put production
on hold to give the cast and crew time to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.130
grieve, and to give director James Wan time
to figure out how to rework the film.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.370
Furious 7 was eventually completed using Paul
Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, as stand-ins

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.580
for his character, with a combination of camera
trickery and CGI used to complete Brian's

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.760
story.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.800
Vic Morrow

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.780
Like Brandon Lee and Jon-Erik Hexum, actor
Vic Morrow's death was the result of an accident

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.510
on set, which is easily one of the most horrifying
tales in the film industry.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.070
Morrow was filming "Time Out," a segment of
Twilight Zone: The Movie in which a racist

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.690
gets a taste of his own medicine when he is
cast back in time and assumes the ethnicities

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.250
of those he was prejudiced against.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.760
During a scene in which Morrow's character
finds himself in the Vietnam war, a helicopter

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.120
hovering overhead was damaged by nearby pyrotechnic
explosions and crashed, decapitating Morrow

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.450
and killing two child actors that he was carrying.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.330
Several people involved in production - including
director John Landis - were put on trial for

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.260
involuntary manslaughter, but were ultimately
acquitted.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.550
Oliver Reed

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.990
Ridley Scott's historical epic Gladiator won
a handful of Oscars in 2001, including the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.670
award for Best Visual Effects.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.050
Among the visual effects used in the film
were early CGI techniques that completed actor

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.010
Oliver Reed's scenes as Antonius Proximo,
the gladiator trainer who becomes a mentor

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.590
to Maximus Decimus Meridius.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.930
Reed died of a heart attack towards the end
of filming, and his character's fate was rewritten

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.770
so that instead of surviving, Proximo sacrifices
himself in order to buy Maximus time to escape.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.300
To complete his remaining scenes, a body double
was used and a CGI mask placed over the body

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.750
double's face to create the illusion of Reed
being present.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.870
It was an Oscar-worthy effect, especially
for the time, and a powerful final role for

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.160
Reed.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.259
John Ritter

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.070
John Ritter first made a name for himself
as one of the leads on ABC sitcom Three's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.470
Company in the 1970s and 80s, and by the early
2000s had gone from TV bachelor to TV dad

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.850
in another ABC sitcom, 8 Simple Rules, in
which he played strict but affectionate father

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.850
Paul Hennessy.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.740
During filming of the show's second season,
Ritter fell ill due to a heart defect called

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.280
aortic dissection, which was initially misdiagnosed
as a heart attack.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.430
Despite efforts to save him, Ritter died in
a hospital later that day.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.500
His death was written into the show, with
the Hennessy family finding out that Paul

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.000
had collapsed while grocery shopping.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Bela Lugosi

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.750
Bela Lugosi starred in some of the most famous
horror movies ever made, including Dracula,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.030
White Zombie and The Black Cat, but he died
while filming one of the most infamously terrible

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.950
movies ever made: Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer
Space.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.280
Well, actually that's not completely accurate.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.091
Lugosi had been filming various random scenes
with Wood for other movie projects, and this

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:16.091
footage was eventually cut into Plan 9.

00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.880
In order to complete these scenes, Wood hired
his wife's chiropractor, who had no acting

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.770
experience and didn't even look like Lugosi,
to stand in for the famous actor by holding

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.780
a cape over his face.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.720
It's a bit of a far cry from the technical
wizardry that made the completion of Furious

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.460
7 possible, but it's also one of the many
quirks that makes Plan 9 From Outer Space

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000
so… memorable.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.280
Marilyn Monroe

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.940
One of the most iconic movie stars of all
time, Marilyn Monroe is known for her roles

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.120
in classic comedies films like Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes, Some Like it Hot and The Seven Year

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
Itch.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.960
Monroe's final film was a romantic comedy
called Something's Got to Give, from which

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.400
she was fired after one month of production,
then later rehired with a change of director.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.370
Before filming with Monroe could resume, the
actress died of a barbiturate overdose.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.639
Something's Got to Give was never completed,
though the footage was later pieced together

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.370
for a documentary called Marilyn: Something's
Got to Give.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.080
Philip Seymour Hoffman

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.340
Philip Seymour Hoffman was a highly respected
actor, who in 2006 won an Oscar for playing

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.910
the title role in Capote.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.980
In more recent years, audiences became familiar
with Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.690
Gamemaker of The Hunger Games.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.620
Sadly, after decades of sobriety, Hoffman
suffered a relapse into the drug addiction

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.940
that had plagued him in his younger years,
and with just a week of filming left on The

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.560
Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 the actor
died after taking a mix of heroin, cocaine,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.240
amphetamines and benzodiazepines.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.020
Director Francis Lawrence decided not to try
and complete Hoffman's performance using CGI,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.570
and Plutarch Heavensbee was instead written
out of the scenes that Hoffman had yet to

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.570
shoot.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.680
These are just a few of the more memorable
instances of actors dying midway through production,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.020
but there are more examples out there.
