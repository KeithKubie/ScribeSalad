00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:14.567
Hello, everyone. 
Let's begin our guided tour.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.271
Welcome to the Museum of Museums.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.912
Museums have been a part of human history
for over 2000 years.

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:25.144
But they weren't always 
like the ones we visit today.

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:31.733
The history of museums is far older
and much stranger than you might imagine.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.368
We'll start over here in the Greek wing.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.450
Our word museum
comes from the Greek mouseion,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.774
temples built for the Muses,
the goddesses of the arts and the sciences.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:47.637
Supplicants asked the Muses 
to keep watch over academics

00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:51.234
and grant ingenuity 
to those they deemed worthy.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:54.420
The temples were filled 
with offerings of sculptures,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.450
mosaics,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.917
complex scientific apparatuses,

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.276
poetic and literary inscriptions,

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:04.530
and any other tribute that would 
demonstrate a mortal's worthiness

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.088
for divine inspiration.

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:10.241
We have arrived at the Mesopotamian wing.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:16.384
The first museum was created in 530 B.C.
in what is now Iraq.

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:20.866
And the first curator 
was actually a princess.

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:26.274
Ennigaldi-Nanna started to collect
and house Mesopotamian antiquities

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:29.163
in E-Gig-Par, her house.

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.631
When archeologists excavated the area,

00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:36.009
they discovered dozens of artifacts
neatly arranged in rows,

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.728
with clay labels 
written in three languages.

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:42.493
She must have had interesting parties.

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:47.929
The tradition of collecting and displaying
intriguing items began to be mimicked,

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.228
as you can see here 
in the Roman Empire wing.

00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:53.801
Treasure houses 
of politicians and generals

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.692
were filled with the spoils of war,

00:01:56.692 --> 00:01:59.655
and royal menageries 
displayed exotic animals

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:04.152
to the public on special occasions,
like gladiator tournaments.

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:07.044
As you can see, we have a lion here
and a gladiator,

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:11.800
and, well, the janitor ought 
to be in this wing clearly.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.694
Moving on, hurry along.

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:17.519
The next step in the evolution of museums
occurred in the Renaissance,

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.409
when the study of the natural world
was once again encouraged

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.523
after almost a millennium 
of Western ignorance.

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:28.540
Curiosity cabinets,
also referred to as Wunderkammers,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.044
were collections of objects that acted
as a kind of physical encyclopedia,

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:35.287
showcasing artifacts.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:39.103
Just step into the wardrobe here.
There you go. Mind the coats.

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:41.772
And we'll tour Ole Worm's cabinet,

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:43.779
One of the most notable Wunderkammers

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.904
belonged to a wealthy 
17th-century naturalist,

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:50.729
antiquarian, and physician Ole Worm.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.924
Ole Worm collected natural specimens,

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:54.523
human skeletons,

00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:56.226
ancient runic texts,

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:59.211
and artifacts from the New World.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:00.815
In other curiosity cabinets,

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:02.653
you could find genetic anomalies,

00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:03.843
precious stones,

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.152
works of art,

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.753
and religious and historic relics.

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.518
Oh my. You might not want to touch that.

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:14.184
These cabinets were private, again,
often in residencies,

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:18.169
curated by their owners, 
rulers and aristocrats,

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.316
as well as merchants and early scientists.

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:24.080
Now, who hears a circus organ?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.366
In the 1840s,

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:28.811
an enterprising young showman
named Phineas T. Barnum

00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.920
purchased some of the more famous
cabinets of curiosity from Europe

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.352
and started Barnum's American Museum
in New York City.

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:39.570
A spectacular hodgepodge of zoo,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.579
lecture hall,

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.922
wax museum,

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.047
theater,

00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:46.894
and freak show that was known
for its eclectic residents,

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.051
such as bears,

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:48.926
elephants,

00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:49.929
acrobats,

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.944
giants,

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:52.292
Siamese twins,

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.811
a Fiji mermaid,

00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:56.053
and a bearded lady,

00:03:56.053 --> 00:04:00.274
along with a host of modern machinery
and scientific instruments.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:04.248
Museums open to the public
are a relatively new phenomenon.

00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:06.989
Before Barnum, the first public museums

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.411
were only accessible 
by the upper and middle classes,

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:12.830
and only on certain days.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.300
Visitors would have to apply 
to visit the museum

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.642
in writing prior to admision,

00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:20.890
and only small groups could visit
the museum each day.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.116
The Louvre famously allowed all members
of the public into the museum

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.732
but only three days a week.

00:04:27.732 --> 00:04:29.149
In the 19th century,

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:32.294
the museum as we know it
began to take shape.

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:34.481
Institutions like the Smithsonian
were started

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:39.273
so that objects could be seen and studied,
not just locked away.

00:04:39.273 --> 00:04:41.678
American museums, in particular,

00:04:41.678 --> 00:04:43.122
commissioned experiments

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:48.489
and hired explorers to seek out 
and retrieve natural samples.

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:54.249
Museums became centers for scholarship
and artistic and scientific discovery.

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.226
This is often called the Museum Age.

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:01.377
Nowadays, museums are open to everybody,

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:02.886
are centers of learning and research,

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.902
and are turning 
into more hands-on institutions.

00:05:06.902 --> 00:05:10.465
But the question of who gets to go
is still relevant

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.590
as ticket prices can sometimes 
bar admission

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.052
to those future scholars, artists
and targets of divine inspiration

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:22.358
who can't afford 
to satisfy their curiosity.

00:05:22.358 --> 00:05:23.898
Thank you all for coming,
and please,

00:05:23.898 --> 00:05:27.306
feel free to stop by the gift shop 
of gift shops on your way out.
