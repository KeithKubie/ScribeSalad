00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
We're on problem 21.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.310
Which product is equivalent
to 4x squared minus 16

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.510
over 2 minus x?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.780
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.300
4x squared minus 16, if we were
to factor out a 4, that's

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.980
the same thing as 4 times
x squared minus 4.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.880
That's 4x squared minus 16, all
of that over 2 minus x.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.630
Then x squared minus 4, that's
that same pattern that keeps

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.550
showing up, a squared minus
b squared, right?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.750
So that numerator becomes 4
times x plus 2 times x minus

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.280
2, right? a plus b
times a minus b.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.570
Then the denominator, let's
think about it.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.620
This has 2 minus x, and we
have an x minus 2 here.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.300
But what if we were to factor
out a negative 1 from this?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.470
What happens?

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.930
If you factor out a negative 1,
then the negative x becomes

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.130
a positive x, and the positive
2 becomes a minus 2.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.920
I did that just to show you that
a negative, if you divide

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.430
this by or multiply by
a negative 1, you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.320
just switch the order.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.070
2 minus x becomes x minus 2,
which is a good thing to

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.110
recognize because we have an x
minus 2 in the numerator, too.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.150
So this will cancel
out with that.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.800
If we assume that x does not
ever equal 2 because x

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.200
equaling 2 would make this an
undefined statement because

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.000
you can't divide by zero, but if
we make that assumption, we

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.060
can cancel those out.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.360
Then we have 4 divided by
negative 1 is minus 4

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.270
times x plus 2.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.480
That is choice D.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.960
Next question, 22.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.220
I like this cutting and pasting

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.260
of the actual question.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.510
It makes it fun.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850
I don't want it to slow down
my computer too much.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.950
I sound like I'm melting
when that happens.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.030
So that's our problem.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.560
I didn't write the
choices down.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400
All right, let's see
what we can do.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.390
So they have x squared
plus 4x.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.250
Let me write this.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.590
x squared plus 4x over x plus 3
times x squared minus 9, all

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.940
of that over x squared
plus x minus 12.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.990
You might say, oh, my God, to
multiply these using algebraic

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.890
multiplication would take
forever, then I'd have to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.810
factor it and simplify it.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.470
The trick here is to factor it
and simplify it before you do

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.370
any multiplication.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.690
So let's simplify each of these
expressions and cancel

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.910
out as much as possible.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.330
So here we can just
factor out an x.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.640
So this just becomes
x times x plus 4.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.090
This is a squared minus b
squared, so this becomes x

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.050
plus 3 times x minus 3.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.360
With that you can't do much.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.260
Let's think about this one.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.430
What two numbers add up to a 1,
a 1x, and when you multiply

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.840
them, you get a minus 12?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.100
So let's see, if you have an x
plus 4 times x minus 3, that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.510
should work.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.970
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.900
4 times minus 3 is minus 12.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.540
So that works.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.190
All right now we're
ready to cancel.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.910
Normally.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.980
I would just start canceling,
but I just

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.070
want to make the point.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:39.140
So this is equal to x times x
plus 4 times these, x plus 3

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:52.680
times x minus 3, all of that
over x plus 3 times x plus 4

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.970
times x minus 3.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.890
Now we can cancel.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.640
We have an x minus 3, x minus
3, x plus 4 x plus 4, x plus

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.370
3, x plus 3, and all we're
left with is an x.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.250
So all of this fancy expression,
all that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.740
equals is an x.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.280
That's choice B.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.870
Where am I?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.940
Next problem.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.630
Image, clear image, invert
colors, there you go.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.990
All right, let me see
if I have to copy

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.510
and paste this one.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.340
Where was I?

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.430
Oh, why not?

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.570
Another one where they're
trying to get

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.520
the simplest form.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.770
So I copied it.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.910
Let me paste it.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.170
All right, I hope you
can read this.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.640
So what is the simplest form
of this expression here?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.850
I'll rewrite it.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:52.290
5x to the third y plus 20x
squared y squared plus 20x y

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.690
to the third, everything
divided by 5xy.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.560
So 5xy actually goes
into every one of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.810
these terms, right?

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.060
Let's just get rid of the 5's.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.150
Well, actually, let's just
divide the numerator and the

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.310
denominator by 5xy.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.830
So what's 5x to the third
y divided by 5xy?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.600
Well, 5 divided by 5-- I'll
do it in magenta.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.220
5 divided by 5 is 1 so we don't
have to write that.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.950
x to the third divided
by x is x squared.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.590
y divided by y is 1.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.390
So this term divided by this
term reduced to that.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.550
Easy enough.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.600
Next one.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.620
Plus 20 divided by 5 is 4.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.090
x squared divided by x is x.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.356
y squared divided by y is y.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:40.200
We did the second term.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.500
Let's do the third term.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.010
20 divided by 5 is 4.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.465
x divided by x is 1 so we don't
have to write it. y to

00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:55.150
the third divided by
y is y squared.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.230
What we have here is this
simplified, but that doesn't

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.420
look like anything here.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.650
So my guess is that this is
probably one of these.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.760
This is the square
of something.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.010
Let's see if we can
factor this.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.520
This would be x.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.170
So what two numbers when I add
them become 4xy or what number

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.330
when I multiply it times x is
equal to half of this-- that's

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.250
another way to think about it--
and when I square it is

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.690
equal to 4y squared?

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.220
That's just plus 2y squared.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.850
If that didn't make a lot of
sense, multiply this out and

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.540
you'll get this answer.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.960
When you look at the choices,
you should just say, OK, I

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.740
know that this choice and
this choice, those look

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.970
nothing like that.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.730
Then you say, oh, well,
maybe this is one of

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.310
these choices, right?

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.460
But you have a 4y
squared here.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.440
This one has no y
at all in it.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.620
So you can even just use
deductive reasoning to say,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.410
oh, the choice must be
x plus 2y squared.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.480
Next problem.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.810
OK, this one I'm definitely
going to copy and paste

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.155
because they have a big image.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.340
All right, let me see
if I can do it.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.280
This makes it a lot easier than
having to draw it myself.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.730
All right.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.840
If i equals the square root of
negative 1, which, if you

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.960
didn't know it, that's what i
is defined as, and I go on

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.240
many videos about the magical
of i and e and pi.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.100
Which point shows the location
of 5 minus 2i on the plane?

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.630
The x-axis is the real axis.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.240
You take the real part,
which is 5.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.840
So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.170
So that's the real part.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.400
Then the y-axis is the
imaginary axis.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.950
You take the imaginary part,
minus 2i, minus 2, right?

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.440
So you go down 2 in the i
direction and you're at point

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.610
D, which is choice D.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.490
Fair enough.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.300
That problem had a lot
of graphics but

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.540
was unusually simple.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.790
Next problem.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.800
OK, now they're giving us a
whole parade of imaginary

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.820
number questions.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.640
So this one I don't have to
cut, copy, and paste.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.810
They say if i is equal to the
square root of negative 1,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.770
which is a definition that we've
all learned, what is the

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.270
value of i to the fourth?

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.250
Well let's just go back.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.250
Let's say you've never seen
i before in your life.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:27.700
Let's think about it.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.915
If i is equal to negative 1--
sorry, this is negative 1.

00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:33.010
I know that negative looks
like it got messed up.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.549
Let's square both sides
of this equation.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:40.710
i squared will be equal
to negative 1.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.059
Now, let's square both sides
of this equation.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:49.100
i squared squared is equal
to negative 1 squared.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.900
Well, i squared squared is just
i to the fourth, right?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.790
2 times 2 is equal to negative
1 squared, which is

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.890
just equal to 1.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.545
And we're done.

00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:57.795
That's choice C.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.580
All right, now they have another
imaginary graph.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.085
So let me just copy and
paste this graph.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.190
I'll go here.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.720
There you go.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.070
I didn't have to erase
what I had before.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.660
The question they ask us: Which
of the following complex

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.330
numbers is represented by the
point on the graph below?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.226
So we just have to figure
out the real and

00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:26.060
the imaginary parts.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.020
So what's the real part?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.790
This coordinate, its
real part is 3.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.640
Its imaginary part is
minus 4 right there.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.640
So it's 3, and its imaginary
part, minus 4 in

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.620
the imaginary direction.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.090
