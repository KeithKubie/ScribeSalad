00:00:00.675 --> 00:00:02.061
- [Voiceover] We've already
seen and you're probably

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:04.527
getting tired of me
pointing it out repeatedly,

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:07.445
that this yellow area right
over here, this area under

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:09.550
the curve y is equal
to f of x and above the

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.737
positive x-axis or I
guess I can say just above

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:16.737
the x-axis between x
equals a and x equals b,

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:20.470
that we can denote this area
right over here as the definite

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.568
integral of from a to b of f of x dx.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.184
Now what I want to explore
in this video and it'll

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:30.084
come up with kind of an
answer that you probably

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:31.550
could have guessed on
your own, but at least get

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.695
an intuition for it,
is that I want to start

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:35.950
thinking about the area under the curve

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.961
that's a scaled version of f of x.

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.902
Let's say it's y is
equal to c times f of x.

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:45.266
Y is equal to some number times

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.116
f of x, so it's scaling f of x.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.836
And so I want this to be
kind of some arbitrary

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:52.038
number, but just to help me
visualize, you know I have

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:53.882
to draw something so I'm
just gonna kind of in my

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.739
head let's just pretend the c is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.653
a three for visualization purposes.

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.190
So it's going to be three
times, so instead of one,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.488
instead of this far right over here

00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:02.964
it's going to be about this far.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.381
For right over here, instead
of this far right over

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:09.114
here it's going to be that
and another right over there.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.495
And then instead of it's
going to be about there.

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.917
And then instead of it
being like that it's going

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:21.078
to be one, two and then
three, right around there.

00:01:21.537 --> 00:01:23.690
So I'm starting to get a
sense of what this curve

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.568
is going to look like, a
scaled version of f of x.

00:01:28.697 --> 00:01:30.966
And at least what I'm
drawing is pretty close to

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.250
three times f of x, but
just to give you an idea

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.959
is going to look something like,

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.741
and let's see over here if this distance,

00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.486
do a second one, a third
one, is gonna be up here.

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:42.511
It's gonna look something like this.

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.915
It's gonna look something like that.

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.916
So this is a scaled version
and the scale I did right here

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:52.916
I assumed a positive c greater than zero,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.679
but this is just for
visualization purposes.

00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:58.811
Now what do we think the area under this

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:01.570
curve is going to be between a and b?

00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:06.877
So what do we think this area

00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:11.766
right over here is going to be?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.390
Now we already know how we can denote it.

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:17.602
That area right over there
is equal to the definite

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:21.139
integral from a to b of the function

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.312
we're integrating is c f of x dx.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:29.045
I guess to make the question
a little bit clearer,

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.278
how does this relate to this?

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:34.921
How does this green area
relate to this yellow area?

00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:38.025
Well one way to think
about it is we just scaled

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:42.294
the vertical dimension up by
c, so one way that you could

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.574
reason it is if I'm finding
the area of something,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.803
if I have the area of a
rectangle and I have the

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:54.573
vertical dimension is
let's say I don't want to

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.476
use those same letters
over and over again.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.359
Well let's say the
vertical dimension is alpha

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.889
and the horizontal dimension is beta.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.643
We know that the area is
going to be alpha times beta.

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:10.776
Now if I scale up the
vertical dimension by c,

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:15.776
so instead of alpha this
is c times alpha and

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.538
this is, the width is beta,
if I scale up the vertical

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:25.520
dimension by c so this
is now c times alpha,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.640
what's the area going to be?

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:31.094
Well it's going to be c alpha times beta,

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:32.591
or another way to think of it,

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:36.767
when I scale one of the
dimensions by c I take my

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.127
old area and I scale
up my old area up by c.

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:41.449
And that's what we're doing, we're scaling

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.241
up the vertical dimension by c.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:44.847
When you multiply c times f of x,

00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:46.723
f of x is giving us the vertical height.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.937
Now obviously that
changes as our x changes,

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.829
but when you think back
to the Reimann sums

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.469
the f of x was what gave us
the height of our rectangles.

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:56.730
We're now scaling up the
height or scaling I should say

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.190
because we might be scaling
down depending on the c.

00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:02.408
We're scaling it, we're
scaling one dimension by c.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.982
If you scale one dimension by c

00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:05.681
you're gonna scale the area by c.

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.973
So this right over here, the integral,

00:04:08.973 --> 00:04:10.081
let me just rewrite it.

00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:15.255
The integral from a to b of c f of x dx,

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.407
that's just going to be
the scaled, we're just

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:20.707
going to take the area of f of x,

00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:23.071
so let me do that in the same color.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.320
We're going to take the
area under the curve

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.462
f of x from a to b f of x dx and

00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:34.462
we're just going to scale it up by this c.

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:39.164
So you might say, "Okay
maybe I could have felt

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:41.571
"that was, you know, if I
have a c inside the integral

00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:43.206
"now I can take the c
out of the integral",

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:46.513
and once again this is
not a rigorous proof based

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:49.044
on the definition of
the definite integral,

00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:50.184
but it hopefully gives you a little

00:04:50.184 --> 00:04:52.589
bit of intuition why you can do this.

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.414
If you scale up the
function, you're essentially

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.900
scaling up the vertical
dimension, so the area

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.939
under this is going to just be a scaled up

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.054
version of the area under
the original function f of x.

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:07.560
And once again really,
really, really useful

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.281
property of definite
integrals that's going to

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:14.497
help us solve a bunch
of definite integrals.

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:18.933
And kind of clarify what
we're even doing with them.
