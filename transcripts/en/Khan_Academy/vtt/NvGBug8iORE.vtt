00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.606
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.606 --> 00:00:03.013
Paige and I are here to teach you

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:05.858
about introductory elements in sentences

00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:08.846
and how commas relate to them.

00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:13.013
Paige, how should we define
what an introductory element is?

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:16.367
- [Voiceover] So, it's
pretty much something

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.665
that happens at the
beginning of a sentence.

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:22.165
It can be a dependent clause or an adverb.

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.333
But as we will see soon, it is something

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.820
that is separated off
with, of course, a comma.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.541
- [Voiceover] Because
that's what commas do.

00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.208
They are separators.

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:38.557
So, let's talk about
dependent clauses first.

00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:39.673
And let me just write out a sentence

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.407
that begins with a dependent clause.

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.724
"When you come in, please
take off your shoes."

00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:46.507
And I've made the difference
between the dependent clause

00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:48.363
and the independent clause pretty clear.

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:50.524
So, this the dependent clause is purple,

00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:53.679
the independent clause is green.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.384
Is there a need for a comma here?

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:57.217
- [Voiceover] Of course.

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:58.050
- [Voiceover] Okay.
(Paige laughs)

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.060
Because we're leading
with a dependent clause,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.113
and that means that this thing

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:03.073
can't stand on it's own, right?

00:01:03.073 --> 00:01:06.490
It's like the ladder up against the tree.

00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:12.736
Because an independent clause,

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:16.232
in green, can stand on its
own; a dependent clause cannot.

00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:18.891
So, we need to differentiate it

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.579
from the rest of the sentence
by putting the comma there.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.567
So, this is a dependent clause.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.910
And this is an independent clause.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.119
So, if you start a sentence
with a dependent clause,

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.711
you're gonna need to put
the comma in the middle

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.929
before you proceed to
the independent clause,

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.392
which is the part that makes it

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.141
an actual functioning sentence.

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:38.974
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.053
- [Voiceover] If you have it
the other way around though,

00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:44.080
if it's just, "Please take off
your shoes when you come in,"

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.423
no need for a comma.

00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:46.590
I'll show you.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.776
So, I'm not sure why this is.

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:03.590
I think it may just sort
of be a style relic.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.805
I'm not entirely certain.

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:07.106
I mean, if you go back in American history

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.609
and you look at the Federalist Papers

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.519
and you look at the way
that people used commas

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.017
in the 18th century, it doesn't
make a whole lot of sense,

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:16.882
relative to how we use commas today.

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.386
So, a lot of this is cultural.

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:21.711
But I can tell you that
when an independent clause

00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:25.774
comes before a dependent
clause, you don't use a comma.

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:29.460
And if you are uniting
two independent clauses,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.444
in the following sentence,
"I rode an elephant

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:33.066
"and then I ate a mango," these two things

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.941
are both independent clauses, right?

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:36.373
I rode an elephant.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:37.439
Then I ate a mango, right?

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.205
These two things need to be connected

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:42.856
by this conjunction, and.

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:43.903
But that's not all.

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:47.706
They also need to be joined by a comma.

00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:51.800
Now, you could also sub
out, if you wanted to,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.843
get rid of this comma and this
and and put in a semicolon,

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:56.959
but that's a story for another time.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.403
So, if you're uniting
two independent clauses,

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:02.851
just do comma and then a conjunction.

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:05.487
So, that's one way to think about

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:07.480
how to use commas for
introductory elements

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.510
like dependent and independent clauses.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.903
But there's also another thing
I wanna introduce you to,

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:13.611
and that's sentence adverbs.

00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:16.444
Follow us over to the next screen.

00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:21.683
So, Paige, what is a sentence adverb?

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:22.836
How does it work?

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:25.094
- [Voiceover] So, we've been talking about

00:03:25.094 --> 00:03:27.094
starting sentences with clauses,

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:29.092
but that doesn't always
have to be the case.

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:31.877
You can start a sentence with an adverb.

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:35.266
Like, let's say,
"Initially, I was afraid."

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.047
- [Voiceover] So, what is initially doing

00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:39.571
in this sentence here, in this expression?

00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:42.728
- [Voiceover] Basically, it's modifying

00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:44.072
the whole rest of the sentence.

00:03:44.072 --> 00:03:46.478
It's modifying the "I was afraid."

00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:48.020
- [Voiceover] So, we're
gonna put a comma here

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.949
to separate it from the
rest of that expression.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.551
That's why we call it a sentence adverb,

00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:54.555
'cause it's not, this is
not the same as saying,

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:56.360
"I was initially afraid."

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.746
This is kind of, like you said,

00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:00.281
modifying the entire expression.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.847
Let's look at another example.

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:04.357
- [Voiceover] "Basically,
you're the greatest."

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:05.599
- [Voiceover] Aww, thanks, Paige!

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.047
So, we've got this word, basically,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:11.145
and basically is modifying
the entire expression.

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:13.327
It's kind of qualifying the whole thing.

00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:14.160
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.993
- [Voiceover] So, we're gonna put a comma

00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:18.718
between this sentence adverb
and the sentence itself.

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:19.551
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.361
- [Voiceover] Cool, so, initially, Paige,

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.726
this seemed pretty complicated to me.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:28.715
- [Voiceover] Right, but,
basically, I think we got it down.

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:30.571
- [Voiceover] All right,
we think that, essentially,

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.747
you can learn anything.

00:04:32.747 --> 00:04:33.945
- [Voiceover] David out.
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
