00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.410
- [Instructor] Right over
here, figure b is a scaled copy

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.960
of figure a.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.550
What we want to do is figure out

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.570
what is the scale factor to
go from figure a to figure b?

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.323
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.050
All we have to do is look
at corresponding sides

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.280
and think about how much
they have been scaled by.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.340
For example, this side right over here

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.950
would correspond to this side
right over here on figure b.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.020
And over here, it had length two

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.830
and over here it has
length one, two three,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.020
four, five, six.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.320
So, it look like that
side has been scaled up

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.673
by a factor of three.

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:45.310
If figure b truly is a scaled copy,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.940
then every side should be
scaled up by a factor of three.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.773
We could verify that.

00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:51.050
We don't have to do it with every side.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.500
We're being told that
these are scaled copies

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.260
but we can see that this is the case.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.960
For example, this side right over here,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.350
corresponds to this base right over here.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.390
This has length three.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.760
So, if we're scaling up
by a factor of three,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460
we should multiply that by three

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.940
and this should be of length nine.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.260
Let's see if that's the case.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.990
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.350
seven, eight, and nine.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.870
So, you can see, we can feel pretty good

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.060
that figure b is a scaled copy of figure a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.893
and that scaling factor is three.
