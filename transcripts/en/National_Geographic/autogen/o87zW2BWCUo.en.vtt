about the the Rapids downstream but
 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.469
about the the Rapids downstream but
desert rivers and desert rapids are kind

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400
paddle up in the pool above the rapid
 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.710
paddle up in the pool above the rapid
and you got plenty of time to get nice

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720
and you got plenty of time to get nice
 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.210

and nervous and you're listening to the
 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.890
and nervous and you're listening to the
thundering of the rapid just downstream

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900
thundering of the rapid just downstream
 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.290
thundering of the rapid just downstream
and then you kind of break the horizon

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300
and then you kind of break the horizon
 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.390
and then you kind of break the horizon

are all these invasive plant species you

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250
are all these invasive plant species you
 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.250
are all these invasive plant species you
know gone are the beaches that that line

the upper stretch of the Colorado River
 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.930
the upper stretch of the Colorado River
and now there are these cracked sediment

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940
and now there are these cracked sediment
 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:32.500
and now there are these cracked sediment
banks and it's all very unwelcoming

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510
 
 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.880

and tribulations and unfortunately this
 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.420
and tribulations and unfortunately this
adventure I got the brunt of those

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430
adventure I got the brunt of those
 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.530
adventure I got the brunt of those
tribulations I stepped into the sand

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:47.540
tribulations I stepped into the sand
 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.340

where the fire pan had been sitting and

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350
where the fire pan had been sitting and
 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.630
where the fire pan had been sitting and
I had gotten second-degree burns on the

I had gotten second-degree burns on the
 

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.020
I had gotten second-degree burns on the
top and bottom of my foot I found a

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.030
top and bottom of my foot I found a
 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.060
top and bottom of my foot I found a
broken oar at camp the next night and

broken oar at camp the next night and
 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.490
broken oar at camp the next night and
used it as a as a cane hobbling along

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.500
used it as a as a cane hobbling along
 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.680

and then when we got off the river it

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:08.690
and then when we got off the river it
 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.480
and then when we got off the river it
was decided that I was going to go home

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.490
was decided that I was going to go home
 

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.200
was decided that I was going to go home
which was really hard I was pretty

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.210
which was really hard I was pretty
 

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.140
which was really hard I was pretty
devastated you know we'd been prepping

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.150
devastated you know we'd been prepping
 

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.180
devastated you know we'd been prepping
for this trip for almost a year and I

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.190
for this trip for almost a year and I
 

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.600
for this trip for almost a year and I
was having the time of my life and so I

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.610
was having the time of my life and so I
 

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.710
was having the time of my life and so I
ended up going home for two and a half

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720
ended up going home for two and a half
 

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.580
ended up going home for two and a half
weeks when I rejoined them about 17 days

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:27.590
weeks when I rejoined them about 17 days
 

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:41.750
weeks when I rejoined them about 17 days
later I was counting

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760
 
 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.950
 
after we got off the river and before we

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:43.960
after we got off the river and before we
 

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.510
after we got off the river and before we
began the reservoir portion of our

expedition there were a bunch of

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.410
expedition there were a bunch of
 

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.140
expedition there were a bunch of
questions that we all really wanted

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.150
questions that we all really wanted
 

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.730
questions that we all really wanted
answered one of the things you hear a

answered one of the things you hear a
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.320
answered one of the things you hear a
lot about when it comes to the Colorado

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.330
lot about when it comes to the Colorado
 

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.650

Colorado is probably the most heavily
 

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.730
Colorado is probably the most heavily

where there's not a single drop of water

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.210
where there's not a single drop of water
 

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.090
where there's not a single drop of water
left the river simply dies it never even

reaches the Sea of Cortez
 

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.960
reaches the Sea of Cortez
that's how heavily we have used this

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:27.970
that's how heavily we have used this
 

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:35.550
that's how heavily we have used this
thing we've literally killed it a lot of

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560
thing we've literally killed it a lot of
 

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.770
thing we've literally killed it a lot of
these dams that control the river

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:37.780
these dams that control the river
 

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.660
these dams that control the river
there's no way they would have been

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:39.670
there's no way they would have been
 

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.340
there's no way they would have been
built today they were all built in the

built today they were all built in the
 

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.920
built today they were all built in the
50s and 60s and one of the questions I

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:43.930
50s and 60s and one of the questions I
 

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.180
50s and 60s and one of the questions I
had was you know if they wouldn't be

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.190
had was you know if they wouldn't be
 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.090
had was you know if they wouldn't be
built today why were they built 50 years

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.100
built today why were they built 50 years
 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.330
built today why were they built 50 years
ago so the river is over allocated for a

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.340
ago so the river is over allocated for a
 

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.860
ago so the river is over allocated for a
lot of reasons a lot of historical

reasons that really have to do with the
 

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.880
reasons that really have to do with the
way the western United States developed

00:09:59.880 --> 00:09:59.890
way the western United States developed
 

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.060
way the western United States developed
there was a huge expansion of the West

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.070
there was a huge expansion of the West
 

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.320
there was a huge expansion of the West
in the late 1800s and the early 1900s

in the late 1800s and the early 1900s
 

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.360
in the late 1800s and the early 1900s
populations started to move from the

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.370
populations started to move from the
 

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.760
populations started to move from the
eastern United States into the western

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:11.770
eastern United States into the western
 

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.340
eastern United States into the western
US and they brought with them their

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:14.350
US and they brought with them their
 

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.170
US and they brought with them their
demand for water and their demand for

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:16.180
demand for water and their demand for
 

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.030
demand for water and their demand for
water took the form of agricultural

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040
water took the form of agricultural
 

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.310
water took the form of agricultural
demands for water but also the

demands for water but also the
 

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.860
demands for water but also the
communities that we developed were

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:21.870
communities that we developed were
 

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.420
communities that we developed were
designed like Eastern communities with

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:24.430
designed like Eastern communities with
 

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.240
designed like Eastern communities with
big lawns and and bigger urban household

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.250
big lawns and and bigger urban household
 

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.100
big lawns and and bigger urban household
demands for water and all of those

Dam was built one of the things that the

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:28.970
Dam was built one of the things that the
 

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.180

that simply was not true there were
 

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:45.670
that simply was not true there were
people living in Glen Canyon before the

people living in Glen Canyon before the
 

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.569
people living in Glen Canyon before the

lot on river trips as a kid and what you
 

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.790
lot on river trips as a kid and what you
see at this put in is a massive sign

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:55.800

waterfall this is what we plan to do

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480
waterfall this is what we plan to do
 

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.520
waterfall this is what we plan to do
we're going along like is that the

there are these tiny little riffles and
 

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.860
there are these tiny little riffles and
like small drops like maybe this is it

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:09.870
like small drops like maybe this is it
 

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.420
like small drops like maybe this is it
and it's just changed and it's become

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:11.430
and it's just changed and it's become

eroded have we already passed the

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860
eroded have we already passed the
 

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.300
eroded have we already passed the
waterfall when we were actually near the

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:17.310
waterfall when we were actually near the
 

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.310
waterfall when we were actually near the
waterfall it became quite evident

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320
 
 

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.620
 
so we're standing on top of Paiute Falls

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:24.630
so we're standing on top of Paiute Falls
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.500
so we're standing on top of Paiute Falls
on the San Juan River and this big

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:27.510
on the San Juan River and this big
 

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.880
on the San Juan River and this big
waterfall that were standing on top of

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:28.890
waterfall that were standing on top of
 

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.440
waterfall that were standing on top of
is actually a result of the reservoir

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:30.450
is actually a result of the reservoir
 

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.650
is actually a result of the reservoir
when the lake was all the way up here

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:32.660
when the lake was all the way up here
 

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.150
when the lake was all the way up here
the San Juan brought in just tons and

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160
the San Juan brought in just tons and
 

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.220
the San Juan brought in just tons and
tons of sediments all of that sediment

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:37.230
tons of sediments all of that sediment
 

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.080
tons of sediments all of that sediment
actually diverted the river away from

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.090
actually diverted the river away from
 

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.540
actually diverted the river away from
its original course and it ended up now

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:41.550
its original course and it ended up now
 

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.370
its original course and it ended up now
pouring off of this big beauty were

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380
pouring off of this big beauty were
 

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.410
pouring off of this big beauty were
standing on top of we've got to find a

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:45.420
standing on top of we've got to find a
 

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.240
standing on top of we've got to find a
way to get our big fully loaded kayaks

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.250
way to get our big fully loaded kayaks
 

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:54.140

around this waterfall we wanted

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.150
around this waterfall we wanted
 

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.430
around this waterfall we wanted
originally we wanted to go to the left

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440
originally we wanted to go to the left
 

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.750
originally we wanted to go to the left
side of the waterfall but there's a lot

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760
side of the waterfall but there's a lot
 

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.460
side of the waterfall but there's a lot
of current over there and we don't

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:58.470
of current over there and we don't
 

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.160
of current over there and we don't
really want to be swept over it so what

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.170
really want to be swept over it so what
 

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.380
really want to be swept over it so what
we're going to try to do is bring our

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.390
we're going to try to do is bring our
 

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.610
we're going to try to do is bring our
boats up to the edge of this little

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620
boats up to the edge of this little
 

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.780

and to kind of pass them down to a point

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:08.970
and to kind of pass them down to a point
 

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.430
and to kind of pass them down to a point
where we can do some sort of a little

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440
where we can do some sort of a little
 

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.350
where we can do some sort of a little
