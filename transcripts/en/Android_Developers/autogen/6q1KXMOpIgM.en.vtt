what's the difference the main

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410
what's the difference the main
 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.160
what's the difference the main
difference is that put is an item potent

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170
difference is that put is an item potent
 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.590
difference is that put is an item potent
call and what does that mean well that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600
call and what does that mean well that
 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.300
call and what does that mean well that
means that if you make the same put call

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
means that if you make the same put call
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.789
means that if you make the same put call
over and over again the result on the

that shopping cart that would not be
idempotent I would go from 12 to 23 24

then be a post call on the other hand if

put one bottle of shampoo in my shopping
 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.899
put one bottle of shampoo in my shopping
cart then that would be a put call

be the fact that we use the word get

be the fact that we use the word get
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.700
be the fact that we use the word get
right there on the left so keep that in

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710

a post call and if you think about it

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380
a post call and if you think about it
 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.020
a post call and if you think about it
that kind of makes sense if we had an

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030
that kind of makes sense if we had an
 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.990
that kind of makes sense if we had an
achievement to say earn 100 coins and we

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
achievement to say earn 100 coins and we
 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.580
achievement to say earn 100 coins and we
made a call to increment achievement by

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590
made a call to increment achievement by
 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.650
made a call to increment achievement by
five coins you would expect that every

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660
five coins you would expect that every
 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.480
five coins you would expect that every
time we made that call it would go from

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490
time we made that call it would go from
 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.030
time we made that call it would go from
five coins to ten coins to 15 to 20 and

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040
five coins to ten coins to 15 to 20 and
 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.520
five coins to ten coins to 15 to 20 and
so on right that call is not idempotent

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530
so on right that call is not idempotent
 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.710
so on right that call is not idempotent
it would be different every time we made

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720
it would be different every time we made
 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.320
it would be different every time we made

that call how about unlocking an
achievement now if you were to say put

you might be right and our judges will

you might be right and our judges will
 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.370
you might be right and our judges will
give you credit for that because if you

give you credit for that because if you
 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.570
give you credit for that because if you
think about it if you were to make that

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580
think about it if you were to make that
 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.250

that achievement would still stay

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120
that achievement would still stay
 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.910

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.820
about this cloud save data that we're
giving it all it does is it copies and

and review that call we made at the

and review that call we made at the
 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.360
and review that call we made at the

technically this looks like we're

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720
technically this looks like we're
 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.510
technically this looks like we're

it seems weird that we're kind of

it seems weird that we're kind of
blurring the lines between accessing a

is basically a good thing one of the

nice advantages of accessing rest
 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.840
nice advantages of accessing rest
service over HTTP is that you can do

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.850
service over HTTP is that you can do
 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.580
service over HTTP is that you can do
things like ping the service directly in

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590
things like ping the service directly in
 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.250
things like ping the service directly in
your browser or make a curl call and you

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.260
your browser or make a curl call and you
 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.990
your browser or make a curl call and you
can analyze the data that way without

having to write your own client that's

you'll also notice by the way that this

you'll also notice by the way that this

be talking about him second it tells the

I did this all in an incognito window so

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:37.810
I did this all in an incognito window so
 

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.510
I did this all in an incognito window so
this access key was basically the only

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:39.520
this access key was basically the only
 

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.670
this access key was basically the only
thing the service had to go on to know

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680
thing the service had to go on to know
 

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.650
thing the service had to go on to know
that the person who made this call was

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:43.660
that the person who made this call was
 

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.810
that the person who made this call was
Todd Kerpelman and this means you have

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:45.820
Todd Kerpelman and this means you have
 

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.310
Todd Kerpelman and this means you have
to be pretty careful about these access

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320
to be pretty careful about these access
 

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.260
to be pretty careful about these access
tokens if someone else were to see this

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.270
tokens if someone else were to see this
 

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.720
tokens if someone else were to see this
video in the next 60 minutes and they

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:51.730
video in the next 60 minutes and they
 

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.550
video in the next 60 minutes and they
copied that access token they could

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560
copied that access token they could
 

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.930
copied that access token they could
essentially hit the play game service

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:54.940
essentially hit the play game service
 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.880
essentially hit the play game service
pretending that they were me because

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:56.890
pretending that they were me because
 

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.790
pretending that they were me because
they have my access token that token is

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800
they have my access token that token is
 

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.170
they have my access token that token is
really the only thing that identifies

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.180
really the only thing that identifies
 

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.180
really the only thing that identifies
who I am there's a reason you know it's

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.190
who I am there's a reason you know it's
 

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.830
who I am there's a reason you know it's
called bearer token and that's because

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:04.840
called bearer token and that's because
 

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.710
called bearer token and that's because
the powers of that kia are associated

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720
the powers of that kia are associated
 

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.660
the powers of that kia are associated
with the owner or bearer of that togan

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:09.670
with the owner or bearer of that togan
 

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.519
with the owner or bearer of that togan
and so you need to treat these things

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:11.529
and so you need to treat these things
 

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:13.079
and so you need to treat these things
with the same kind of respect you would

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:13.089
with the same kind of respect you would
 

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:15.240
with the same kind of respect you would
treat a password that means for starters

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.250
treat a password that means for starters
 

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.370
treat a password that means for starters

where anybody could copy and paste it
that would be a terrible idea in

that would be a terrible idea in
 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.340
that would be a terrible idea in
practice this means you would not add it

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.350
practice this means you would not add it
 

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.650

would more typically send the access
