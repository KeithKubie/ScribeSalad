IS... WHAT ARE HOINTS?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.073
&gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT THE WORD POINTS

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.975
WAS A LITTLE NEGATIVE, BECAUSE

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.943
IT'S RUDE TO POINT AT PEOPLE.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.712
SO WE CAME UP WITH HOINTS, WHICH

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.547
