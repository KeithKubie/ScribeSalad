00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:01.860
Let's think a little
bit about what

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.070
it means to multiply
2/3 times 6.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.370
One way to think about it
is to literally take six 2/3

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.390
and add them together.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.930
This is six 2/3 right over here.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.230
And if we wanted to
actually compute this,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.400
this would be equal
to-- well, we're

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
going to take these six
2's and add them together.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.840
So we could view it
as 2 times 6 over 3.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.740
2 times 6 over 3, which
is the same thing,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.010
of course, as 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12, 12/3.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.980
And what is 12/3 equal to?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.040
Well, we could rewrite
12 as-- so this is equal

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.790
to-- we could rewrite 12
as 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.540
over the yellow 3.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.590
Let me do it like
this so I don't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.340
have to keep switching colors.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.450
This is going to be
the same thing as 3/3

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.734
plus 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:12.400
And each of these are
obviously a whole.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.803
Each of these equal 1.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.330
That's 1 and that's 1, so this
is going to be equal to 4.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.260
So that's one way to
conceptualize 2/3 times 6.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.970
Another way to think
of it is as 2/3 of 6.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.530
So let's think about that.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.360
Let me draw a number line here.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350
And I'm going to draw
the number line up to 6.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.330
So what I care about is the
section of the number line

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.980
that goes to 6.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.600
So that looks pretty good.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:52.820
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.120
So if we want to
take 2/3 of 6, we

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.650
can think of this whole
section of the number

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.080
line between 0 and
6 as the whole.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.345
And then we want to
take 2/3 of that.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:06.220
So how do we do that?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.400
Well, we divide it into thirds,
to three equals sections.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.460
So that's one equal
section, two equal sections,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.880
and three equal sections.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.790
And we want two of those thirds.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.080
So we want 1/3 and 2/3.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.590
Now where does that get us?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.070
That gets us to 4.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.160
So we get, obviously,
to the same answer.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.437
We would be in a tough
situation if somehow we

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:29.520
got two different answers.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.450
Either way, 2/3
times 6 or 6 times

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.540
2/3, either way, that is
going to be equal to 4.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.710
But there are two different
ways of viewing this.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.470
This first way is literally
viewing it as 2/3 six times.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.700
And this way is we're taking
a fraction of the number 6.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.208
We're going 2/3 of the way to
6, which would get us to 4.
