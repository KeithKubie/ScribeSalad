00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.312
- So I'm here with Stu Schmill,
Dean of Admissions at MIT.

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:07.121
Thanks for joining me.

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.862
- Sure, happy to, Sal.

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:10.817
- So what I wanted to ask you about is,

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:13.424
it's just the general
notion of, well, of course,

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.686
college admissions, but in particular,

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.288
there tends to be some stereotypes

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:20.594
in terms of what makes
a competitive applicant,

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.401
and I'll just throw out,
at least my stereotype of,

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.874
you take, i don't know,
five, six AP courses

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:27.996
and you do really well in them,

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.434
you have a very high SAT score,

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.509
your GPA is near perfect,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.739
you're close to the top of your class,

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.142
you're vice-president or president

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:39.976
of three or four clubs,

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.975
you play first viola in
the symphony or whatever,

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.352
whatever it might be--

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:46.497
- Or all of those, yes.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.026
- All of those, so how much truth

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:51.713
is there to that and or not?

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.205
- Well, I think the things
that you've just described

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:58.352
are components

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.470
that a certain student might have

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.716
as part of their
application, and it is not

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:09.451
the first way that we think about

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.947
evaluating students.

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:15.843
So, we think about
trying to enroll students

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.410
that are going to succeed

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.150
academically on our campuses,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
who are going to be
well-matched to our institution,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.028
so that the kinds of things that motivates

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:32.920
those students, that get them excited,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.779
are the things and the
culture on our campus,

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.105
and then we think about
what kind of contributions

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:42.693
that those students might be
able to make to our campuses,

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:46.942
which might mean any particular kinds of

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:48.795
talent that they have, but also

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:50.872
how engaged they're going to be

00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:53.485
in the life of the university.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:56.468
So that's really the lens
that we're looking through

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:58.972
and students can manifest those things

00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:03.337
and demonstrate those
things in different ways.

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:06.688
So, you talked about a number of

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:08.740
AP classes and things like that

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.534
that students might have, and for us,

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:15.830
we're looking at the choices
that students have made

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.006
around their academics but
also their non-academics,

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.534
so academically, we want to see

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:24.296
that students are challenging themselves

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:28.128
in the things that really interest them,

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:32.141
and students can do that in
any number of different ways.

00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:36.110
So AP classes may be one,
but there are other ways

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.286
of doing that as well,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:40.642
and not all students have
even access to AP classes.

00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:47.022
And it's not as though
there's a particular tally

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:50.853
or score sheet that we have

00:02:50.853 --> 00:02:54.772
where we're looking at a student's record

00:02:54.772 --> 00:02:57.372
and saying they have
to have certain markers

00:02:57.372 --> 00:03:00.315
because, really, there are all
different kinds of markers,

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:02.905
all different ways that
students can demonstrate

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:04.577
these different talents.

00:03:04.577 --> 00:03:09.209
So if certainly, academically,
as I said earlier,

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.544
not all students have
access to taking AP classes,

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:13.628
so there may be other ways

00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:15.811
that students can demonstrate to us

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.745
that academically
they're going to be ready

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:20.620
to succeed on our campus.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.647
- So there are these two realities.

00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:24.309
On one extreme, you have,

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.278
and this is maybe the
more traditional reality,

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:28.370
that students taking a lot
of very rigorous courses,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.180
doing a lot of homework, staying
until 2:00 in the morning,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.423
they're very stressed out,

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:35.780
they, frankly, don't have
time to pursue their passions.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.452
On the other side, you could have students

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:40.845
who aren't in a traditional system maybe,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.914
and maybe they don't even
have traditional grades,

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:43.944
but they're able to show evidence

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:47.322
of their academic knowledge
through a standardized test,

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.361
through, maybe they take things like

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.575
the AP tests themselves, maybe
independent study for it,

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:54.584
maybe they take some college courses,

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:56.601
but they have more time
to pursue their passions

00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:58.225
and build portfolios,

00:03:58.225 --> 00:03:59.458
I mean, on some levels,
basically what I'm hearing,

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:01.010
it sounds like that second
string might even be

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.949
at an advantage.

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.019
- I think students that
are overloading themselves,

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.605
their coursework,

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:11.404
where they don't leave any
time for anything else,

00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:14.121
are definitely doing
themselves a disservice.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.391
I think students, again,
challenge themselves

00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:18.411
in the areas that interest them,

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.650
but I think students also really need to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.236
leave themselves time and capacity

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:28.559
to pursue more independent projects.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.086
Independent, I don't mean by themselves,

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:32.360
independent projects could mean

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.078
with other people, certainly,

00:04:34.078 --> 00:04:37.306
but these other projects
that allow students

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.604
to use some creativity

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:43.473
and independent thought

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:45.859
in coming up with some
new and interesting things

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:49.794
in whatever topics interest them,

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:50.899
those are the kinds of things

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.894
that we also really like to see

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.482
students submit as part
of their application,

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:57.627
we really like to see it,

00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:01.819
and those kinds of projects
can really help students,

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.758
because it can show them, it can show us,

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:07.029
kinds of things that
students might want to pursue

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.211
once they come to campus,

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:11.480
and, so, on the academic side,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.322
really, we're just looking for evidence

00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:15.418
that students are talented and capable,

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:19.238
and that they're gonna
do well, and beyond that,

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:22.339
we're looking at the rest of it, and those

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.096
portfolios that students can submit

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.456
showing the independent work they've done

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:30.995
can really enhance their applications.

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.022
- So a student, just to make it concrete,

00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:35.073
a student with strong SAT scores,

00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:36.664
ones that we show are ACT scores,

00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:39.427
that show evidence that they'll
do well at a place like MIT,

00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:41.278
strong, maybe, AP scores,

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.981
and the rigorous ones that
they have an interest in,

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.871
plus a portfolio of things that they've,

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:49.101
substantive things that they've done,

00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:50.571
not just, kind of, cookbook projects,

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:54.201
but things that will
really show their passions,

00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:57.937
they would have a strong application.

00:05:57.937 --> 00:06:01.225
- Those students would have
a very strong application.

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.127
- So that brings up another
interesting dimension,

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.364
I mean, at the other extreme end of this,

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.695
you do have some home schooled students,

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:09.872
you have this unschooling movement,

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:11.084
but how do you evaluate those students,

00:06:11.084 --> 00:06:13.153
and actually even compare
them relative to the students

00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:14.531
who are taking the five AP classes

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:16.883
in a traditional college prep school?

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:17.551
- Right.

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.204
So, I think thinking about
home schooled students

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:22.672
is a great way

00:06:22.672 --> 00:06:24.964
to demonstrate the fact that

00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:27.575
it's not just about the AP classes

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:30.056
because we have home schooled students

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.305
who were very successful

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:34.674
and who do successful in
our process, certainly,

00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:38.481
but also become very
successful once at MIT.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.932
We do need evidence, though,
that they're going to do well,

00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:43.448
and there are a number of ways

00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:47.248
that students can demonstrate that to us.

00:06:47.248 --> 00:06:50.471
It is one of the reasons why
we require standardized tests,

00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:53.114
I mean, that's one piece of information.

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:56.640
It's not all of it, but it's one.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.652
Some students, right,

00:06:57.652 --> 00:07:01.489
who are not in traditional
schooling pathways

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:05.408
will still take classes

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:06.485
in less traditional ways,

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:10.071
so some will take classes at
local colleges, for example,

00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:14.065
and be able to demonstrate
their ability that way.

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:17.457
And then there are other various kinds of,

00:07:17.457 --> 00:07:19.091
of ways students can do it,

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:22.377
for example, the American Math Competition

00:07:22.377 --> 00:07:25.821
offers these competitions
where students who have a

00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:29.439
high ability in math can
do well on these exams

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:33.846
and progress towards and
through the Olympiad program,

00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:35.903
and it's a way for students
to demonstrate, again,

00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.789
their talents, at least in
math, so that's one example,

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.487
and there are other ways like that.

00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:44.831
So we're open to evaluating
all kinds of evidence

00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:48.267
that students can present to us

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:50.097
to demonstrate

00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:54.664
their ability to succeed
once they come here.

00:07:55.144 --> 00:07:58.072
- Well, thank you, I think
that this is really exciting.

00:07:58.072 --> 00:07:59.330
I think I have some young
people I need to call

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.829
and tell them about it.
(Stu laughs)

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:02.834
- That's great, send them our way.

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.126
(Sal laughs softly)
