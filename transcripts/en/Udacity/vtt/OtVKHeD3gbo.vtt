goes into a country where
it finds an animal and

from its perspective knows that this
animal has wings and does not have fur.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.760
So these two additional centers
is gotten in the knowledge base.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.160
Now the robot wants to
prove that this is a bird.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.230
In order to [INAUDIBLE] proving,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.310
