00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Big History
and today we're going to talk about the Anthropocene.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.900
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Anthropocene? What does
that even mean? That sounds like gibberish.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.840
No, Me From the Past, your tenth grade essays
were gibberish. The Anthropocene is a word

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.080
derived from the Greek word for human. Like
you know how anthropologists study humans?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.800
Well, the Anthropocene is an unofficial
geologic era where humans have

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.820
an immense influence over the biosphere.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.220
But I want to emphasize that it is unofficial
because geologists are a vicious and terrifying

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.560
bunch and the word is not official until they
say it's official. But even if it's not yet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.960
a word, the underlying concept is very useful.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.449
So due to the intensification of collective
learning and the continued rise of complexity

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.479
we've been talking about, you could argue
that more change has happened in the past

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.999
century than in the previous, like, 250,000
years of human history.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.240
And it's all roughly within living memory.
You, your parents and your grandparents have

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.829
lived in one of the most complex and interesting
times ever.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:03.700
[Theme Music]

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.560
So, since 1800, we've had a Cambrian explosion
of innovation and discovery, like in the last

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.960
few years alone we've discovered a fundamental
particle that weaves together the fabric of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.079
the universe - The Higgs Boson. We discovered
the largest ever black hole, which is about

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.379
17 billion times the mass of our sun, we found
preserved woolly mammoth blood, we even have

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.680
electric cars that go more than 125 miles
per hour.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.079
Although, you should drive them more slowly,
obviously.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.520
We've grown to a population of seven billion
people and your phone has more computing power

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.539
than all of NASA did when they sent men to
the Moon in 1969.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.899
And collective learning is increasing exponentially,
here's Emily Graslie from The Brain Scoop

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.959
to help us understand the scale of that growth
of knowledge.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.360
As human populations grow exponentially, collective
learning is undergoing a snowball effect.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.680
In humanity's first 250,000 years as foragers,
about nine billion people lived and died.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.840
Thanks to agriculture in the last thousand
years, about 55 billion people have lived

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.680
and died, and seven billion of them are around
now.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.620
This is great for rising complexity. We now
live in a unified global network of billions

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.200
of brains. Communication is almost instantaneous
and we harness the power of the Earth and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.090
Sun on a massive scale. The potential for
new breakthroughs in technology or in our

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.000
understanding of the cosmos is heightened
by all of this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.300
It's all part of the continuous rising complexity in Big
History, a trend that has been preceding for over 13.8

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.860
billion years -- from gas clouds to stars to single-celled
organisms to trilobites to dinosaurs to culture.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.640
The beginnings of the Anthropocene weren't
all sunshine and daisies, however.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.760
The late 19th century was marked by an increase
in the destructiveness of weaponry, a number

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.460
of colonial empires covered the entire Earth,
with the exception of a few non-European states

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.420
which managed to maintain their independence,
and mounting nationalism and bigotry led to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.360
some terrible chaos in the early 20th century.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.420
World War I killed 15 million people, the
Spanish flu which followed it and spread largely

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.530
as a result of the unified global system that
had previously been so valuable to collective

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.760
learning killed off three times as many, and
50 million people were killed during World

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.840
War II. Such is the devastating cost of increased
innovation and connectivity.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.360
Following World War II, a new wave of industrialization
entered East Asia, Central and South America,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.590
The Middle East and other areas. Newly developed
crops, especially strains of wheat and rice,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.660
helped places like India and China, which
in the mid-20th century still suffered famines.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.890
Their populations exploded for better or worse,
and we harnessed the power of atomic fission,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.730
putting immense power in the hands of humans
to be used for good or ill.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.750
It's the threat of nuclear holocaust combined
with the possibility of an asteroid impact

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.370
or super-volcanic eruption that makes scientists
like Stephen Hawking encourage the colonization

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.530
of the Solar System to increase the chances
of our species surviving.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.220
Coping with scarcity is the bottom line of much
of organic history encompassing all species,
including humans.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.260
So for most of human history the world
was separated into four isolated zones.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.540
The agrarian communities within those zones were
largely subdivided into separate social orders and

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.710
classes and varying degrees of wealth.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.980
And the number of the wealthy, landed gentry
and aristocrats in the average agrarian civilization,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.520
whether it was Mughal India or Louis XIV's
France, was between ten and twenty percent

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.310
of the total population. So, at most, twenty
percent of people were not poor.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.620
Today, in a united global system (I mean,
except for North Korea) if you earn more than

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.560
roughly $20,000 per year, as most working
adults in the developed world do, you are

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.480
in the top 20% of the world's richest people.
You are part of the global aristocracy.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.900
But I should note that a couple things definitely
have changed. For one thing, if you are

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.480
part of the global aristocracy, you are enjoying
a standard of living better than what kings

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.660
had only a couple centuries ago. You probably
have a refrigerator. You flip a switch and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.620
the lights come on. You have antibiotics,
at least for a few more years. I mean, admittedly

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.320
Netflix doesn't have any of the good movies,
but that's still a better entertainment option

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.880
than what Louis XIV had. All he had was public
executions. And hopefully the average person

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.260
in the developed world today is a little more
enlightened about the challenges of poverty

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.900
than an 18th century aristocrat would have
been, but the jury is still out on that one.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.280
I mean that's why "first world problems" is
a meme, right? But, how we behave toward the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.700
developing world in the next 100 years will
determine much of how we are viewed not only

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.960
by them, but by the thousands of future generations
that come after us and read of our deeds in history.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.280
So, is human history a story of progress where
life has become better for most people over

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.200
the course of 250,000 years and will life continue
to get better for most people during the Anthropocene?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.700
We're going to try to answer that by looking
at the Anthropocene in light and shade, which

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.980
is basically just a list of pros and cons.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.780
Pro - Since 1970, manufacturing jobs have
lifted approximately 600 million people out

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.600
of poverty, modern technologies can now feed
and clothe more humans than ever before.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.000
Con - More people in the developing world
are forced from traditional ways of life and

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.590
into factory jobs with poor safety standards,
long hours and measly wages. And a lot of

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.090
the goods that they produce go overseas to
enhance the standard of living of a prosperous

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.200
and wealthy developed world. And while the
ratio of impoverished to wealthy countries

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.700
in 1820 was about 3:1, today it's closer to
72:1. Standards of living may be increasing

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.850
on average, but the wealth inequality gap
is getting wider and wider.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.730
But pro - we have managed to harness a lot
of energy, our use of coal and oil and nuclear

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.940
power. These energy flows have allowed us
to generate an astounding amount of complexity

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.860
in our little corner of the universe and improved
people's standards of living.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.480
Yeah, but con - current modes of production
rely heavily on non-renewable resources that

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.920
are not great for the environment. Unless you've
been hiding under a rock for the past twenty years,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.580
you will probably have heard of climate change
and the potentially devastating effects it will have.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.960
Furthermore, as humanity continues to force
the environment to adapt to our needs, we

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.300
are accelerating the rate of extinction of plant and animal species that don't happen to be useful to us.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.639
One of the reasons we call this period the
Anthropocene is, if humanity were to suddenly

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.780
disappear and aliens were to land on Earth
500 million years later and start excavating,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.919
even if they saw no sign of the humans on
the fossil record, they would see a mass extinction

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.819
event rivaling the five most devastating mass
extinctions in pre-human history.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.699
Pro - collective learning's advances in medicine,
agriculture and genetic engineering have in

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.350
the past 200 years lowered the death rate
and freed billions of people from the cycles

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.510
of starvation and famine that affected agrarian
civilizations.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.900
Con - the tremendous expansion of populations
in India and China have created a severe problem

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.889
for the infrastructures of those countries.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.870
We now have seven billion people on Earth
and we'll grow to between 9.6 and 12 billion

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.580
later in the century.
Yet, at our current rates of consumption and

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.240
modes of production, the world could only
support a population of two or three billion

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.460
people who enjoyed the same standard of living
as people in the United States do.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.580
China's population may level off by around
2050, India's might level off by 2070, but

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.510
Sub-Saharan Africa, a region of the world
that already suffers from the highest levels

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.530
of poverty and is least equipped to deal with
problems of overpopulation is set to expand

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.220
enormously even past the year 2100.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.060
Add to this the likelihood that climate change
will reduce the amount of arable cropland

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.550
on the Earth by 10-25% and we may have a severe
population problem on our hands. And as we

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.660
can see from the population cycles of the agrarian
period, overpopulation tends to spark more violence.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.760
Pro - in the long term, development of a country's
economy tends to change demographic trends.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.220
While an agrarian civilization benefited greatly
from a farmer having half a dozen kids, first

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:29.760
to combat the high infant mortality rate,
and second, because by the time they were

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.180
twelve, they could help out at the farm, today, kids
take 18-22 years to educate and they're expensive.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.180
Also, adults end up having other
opportunities open to them. Fewer kids, more

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.400
hours on the Xbox or pursuing a law degree
or a high-flying business career, whatever.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.900
Economic development can slow population growth.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.600
And many of the developed regions' of
the world populations are stabilizing,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.700
which is why it is important to foster
economic growth in places like Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.559
Con - but what drives a lot of the economic
growth? Energy production, and developing

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:04.249
countries are more prone to use inexpensive,
fast and dirty forms of fuel to develop, rather

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:08.720
than more expensive, eco-friendly alternatives.
This compounds the environmental problem,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.569
which in turn can mess up the environment
and compound the population problem.

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:17.809
So it turns out, it's complicated and we are
a little bit ambivalent about the Anthropocene.

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:22.129
In the next century, humanity's population
growth will continue, but it'll hopefully

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:27.409
level off between 10 and 12 billion people
due to declining birth rates. If it doesn't,

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:31.220
we might be in trouble. Well, we'll definitely be in
trouble at some point, we just don't know when.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.520
But even if it does level off, we've still
got problems concerning how to support all

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:40.740
those people at a decent standard of living
and how to find the energy to fuel that process.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.860
I mean, we're talking about between
10 and 12 billion people?

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.860
The first time the world's population got to
one billion humans was 1804.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.139
So right now, we're still heavily dependent
on non-renewable fossil fuels.

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:56.850
Well, technically, they are renewable but
you need, like, a 100 million years.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.470
But there are a few possible future scenarios.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.260
One - we are miraculously saved by some technology
in the same way that the industrial revolution

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:08.259
lifted humanity out of the recurring cycles
of famine in the agrarian era.

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:12.679
Two - we collapse miserably into ruins and ashes.
I don't like "two," Stan, is there an option three?

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:16.619
Oh there is, that's good news!
Three - we can guide human society into a

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.760
"creative descent," a gentle decline of complexity
to more simple, subsistence living.

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:25.720
Actually, you know what, I'm not crazy about
"three" either, I am all for "one."

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.840
Now, at present, we don't know what scenario
will play out. We're acting as if we will

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.339
be saved by some technology, and in fact,
that's the only way that leads to the continuing

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:37.559
rise of complexity, but we can't just assume
that will happen.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.399
And as for the potential dangers of the 21st century,
there are environmental disasters, the rise

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.120
of a superbug that wipes out millions upon millions
of people, possible global conflict or a rise in instability.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.240
The next fifty years will be fraught with
a lot of risk.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.820
But if we can somehow make it through what some
call the 21st century bottleneck, things start to brighten again.

00:10:57.829 --> 00:11:03.249
We'll be a stable population of 10-12 billion
increasingly well-educated and interconnected

00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:06.909
innovators, and that's great for
collective learning in the 21st century.

00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:09.360
Who knows where such massive potential could lead?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.520
It's important to remember that while there
are seven billion people in the world right now,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.720
many of them don't have access to good
education and that limits their innovative

00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:21.189
potential. If in the future we see less poverty,
as we've seen in the last twenty years, and

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:24.610
more access to education, I'm kind of hopeful.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.280
As far as we know, we are unique in the universe,
and if for nothing else, it is our duty to

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:36.050
our own innate curiosity to survive and to
see where this rising complexity leads.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.839
Our task as a species in this century is to survive
it. If we can just manage that, from the end

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:46.599
of the 21st century, the universe may take
us in a thousand astonishing directions.
