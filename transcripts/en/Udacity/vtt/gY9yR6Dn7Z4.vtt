00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.600
For example, research shows that beautiful people earn about 10% more money

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.236
over the course of their lives. They also tend to have more friends, more sex,

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:16.352
and more dates than non beautiful people. Moreover, research has shown that

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:20.432
some people believe that beautiful people also have superior personal

00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:25.052
qualities. Now it turns out that beautiful people may actually have better

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:29.612
opportunities, and more friends for social interaction. And therefore their

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:34.002
social skills can be better than less beautiful people. This doesn't just hold

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:39.489
true for how we behave as adults in interacting with other people. But research

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.527
has found that mothers tend to be more affectionate and playful with their

00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:47.128
children, when they're attractive as compared to when they're unattractive. So

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:49.580
this leads us to the question, what is beautiful?
