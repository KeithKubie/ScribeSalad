TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, Glass
is a new platform.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.350
In fact, it's a new form
of technology.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.910
And because of that, we need
new rules for the road, new

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.370
guidelines, if you will, to
know how to build these

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.350
services for users.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.870
We've come up with four
guidelines that make sense for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.110
the services that we've built.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.080
And we think they're
going to be really

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.730
useful for you as well.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.610
The first of which is
to design for Glass.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.710
Now, Glass is a unique platform
that is both mobile

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.510
but fundamentally different than
existing mobile platforms

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.570
in both design and use.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.180
You want to build your Glass
service with this in mind.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.050
Design it specifically
for Glass.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.010
Ensure that the user experience
is appropriate for

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.190
Glass by testing
on the device.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.650
You need to wear this service
throughout your day, during

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.100
the week, in the evenings,
to really know how it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.590
fits into your life.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.360
Now, a great example of this is
that you wouldn't want to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.770
read an entire news
story on Glass.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.850
When you put on Glass, you
know it's great for those

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450
short interactions, when you
need access to information

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.200
right then.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.980
Reading headlines and reading
photos is really, really

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.550
great, but you wouldn't want to
sit there and read a whole

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.965
article like you would
be reading a book.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.560
The second guideline I want
to talk about is,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.530
don't get in the way.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.170
Now this seems simple,
but it's really key.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.800
Because users want Glass there
when they need it, when they

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.290
want it, but out of the
way when they don't.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.840
You want to make sure that your
service provides for this

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.310
desire by not being too
frequent and loud with

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.890
notifications, and provide
appropriate controls for the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.560
optimum user experience, and
never take precedence.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.490
The user's life comes first.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.810
Now, a great example here is
that you wouldn't want to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.470
insert a modal dialogue as a
timeline card for the user.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.990
And what I mean by that is you
wouldn't want to give them a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350
timeline card, whereas if they
don't respond to it, your

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.280
service stops working
for them.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.870
Rather, the timeline cards you
insert should be something

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.310
that, if they look at, it's
great, but if they miss it,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730
it's no big deal.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.060
A third guideline is
keep it timely.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.430
Glass is a very now device.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.710
You can think of your phone
as information that you're

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.800
looking at for today or perhaps
this week, your laptop

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.690
for maybe this month, your hard
drives at home for the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.400
last year or so.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.910
But Glass is something that
you're carrying throughout

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.250
your day that you look at when
you need something right now.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.790
And the data that you provide
should be that.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.200
It's most effective when it's in
the moment and up to date.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.410
Now, an example is that you
wouldn't want to insert a

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.930
timeline card that's an
email from a week ago.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.670
You'd rather give the user an
email that just came in and is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.530
important to them.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.210
The last one here is avoid the
unexpected, and particularly

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.050
the unexpected and
the unpleasant.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.920
You want to be transparent with
the user and give them

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.380
the functionality that
you promised.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.110
Now, you're going to want to
do this on any platform but

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.470
especially on Glass, because
the user is wearing it.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.970
An example here is that if I
were to share photos with your

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.410
service, and then you also
insert timeline cards that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.480
describe new features on your
web property, that's going to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.280
be inappropriate.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.340
I mean that's a newsletter that
I'm going to want to read

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.360
in my inbox.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.800
I didn't sign up for that.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.250
And by giving that to me, it's
going to hurt my overall user

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.130
experience with your service.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.630
So let's go through those
one more time.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.300
The four guidelines are, first,
design for Glass.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.440
Glass is new.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.510
And you need to design
specifically for it as a user

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.600
experience.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.590
You don't want to
get in the way.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.650
You want to provide information
there for the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.820
user, when they want it, but you
want to be completely out

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.790
of the way when they don't.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.910
You want to keep it timely.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.610
Glass is about right now.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.210
Provide up to date information
and respond to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.700
the user right away.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.010
And finally, you want to avoid
the unexpected, and especially

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.130
the unexpected and unpleasant.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.810
Give the user the service
that they signed up for.
