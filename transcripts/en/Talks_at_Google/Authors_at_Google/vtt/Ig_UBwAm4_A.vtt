00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.490
JILL EBSTEIN: So I'm going
to start off with just

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.120
a small background here.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.860
"At My Pace" is a series.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.340
I didn't envision myself doing
this so much, but it became so,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.810
and every time I
do another book,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.260
it adds meaning at
least to my life.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.240
And it began when I took
on the Sheryl Sandberg

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.350
"Lean In" conversation.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.190
I wanted to expand it to be
more about the range of choices

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.330
we make in our life.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.980
Some people, I say,
are leaning in,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.020
going on the Autobahn
full speed ahead.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.570
Others have a more winding path.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.110
And my objective was that
we celebrate all our choices

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.540
and that we reserve judgment.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.610
And that was this
book right here.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.630
And so the cover is about
blue sky and open roads.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.670
That's how we should
see our world-- blue sky

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.840
and open roads.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.299
And then I thought it was done.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:52.840
And then the next
thing that happened

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.700
was that my mother
was ailing, she

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.870
was coming on the
end of her life.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.500
And I wanted to elevate
the conversation

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.270
from focusing on her to
something more meaningful.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.151
So I asked people
the question, what's

00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:05.650
one lesson you take
from your mother

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.390
and how it's impacted your life?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.620
And that gave us a
really rich conversation.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.880
And I found out, by the way,
that mothers and their kids

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.650
have way more complex
relationships than I

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.450
probably realized at the time.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.160
And that was book two.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.490
And this was about showing
your gratitude or, as I say,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.070
giving either a flower
or an olive branch

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.010
as you find comfort and
peace in your relationship

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.030
with your mom.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.704
So now I had two
books and the marketer

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:31.120
in me said, well,
now you probably

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.960
need to start thinking
about a tag line.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.220
And I thought about that.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.190
And so what the "At My
Pace" series is about is,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.250
at its heart, it's
about personal stories.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.140
And then from there we were
able to have an expanded

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.780
conversation.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.840
And from there, hopefully
there's emerging insights.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.030
So it's stories,
conversation insights.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
Now I feel like I'm having
a tag line start to happen.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.010
And then after that, I was
not quite sure I wanted to do,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.190
but I realized that I have a
lot of millennials in my life.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.330
I have three children
and a son-in-law.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.289
So I think technically I have
four millennials in my life.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.160
And on good days,
I understand them.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.770
On other days I'm perplexed by
the way they frame their world.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.410
But I don't fall prey
to the generalizations

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.030
that we always hear
about millennials.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.680
These are some of the ones--

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.930
social media-obsessed,
narcissistic,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.340
want to get there fast.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.870
You can imagine all the
ones that you've heard.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.670
And I wanted to hear
from them themselves

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.360
how they look at their world,
what their challenges are,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.580
and what we as baby
boomers can glean from it.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.360
And also, what they can
share among themselves

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.030
that will help them as
they find their way.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.290
So just in terms of the "At My
Pace" format, what happens is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.920
they're 1,000 word
pieces roughly,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.790
they're story oriented.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.280
I give guidelines and
I help contributors

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.940
get their pieces together as
much or as little as they need.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.750
And so I came up with some
guidelines for this one.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.680
Lisie, who's right here,
she's my first contributor.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480
She was an awesome one.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.530
There's 29.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.430
And so what I wanted to do today
is talk about what I learned

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.630
and what you do with it.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.970
And I'm hoping that we can
have a conversation about this.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.300
I would like this
to be informal and I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.790
would like you guys to
ask questions or give me

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.680
your thoughts as you hear them.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.660
So I'm going to start
off by just giving you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.195
some of the titles.

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:32.424
There's 29 pieces in here.

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:34.090
I'm going to give you
some of the titles

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.300
to give you a feeling
for what I heard.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.080
And I want to see whether--

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.910
raise your hand if
any of these either

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.010
resonate with you or you know
somebody close in your life

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.640
who you think they
could have meaning for.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.680
So these are some of the titles.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.430
"A Layered Identity."

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.330
"When The World Tells You No."

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.290
"Detours."

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.310
"Imposter Syndrome."

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.510
"Finding The Power of Me."

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.280
"A Series of New Beginnings."

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.645
"A Clash of Perception
and Reality."

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.474
"How To Love Myself."

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.410
"The Start and The Restart."

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.770
"Turning Caring Into Doing"
And "Keeping The Faith."

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.600
So those are just some.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.980
And what was exceptional to
me about these contributors

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.760
is it was a look at their lives
in the most uncurated way.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.490
They were extremely honest.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.110
When you read this
book, you'll see

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.460
that there's a fair
bit of anxiety,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.020
some depression, some stress,
tremendous uncertainty,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.710
self-doubt.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.470
All the things that we--

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.310
I know as a baby boomer,
I have felt for years.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.350
But our 20-somethings feel that.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.750
And they explain
where it comes from

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.670
and what they're doing with it.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.650
So I think the best
way for me to begin

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.560
is to describe the first piece
in the book and the last piece

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.280
in the book.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.100
Because I think it really
frames the discussion well.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.940
The first piece is
"Purposeful Prisons."

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.280
Lisie wrote that.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.870
One of the questions I
asked these contributors is,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.420
what is a book, a
poem, a song, something

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.420
that resonates with you?

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.340
I wanted a quick insight into
the window of their soul.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.990
So tell me what that would be.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.516
And they could or
could not use it.

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:38.140
It didn't matter to
me, but at least it

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.450
helped me to understand
who they were.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.030
And so Lisie right
away said, oh, William

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.134
Wordsworth, "Nuns Fret Not."

00:05:45.134 --> 00:05:46.300
Now, I was an English major.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.400
I happened to like
Wordsworth, but I did not

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.230
recognize that poem.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.460
And it's a wonderful poem.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.760
In "Nuns Fret Not,"
it's really about

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.160
how the constraints
in our life sometimes

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.380
give us purpose and meaning.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.380
And so Wordsworth discusses
how nuns, like convents,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.330
have poets like sonnets--

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.900
they're 14 lines-- and how
while some people might

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.260
find those boundaries
constraining, infringing

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.480
upon the things you
want to do, Wordsworth

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.760
argues that those
boundaries are purposeful.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.560
They're purposeful
prisons that anchor you.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.970
And Lisie, who describes
being a software

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.780
engineer, a ballet dancer,
and an observant Jew

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.270
has plenty of
boundaries in her life.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.940
But for Lisie, those
boundaries are purposeful.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.460
So she makes the case
for those anchors--

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.480
those very strong anchors--
being a good thing in her life.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.540
The last piece in the
book is called "Color

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.970
Outside The Lines"
by Kimberly Rhoten.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.360
She is the oldest
of the contributors.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.260
She went to UC--

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.760
University of
Chicago Law School.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.510
Did really well,
had her pick of jobs

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.140
at law firms when she graduated.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.630
Deeply cares about the
social issues of our day.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.270
Wants her life to be
dedicated to the social issues

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.284
of the day.

00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:03.700
And so she picked
what she thought

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.230
was one of the most progressive,
left-leaning law firms

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.649
that she could find
that she could work in.

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.190
But it didn't last
very long for her.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.140
Even that did not work.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.329
And so she leaves the
law firm and she goes

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:19.120
and she fights for the
social issues, which

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.060
include immigration rights,
sex worker rights, health care

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.440
advocacy.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.790
And she finds her way--

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.080
today she is the Assistant
Director at Northeastern Law

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.480
School for policy.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.070
But in the course
of all that, she

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.750
discovered that she loves to
paint, she loves to dance,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.020
she came out.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.900
There's a whole
sharing of her life

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.360
and a sharing of who
she wants to be--

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720
who she is.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.605
And so there aren't too
many boundaries for her.

00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:50.260
For her it's about
expressing yourself and being

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.770
true to who you are.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.630
And so we have on one
side "Purposeful Prisons."

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.910
On another side "Color
Outside The Lines,"

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.110
which she literally is.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.780
She paints with her
fingers, and figuratively,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.810
as she makes choices in her
life that defy some of the more

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.340
traditional choices.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.770
So we had that on the other end.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.000
So the question is for these
contributors-- for these 29,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.120
where do I fit in and
what are my challenges

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.380
in finding that place
where I can find peace,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.370
truth to who I am, support
for the things I believe in?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.960
I think that's the challenge.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.110
By the way, I also was able
to survey this group, which

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.670
this is the first
of the books that I

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.414
surveyed my contributors.

00:08:32.414 --> 00:08:34.330
In the previous ones I
just took their stories

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.330
and went from there.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.179
But I wanted a
little bit of data

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.340
because, after all, we
live in a world of data

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.919
and it's what I do
in my day job anyway.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.050
So I read through the stories--

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.280
worked through these stories,
and as I stepped back

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.830
and looked at them, I found
that there are basically

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.120
five parts of what I
think the contributors had

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.030
to conquer and manage
to get to a place

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.310
that they felt good about.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.119
So the first one is just
about being healthy.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:04.660
It's about being
emotionally healthy,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.480
it's about being
physically healthy,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.590
it's about feeling like
you're standing firm

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.940
on your own two feet with energy
and purpose and ready to go.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.090
That actually doesn't sound
that hard, but very hard.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.680
And one of the early
pieces I worked on

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.220
was a woman named Pam
[? Skop, ?] and she writes

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.860
a piece called "Heal Thyself."

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.622
And what happened
was I met her sister,

00:09:28.622 --> 00:09:30.080
and her sister said
to me, you need

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.970
to get a hold of my sister.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.070
She has a piece in her.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.509
It would be very helpful,
very therapeutic.

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:36.800
I think you should talk to her.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.900
So I did talk to
her and I'm just

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.360
going to read you the beginning
of her piece, "Heal Thyself."

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.060
She's 28, so she's older in
this range of 20-somethings.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.060
I found that the older
you were in your 20s,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.710
the more you had
to share or more

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.030
willing you were to share
what you had to offer.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.730
So this is what Pam
says, "In June of 2017,

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.630
I was a bridesmaid for
the fifth time in my life.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.460
I bought another
expensive dress,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.220
got my hair and makeup
done, and smiled

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.060
as I walked down the aisle on
the happiest day of someone

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.829
else's life.

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:15.870
I looked around the room
at this group of friends

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.510
and realized how far we
had come since high school.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.790
Six of the group
of 10 were married,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.070
with one more couple on
the way in a few months.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.090
One couple was
expecting a child.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.960
Another had moved to Stanford,
Connecticut and gotten a dog.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.407
Most everyone was becoming
established in their careers.

00:10:31.407 --> 00:10:33.990
These people were dear friends
and we shared a common history,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.830
but in that moment I couldn't
help but feel pretty far

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.060
from their realities."

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.790
So what happens to Pam is,
she continues to do her life,

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.060
but she looks at
herself all the time

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.350
and feels like she's
not attractive.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.510
She wants to eat less.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.030
She ends up having some
kind of an eating disorder.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.680
She cries.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.263
Her mother says to
her, we have to get

00:10:57.263 --> 00:11:00.330
you help-- this is not OK.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.980
And Pam agrees.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.140
And so through a combination of
therapy, meditation, and yoga,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.120
she finds her peace and she
understands herself far better.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.950
And what she says at
the end of her piece

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.660
is that the hard work of
her 20s has paid off for her

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.250
and has laid the
groundwork for what

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.220
she thinks will be a much more
positive, much more energizing

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.740
30s.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.050
And she's looking forward
to taking advantage

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.280
of the foundation she's laid.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.860
And what she really wants
to do is help others

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.210
who suffer like her.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.130
She became a licensed
yoga instructor.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.850
She's going through
other training.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.850
And what she intends to
do is to pay it forward,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.840
because she knows how long and
how hard her path was and she

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.650
wants to be able to help others.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.370
So step one is being healthy.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.747
And you'll see when you read
the book, the second piece

00:11:49.747 --> 00:11:51.330
in the book is called
"Sliding Doors."

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.360
It's about a young man in
college who falls off a balcony

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.690
and has serious trauma and
has to relearn his gait,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.610
he has to relearn so many
things that we take for granted.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.572
And so he's also looking back at
his life and the sliding doors.

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:05.280
Because it was going
this way and then it

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.530
went that way, so
all of a sudden

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.870
he sees his life
very differently.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.500
And he has the same idea,
which is get healthy and then

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.284
pay this forward.

00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:16.450
And all the people in his
life who have helped him--

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.090
which is quite a large team--

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.540
feel that there's now
new meaning in their life

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.680
as they realize what you can do
for others and also, the fight

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.080
that people have
to have in them.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.540
So healthy is job one.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.920
But the second one--

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.500
which I saw some
hands raised on--

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.630
is about managing rejection.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.872
And for these
20-somethings, many of them

00:12:40.872 --> 00:12:42.330
grew up in families
where they were

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.120
told they can do everything,
the world's their oyster.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.610
We tried to groom them
for the most possible

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.979
successful outcomes ever.

00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:51.270
We tried to make sure that
they wouldn't experience too

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.620
much failure if any failure.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.430
We tried to make their
life just smooth as silk.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.380
And of course, that's
not the way the world is.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.770
And so I'm talking
to a journalist,

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.420
his name is Sam Tabachnik.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.030
He worked for "The
Washington Post."

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.714
He was a contractor
journalist-- a very happy one.

00:13:09.714 --> 00:13:11.130
They told him,
well, probably when

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.530
the contract runs out we'll
be able to get you signed on

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.800
as an employee.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.270
But as you can imagine,
it did not happen.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.520
So now he's faced with
trying to figure out

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.020
what he's going to do next.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.200
And you probably know that
journalism is not the easiest

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.290
of places to land another job.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.220
And so he sends email after
email and has coffee--

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.100
he talks about how many cups of
coffee he has to try to network

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.630
to land his next job.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.290
And all he feels is
rejection facing him.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.100
And he writes this.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.410
He says, "Frankly, I just wasn't
used to this kind of repeated

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.460
rejection.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.760
Growing up, I might get rejected
from a travel soccer team,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.670
but there was always
another team to join.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.820
I went to schools where
the teachers nurtured us.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.280
Pretty much everyone
got A's and B's.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.760
There wasn't a need for
a ton of tough love."

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.120
So the question is what
to do next, because he

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.350
wasn't finding a job.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.300
He needed both money
and purpose in his life.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.900
So he became a Lyft driver.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.609
This was not anything
he ever imagined.

00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:18.150
He doesn't actually love driving
because he finds the traffic

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.070
to be very burdensome.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.730
But what he discovered was that
when he was driving people,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.530
he loved talking to them.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.570
And he loved almost
interviewing them

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.270
to see what was going on with
them, what they were about.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.760
And in that way it
confirmed for him

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.930
that journalism and reporting
is really what he's about.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.110
And so he continued
to be a Lyft driver

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.840
until he found his job in
journalism-- another job

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.300
for a smaller paper.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.550
And so it ended up being, he
worked his way through it.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.620
But when the world
tells you no, it's

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.250
about not expecting the
rejection you're about to feel.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.670
And I feel that was a theme that
made it through so many pieces

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.750
in this book--

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.480
how to manage
rejection, the surprise

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.760
of it all, how to pick
yourself up and just

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.350
keep on going forward.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:10.800
So in terms of the challenges
that these contributors had

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.870
to conquer to get
to a good place,

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.930
one was emotional
and physical health.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.460
Another one was understanding
and experiencing rejection

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.720
and being able to make
your way through it.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.920
But there's a third one,
which I think both the parents

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.300
and the kids share.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.850
And that's called the
burden of expectations.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.370
We expect so much from them
and they expect so much

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.810
from themselves, too.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.130
And when you live under
these high expectations,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.800
there's almost only
one place to go.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.930
And so I'm going to read you
the beginning of another piece.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.080
So back to my
asking people, what

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.980
is a song, a poem,
a book, something

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.830
that resonates with you?

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.410
In the piece called "A Clash
Of Perception and Reality,"

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.000
Gavriel Remz starts
the following.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.430
He says, "There's a delightfully
smug scene in season four

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.640
of 'The Office,' where Ryan
Howard has been promoted

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.610
to the corporate office
in New York City.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.360
Ryan's climb up the ladder
means he will supervise

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.820
his former boss, Michael Scott.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.160
Clearly pleased
with his progress,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.020
Ryan looks into the
camera and says,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.830
people keep calling
me a wunderkind.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.390
I don't even know
what that means.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.700
I mean, I know what it means.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.730
It means I'm very
successful at your age.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.880
So it makes sense."

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.900
And then Gavriel says, "I
thought I was just like Ryan--

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.480
skipping a dozen
steps on my way up.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.340
I craved the satisfaction of
being considered a wunderkind."

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.700
He goes to work for a
political newspaper.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.930
He's super excited.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.360
He gets to be in on
the issues of the day.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.830
He gets to meet
senators, he gets

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.590
to have all these super cool
conversations and things.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.300
But then he realizes,
especially when

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.820
he's having dinner with his
father, who was a journalist,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.550
so what are you really doing?

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.910
What kind of work are you doing?

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.890
Where do you feel
you're adding value?

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.490
The more he peels
back the layers,

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.230
the more deflated he feels, the
less he likes the newspaper.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.390
And he realizes this isn't
really a job for him.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.520
It's not even a
career track for him.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.660
And he is now
disengaged from that.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.670
He's going to go to a public
policy program in the fall.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.790
And he hopes to enter
into a career of politics.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.150
It comes from a very good place.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.930
He says, "I want to give
a little more to the world

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.280
than I take back."

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.750
And so it's all good.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.990
But his expectation of being
the wunderkind-- that kid

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.890
who would be able to exceed all
expectations, that's a hard one

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.390
to manage.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.848
It's a hard one as parents when
you place that on your kids

00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:43.410
and it's a hard one for kids
who have their own expectations

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.730
that are quite large.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.157
And I think it
doesn't always come

00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:47.490
from a bad place in the parents.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.240
We know that we know
our kids and we think

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.329
we want the best for them.

00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:52.620
But it ends up being in a
bad place, because it ends up

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.036
putting pressure
that they already

00:17:54.036 --> 00:17:56.310
feel upon themselves anyway.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.520
So when you decide to
go do fill in the blank,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.470
what will you hope
to get out of it?

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.470
If it turns out to be a path
that's not meaningful for you,

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.840
how will you know?

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.864
What's a milestone,
a measurement,

00:18:08.864 --> 00:18:10.530
something that you
hope to get out of it

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.630
that's-- what's the marker
that you hope to see?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.770
And if you don't see
that, what would you do?

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.420
I think the problem
is when we start

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.440
to place our answers on them
and they're not their answers.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.940
But I think it's tricky.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.810
And maybe we have some young
20-somethings in this room.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.760
Does anybody want to
offer any thoughts

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.210
as to what we
could do, the older

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.335
generation, to be a little
more effective on this one?

00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:38.460
AUDIENCE: I'm probably
actually not even old enough

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.850
for this book to apply,
because I'm only 19.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.510
But I think one of the things
that a parent should do

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.410
is probably let their
kid have other role

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.250
models other than just parents
and relatives, and stuff

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.050
like that.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.490
Because that's a really
good way for the kid

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.170
to be very isolated.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:03.540
And they want to live the
expectations that their parents

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.440
have for them.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.670
JILL EBSTEIN: Right.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.010
So other role models and
really allowing their kids

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.050
to find other ways to
get their guidance?

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.250
JILL EBSTEIN: That's
a great suggestion.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.340
So the other part
about that is, once you

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.620
have this burden of
expectation, you go ahead

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.065
and you decide you're going
to try to go live up to it,

00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:22.690
what do you do?

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.110
And so the contributors
in this book

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.350
do a series of what I call
experimentation and wandering

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.570
as they try to find their way.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.640
There is a piece by
Carla Moody called

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.380
"A Series of New Beginnings."

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.360
And she describes graduating
college, having no money,

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.730
having to get a job as a
volunteer, living with her aunt

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.390
so she can basically
have free living.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.730
And during lunchtime,
when people

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.650
might be able to
do something, she

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.610
just wanders the street walking,
because walking is free.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.290
And she loves water.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.610
She's a Pisces, she says.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.040
So she looks at water fountains
and she entertains herself

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.290
in the cheapest,
freest way possible.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.340
And from there, she just
said, I need some money.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.730
She gets a nanny job.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.980
From there, she goes
to work for Groupon.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.290
From there, digital media.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.220
She just wanders from
one job to the next.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.610
Then she leaves Chicago
and she goes to Colorado.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.620
And the last I spoke to her, she
said, every step along the way,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.680
she learned something about what
she likes and what she doesn't.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.970
And she now understands.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.220
In this next job, she
thinks she'll last longer

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.540
and she thinks she'll have
a little longer road on it.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.390
But wandering and
experimentation is the process.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.250
And two things about that.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.330
One is that I think if we were
to prepare our high school kids

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.860
and our college kids for this
is a trajectory that many

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.834
go through versus
thinking they're

00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:47.500
going to have a
straight shot somewhere,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.010
I think that would be helpful.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.800
And I think if we
ourselves, as parents,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.320
prepare ourselves for this
trajectory-- this windy,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.069
and has starts and stops--

00:20:55.069 --> 00:20:56.110
then that's helpful, too.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.090
Because we place
less demands on them

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.772
and we place less
anxiety on ourselves,

00:20:59.772 --> 00:21:01.480
which just ends up
meaning that everybody

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.330
feels the anxiety that we feel.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.100
So that's an example.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.980
But on the
experimentation piece--

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.326
I'm going to tell a story.

00:21:11.326 --> 00:21:12.850
It was really funny.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.960
So as you know, I asked,
give me a source of something

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.900
that means something to
you-- a poem, a song, a book.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.670
And so I talked to this man
named Aaron Schoenfeldt, who

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.560
I've never met.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.170
And he says to me,
oh, that's easy.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:34.020
I love Camus's
interpretation of Sisyphus.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.850
Wow.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.120
Camus's interpretation
of Sisyphus.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.220
Let me give you a little
background on Aaron.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.630
He went to go work at City Year.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.620
He graduated college.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.330
He thought he'd be
a basketball player,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.360
but his basketball career
wasn't as long as he thought.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.520
So he studied anthropology and
he's all about giving back.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.400
And he ended up
joining City Year

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.890
and going to Tulsa to teach.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.680
He always had high
expectations of what

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.346
would happen when we
went to Tulsa to go

00:21:59.346 --> 00:22:02.130
teach high schoolers.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.420
And here's what he found.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.382
So he starts off and he
says, "I spend most of my day

00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:09.840
mentoring and
tutoring students who

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.050
are struggling with attendance,
behavior, and classwork.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.030
I pulled students out
of class to give them

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.496
individualized support.

00:22:16.496 --> 00:22:19.120
I met biweekly with students to
discuss behavior and attendance

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.360
goals for the week.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.770
My services felt futile.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.430
I could feel my activist
spirit dwindling."

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.100
And so then what happens?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.754
He discovers, he
says, "I found out

00:22:32.754 --> 00:22:34.170
that it was tough
to tell students

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.780
to do their homework when
their reason for not completing

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.970
the assignment was that they
have no time in between working

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.390
to support their families and
being the primary caregiver

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.840
to their young siblings."

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.320
So he was serving a very
impoverished disenfranchised

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.220
community.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.850
And education in
the classic sense

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.980
of what he was trying to teach
them was just not possible.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.100
And so then he remembered Camus.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.840
And you know "The
Myth of Sisyphus"

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.310
is the boulder that
you're trying to push up

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.510
and then it ends up coming down.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.480
And the myth-- in Camus's
interpretation, the meaning

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.360
is in the struggle to
continue pushing up,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.330
and he says, to fight the
nihilistic tendencies of oh

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.260
is futile.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.520
And you have to find meaning
in the everyday grind of doing

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.020
the job and moving
things forward

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.110
and the challenge of it all
versus the outcome of it all.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.580
And so he says, "In Camus,
the most important thing

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.550
is that we continue to believe
in the world and in ourselves,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.320
and in the struggle
there is meaning."

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.120
So he completely reframes his
job and he alters his method.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.440
"I changed to a more
practical approach, hoping

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.260
to meet students closer
to where they were,

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.979
instead of where I
wanted them to be."

00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:50.520
And he describes what he does,
and he says, "All of a sudden,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.395
the students were
improving their attendance,

00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:54.440
their behavior, their skills."

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.040
And he says, "All
was not exhausted.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.380
My boulder awaited
me every morning."

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.680
But he was OK with it, that
the challenge and the value

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.250
was in that push.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.310
And so I think that
experimentation is just

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.490
part of the process.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.960
And that just like
with Aaron Schoenfeldt

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.770
and with Carla Moody, you
have to understand and expect

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.220
the fact that it's going to
be fits and starts and a lot

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.630
of learning along the way.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.920
So the last thing I want to
talk about is affirmation.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.900
So you go through
all this process,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.670
you deal with rejection.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.440
And it's not sequential.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.840
But you deal with rejection,
you get yourself relatively

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.550
in a healthy place, you
manage your expectations

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.500
and/or your family's
expectations,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.520
you're figuring out
what you want to do.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.690
But the end game is that you
can affirm what you're doing,

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:46.244
and as one of the contributors
says, how to love myself,

00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:47.910
that you really affirm
what you're about

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.743
and that it has meaning
to you, and that you

00:24:49.743 --> 00:24:53.430
can feel positive and go forward
with whatever your mission is.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.580
So Esther Steinberg
is a comedian.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.470
And she's 28 years old.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.547
And she is used to being--

00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:02.130
when she gets on
stage, sometimes it's

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.620
a friendly audience, sometimes
it's not a friendly audience.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.078
You work hard to
even get on stage.

00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:08.220
She was on a sitcom
series for a while.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.480
That got canceled.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.210
She has dealt with a
series of rejections

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.915
that makes it hard for her
to continue to move forward.

00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:16.290
And yet, there's
nothing else she

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.990
wants to do in life but
comedy and entertainment.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.770
So she goes into therapy to
work her way through depression.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.270
And I'm going to
read you the story

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.720
that her therapist tells her.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.690
And I want a take from
you guys of whether this

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.900
would be comforting to you.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.390
I think it's curious.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.540
"One day my therapist spent our
entire session telling me this

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.350
long story about a movie called
'Queen of the Nile,' which I

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.500
had never seen.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.020
It's about a missionary
who goes to Africa.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.320
Somehow the missionary and
a man end up on a small boat

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.060
and they sail for safety.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.080
They both die on the boat after
a series of terrible events.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.000
And right before the
end of the movie,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.330
the camera zooms out and reveals
that they were only a couple

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.980
of feet from safety.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.480
My therapist told me
that woman was me."

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:01.980
OK.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.610
So stop.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.480
First of all, would that
make you feel better?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.980
Hands up if it makes
you feel better

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:15.580
to know that the shoreline
was right there next to you.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.880
It's hard for me to imagine.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.800
But here's what she says.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.090
She said, "I was
feeling desperate.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.400
I didn't go to a therapist
to hear him recap a movie,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.490
but somehow as low as I was and
feeling as desperate as I was,

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.210
hearing this story brought
me a glimmer of hope.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.160
My take-- when you
are in a moment that

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.870
is difficult and
gloomy, sometimes it

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.990
helps to hear someone
else say you are so close

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.150
and you can't even see it."

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.530
So for her, that
story emboldened her.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.320
And she felt like there was
hope, that shoreline was right

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.000
next to her and she kept on.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.210
And she's actually
doing very well.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.180
She's on a series of shows
and comedies going on.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.871
But she uses that as a moment.

00:26:58.871 --> 00:27:00.870
And she realized she has
to really just a affirm

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.860
herself and remind
yourself that she is good,

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.150
her skills are good, she can
get there if she wants to.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:07.650
OK.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.400
Thank you so much.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.750
[APPLAUSE]
