00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.060
 As you sit in the plane and try to relax, you have terrible thoughts such as: 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.560
 What will happen if the plane door is opened? 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.300
 Commercial aircraft raise pressure inside their cabins to match atmospheric pressure of 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level. 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.460
 Although the cruising altitude of the aircraft on board is between 30,000 and 45,000 feet in the air. 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.060
 Atmospheric pressure decreases as the altitude increases. 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.020
 Due to the gravity of Earth clouds on atmospheric particles in the atmosphere. 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.100
 The closer you get to the surface of the earth, the stronger these molecules. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.180
 The pressure will be reduced in less than 0.5 seconds if the door is opened. 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.160
 Will be thrown out of the aircraft as well as anything that is not installed if the seat belt is not attached 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.660
 Due to different pressure 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.600
 Survival rates in this default scenario are very low given the possibility of a full crash. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.820
 Because the air is lighter in high places, the oxygen content is lower. 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.660
 The gradual decrease of pressure in the compartment causes the oxygen mask to fall from the top 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.760
 You will have an average of 18 seconds to put the mask before you become hypoxic. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.800
 Oxidation occurs at low oxygen levels and causes symptoms including dizziness, nausea and loss of consciousness 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.960
 Leading to death. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.360
 The remaining oxygen will remain in the aircraft for 10 minutes 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 It is enough time for the pilot to land quickly by 8,000 to 10,000 feet 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.780
 To balance external and internal pressure and give you hope of survival. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840
 Have you been in a panic yet? 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 Do not worry, the chances of opening the door are very small 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.840
 This is because the actual pressure is eight to ten pounds per square inch of the plane. 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.820
 Remember that the pressure inside the cabin is higher than outside. 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.480
 For example, we will introduce the largest commercial aircraft, the Airbus A380, 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.020
 Where the main door weighs 4288 square inches, 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.920
 It requires 38,592 pounds of power to open it. 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.540
 This is equivalent to trying to move 3 African jungle elephants - 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.760
 It is the largest mammal on Earth. 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.820
 In addition, the door of the aircraft is always closed automatically by the pilot 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.720
 Through functions that can be accessed from inside the cockpit only. 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.360
 To lessen your fears: 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.660
 It will be almost impossible for any individual to break you and the window of the plane. 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.460
 These windows are made of six layers of different types of strong anti-bullet polymers. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.860
 Furthermore, these windows are always round to minimize attraction during flight, 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160
 This prevents cracking and low pressure. 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.900
 Your death toll in a car accident is 1/114 higher than that of an aviation accident 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.600
 Compared with 1/9821 incidents related to air travel. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.780
 So, fasten your seat belt and watch the video safety instructions, and above all enjoy your trip. 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.320
 Thanks for watching the video, do not forget to subscribe to the channel, 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.740
 We publish a new science video every Thursday. 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.180
 And click the bell icon seems to have a function. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.700
 If you want to watch more videos now, we'll put links to some videos here so you can lose them 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.520
 To satisfy your need for knowledge, 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.920
 Otherwise, we'll see you next Thursday in a new video. 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 Bye!
