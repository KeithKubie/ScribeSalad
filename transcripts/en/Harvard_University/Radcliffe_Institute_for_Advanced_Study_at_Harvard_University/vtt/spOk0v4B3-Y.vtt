00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.090
- Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.990
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin, the
dean of the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.350
And we are delighted to have
all of you here with us today.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.910
Let me start by thanking
VIDA, women in literary arts,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.440
for partnering with
the Schlesinger

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.410
Library on the History of
Women to organize this event.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.890
And of course, I'm grateful
to this remarkable group

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.010
of panelists and our
distinguished moderator

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.259
for agreeing to participate
in what promises

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.220
to be a fascinating discussion.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.970
Today's program is a part
of a yearlong celebration

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.390
of the 75th anniversary of
the Schlesinger Library.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.950
And I understand that we're also
marking the 10th anniversary

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.400
of the VIDA Count, an
annual inventory of gender

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.690
disparity in major literary
publications and book reviews.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.620
Here at Radcliffe and
at VIDA, too, I imagine,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.790
anniversaries are about
more than commemoration.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.180
They're are also
about taking stock.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.070
They provide an opportunity
to reflect on progress,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.800
but also to chart
the work ahead,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.870
the work towards the objectives
that we've set for our society

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.730
and for ourselves as advocates
of equality and opportunity

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.560
for all.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.280
For that reason, I'm thrilled
that today's panel will focus

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.200
our attention on feminisms
now, where we find ourselves

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.020
and where we aim to go.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.270
Over the next few
years, we at Radcliffe

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.140
will engage in more of
this kind of taking stock

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.100
as we critically examine the
centennial of women's suffrage

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.720
in the United States.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.070
And on Monday, October 29, we
will continue our Schlesinger

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.510
75th anniversary programming
with a performance

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.740
from Shaina Taub's important
new musical, The Suffragist,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
followed by a panel discussion.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.340
I hope many of you will
register online and join us

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.479
for that event.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.389
And now it's my
distinct pleasure

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.760
to turn things over
to Jane Kamensky, who

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.950
will introduce our panel.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.740
Jane is the Pforzheimer
Foundation director

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.250
of the Schlesinger Library here
at Radcliffe and the Trumbull

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.670
Professor of American History
in the faculty of Arts

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.900
and Sciences.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.216
Jane.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:29.681
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.660
-

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.460
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.650
Thank you, Tomiko.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.240
This is, as Tamiko said, part
of our 75th anniversary year.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.770
It's our first public
event of the year.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.680
It's the first public gathering
in the renovated Knafel Center.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.450
So if you smell
off-gassing, it's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.010
all from very green materials.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.600
Don't worry about that.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.698
And it's also Tomiko's first
public event as our new dean,

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:02.198
so welcome.

00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:04.628
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.520
So looking back to look forward.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.330
The anniversary
commemorates the founding

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.220
in 1943 of Radcliffe College's
Women's Rights Collection,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.790
which then consisted of about
30 cartons of manuscripts

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.000
and several hundred
printed volumes.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.040
The Women's Rights
Collection came out

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.610
of what has come to be
known as the first wave

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.270
of American feminism,
the decades of activism

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.060
from the second quarter
of the 19th century

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.970
into the early decades
of the 20th, which

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.960
culminated in the 1920s
passage of the 19th Amendment

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.960
to the US Constitution,
declaring that the right

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.590
to vote in the United States
could not be abridged by sex.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.690
The amendment, of
course, enfranchised

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.320
only those American women
who were not already

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.180
denied the vote
by virtue of race,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.650
national origin, territorial
residence, disability,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.470
and other qualifiers.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.430
By the 1950s, Schlesinger's
women's suffrage collections

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.770
were very strong,
nearly peerless.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.790
Only Sophia Smith's special
collections could rival them.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.550
But the library
grew quite slowly

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.300
until the gathering of a second
wave of American feminism

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.940
beginning in the 1960s.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.090
The thinkers, activists,
and organizations

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.730
of the second wave
wanted to be sure

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.650
that their legacies
would be preserved

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.110
in libraries and in archives.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.160
And many of them joined
forces with Schlesinger.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.910
Our second-wave collections
span and sometimes

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.790
bridge the many
schisms of that era.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.970
We include the papers of
liberal and radical feminists,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.670
of white and
African-American activists,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.930
of queer and straight thinkers,
of anti-pornography and pro-sex

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.150
feminists, and so on.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.960
So we hold, to name just a few,
the papers of Betty Friedan,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.090
of Susan Brownmiller,
of Adrienne Rich,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.960
of June Jordan, Andrea Dworkin,
Catharine MacKinnon, Florence

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.530
Kennedy, and as of last
January, Angela Davis,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.560
as well as the organizational
records of NOW and NOW

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.230
Legal Defense and
Education Fund, of Women

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.670
Against Pornography, and of
the Boston Women's Health Book

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.380
Collective.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.260
For several decades
now, scholars

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.850
of the history of
women and gender

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.780
have questioned the very
idea of feminist waves, which

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.560
have never been as unified
or as discrete or as clear

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.550
in their swelling and breaking
as the wave metaphor suggests.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.540
Nonetheless, it's been
obvious for some time

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.870
that the so-called
second wave is over,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.980
having reached its sell-by
date long before the 2016

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.450
presidential election.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.080
Through its strengths
and its faults,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.870
the second wave has
given rise or given way

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.740
to subsequent forms
of feminist activism.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.210
Today's emerging feminists, the
fourth or maybe the fifth wave

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.620
by some reckonings, have fresh
energies and different ways

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.220
of viewing the world than their
predecessors sometimes did.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.950
Their intellectual and
institutional relationships

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.380
to those predecessors
is, I think

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.630
it's safe to say, mixed, a
blend of homage and critique

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.650
that any movement
needs to remain vital.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.680
The commitments,
priorities, hopes and fears

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.590
of millennial feminists and
their links to the commitments,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.050
priorities, hopes and fears
of the second wave and indeed

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.490
the first, are our subject
here this afternoon.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.490
What batons have
been passed and which

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.610
have been dropped
between the generations?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.190
How have rising
feminists shined light

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.370
into the blind spots
of their forebears.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.140
And also in turn, what did the
instigators of the second wave

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.850
know that we may be at
risk of forgetting today?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.070
As we turn toward another
important moment for women,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.140
for voters to use or
lose the franchise

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.140
and the rights that go
with it, and as libraries

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.980
like ours begin to collect
the records of Gen Y

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.520
and of millennials, getting
a handle on these questions

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.840
seem important.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.030
Populating and framing
today's discussion

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.950
came out of a team
effort, as Tomiko

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.700
said, between a classically
second-wave organization

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.290
and a millennial one.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.710
Schlesinger Library and the
New York-based nonprofit VIDA,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.990
Women and the Literary Arts.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.240
VIDA is a feminist
organization committed

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.690
to creating transparency
around the lack of gender

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.050
parity in the literary
landscape and to amplifying

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.780
historically marginalized
voices, including people

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.270
of color, writers
with disability,

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.590
and queer, trans, and gender
non-conforming individuals.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.870
The VIDA Count, VIDA's
flagship program,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.000
now marking its
10th anniversary,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.460
highlights gender
imbalances in publishing

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.030
by tallying genre, book
reviewers, books reviewed,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.960
and journalistic bylines to
offer a data-driven assessment

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.060
of the publishing world.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.150
Through the VIDA Count, along
with the online publication

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.440
of VIDA Review and
initiatives like #saferlit,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.380
VIDA aims to stimulate
thoughtful conversation

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.039
about the challenges faced
by marginalized populations

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.730
within the literary community
and beyond with hopes

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.510
of enabling a more
inclusive literary culture.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.700
In recent years, VIDA has
added race, disability,

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.770
sexual identity, and age
to the categories counted.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.050
The count has been
widely acknowledged

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.840
by myriad national
news outlets as one

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.970
of the only and most
reliable sources

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.940
on gender disparity
in the literary world.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.590
It has also moved the needle
on many important publications,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.200
except those which are
unrepentant resisters.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.000
The men's review of books,
as I like to call it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.910
I want to thank VIDA board
members Melissa Febos

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.270
and Hafizah Geter for their
help curating this stellar group

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.350
of panelists.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.720
I'll introduce them
all now in the order

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.180
in which they'll speak.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.540
So first up will be the
poet Fatimah Asghar,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.450
the writer and
co-creator of Brown Girls

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.660
an Emmy-nominated web series
centered on friendships

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.750
between women of color,
which is in development

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.510
for television with HBO.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.760
Asghar's debut collection of
poems, If They Come For Us,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.880
which she has a copy of
in front of her right now,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.960
was published by the One
World imprint of Random House

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.460
just last month.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.100
It explores her
unique subjectivity

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.930
as a Pakistani Muslim American
at times of peril and fracture

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.860
in her home country, especially
around the time of partition,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.410
and in today's United States.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.570
Starred reviews in
Publishers Weekly

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.180
and in the Library
Journal hail her voice

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.110
as at once fierce and
tender, personal, powerful,

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.730
and political.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.730
She is also a graduate of
Cambridge Rindge and Latin High

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.270
School.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.310
Some of whose
students and faculty

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.180
are here today to
hear and pay tribute

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.790
to their famous forebear.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.040
Writer and legal
activist Dana Bolger

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.990
is co-founder of
the organization

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.350
Know Your IX, a national
youth-led movement

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.240
that educates and
empowers students

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.840
to end gender violence in
their schools and beyond.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.440
Founded in 2013, Know Your
IX works with high school

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.000
and with college
students, training

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.580
them to combat gender
discrimination, including

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.140
sexual violence.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.690
Bolger also serves
as a senior editor

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.600
at Feministing, a leading
online community run

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.000
by and for young feminists.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.800
She has testified
before Congress

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.130
on sexual assault policy
and legislative reform.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.260
And her writing has
appeared in the New York

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.020
Times, the Washington Post,
and The Wall Street Journal,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.780
among other outlets.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.940
Melissa Febos,
assistant professor

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.460
of creative writing at
Monmouth University,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.310
is the author of the memoir
Whip Smart, published

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.030
in 2010, and the essay
collection Abandon Me,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.410
published in 2017, which the
New Yorker called "mesmerizing,"

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.400
and which was a Lambda Literary
Award finalist, a Triangle

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.190
Publishing Award
finalist, an Indie Next

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.580
pick, and a named
best book of 2017

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.200
by an astonishing
range of publications,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.580
including Esquire, Book Riot,
The Cut, Electric Literature,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.460
The Brooklyn Rail,
Bustle, Refinery29, Salon,

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.270
and The Rumpus.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.103
I don't think there are
many people who have

00:11:56.103 --> 00:11:59.100
reached Esquire and The Rumpus.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.670
The inaugural winner of the
Jeanne Cordova Nonfiction

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.860
Prize from Lambda
Literary, Febos

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.980
will publish a second
essay collection, Girlhood,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.500
with Bloomsbury in 2020.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.660
A cultural critic,
Kim Foster founded

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.910
For Harriet, an online community
of women of African ancestry,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.360
founded it back in 2010 while
she was an undergraduate right

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.250
here at Harvard.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.990
Welcome back, Kim.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.880
For Harriet has since seeded
three sister sites, Soar,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.100
Shine, and The Culture.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.350
The aim of these
communities is, quote,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.320
"to raise the level of discourse
surrounding black womanhood."

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.100
The For Harriet sites
have become premier spaces

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.107
for black women's
journalism and storytelling

00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:47.690
and have been featured
in the New York

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.780
Times and other
national media outlets.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.090
Kim has written for The
Guardian and for Newsweek

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.690
and has appeared widely
on television and radio.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.780
Two years ago, Forbes
magazine named Foster

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.780
to its national
30 under 30 list.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.950
Finally, Emi Koiama,
activist, writer,

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.680
and self-described
rogue intellectual,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.130
is the author of the pioneering
Transfeminist Manifesto

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.280
and other essays of
transfeminism, published back

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.550
in 1999.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.900
This is very early for
transfeminist writing.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.620
The Manifesto has circulated
both as an underground text

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.620
and in published versions
for nearly two decades.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.470
We have become
increasingly aware

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.630
that the diversity of women is
our strength, not our weakness,

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.460
Koiama writes in that manifesto.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.010
Koiama's transfeminism
and her activism

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.970
more broadly embraces what
she calls feminist coalition

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.060
projects in which women
from different backgrounds

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.790
stand up for each other.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.790
Koiama is a multi-issue
social justice activist,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.720
synthesizing feminist,
Asian, survivor, dyke, queer,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.670
sex worker, intersect,
genderqueer,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.890
and [? crypt ?] politics.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.500
When I asked her about her
pronoun preferences for this

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.740
introduction, she wrote, and I
quote-- and she said I could--

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.990
"I don't subscribe to
the neoliberal politics

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.060
of preferred pronouns
that reduces gender

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.220
to a mere matter of
individual preferences, which

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.830
is deeply troubling
to me as a feminist,"

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.850
something that we can talk
about later this afternoon.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.060
Koiama currently serves
as the coordinatrix

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.300
of the Seattle-based Coalition
for the Rights and Safety

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.280
for People in the Sex Trade.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.440
After each panelist
speaks briefly

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.440
about their work, my
colleague, Robert Reid-Pharr

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.980
will moderate a discussion among
them before turning to Q and A

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.750
from the audience.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.900
Reid-Pharr, who served for
many years as distinguished

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.230
and Presidential Professor of
English and American studies

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.710
at CUNY Graduate Center recently
joined the Harvard faculty

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.740
as Professor of Women,
Gender, and Sexuality.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.650
His is the first appointment,
first senior appointment,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.620
to lie solely within
the WGS program

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.500
and is a real achievement
for us to have him here.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.857
Welcome, Robert.

00:15:02.857 --> 00:15:04.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.130
An eminent feminist theorist
and cultural critic,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.440
Reid-Pharr is the author of
four books on race, gender,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.110
and sexuality in
American culture,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.880
including Archives of
Flesh, published in 2016,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.620
and Black Gay Man, a collection
of essays published in 2001.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.460
At Harvard, his courses include
race, gender, and the archive.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.760
He is working on a
biography of James Baldwin.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.070
And with that, I will turn
it over to Fatimah Asghar

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.130
to kick off what I know will
be a stimulating discussion.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.870
Thanks.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:40.280
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.320
Can you guys hear me?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.080
Does this work?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.640
Yes.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.720
OK.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.810
Thank you all so much for
having me, for being here.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.290
It really means a
lot to me, especially

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.970
having gone to Rindge and
when I was in high school,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.170
I used to work here.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.730
And it's really
amazing to be here.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.650
So I'm going to read them
poems and talk a little bit.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.680
This poem is called
"National Geographic."

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.170
"I see my not-me on the news,
she who weds for her sweet 16.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.470
Mosquito bites for breasts.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.140
My not-khaala's trace her
hands with mehndi, a plate

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.660
of mathai bursting at her feet.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.860
My not-khalu's dance pound palm
to drum, stave off monsoons.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.120
My not-abbu checks the
sheets for her blood

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.270
the morning after, brandishes
the satin like a flag,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.440
his pride singing
through the town.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.200
There is my not-me
again, the one I

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.580
could have been, drowned in a
burqa on her way to the market,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.890
fingering mangoes
through gloves,

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.770
nihari steaming for
hours at the flat shared

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.260
with my not-husband's family.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.470
My not-me's eyes,
brilliant and green,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.630
decorating the pages
of Western magazines,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.630
eyes that earn a white man
awards and showings, but eyes

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.860
that stay [INAUDIBLE]
in the mountains

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.280
while my not-me rims her
son's mouth with salt to trick

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.680
his belly into not hunger.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.589
My not-me celebrating
Diwali, lights

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.950
gathered at the
base of her door.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.280
My not-me Indian worshipping
a host of different gods,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.190
calling all their names.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.150
My not-tongue not foreign,
not accented, not strange.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.849
My not-me not worried
about Taliban,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.080
but still worried about men.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.600
My not-me on the bus,
divided among the passengers

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.960
hands, abdomen gutted,
left on a road to die.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.160
Still not me alone and not me."

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.630
So I think that when
I think about feminism

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.110
and how it relates to my
work, I think about the ways

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.740
that my work tries
really hard to grapple

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.450
a lot with
intersectional identity

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.770
and giving the space to
have a full breadth of one's

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.370
humanity, which I think is
sometimes really difficult when

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.540
you're a person who comes from
a background or backgrounds that

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.970
are intersecting and
when people kind of try

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.090
to categorize or pigeon-hole
you into being one thing

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.060
and don't really allow
you the space of really

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.550
being a full human.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.980
And thinking about, too--
so I work as a poet,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.180
and I'm also a screenwriter.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.100
And I think a lot
about the way that we

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.110
develop characters in screen.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.750
And a lot of times the way that
folks talk about developing

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.340
characters is they'll be like,
well, here's a character.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.470
This is their backgrounds.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.970
These are the issues
that they face.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.370
And this is that, which
to me always rings

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.070
super hollow when you
then go to screen and see

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.320
that kind of beings displayed.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.250
The reason why is it doesn't
give space for humanity.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.630
It doesn't give
space for someone

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.720
to just be a full person.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.250
And I think sometimes
when I think

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.710
about the danger of when we
talk about representation,

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.730
especially when we
talk about filmmaking

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.480
or when we talk about poetry
and we talk about art,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.910
is when you talk
about representation

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.790
and you kind of reduce it
down to just that and you

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.390
don't allow for the reasons
why representation is important

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.419
and the reasons why it's
important to have people who

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.210
come from the backgrounds
of the characters

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.043
that they're writing
write those backgrounds

00:19:16.043 --> 00:19:18.170
and to kind of give
them that fullness

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.939
and that sense of complexity
that sometimes missing.

00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:24.230
So I think that it's interesting
because a lot of times

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.990
I'm asked about things
about representation.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.684
And it's hard, because I think
representation is really,

00:19:29.684 --> 00:19:31.100
really important,
but I also think

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.530
it's a really hollow
concept when you just

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.790
treat it as representation
for representation's sake.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.900
And so I really want to--

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.300
I think for me the thing
that really matters to me,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.820
the thing that drives
a lot of my work,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.580
is to really focus
in on the human

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.130
and thinking about
the pain and the joy

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.680
and the love of all
of those identities.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.330
And I think for
so many of us who

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.130
come from marginalized
backgrounds,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.100
we kind of come from this space
where people only talk about

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.840
your identity as a space of
trauma and as a space of pain

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.010
and of sadness and as a
lack, like you are this

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.390
because you lack whiteness.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.310
You are this because
you lack maleness.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.810
You are this because you lack
straightness, whatever that is.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.420
And that's a really damaging
way of thinking about identity.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.550
And it's a really,
really damaging thing

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.910
to be a person of color, to
be a woman of color, a queer

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.880
woman of color, and
have to kind of think

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.000
about yourself as a lack and
not from a positive [? sight. ?]

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.870
And so something that I
think about in my work

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.550
is to really not
let that happen,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.010
to really not say that
I come from a lack

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.860
or I'm a lack of something but
that I'm actually a positive.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.410
I exist in this positive space.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.176
And that's not to say that
you can't you talk about pain.

00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:50.300
That poem that I just read
had a lot of pain in it.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.780
But thinking about what are the
complicated bonds of sisterhood

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.640
and intimacy formed from some
of these backgrounds and how

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.990
are those terrains
of joy and of love.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.122
And how is that a specific
kind of love and joy

00:21:03.122 --> 00:21:04.580
that other people
don't have access

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.370
to that we can celebrate?

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:12.050
So I'm going to read
another poem, which

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.530
is a poem that I wrote.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.840
I did crew here on
the Charles River.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.570
And this is a poem for the
people that I did crew with.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.610
And it's called "To
Prevent Hypothermia."

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.090
"After the race, my teammates
kicked the boys off the bus

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.060
and into the downpour,
blocked the windows

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.440
with their sweatshirts, peeled
the wet clothes from my skin,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.430
each inch matted down,
disobedient, hair

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.820
plastered to my brown legs.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.010
It took two hungry girls
to remove the Spandex

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.520
from my paling thighs,
their blond hair a cascade

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.240
from heaven, water droplets
falling from their roots,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.160
stinging my body.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.900
The ports tore off my
shirts and sports bra.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.150
And my nipples lighthouses
in a swole ocean,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.090
a trail of dark hair
running up my belly.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.140
My whole boat witness to
my small, naked frame,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.390
a gulf of shiver on the bus.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.140
And their own hairless legs
disappearing into their shorts,

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.310
skin ripe as peaches,
reaching for my brown body.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.800
These girls who I
had stolen glances

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.110
at while we changed and wished I
could look like, my locker room

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.740
crew, my 5:00 AM practice girls,
my lean over the starboard side

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.140
so she could pee off
the rigger girls,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.250
my two-mile run after eating
Annie's mac and cheese girls.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.200
They took turns
rubbing life back

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.410
and my bones, offered
clothes off their own backs

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.360
to keep me from shaking.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.650
My girls, sandwiching me in
their heat until my joints

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.580
flowered, until the warmth
blooded through my blood.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.040
What more could
I ask than a team

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.530
willing to undress
their captain, too

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.100
cold and rain-glittered
to do it alone."

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.922
Thank you.

00:23:04.922 --> 00:23:07.342
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.230
- Hi, everybody.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.770
Thank you so much for having me.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.220
I'm totally thrilled to be here
and feel completely humbled

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.560
and a little bit
intimidated to be here

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.880
with my amazing co-panelists.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.550
I'm Dana.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.760
I am a third-year in law school.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.210
Before I went to law
school, I organized students

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.420
across the country to combat
sexual and gender violence

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.190
in our schools.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.300
We passed good laws.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.160
We defeated bad laws.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.660
We organized for better policies
and practices in our schools.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.720
And then we turned around and
trained the slightly younger

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.500
generation of [? next ?]
students to do the same.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.950
And the idea wasn't just
to mobilize young people

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.860
on this one issue
of sexual violence

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.430
but frankly to politicize
them and to develop

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.800
their feminist
consciousness and endow them

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.620
with the tools and the
skills that they were going

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.730
to need to fight on any range of
progressive causes in the years

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.400
ahead.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.940
Many of us in the contemporary
movement against gender

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.020
violence met online after
we formed secret Facebook

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.700
groups, groups with hundreds and
hundreds of survivors in them.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.420
We shared tips there
about managing flashbacks

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.510
and crowdsourced
advice on dealing

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:43.370
with a hostile,
unresponsive legal system.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.840
And in those Facebook
groups, we got angry.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.500
We circulated older
feminist writings.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.450
We planned protests.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.370
It was a form of
consciousness-raising,

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.860
just online.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.280
And dissatisfied with
the lack of resources

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.710
that were available to
us, we built our own.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.460
So with no legal
background or degrees,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.590
we built a website to share
with other students what

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:12.410
we had learned the hard
way about our own rights.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:18.230
So this is all to say that my
small community and generation

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.050
of feminists have relied
in really large part

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.290
on the strategies and the tools
sharpened by the feminists who

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.410
came in the 50 years before us.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.200
And it seems impossible
to me to talk

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.180
about the contemporary
movement against gender

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.410
violence in our schools without
talking about the second wave.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.660
Title IX, the landmark
civil rights law

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.690
that, among other
things, requires schools

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.270
to respond to sexual
harassment and violence,

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:48.290
is itself, of course, a
product of the second wave.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.180
And the core insight
of the second wave,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.300
that the personal is political
and that private violence ought

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.310
to be a matter of
public concern,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.000
lives on in our work today.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.030
But the central question,
as many of us see it today,

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.490
is who should be
responsible for responding

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.310
to the harms of violence.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.220
The white, mainstream
strand of the second wave,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.550
which demanded that the state
take gender violence seriously

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.860
in the same way it took
other forms of violence

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.130
seriously through the
police and prisons

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.980
resulted in reforms ranging
from the criminalization

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.110
of marital rape to dual and
mandatory arrest policies.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.660
And it coincided with the
rise of mass incarceration

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.630
and with the idea
that incarceration

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.110
should be the dominant
and the appropriate way

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.830
to address all sorts of problems
in our country, problems that

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.140
might otherwise have been
differently addressed

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.870
through, say, a
focus on education

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.390
or poverty or public health.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.340
As my friend Alexandra
Brodsky puts it,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.750
prisons really
came to monopolize

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:59.440
our imaginations of the
right way to respond to harm.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.730
That's a legacy that many
of my peers want to undo.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.030
For us, part of the
appeal of Title IX

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.460
has been its potential
to be an alternative

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.360
to the moral failure of the
criminal legal system, a system

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.320
that puts black and brown
men in cages, that threatens

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.400
undocumented victims with
deportation, that criminalizes

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.960
women of color when they fight
back against their abusers,

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.170
and that does nothing meaningful
to end sexual violence,

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.410
but actually fosters violence
against the people it's

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.470
supposed to house and reform.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.560
So many young feminists are
asking the question if not

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.835
this system, then what?

00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.140
What are the alternatives?

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.150
And that's a question
that women of color

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.920
have been asking for a
really, really long time

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.380
and that groups
like Insight have

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.770
been pioneering really
creative responses

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.480
to for a really long time.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.680
But one alternative,
it seemed to my peers,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.500
was to marshal civil
rights law, Title IX,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.900
to require our
institutions to respond

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.910
to the harms we're facing.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.160
Title IX prohibits sex
discrimination in education,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.010
not just in colleges
and universities

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.430
as we hear about a lot, but
also in elementary schools

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.750
and middle schools
and high schools.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.490
And because rape and harassment
can make it really hard to get

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.970
an education, US courts
have long required schools

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.670
to mitigate the harms of
this violence on student

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.050
victims' lives and to really
focus on victims' needs

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.530
in a way that the criminal
legal system doesn't and really

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.070
can't.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.610
So I'm talking about how schools
must help victims relocate out

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.190
of a dorm that they
shared with their abuser

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:48.010
or off campus, free access to
a whole host of accommodations

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.730
like therapy and
academic tutoring

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.620
to help someone get back on
track in school after trauma.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.810
And of course, the
system isn't perfect.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.140
And certainly,
schools have all kinds

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.190
of incentives as corporations
with bottom lines

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.860
and reputations
at stake to get it

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:15.046
wrong to the detriment of both
victims and accused students.

00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:18.400
Though you wouldn't know it from
how the media covers the issue,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.710
young feminists have been
thoughtfully thinking

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:25.770
through what just discipline
should look like, too,

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.480
and what protections a
just disciplinary process

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.490
ought to have for
both students--

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.870
victims and accused.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.690
So things like ensuring that
both parties have access

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.340
to all the evidence
and adequate time

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.650
to prepare their case,
that both parties are

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.090
able to have a
neutral third party

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.880
pose them questions
and examine them,

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.030
that both parties have the right
to appeal the decisions that

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.480
are handed down.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.980
And it's not just in schools
that we're thinking about this,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.930
but young feminist
groups like Know Your IX

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.870
have been really
active in opposing

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.320
the expansion of the
criminal legal system in sort

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.290
of a unique way that, as
survivors, we're able to.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.180
So a couple years ago, we
defeated this Delaware bill,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.320
which was backed by second-wave
Democrat lawmakers that

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.570
would force schools to hand
rape reports over to the police

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.700
with or without
survivors' consent.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.310
And those bills, which have
really proliferated in states

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.230
all across the
country, don't just

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.690
undermine survivor autonomy.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.820
They also limit the
range of options

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.640
that survivors
can pursue, making

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.570
victims who have reason to fear
the police afraid to report

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.870
to anyone, including
their school.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.470
Likewise-- and I'll wrap up in
a minute-- but this last year,

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.211
Know Your IX and other groups
opposed the recalled Judge

00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:44.710
Persky.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.110
He was the judge who
gave Brock Turner

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.400
that infamous six-month sentence
for raping an unconscious woman

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.990
at Stanford.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.420
And certainly, the sentence
that Persky imposed

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.940
was sexist and
racist and classist

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.650
and was rooted in the idea that
white boys who swim at Stanford

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.560
deserve endless second chances.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.680
But the response of recalling
the judge we feared would cause

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.920
other judges to issue ever
more punitive rulings,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.560
afraid of losing their
jobs if they didn't.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.680
Anyway, the point
of our critique

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.480
here isn't to shame survivors
who choose to go to the police.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.480
In a world with really
severely limited options,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.690
it's understandable
to seek recourse

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.435
wherever you can find it.

00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:32.560
And the point also isn't
to insist that Title IX is

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.030
a perfect alternative here.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.920
I don't think it is.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.710
Rather, it's to say this,
which is that we shouldn't have

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.650
to be afraid in our schools.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.410
And we shouldn't have to choose
between enduring harassment

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.650
in our workplaces and not
bringing home a paycheck.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.280
We need alternatives
beyond the criminal system

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.270
to make right the harm that
violence creates in our lives.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.100
And we need systems
that discourage

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.550
that harm in the first place.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.490
I think this is one of the
central questions my generation

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.870
is going to need to figure out.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.160
And I feel really
glad that there

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.030
are so many smart,
creative young feminists

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.676
in that fight with us.

00:32:14.676 --> 00:32:15.672
Thank you.

00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:18.162
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.070
- Hi, feminists.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.290
How are you doing?

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.170
I feel much more
nervous than I usually

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.260
do with public speaking.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.760
And I think it's sort
of that thing where--

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.780
and maybe these other
panelists will agree with me--

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.740
when people I know or people
I love or my people are

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.290
in the audience, I often feel--

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.670
do the stakes feel higher?

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.350
In a way, that's
sweet but scary.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.380
And I sort of feel that here
because I feel like probably

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.750
because you're my
people in many ways.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.700
So thank you for being
here and making me nervous.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.990
And I am so honored to be here.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.804
I also feel a little bit out
of my depth in many ways.

00:33:01.804 --> 00:33:03.220
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.770
- Thank you.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.470
Thank you, [? Jane. ?]
I take that back.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.530
And I'm just going
to say that it also

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.360
feels sort of sweet
in a personal way,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.830
because when I was--

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.647
about 20 years
ago when I was 16,

00:33:15.647 --> 00:33:17.480
I dropped out of high
school and got my GED,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.030
and I moved to Boston
and I took night classes

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.050
at Harvard Extension.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.900
And I took mostly feminist
history classes and also

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.830
some creative writing.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.920
And so it just feels
sweet, like I sort of

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.100
wish I could go back to
that very brave and arrogant

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.220
young person and let her know
that it was going to work out

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.320
and I would be here today.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.410
So thank you for
allowing me that.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.430
And you heard, I'm also
on the board of VIDA.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.440
And with my colleague,
Hafizah, over here,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.090
helped co-curate this event.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.070
And you heard a
little bit about VIDA

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.932
from Jane in the introduction.

00:33:50.932 --> 00:33:52.640
And I'll expand on
that a little bit more

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.130
to illustrate some
of the ways that I

00:33:55.130 --> 00:34:00.080
think we are an example of a
certain kind of feminism now.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.130
So for those of you who don't
know, almost 10 years ago now,

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.305
the VIDA founders,
who are all poets,

00:34:07.305 --> 00:34:09.679
were having a conversation
with each other about the lack

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.870
of gender parity that
they saw in the magazines

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.520
where they wanted
to see their work

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.311
and in the review
outlets where they wanted

00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:16.812
to see their work reviewed.

00:34:16.812 --> 00:34:18.770
And it was a conversation
that they, of course,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.880
had had before, that women
have always been having.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.280
But they decided to concretize
what they were seeing.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.175
And they wanted to make
other people see it.

00:34:27.175 --> 00:34:28.550
Because they were
tired of making

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.020
that really obvious argument.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.570
So they undertook this
massive data collection

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.250
and collected
hundreds of the years

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.360
tables of contents and
physically counted the women

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.580
that they could recognize.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.770
And they counted reviewers,
authors of books reviewed,

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.679
and bylines in top-tier
magazines like The New Yorker

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.120
and so forth.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.330
And the pie charts that resulted
proved what they already

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:57.050
knew, that women were profoundly
under-represented in all

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.370
of those spaces.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.100
And in the 10 years since
then, the annual VIDA Count

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.530
has become something of a
household name, at least

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.450
among writers.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.360
And many of those early and
worst offenders, the somewhat

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.670
repentant ones or at
least publicly repentant

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.250
ones, as Jane pointed
out, have admitted

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.420
to consciously working to
improve their VIDA numbers.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.980
And since then,
in these 10 years,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.250
VIDA has also grown in
some other directions.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.000
Kimberle Crenshaw, who coined
the term "intersectionality"

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.760
and the analytic framework
said recently in an interview

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.280
that "intersectionality is
the lens through which you

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.800
can see where power
comes and collides,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.140
where it interlocks
and intersects.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.660
It's not simply that there's
a race problem here, a gender

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.650
problem here, a class
or LGBTQ problem here.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.480
Many times that
framework erases what

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.400
happens to people who
are subject to all

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.680
of these things."

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.040
And Fatimah also
talked about this some.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.400
I've worked primarily with
sort of the second generation

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.940
of VIDA leadership, along with
my two colleagues who are here

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.800
today, Hafizah Geter
and Camille Rankine, who

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.680
is our present executive
committee chair.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.630
Can you guys just wave?

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.210
These women have done so
much work for this event

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.840
and in general.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.560
And in recent
years, VIDA's focus

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.350
has broadened in this
consciously intersectional

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.480
direction, because we
don't just have a gender

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.020
problem in the literary world.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.360
And the count is now plural
and examines race, disability,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.780
sexual identity, and age.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.560
And it's ever expanding.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.000
And we're refining
our techniques

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.150
for counting those categories.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:35.390
So the priority of VIDA
today is a bit broader

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.710
than it was in the beginning.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.690
It's to examine and
raise consciousness

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.320
about these interlocking and
intersecting systems of power

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.830
in the literary world, which
is, of course, a microcosm

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.530
of our greater world,
and to create spaces

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.800
on stages like this,
in our online magazine,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.690
and through programs
like saferLIT

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.240
where those most disempowered
intersectional voices can

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.920
be heard and protected.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.310
So I'm here on this panel
as a VIDA board member

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.500
but also as a feminist artist.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.110
So I want to talk a little
bit about my own path

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.410
and the relationship between my
art and my activism and the way

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:14.170
that our work at VIDA is sort
of at the nexus of those things.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.470
So I'm on the cusp of
what some recognize

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.850
as the millennial cutoff.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.120
And I was raised by a very
serious second-wave feminist,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.070
by which I mean that as a
tiny person in a stroller,

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.590
I spent a lot of time
lounging at marches.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.170
And when I learned
to read, I discovered

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.440
that my mother had corrected
all of my fairy tale books

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.470
with a Sharpie to
change the pronouns so

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:46.620
that the female characters
got most of the heroism.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.620
It was Gretel who came up with
the idea with the bread crumbs

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.250
in my book.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.450
And my bedtime lullabies
were Holly Near songs.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.100
Anybody here-- yes.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:57.600
OK.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.050
"Power" was my favorite.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.790
And my first concert was Sweet
Honey in the Rock, probably

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.440
still the best.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.180
The first literary
accolade that I ever

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.790
won was a poetry prize
for girls from NOW,

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.440
the National
Organization for Women,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.740
which as Jane pointed out,
houses their archives here

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.460
at the library.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.690
- We have Holly Near, too.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.330
- You have Holly Near also?

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.452
We'll talk.

00:38:19.452 --> 00:38:20.910
The meetings of
whose local chapter

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.010
I regularly attended with
my mom and her friends

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.670
and played with my
LEGOs in the back.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.300
I was also obsessed
with Ms Magazine.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.457
And I borrowed the name
of its back page column.

00:38:32.457 --> 00:38:34.290
I don't think they've
done this for a while,

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.660
but does anybody
remember "No Comment."

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.110
It was like readers would
send in misogynistic ads,

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.980
and they would collage
them on the back.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.580
They never published
the ads that I sent in.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.320
But I loved it so much,
that I named my zine

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.530
when I was 14 after
the back page of Ms.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.560
And it was also
called "No Comment."

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.770
And I photocopied the issues of
my zine at our local library,

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.500
and then I distributed them
at my small-town high school

00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.970
in Cape Cod.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:05.010
I was very popular, as you can
imagine, as the only girl who

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.260
shaved her head but not her
legs in my whole school, who

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.920
was an out bisexual, who
knew all the words to Bikini

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.860
Kill and Ani DiFranco.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.660
I literally can't
remember a time

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.370
when I didn't
identify as a feminist

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.060
or I didn't know that I
wanted to be a writer.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.320
And I became conscious
of my own privilege

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.460
and my own intersecting
identity around the same time

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.890
that Crenshaw coined the term,
although it was another 20

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.790
years or so before I heard it.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.412
Though I've always
identified as white

00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:34.620
and experience the privileges
of being read that way,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.420
I come from an
interracial family,

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.300
which felt really simple in
some ways inside of our home

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.740
and more complicated in other
ways outside of our home.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.300
And it wasn't until college,
until I came here, actually,

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.640
that my understanding
of feminism

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.740
included a larger
dialogue about race.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.680
And even then, it didn't really
dig into those more nuanced

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680
intricacies.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.730
I'm also the queer
daughter of a queer mother.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.410
But as femme-presenting
women, we

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.470
have often been invisible
and assumed straight.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.542
And in my early 20s,
I became a sex worker.

00:40:03.542 --> 00:40:05.250
And the discourse
around that experience,

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.360
even among feminists, maybe
especially among feminists,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.240
didn't seem to leave room
from my own experience.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.740
So all of these aspects, and
not only these aspects of me,

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.274
felt fraught, laden with
both privilege and erasure.

00:40:20.274 --> 00:40:21.690
And the feminism
I'd grown up with

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.750
didn't give me a map for
how to parse that out,

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.010
how I could be both marginalized
and privileged at the same time

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.540
or how to reconcile all of
those hybrid identities.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.540
I felt so many
things that I just

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.380
felt like I could claim
nothing, a lot of the time.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.360
So writing became a place really
early on for me, really young,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.980
where I tried to put words
to the aspects of myself

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.940
and my world that felt unnamed,
even within my own politics.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.980
And it has always been
that, a place where

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.470
I try to speak what feels
unspoken, discouraged,

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.900
incomprehensible, incompatible.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.140
And as a teacher, that's how I
present writing to my students.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.600
And that practice has
defined both the content

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.220
and the form of my work.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.770
So I write mostly
nonfiction, but I

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.890
borrow elements of poetry
and memoir and scholarship

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.700
and criticism.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.931
And like me, it's a hybrid
thing most of the time.

00:41:11.931 --> 00:41:13.680
And when I finally did
find the literature

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.800
of intersectionality, it
felt like this huge relief

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.390
to see it named.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.990
And that more holistic view
of our culture's sickness,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.830
its fundamental
power imbalances,

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.310
seems, to me at least, also
to reflect the interconnected

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.520
nature of my own identity
and my work and my activism

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.690
and my art.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.640
None of it is separate for me.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.880
And so working with VIDA
seems like the perfect example

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.980
of that integration.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.500
All of us at VIDA are feminists,
writers, teachers, editors,

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.870
folks who often claim the
intersectional identities

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:43.974
that we champion.

00:41:43.974 --> 00:41:46.140
And we're all interested
in leveraging our privilege

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.910
to further that cause.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:49.440
We each bring to
the organization

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.590
our own particular strengths
and employ them in our activism.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.900
And it's part of our
art and our social lives

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.779
and our professions.

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.570
And I think it's
impossible for a lot of us

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.759
to distinguish those things.

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:00.300
And in that way, I
think we're really

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.320
typical of a certain kind
of contemporary feminism.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.410
And I can see the ways that
my mother's feminism grew out

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.730
of that of the suffragists, how
it complicated and corrected

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.740
and advanced much of that work.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.710
And I can also see the way the
third-wave feminists grew out

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.990
of and reinvented the
consciousness-raising groups

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.060
of the '60s and '70s.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.710
And I can see the
ways that my feminism

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.810
and its intersectional
focus is a correction

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.370
to the history of
white feminism,

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.130
to Betty Friedan's fear
of the lavender menace,

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.800
as I can also find its early
echoes in the Bill of Rights

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.500
for NOW, which was
adopted in 1967

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.180
and speaks explicitly
about the need

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.640
for economic and racial justice.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.800
So-- I'm almost done--

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.290
feminisms now, I think, are the
result of centuries of mindful

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.330
feminist work, the
work of activists

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.830
who recognize that
if we are going

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:53.360
to sustain our work, our
waves, but not troughs,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.780
we needed a more expansive
space for feminism.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.090
We needed a feminism
capacious enough for us

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.030
to work together and also
alongside one another.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.770
We needed multiple feminisms.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.510
And I do think
that we have them.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.020
I think that you're looking
at them, in many ways.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.450
And I'll end with a quote
from one of my heroes, one

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.310
that I was reminded
of recently in a talk

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.670
by the wonderful feminist
novelist Randa Jarrar.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.970
So at the 1981 conference of
the American Writers Congress,

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.370
which sounds fancy, but
it was really small,

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.670
Toni Morrison, who was an
editor then at Random House,

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.460
told the audience, "We
don't need any more

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.650
writers as solitary heroes.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.080
We need a heroic
writers' movement,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.110
assertive, militant,
pugnacious."

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.650
And those words-- writing
them gave me a chill.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.840
Reading them-- they make my
armpit hair stand up on end.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.780
Because I think we actually
have right now not one

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.740
heroic feminist movement,
not solitary feminist heroes,

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.280
but a wide-ranging set of
heroic feminist movements.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.330
Because the feminists I work
with today, these people,

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.890
they are as flexible and
creative and connected

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.380
as they are assertive,
militant, and pugnacious.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.870
So I want to thank them
and thank you and thank

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:06.830
my fellow panelists.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.275
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.170
- Hi, guys.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:22.100
First of all, I have to say,
as was mentioned earlier,

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.750
I graduated from Harvard.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.080
I am always overjoyed
every single time

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.730
I get to come back here.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.990
Every single time
I'm invited back,

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.020
I want to jump out of my skin.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.610
Because I'm one of
those people who's

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.860
obsessed with their alma mater.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.770
I used to really make
fun of the people.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:40.430
Like, really?

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.930
That was the best
time of your life?

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.880
But it was.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.250
And also, I am always so
happy to come back to Harvard,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.440
because I do not
arrive at this work

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.870
if I didn't choose this place.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:59.000
I was dumb as hell when I was
17 years old, as most of us are.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.340
But I am so, so thankful
that stupid 17-year-old Kim

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.440
had the foresight
to choose Harvard,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.940
because I'd not become the black
feminist media-maker that I

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.490
am if not for the
African-American studies

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.060
department, if not for the
feminist theory classes

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.690
that I was able to take here,
if not for the robust community

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.490
of black women that I
encountered when I was here.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.600
So I am always delighted
to come back and be

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.860
of service to Harvard College.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.740
So after I got that
out of the way--

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:41.749
so I started For Harriet
in 2010 when I was 20.

00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:42.790
That was eight years ago.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:43.190
How old am I?

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.731
I don't know.

00:45:43.731 --> 00:45:50.180
So anyways, it was the spring
of my junior year in college.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.930
I'm not going to get
into the whole story.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:58.080
But basically, I
was politely asked

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.690
by Harvard College after junior
year not to return in the fall.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.310
And so I was kicked
out of school.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.060
I failed out.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.680
But I came back and graduated.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.680
It's a whole long story.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.110
We can, you know--

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:15.630
But that summer, I
launched For Harriet.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.250
And it was a digital community.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.800
It is a digital community
for black women.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.260
And at that point, my
desire was to create

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.530
intergenerational conversations.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.940
I was incredibly lost.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.410
I was stressed out.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:33.510
I recognized how
important and how

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.600
fortifying the deep
connections that I

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.020
had developed with black
women of different ages

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.190
here had been for me.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.580
So I wanted to recreate
that space online.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.930
So originally, For Harriet
was about dialogue.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.480
At that point, I was
already a progressive.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.340
I was already a feminist.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.290
And so I knew that I wanted For
Harriet to be an intentionally

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.680
progressive space, an
intentionally feminist space,

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.980
where we encourage dialogue,
but the kind of dialogue that

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.080
was going to move us forward.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.220
And from starting this
community in 2010,

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.660
I was able to be really
plugged into black women's

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.290
digital spaces.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:22.210
So this was way back when
everybody had Facebook,

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.180
but not really.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.920
And it was the earlier
days of Twitter.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.930
And Tumblr was a big deal.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:39.530
So there were so many ways for
us to communicate and dialogue.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:44.426
And I wanted to be able to
be a leading voice there.

00:47:44.426 --> 00:47:45.800
I decided not to
script this out.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.140
I did a talk about a month
ago, and it was so scripted,

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.840
and I realized the script
was a straight jacket for me.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.520
So we're going to
loosey goosey it here.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.990
All right.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:03.840
So I always want to
underscore that I

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.630
am a very proud feminist.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.280
I am amazed by the way
that feminist ideas

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.110
have been mainstreamed.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.900
But I always want to
underscore that we do not

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.000
get to this place societially.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.390
We do not get to
the MeToo movement.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.360
We do not get to
intersectional feminism

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.403
without the work and the
theory of black women.

00:48:27.403 --> 00:48:28.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.820
Yeah.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:29.320
Yeah.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.410
It is so interesting
to me the way

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.110
that intersectionality
has been mainstreamed.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.130
The other day, my mom, who
is not a feminist per se,

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.660
said, oh, it's the
intersectionality.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.060
And I said, it's the what?

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.570
But that is because
these ideas that

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.720
used to be confined to
the, quote, unquote,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.300
"ivory tower," they
have worked their way

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.810
into popular discourse.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.210
And that has only happened
because of the work

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:03.270
that black women have
been doing online.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.460
Often when we talk about
the digital divide,

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.610
we talk about how black
folks have less opportunity

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:10.530
to access digital technologies.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.430
Sorry, my contract is about
to do something weird.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.710
We often talk about
the digital divide

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.740
as coming from a
place of black, right?

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:25.800
Black people don't have access
to the newest technologies.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.200
But I think that we see--

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.240
and the way that
black women's work

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.290
has infected mass movement--

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:36.090
I mean, we don't get
to the Women's March

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.520
without the work of black women.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:45.580
I think of that divide as a
source of enormous opportunity.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.110
Black women have
used these spaces--

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.330
Twitter, Facebook,
Tumblr spaces--

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:53.130
that were not made for us.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.190
And they were not
made with us in mind.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.730
But we have innovated
in these spaces

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:05.730
and been able to shape
and craft this discourse

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:09.360
in this back-and-forth and
doing this real-time theorizing

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.570
and doing it in a
way that sticks.

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.300
And that is really,
really incredible.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.200
And so for me at For
Harriet, as I've gotten older

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.480
and grown in my
feminism, I wanted

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.250
to not just have dialogue.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.620
But I wanted to cultivate
the sort of dialogue

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.040
that moves us forward.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.500
Patricia Hill Collins says
in Black Feminist Thoughts--

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.360
I do a lot of citation.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.537
I think a robust citational
practice is really important.

00:50:36.537 --> 00:50:38.370
It's a really important
part of my feminism.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.940
Patricia Hill Collins notes
in Black Feminist Thought

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.900
that the way that we transform
societies is twofold.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.730
So it's doing that
internal work,

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:52.650
changing how you understand
yourself and the world.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.510
And then you do
the external work,

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.240
like changing power relations.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.950
And so I love doing the work
in black women's communities

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.060
of working on that
internal stuff

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.190
and making sure that
it goes outward.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:15.120
So like I said, whenever I make
videos or whenever I'm tweeting

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.540
or whenever I'm editing
or writing articles,

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.650
I make sure to cite
the black women

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:24.990
theorists, the black
women activists who

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.720
have set the stage for
what we are doing now.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.360
And it's really important for
me to do that because I often

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.750
find black women have--

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.470
they are not so apt,
often, to embrace

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:40.450
the idea of being feminists.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:41.760
People say, I'm not a feminist.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.190
I'm a womanist and
all of this stuff.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.200
Because they imagine
feminism as being something

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.550
that is for white women.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:51.090
One of the reasons why I have
a robust citational practice

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:55.650
is to underscore the fact
that we don't just get here,

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:59.220
that black women built this.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.080
This house of black
women and women

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.840
of color, the house that we
are currently standing in

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.550
is not just a house that we
just walked in in 2015, right?

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:11.850
It is a house that we
constructed brick by brick.

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:13.110
That is our labor.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.040
That is our work.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.000
That is our activism.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.180
That is our theory.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.770
And so I always want to
be able to communicate

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:23.730
to black women of all
generations that this is us.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.900
This is ours.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.860
A long time ago, Barack Obama
said, you didn't build that.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.810
No, we did build this.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.530
We did build this.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.870
And so another part of the
work that I am doing now

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.470
at Four Harriet and the work
that I'm doing personally

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.630
as I'm working on
this book project

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:48.180
is trying to outline what does
a feminist life look like?

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.980
Not to steal from Sara Ahmed.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.450
She has an amazing book,
Living a Feminist Life.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.520
But really approaching
that question

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.010
from the unique positionality
of a 29-year-old black woman,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.720
a millennial black woman, whose
feminism has been constructed

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.750
by all of those women who
came before but has also

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.350
been constructed and mediated
by digital technologies

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.470
and the opportunities that
arise from those spaces.

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.210
What do we do?

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:23.360
And so I really want to
underscore for my community is

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:31.280
I don't love how a lot of
times when we're talking

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.850
about liberation, a
really popular approach

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.900
is to approach
liberation from a really

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.970
individualized perspective.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:44.620
So I often hear
people say, liberation

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.240
is whatever it
feels like to you.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.790
Liberation is whatever--

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.270
And I'm like, no.
[? I don't want. ?] Right?

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.940
So one of the things that I
try to underscore in my work

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.030
personally and the work
that we do For Harriet

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.580
is to underscore that
pleasure is important.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.810
Pleasure is important.

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.160
We are human beings.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.410
And it is important for
us to enjoy our lives

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.730
while we're here.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.730
But I urge people to
interrogate those pleasures.

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.420
I think joy is important.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.110
I live for my
five-year-old nieces.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.340
I just am obsessed with them.

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.320
I want to be with them.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.420
No-- I was to lie.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.660
I was going to say I
want to be with them

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.660
every second of the day.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.790
I do not.

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:29.850
But I love to hang
out with them.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:32.000
I never experience
more joy than when

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.680
we are laughing and giggling.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.580
That is important.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.150
But I also want to underscore
our community and the people

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.300
who are drawn to my
work that we have

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.564
to interrogate how our joys
bring other people pain.

00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:45.980
And that doesn't
mean that we have

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.900
to live in that place of shame.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.290
It doesn't mean that we have
to be self-flagellating.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.210
It just means that we
have to be conscientious

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.530
as we move through the world.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:01.290
Another part of what I try to
do is to underscore the fact--

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.310
in doing a lot of research,
I have talked and interviewed

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.530
a lot of OG black feminists.

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.440
I read all the time.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.280
That's a part of my robust
citational practice.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.830
And I try to underscore the
fact that sometimes, especially

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:18.740
online when we're just
trading these thoughts

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.860
and theorizing really,
really quickly, we

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:26.780
have a tendency to think that
we are reinventing the wheel.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:33.020
So take for example,
sexual bodily autonomy.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.979
Sometimes I see young feminists
talk about bodily autonomy

00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:37.770
and freedom with their
sexuality like we're

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.900
the first people who did this.

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.040
And so one of the things
that's so interesting to me--

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.640
I love, I love
interviewing elders--

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:51.280
is listening to a 75-year-old
black woman talk about, yeah,

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.860
I brought my girlfriend
to Thanksgiving in '72.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.490
Yeah, we were out here with
boobs out and butt out,

00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:00.950
and I had my hot pants in '67.

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:02.450
You know what I'm saying?

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.770
We are not the first
people to do this.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:08.900
And that's why a big part of
my feminism, while I think

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:14.540
that contemporary feminism
is altering our conversation

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:18.530
in a very unique way, it's
also building on the shoulders

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:19.760
of those who came before.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.070
And so I always want
to underscore that.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:25.130
And finally, I
love what Dana was

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:29.840
talking about in her approach
to addressing sexual violence.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.550
A big part of what I try to
do as a black feminist who

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.790
will hopefully write
a book of theory--

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:38.540
I am obsessed with theory.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.780
Bell Hooks says in theory
is liberatory practice.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.680
Theory has helped me
understand I'm not crazy.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.430
And I want to help
other people understand

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:48.560
that they're not crazy.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.930
But hopefully, what I'm going
to be doing in this work

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.810
is letting people know
that different is possible,

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.210
that we don't have to settle
for what we've been given,

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.790
that it looks hard
and sometimes it's

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.310
not easy for us to imagine.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.490
What is a world without prisons?

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:05.510
Well, what does that look like?

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.420
But we can still
make steps forward.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.670
A new world is possible.

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:14.185
So that's really what
I'm I'm trying to do.

00:57:14.185 --> 00:57:17.155
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.870
- How's this microphone?

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:27.370
Good?

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:27.870
OK.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:28.700
Cool.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.170
Hello, people.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:31.420
Hi.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.030
This is my baby, [? Adrie. ?]
And over there is my nephew,

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.830
[? Shakur, ?] who's
doing a campus visit.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:43.010
So I think you made a good
sell for the University,

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:46.170
for a young back
man to study here.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:48.250
Anyway, my name is Emi.

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.500
I am currently
[INAUDIBLE] my work.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:56.530
Lots of my work has to do
with the impact of policies

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:58.330
on people who are
in the sex trade,

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.740
and especially the kind of
policy that's rolled out.

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.940
And suppose they
do protect people

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.950
from the human
trafficking, especially

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:08.440
sex trafficking of
young people, but how

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:12.250
those policies in practice
impact the young people who

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:15.820
are often runaways, who
are queer and trans youth,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.330
or the other people who
are in the sex trade who

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:20.980
are immigrants and
people of color

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:24.220
and how those
policies are actually

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.610
adding onto the
existing state violence

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.000
against those very
same communities.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.620
So that's my main work.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.970
But since this is a 75th
anniversary for the Schlesinger

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:41.830
Library, and I was
reminded about the article

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:44.980
that I wrote in 1999 about a
Transfeminist Manifesto, which

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.250
was like trying to write
transfeminism when there wasn't

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.070
even very much writing
about trans issues

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.500
in the first place.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.680
Kate Bornstein's
Gender Outlaw was out.

00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.850
Leslie Feinberg's book on
Transgender Warrior was out.

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.770
But there was basically
nothing else that was there.

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:08.590
And so it happened in 1999.

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:09.910
How long ago is that?

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.100
If there are any students
here, some of the students

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.210
weren't even born.

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.854
1999 is when Brittany was
singing "Hit Me One More Time."

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:21.681
TLC's "No Scrubs."

00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:22.180
OK.

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.230
So that's 1999.

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:26.710
SpongeBob just started in 1999.

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:29.230
Columbine High School
shooting was 1999.

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:30.850
It's a long time ago.

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:35.650
And it's just so unbelievable
to think that the whole trans

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:38.470
movement and trans
awareness was,

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:42.460
like, zero at the time
compared to it is now.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:45.640
And I was writing about
transfeminism at the time

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.410
and trying to write
about the [? how-- ?]

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.880
in both ways for the trans
to feminism and the feminism

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.510
to trans.

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.560
So I wanted to write about
how the key feminist issues

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.920
and concepts and
movements and focuses

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.980
on the feminist politics
and how those apply

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.250
to trans women and other
trans people and people who

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.980
are gender nonconforming,
which was not the language I

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.079
used at the time.

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.620
By the way, at the
time, the language

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.000
was transsexual, because there
are lots of older transsexual

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.660
people at the time
who are saying,

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.910
don't call me transgender.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:19.900
That's not right.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.800
So whatever.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.552
That's old battles
from the 1990s.

01:00:24.552 --> 01:00:26.010
So I was using the
word transsexual

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:32.020
to talk about that, how
those feminist politics,

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.810
feminist theory,
feminist movement,

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.600
apply to trans women
and other people.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.470
And on the other hand, we're
talking about how involving,

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:45.220
including trans women's
lives and experiences changed

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.010
feminism.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:51.200
So how does that inform when you
look at the ideas of privilege,

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.640
especially when people
talk about male privilege

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.730
and other privileges,
too, people

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.730
think in terms of people
have it or not have it,

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:01.600
just static and
totalizing things.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.700
But that's not reality
in actual practice.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.810
And I think that's true
for any other people, too.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:10.210
But when you talk about
trans women's involvement

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:13.200
in feminism, that
makes even more clear

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:19.090
that this idea of totalizing
and static privilege

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.569
is not a real thing.

01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:23.110
And I think that that's kind
of, in fact, one of the examples

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:27.250
that I think that trans
feminism brings to the feminism.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.040
So I was writing about that.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.360
And again, as I said, it's 1999.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.370
It was limited because
of the historical--

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:38.800
the terms that I
used at the time

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.870
are not legible today
to people who are not

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.160
aware about the history.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.300
And it's a historical text, even
though it's only 20 years old.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.940
It's a historical
text that requires

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.190
the [? historisizing ?]
to understand

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.320
what those things mean.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.630
When they talk about
how there is virtually

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:02.860
no representation of trans
men, which is not true now.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.696
But the time, it
was very much true.

01:02:05.696 --> 01:02:07.570
We had a couple of
friends who are trans men.

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.150
But there wasn't
any organization

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.000
that was headed by trans men
at the time, for example.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.130
So that was actually
true at the time.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.720
And it's a totally
different time now.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.327
So there are weaknesses
because it's historical.

01:02:20.327 --> 01:02:21.910
And also there was
weakness, because I

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:25.380
was writing in a near void.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.270
And there was very
little published.

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.770
And especially there
was very little

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.530
published about transfeminism.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.570
And there was very
little published

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.920
about trans women of color.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.610
I didn't know
about Sylvia Rivera

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.790
or [INAUDIBLE] at the
time I was writing this

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.740
because nobody was
writing about that.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.070
There wasn't blogs.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.860
I mean, 1999, people
started writing some,

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.750
you know, what is that?

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.340
Like a diary thing.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.670
And the weblogs started
happening in 2000.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.460
And that became blog
a little bit later.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.710
So there wasn't those.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.164
There wasn't Tumblr.

01:03:03.164 --> 01:03:04.080
There wasn't Facebook.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.890
There wasn't any
of those things.

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:09.390
And so I was writing
without those things.

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:13.080
I was relying on books
and magazine articles.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.640
And those are things
about white trans people.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.360
There was nothing else.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.530
So some of the weakness from
the [? manifest ?] that I feel--

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.510
and I kind of feel
embarrassed that sometimes,

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.670
some of the universities
are using that text when

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:31.050
from 1999 as if a contemporary
cutting-edge piece, which

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:32.020
it's not.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.980
Is something that was written
at a certain historical moment

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.480
that is not now.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.910
And I think it could be
beneficial if people actually

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:40.050
read that way.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.240
But to use it and
show people, hey,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.850
this is a really cool new thing,
and then that's so backward.

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:50.310
So it's been 20 years.

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.310
And I wanted to think about--
oh, my [? Adrie ?] is just

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:56.081
inside this.

01:03:56.081 --> 01:03:57.900
She's just completely hidden.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:04.470
So transfeminism in the 20 years
and how it changed or how it--

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:11.160
on one hand, we have rapid
and just explosive explosion

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.590
of the trans movement
and trans awareness,

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:16.530
trans visibility over
the last 20 years.

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:18.900
That was so much
hidden at the time.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.220
But it's much more visible
that there are so many people,

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.850
so many trans
people who are out,

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.530
so many trans people who are in
the media, and who [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.710
And also there are so
many trans allies who

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.450
are feminist and non-feminists.

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.580
And so we see all
of those, and it

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:40.410
seems that because we have maybe
100 times as many feminists who

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.380
are trans allies,
you might think

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.460
that transfeminism is 100
times stronger because of that.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.330
But on the other hand, I feel
that even though this wide

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.075
acceptance and awareness
have spread about [? trans ?]

01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:57.780
[? issues ?] in general,
the transfeminism--

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:03.630
it's like sharp awareness of
the interaction between trans

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:07.830
women's experiences with the
feminist ideas and movements

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:11.250
hasn't really happened except
for those few philosophy

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:14.140
journals you see some of the
really radical writing about.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.030
That's not what
people are reading.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:20.760
Well, what I noticed is that
there was too much emphasis

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.630
on respecting individual
identities, individual gender

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.540
identities, and
respecting the pronoun.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.760
That was part of
the introduction

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.270
that was read about me.

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:34.380
So people just respecting
that somebody is--

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.600
somebody's gender
identity and pronouns.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.780
And they end there, because
that's a test of whether or not

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.490
you are a trans ally.

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:43.590
But that's so limited.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.330
That's just the basic.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.290
That's assumption.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.810
That's a premise, and
that's a [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:50.490
That's a starting point.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.930
But that's not the end.

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:53.890
That doesn't make
you a trans ally

01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:59.310
or you make your task as
a trans ally end there.

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:01.660
And yeah, that's how it ends.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.230
And I was just talking earlier
with [? Naomi ?] [INAUDIBLE],,

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:08.430
who wrote in 1995, I think, that
it in the context [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:11.770
lives, but transsexual
lives are lived and livable.

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:13.650
This is something that
was written in 1995

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.815
or-- is it 1995?

01:06:15.815 --> 01:06:17.300
- 1997.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:17.890
- Something.

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:18.390
Yeah.

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:19.880
It's before the Manifesto.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.760
And by the way, I didn't
know that work in 1999

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.130
when I wrote the Manifesto.

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.280
I met her around 2000, 2001.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.590
And so that's the idea that
we need to take the trans life

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.560
and existence as given.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.100
It's for granted.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.030
We're not debating that.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.560
People exist, and we
don't need to have

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.810
any theoretical
justification for that.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:46.070
People exist.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:48.140
And then talk about
what we need to make

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.355
people's lives less horrible.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.490
But that doesn't
happen very much.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:58.340
We think that when we
respect someone's identity

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.400
and we respect somebody's
principal pronouns, that's it.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.510
That's the end of it.

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:07.280
And that's how the bar
for the being trans allies

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.780
has been set so low, that just
by satisfying that, somehow you

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:19.040
escape any further
requirement to do something,

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.340
to address that kind of violence
and inequality and poverty

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.150
all the things that affect
the people who are trans.

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.650
And this is like a neoliberal
politics privilege [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:32.900
individual liberty to identify
who they are, reduces gender

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.030
to the individual preferences.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.790
But gender is not just
individual preferences.

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:41.230
It's a [INAUDIBLE] social
stratification and violence as

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.310
well as of resistance
and liberation.

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:45.950
So that when you don't look at
that, when you think of it only

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.070
as a label you put on yourself
and then other people just

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:51.110
need to respect that,
that removes this

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:54.005
from the social context where
people are actually living.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.550
The trans terms and
concepts are often

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:06.260
defined in a removed,
anti-feminist, even,

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.760
[? reactionary ?] ways.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.710
People define trans
as somebody who

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.500
is born with a body
that's different from how

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.550
they identify.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:17.359
And they say, well, the cis,
that's opposite of a trans,

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.010
for those people who
haven't heard it.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.430
People often define cis means
that you are born with a body

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.149
and you're fine with the gender
that you are assigned with.

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:30.680
And if the being fine with the
gender you are assigned with

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:35.000
was what makes you cis, this
then feminists are not cis.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.450
Feminists are not OK with the
kind of gender, the imposition

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.300
of gender that's placed on us.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:46.850
And yet, that really
diminishes the reality

01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:48.290
that cis is actually real.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.710
Trans people do experience
a certain limitation

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.359
and restriction in life.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.740
So it's a real thing that
we need to talk about.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.760
But by defining it in such
a [? reactionary ?] way,

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.729
that it makes it lose meaning.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:05.210
So often it's just
really poorly defined.

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.859
And this happens because we
remove the trans politics

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:14.810
and transfeminism from
the realities of how

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:18.529
people experience in our lives.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:23.149
But there was one time the
trans movement has actually

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:27.680
gone more intersectional,
[? especially ?] in 2014.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.770
That's the year in
January [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.460
was released from prison.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.920
She was a black trans women
who was put in the men's prison

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.520
for defending herself.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.600
And then she when she came out,
she and the black trans women

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.500
actress Laverne Cox,
went around in the media

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.250
and around the country talking
about prison abolition, prison

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.890
reform, prison
abolition, actually,

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.420
talking about how
the prison is just

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.140
not a good thing
for trans people

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.450
and that we shouldn't just
be looking at the pronouns.

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:03.020
We need to be thinking
about prisons.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.030
In February, Janet
Mock's book-- she's

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:06.710
another black trans
women who's also

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:11.030
mixed-race in Hawaii, an
indigenous Hawaiian woman,

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:14.810
released the book, Redefining
Realness in February 2014.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:18.800
And in June, the Laverne Cox,
the black trans woman actress,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.740
was on the cover of Time
Magazine with the title

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.700
The Transgender Tipping Point.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.500
And then in January
2015, we saw the release

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.120
of the film The Tangerine.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.830
How many of you
have seen Tangerine?

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:32.450
Watch it.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:34.810
It's [? the ?] best film.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.000
I love it.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.320
It's about the black
trans women who are doing

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.230
sex work and all kinds of--

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:47.157
their community and all the
crazy shit that happens.

01:10:47.157 --> 01:10:47.990
You should watch it.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.060
It's amazing.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.280
It's comedic.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.290
And it shows the trans women,
black trans women, characters

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:59.920
as acted by black trans
women and beautiful.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.850
Anyway, there was a rush of
this focus on black trans women.

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:06.100
And black trans women
somehow dominated

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.420
the public representation of
a trans issues for a while.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:14.200
And it's not just
only the black trans

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.960
women that were on the
cover of magazines.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.220
But they were talking
about prison abolition.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.440
And that has never
happened before.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.860
And then that dominance
of the black trans

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.472
women in the media and all
that died down quickly in 2015.

01:11:29.472 --> 01:11:30.840
What happen in 2015?

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.620
Do you know?

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.130
2015, what happened
was Caitlyn Jenner.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.700
Caitlyn Jenner, who
supported Donald Trump.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.460
Caitlyn Jenner, who said
to the Vanity Fair magazine

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.170
the hardest part
about being a woman

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:46.330
is figuring out what to wear.

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:52.450
So she became the face of the
transgender people in America.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:57.400
And along with that, we saw the
rise of the anti-trans bathroom

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.876
bills around the country.

01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:01.000
So they're trying to restrict
trans people's access

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.720
to bathrooms.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.060
So with all of those--

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.810
and also I feel like both the
gay rights and anti-gay rights

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:13.500
movements used the
bathroom issue because they

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.810
lost the issue of marriage.

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:18.330
The marriage was--
the Supreme Court,

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:20.040
everything might come back.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.210
But for the moment, it
was resolved nationally.

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:26.850
So they needed some issue
to rally around their people

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.480
and raise more money so they
went to the bathroom issue

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.770
on both sides.

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:35.880
And how this bathroom
bill controversy happened

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.450
was that it reduced-- the
whole idea of bathroom access

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:42.750
is way more political than just
whether or not trans people can

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.430
use the bathroom.

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.830
We think about trans
inclusion, but we also

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:51.240
think about the access for
homeless people and people

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.250
using drugs in the
public bathrooms

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:57.690
because there are no
other safe place to do so.

01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:02.340
The politics around racial
segregation was a thing.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:07.080
There is sexual violence,
sexual harassment in restrooms.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.870
The bathroom in
certain communities

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:12.150
was the site for
cruising for sex.

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:15.840
So there's lots of politics
and culture behind that.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.280
And then also we have--

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.750
it's just so funny.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.870
So many cafes around
in Seattle where I live

01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:26.340
have a sign that says all are
welcome, immigrants welcome.

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.910
And then bathroom
for customers only.

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.410
No public bathroom.

01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:34.980
At the same-- next
to each other.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.540
And then when you think
about the establishment

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.750
of quality-of-life crime
laws which makes it

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.750
a crime for people to lie
down in the street or pee,

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:48.410
urinate in the street
and things like that.

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:51.570
And those are specifically
targeting certain communities.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.410
So there are so many
political things

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:56.760
that are involved in this idea
about bathroom access itself.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.310
And yet it's just reduced
to who gets to access--

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.492
which person gets to
access which bathroom?

01:14:02.492 --> 01:14:04.450
And they're not thinking
about homeless people.

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.650
They're not thinking about
other people who are--

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.710
people with disabilities
who can't access bathrooms.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:13.860
They're only thinking about
which white trans women can

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.600
access women's restrooms.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.950
That's how reduced
that issue is.

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:23.130
We need to not do this.

01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:24.940
We need to go back to the--

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.220
oh, [? Adrie-- ?] we need to
think about the gender justice

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.160
and gender liberation, not
the gender libertarianism,

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.100
where you get to decide
which gender you are.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:40.050
We need the public spaces
reimagined radically,

01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:42.570
not just the
gender-appropriate bathrooms

01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:48.030
and designating the gender
policies for each facilities.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.800
And we need prison
abolition and not

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.650
gender-sensitive prisons
that can put people

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.850
in the right place.

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.730
And I want to end with
that what [INAUDIBLE] said

01:14:56.730 --> 01:14:58.740
in the early interviews
right after she came out

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.420
of prison, when she was put in
the men's prison for two years.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.330
And people lobbied,
organized to try to get her

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:09.510
to be transferred
to a women's prison.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.940
But she actually
responded to that,

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.370
saying that, no, the
women's prison is not

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.650
an appropriate place
for me, either.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:20.610
There's no appropriate place
in a prison for a black trans

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:23.250
women like her and
probably for nobody else.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.840
So she was telling the
people, and many of those

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.557
are trans activists and
trans allies who are white,

01:15:29.557 --> 01:15:31.140
who don't know
anything about prison--

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.150
I'm not saying that
white people don't know--

01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:34.890
I'm talking about
people who have

01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:37.890
no experience in
the prison activism

01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:41.820
before are being introduced
to that through the work

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.330
of a black trans woman
who was in men's prison

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.030
and telling people, rather
than to fight the fact that she

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:50.840
was misclassified into men's
prison instead of women's

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.210
prison, we need to fight
to release and free

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:58.080
all trans women and all
black people and all people

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:58.830
from the prisons.

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:00.750
And so that's like a really--

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.503
it was really--

01:16:02.503 --> 01:16:04.270
I don't know what to say.

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:06.120
It was really
exciting to see that.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:11.940
And that became the call
of the trans movement

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.900
for a second in 2014.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.310
I want to bring that back.

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:18.070
OK.

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:20.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:29.260
- Wow.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.380
Thank you so much.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.420
It's interesting,
because one of the things

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.902
about our generations is that
we spend so much time thinking--

01:16:37.902 --> 01:16:40.360
especially people who are maybe
a little bit older than you

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.400
guys, like me-- that we
spent so much time thinking,

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.880
oh, my gosh, we don't have
progressive intellectual life,

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.520
progressive cultural life,
where has it happened?

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.080
And it's just such
a pleasure to me

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.270
personally to be able
to be here with you guys

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:56.710
and to realize the amazing
work that you're doing

01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:58.510
and the amazing
energy that you all

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:01.537
are bringing to your activism
and into your creative stuff.

01:17:01.537 --> 01:17:03.370
Fatimah, I wanted to
say to you thank you so

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.580
much for your beautiful poetry.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.246
It was just, frankly, fantastic.

01:17:07.246 --> 01:17:09.134
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.285
And just you know, I'm a super
snob about literature so--

01:17:15.285 --> 01:17:16.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.610
You're good.

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:19.470
You're good.

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:21.780
And I just wanted
to say you had me,

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.270
and I think you set the
tone for this conversation

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:26.910
with that whole idea that
we don't want-- none of us

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:29.450
wants our identities to
be thought of as just lack

01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:30.090
and trauma.

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:33.600
All of us are unbelievably
complicated people.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.680
Dana, I love the
idea of the fact

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:42.960
that young feminists, some of
them survivors, many of them

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.990
survivors, are,
in fact, thinking

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.660
in sophisticated ways
about holistic responses

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.740
to sexual violence.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.619
That is an amazing
and brave thing.

01:17:51.619 --> 01:17:53.910
And you and the people that
you're doing your work with

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:55.020
need to be commended.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.300
And I told you
earlier that I think

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.130
that the fact that
you have been involved

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:01.100
in an organization
of young people--

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.890
and training young people to
take over the organization

01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:07.230
is an incredibly radical
thing to be doing,

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:09.025
radical in the best
sense of the word.

01:18:09.025 --> 01:18:11.720
So thank you for that.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.360
And Melissa, for
one thing, I wanted

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.200
to tell you that my
first-ever album was Queen

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.390
and my second ever album
I ever bought on my own

01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.900
was Holly Near.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:25.046
So I'm right there
with you on that.

01:18:25.046 --> 01:18:26.670
And I still have that
Holly Near album.

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.560
And I got it signed by
Holly Near, no less.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.220
And so I think that it's amazing
to have a generation of people

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:36.060
that's having a set of
cultural references built off

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.351
of feminism.

01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:38.850
And thank you for
that conversation.

01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:40.800
And I love it that
right at the beginning

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.900
of the process of
VIDA's development

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.690
you all were already
interested intersectionality.

01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:51.382
So it was a question of
the genders of the writers

01:18:51.382 --> 01:18:53.340
and the creative people
who were being included

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.470
but also their race
and their sexuality

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:59.310
and their age and their
ability or disability.

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:03.400
And then Melissa, I have
to say, excuse me, Kim,

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.290
I have to say to you that--

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:08.140
to thank you, actually,
because, in fact,

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.290
this is my second
week at Harvard.

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:15.000
And so I was like, well,
there is a robust community

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.700
of black women.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.630
There is plenty of
feminist theory.

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:20.820
And there's both
women and gender

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.410
studies and African and
African-American studies.

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.050
So I'm psyched all up.

01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:26.460
I'm psyched all up about it.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.420
- You're welcome.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.700
- Thank you very much.

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.390
And I couldn't
agree with you more

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.690
that we need to do better
citational practice.

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.920
And I'm a snob about
citational practice, in fact.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.800
I, in fact, know what
I'm talking about.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.290
And I think that
it's a point that

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:46.800
has to be driven home over
and over and over again.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.522
And I really like this idea
of what does feminist life

01:19:50.522 --> 01:19:52.980
actually look like and what
does a feminist future actually

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.479
look like?

01:19:53.479 --> 01:19:55.230
And I'll go through
this quickly,

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.830
and then I'll ask all of
you this question exactly.

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:00.660
And Emi, obviously,
your comments

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:05.324
were so informative
and so brave.

01:20:05.324 --> 01:20:07.740
It's rare that you have somebody
talk about their own work

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.992
and say, you know, this
work that I did 20 years ago

01:20:09.992 --> 01:20:12.450
actually has its own limitations
that are based on the fact

01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:15.190
that it was done 20 years ago.

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.910
And I bet you're a rougher
reader of your work

01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:20.190
than everybody else is.

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.650
And then it's a bold
statement to say

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:27.120
that you believe that there's
too much emphasis on questions

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.445
of individual identities
and that what you believed

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:32.070
should happen, I
think, a lot of people

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:34.140
actually believe is-- the
phrase that you've said

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:39.960
is the public spaces should
be reimagined radically.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.610
So I was stunned by what
you were saying, all of you.

01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:49.260
But what kills me, what really
I can't get my head around,

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.110
is that we're here with
a group of very, very

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.970
impressive persons.

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:57.870
And [INAUDIBLE] are doing
all sorts of fantastic work.

01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:02.400
I don't get it, how you can
have this community of people

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.540
engaging with this
community of people

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.150
and yet we're in a
time in our country

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:10.860
in which intersectional is
wildly under attack, when

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.470
there's a certain set
of identity politics

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.200
that have taken
over the government.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.840
And so can you explain to us
how that weird bifurcation

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.670
is happening in our culture?

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.268
And then tell us
the way forward.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:25.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:28.580
But I also should say that
we don't have so much time.

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.454
So you're going to need
to be quick about it,

01:21:30.454 --> 01:21:34.240
because we want to have
questions and answer, too.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.800
- I would say that
pushback is to be expected.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.750
I'm not a historian.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.360
But I do be reading.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.680
And I got a degree in African
and African-American studies.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.350
Shout out to [INAUDIBLE]
[? Skip ?] [? Gates. ?] So

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:50.320
anyways, I think we see
throughout history that

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.137
as people of color, marginalized
people make inroads.

01:21:54.137 --> 01:21:56.470
There's always going to be
pushback from the mainstream,

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:57.970
from majority.

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:06.340
That power shift always causes
a mass revolt and pushback.

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:10.150
And so I'm not
necessarily surprised.

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:13.720
I heard an amazing writer
called [? Doreen ?] [? St. ?]

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.740
[? Felix ?] once.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.200
She said that this
is just evidence

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.429
that white supremacy
is on its last breath,

01:22:19.429 --> 01:22:20.470
you know what I'm saying.

01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:23.170
So this historical
moment that we're in,

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:26.110
I don't consider it
to be a huge failure.

01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:31.025
I consider it to be evidence
that we are on the right path.

01:22:31.025 --> 01:22:33.450
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:39.520
- Can I ask you guys
back about that.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.160
I tend to think
that that's true.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.600
At the same time, what
about the question of people

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.290
right now in having to
deal with backlash in ways

01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:51.880
that are quite deadly?

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.650
What do you say to communities
that really are getting it

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:55.480
in the neck?

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.610
There's lots of
[? spikes ?] of all types

01:22:57.610 --> 01:22:58.810
of violence in this society.

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:00.190
How do we actually--

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.400
I agree that we're probably
moving ahead historically.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.000
How do we care for each other
during what are very, very

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.523
difficult times for all of us?

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.600
I also will call on you.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.680
I am a professor.

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:22.731
- I can't-- does this mic work?

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:23.230
No.

01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:24.340
Yes.

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:27.540
So I think-- this is hard for
me because I'm not an academic,

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.540
I'm not an intellectual.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.902
I'm an artist.

01:23:29.902 --> 01:23:31.360
So all of my work
is contextualized

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:36.700
by the practice of art making
and by being an artist first.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.830
And so thinking about the
kind of current age we're in,

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:44.440
I agree a lot with
Kim about the feeling

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:53.260
of this moment being a
response to the kind of hope

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.500
that folks had when Obama
was president and when folks

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.830
were like, oh, now
we're post-racial

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.990
or whatever that mass was.

01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:06.640
But I think that as an
artist, though, we've been--

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.229
what you do is--

01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.770
I don't know.

01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:09.580
Whatever.

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.410
I've seen the ways
in which folks have

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.630
been suffering for forever.

01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:14.900
This isn't to me--

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.740
and a lot of folks have asked
me when the book was coming out,

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.950
when Brown Girls was coming
out, I was like, well,

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:21.940
now's the time.

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.100
And I was like, now
is the time for what?

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.210
That's been happening.

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:26.230
This has been happening.

01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:29.110
You read articles
from the '70s and '80s

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:32.260
of cops murdering young
black people in New York

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.310
and all over the country.

01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:37.060
This is not-- all of
this stuff has just kind

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.620
of been happening for so long.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.450
And it's really,
really frustrating

01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:44.440
to feel like that has
continued to happen

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.890
and people's labor has continued
to happen around organizing

01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:49.430
and being activists around it.

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:53.530
And then there is still such
daunting white supremacy.

01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:55.330
That's a really
frustrating thing.

01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:59.110
And to me, what I think
about it as an artist,

01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:01.204
what is the role of art in that?

01:25:01.204 --> 01:25:02.620
What is the role
of things that we

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.220
can do as artists to
both provide spaces

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.440
of alleviation and
of joy and also

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.061
to provide spaces of a
magnifying glass and a witness

01:25:11.061 --> 01:25:11.560
to that?

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.620
And so that to me
is what I think

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.570
of as the responsibility
of an artist

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:21.280
is to say how can you
both be the magnifying

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.660
glass and the moments where
you can kind of build a shelter

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:30.220
for that feeling?

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:33.790
And I agree a lot with
Emi about the kind of ways

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.860
that it's really important
to radically reimagine

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.640
public spaces.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.660
And I think that if there were
spaces in which we could have

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.210
public reckonings
with our history,

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.730
if there were spaces in
which that was named,

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.320
I think we would live in
a really different world.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.790
And I think that
if we really had

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:57.280
to grapple where we walked on
a day-to-day basis, the things

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.230
that have happened in
the spaces we're around,

01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:00.790
I think we would
just really live

01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:01.956
in a really different world.

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:03.820
- So are you saying
that we should

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:08.740
do more monuments, more memorial
practices in the society

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.180
at large?

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:10.729
- I think so.

01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:11.520
I mean, I think so.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.660
I think that--

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.900
I did a Fullbright
in Bosnia where--

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.110
and it was 20 years after
the siege of Sarajevo.

01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:22.150
And I was really interested
in the ways that--

01:26:22.150 --> 01:26:24.870
I was looking particularly
at memorialization,

01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:28.760
using art as a way of
memorializing violence.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.116
And I think what I saw there.

01:26:31.116 --> 01:26:31.990
And it's not perfect.

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:33.940
But what I saw was
moments in which

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:36.610
both through ephemeral
site-specific work

01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:40.180
and through monuments
and through art,

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.460
and even just how
all the parks were

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.770
converted into grave
sites out of necessity.

01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:48.160
There is a way when that
happens, you really grapple

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:48.660
with things.

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.402
And here, I think a
lot of American society

01:26:51.402 --> 01:26:53.860
is just really interested in
the Band-Aid and the cover-up.

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.964
And I don't think that
that's a good thing.

01:26:55.964 --> 01:26:57.880
- Can I ask all of you
a question that follows

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.004
from that, then, about--

01:27:00.004 --> 01:27:02.170
especially because we're
talking about feminisms now

01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:07.660
and we're talking about
millennial feminism in relation

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.310
to second-wave feminism--

01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:11.980
how is it that
you do as feminist

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:14.710
the types of
understanding what has

01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:18.290
come before the types
of memorialization

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:22.250
of previous ways of thinking
that actually can get

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.250
to large amounts of people,
that actually allows

01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:25.600
us to not always be--

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.570
every one of you said something
about recreating the wheel.

01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:31.180
And I'm not sure, as an
educator, that I know

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.530
how to not recreate the wheel.

01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:34.238
I wonder if you guys
have ideas about how

01:27:34.238 --> 01:27:36.470
to do a better job of that.

01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:42.760
- I guess I will say--

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.440
and I'll also relate
this back to art,

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.960
because it's analogous for
something that comes up

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.610
in my teaching a lot, which
is that I get a lot of writers

01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:54.100
being worried that
their work is going

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.670
to be reinventing the wheel or
that it's not totally unique.

01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.910
And my answer to that
over the years has become,

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:02.620
it doesn't have to be.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:04.990
Certainly there
is a way that you

01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:08.140
are creating a work that could
be executed and delivered

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.780
in only the way that you
could possibly do that.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.720
But its message is not
going to be a new one,

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.047
because the things that
we need to see in art,

01:28:15.047 --> 01:28:17.380
as the things that we need
to address with our activism,

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.210
are not new problems.

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:22.420
So I'm really into
Kimberley's phrase

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.440
of robust citational practice.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.289
So I think it's not--

01:28:27.289 --> 01:28:29.830
I don't think there's a problem
with fighting the same fight.

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:32.032
Because we haven't won it yet.

01:28:32.032 --> 01:28:34.240
It's about sort of giving
credit to the people who've

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.200
done it before and to adopting
correct strategies that

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.651
worked and didn't work.

01:28:39.651 --> 01:28:40.150
- All right.

01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:41.739
I'll ask one last
question on my own,

01:28:41.739 --> 01:28:43.780
and then I think that we
have the microphone here

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.030
so we'll take some
questions from the audience.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:48.530
So I get all that.

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:52.570
But how do you stay
robust yourselves?

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.660
It's an amazing thing to have
a robust citational practice.

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.220
It's an amazing thing to be
constantly doing your work.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:02.770
But how do you make sure
that our communities

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:06.530
are caring for themselves and
in the fight for the long term?

01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:10.850
I like the idea of you've got to
have pleasure in life as well.

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:13.949
And we all know that one of the
real tragedies of generations

01:29:13.949 --> 01:29:16.240
of activists who came before
us is that so many of them

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.930
burned out, died early deaths,
had real financial problems,

01:29:19.930 --> 01:29:22.460
had real substance
problems, everything.

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:26.987
So we would be wrong to not
note that and to try to say,

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:29.320
at least among ourselves,
look, these are the strategies

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.560
that one needs in order
to be an activist who

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.240
is a robust activist
and a robust person.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.190
- Yeah.

01:29:37.190 --> 01:29:43.330
I would recall what
Fatimah said about lack.

01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:46.780
And what I see is its
converse, which is abundance

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:49.660
and gratitude and
joy and plenty.

01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:53.410
And even in the midst of all
of these recurrent problems,

01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:54.280
we all have that.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.200
And I think most of
us referenced it.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.189
And for me, I have to
feed that part of me that

01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:01.480
is in touch with the abundance.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.940
And that comes from
absorbing other people's art.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.590
I talk about
therapy as much as I

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:08.350
can because it has been
so necessary to my art

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:13.010
and my activism and my
recovery and remaining robust.

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:16.300
And I think that talking
about self-care--

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:19.090
the term has a little
fatigued with that.

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:20.674
But there are forms
of wellness that I

01:30:20.674 --> 01:30:22.923
think are radical, especially
for certain populations.

01:30:22.923 --> 01:30:24.430
- I loved in
Fatimah's second poem,

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:28.920
I think it was, how to not get--

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.261
what was it?

01:30:30.261 --> 01:30:31.155
- Hypothermia.

01:30:31.155 --> 01:30:32.049
- Ever so sorry.

01:30:32.049 --> 01:30:32.950
- Oh, that's OK.

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:36.160
- That the answer to that
was have your friends.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.500
So self-care is also
about communities

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.350
caring for each other
and caring for each other

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.080
across differences as well.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.130
- I also just want
to say really fast

01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:48.730
that when I emphasize
to people my age

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:51.130
and younger generations
of women that we don't

01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:53.950
have to recreate the wheel,
it is not necessarily

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:55.945
an admonishment.

01:30:55.945 --> 01:30:58.570
It's the fact that-- look at all
of this incredible work that's

01:30:58.570 --> 01:30:59.410
been done.

01:30:59.410 --> 01:31:01.060
Look at this
incredible foundation

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.579
that we have to build from.

01:31:02.579 --> 01:31:04.370
And then we don't have
to beat ourselves up

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:06.610
if we don't feel like we
have all of the answers.

01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:08.710
And we don't have
to waste time trying

01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:12.250
to retread these arguments
that have already been had,

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:16.250
trying to remake this theory
that's already been done.

01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:18.700
We get to remix and remake.

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:22.330
And that's an
enormous opportunity.

01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:23.680
She mentioned abundance.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.121
I feel enormous gratitude
that we have that.

01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:26.620
- Right.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.300
That's fantastic.

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:31.570
So I think that we can
take a few questions.

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:34.334
I have been asked to
be that time police.

01:31:34.334 --> 01:31:35.000
I don't like it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.300
I don't even believe in the
Western concept of time.

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.880
But I will knuckle under
for the time being.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.560
If there are people who
would like to come to this

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.800
mic in the center, if
you'd like to ask questions

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.700
to our panelists.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.574
And they do have all
the answers, by the way.

01:31:54.851 --> 01:31:55.350
- Hello.

01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:57.360
I just had a kind
of quick question.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.420
As someone who's lived in
a lot of different areas

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.070
of the country, I've found--

01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:04.550
I've only lived here in New
England for a few years.

01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:07.710
But I've found
that there's often

01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:10.880
this sense that this
very liberal area isn't

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.850
part of the problem.

01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:14.850
And I wonder if you
have any suggestions

01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:16.950
for sort of changing the
conversation around that.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:27.750
- No.

01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:29.722
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:31.201 --> 01:32:33.173
- Can you clarify your question?

01:32:33.173 --> 01:32:35.020
- Yeah, I'm not sure
I totally [INAUDIBLE]..

01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.895
- I think that if I can
repeat what you said,

01:32:36.895 --> 01:32:41.120
I think that you said that
you live here in this area,

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.780
in the Boston-Cambridge
area, and in liberal areas

01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:47.180
the assumption is often that
we are not part of the problem,

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.350
the problem of woman-hating,
the problem of racism,

01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:53.170
the problem of transphobia,
the whole thing, and--

01:32:53.170 --> 01:33:03.170
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:06.410
- And so New England
is just now reckoning

01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:09.000
with the violence
of slavery as well.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.500
So how do you, in
New England, let's

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.250
say it that way, how
do you in New England

01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:14.720
continue to do activism with
a population that imagines

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.937
that it's not the
problem, largely imagines

01:33:16.937 --> 01:33:18.020
that it's not the problem.

01:33:21.642 --> 01:33:23.350
- I would say one
thing that I'm obsessed

01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:27.460
with writing about and
working through right now is

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:30.070
making sure that when we
are talking about power,

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:35.470
we are doing it in
interesting and complex ways.

01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:38.180
So often we think about
power and privilege,

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.890
and it's I have more
than you or whatever.

01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:43.540
And after reading this
book called The Metaphysics

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.040
of Gender by Charlotte Witt.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:45.650
I'm sorry.

01:33:45.650 --> 01:33:46.720
I'm one of those--

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.303
so anyway, I just
got finished reading

01:33:48.303 --> 01:33:52.060
this book called The Metaphysics
of Gender by Charlotte Witt.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.024
And actually, that's
not where this idea

01:33:54.024 --> 01:33:54.940
is going to come from.

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.773
It's actually going to
come from Iris Marion

01:33:56.773 --> 01:33:59.670
Young, who is a political
theorist and feminist theorist.

01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:03.520
Anyways, after reading her
book, Justice and the Politics

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.850
of Difference, what I
really came away from

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.600
is this understanding that power
is not what individuals have.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.970
Power is what societies do.

01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:15.985
And when we refuse
to think about power

01:34:15.985 --> 01:34:19.480
as just like, what am I
doing to you, getting away

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.280
from that interpersonal
stuff and really

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.120
think about what our society
is doing to people, what

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.760
is happening
structurally, I think

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.760
that people are more apt
to be able to understand

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.145
why is this person in poverty?

01:34:33.145 --> 01:34:36.790
It is not necessarily a
personal indictment of you

01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:38.677
when we take away
that stuff that

01:34:38.677 --> 01:34:40.510
makes people uncomfortable,
even though it's

01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:42.290
good to be uncomfortable.

01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:46.750
We can think about
the ways that we

01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:51.150
attain these social
positions structurally.

01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:55.610
And I think that going back
to the work of black feminists

01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:58.660
who tell us that all
oppressions are linked,

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.000
this idea of interlocking
depressions from the Combahee

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.270
River Collective, really
just underscoring the fact

01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:07.150
that this stuff is structural.

01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:10.430
Who cares about you?

01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:12.310
Look at all of the
violence and the harm

01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:15.910
that these white supremacist
capitalist imperialist

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:19.810
patriarchy is doing around us.

01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:21.171
- Please.

01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:21.670
- Hello.

01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:25.300
My name is [? Aila. ?] And
I am a graduate student

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.860
in library and information
science at Simmons College.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:32.570
And I also work here at
the Schlesinger library.

01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:35.750
And I've been working
with Angela Davis

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:37.250
with her a collection
among others.

01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:41.020
And I'm curious how
are you all thinking

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.330
about how you want
to be remembered

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:47.892
and how you want your
legacies to be formed?

01:35:47.892 --> 01:35:48.850
- I like that question.

01:35:54.594 --> 01:35:56.260
Emi, you have a funny
look on your face.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.160
Go for it.

01:36:01.110 --> 01:36:05.830
- I just hate taking
credit for things.

01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:08.590
So I write lots of things.

01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:10.570
And I try to offer analysis.

01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:14.600
And I want that to have
an impact in the society.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.570
I wanted to educate and inform
and just change conversations,

01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:23.470
whether we were talking
about the politics

01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:26.110
of [INAUDIBLE] people in the
sex trade or any other issues.

01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:29.920
I've done lots of work around
changing the way the society

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.630
and especially
feminist institutions

01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:34.300
deals with [INAUDIBLE]
sexual assaults.

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.260
Those are-- to me, it's
just all those ideas.

01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.190
I mean, it's not like
my original ideas.

01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:42.490
It comes in conversation
with lots of other people.

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:45.890
It's like I feel like I'm making
a contribution in those ways.

01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:51.330
And I want those to
continue to ripple.

01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:54.400
I don't really want my
name attached it it.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.950
I'll be horrified if
something was named after me.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.370
- Please.

01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:04.300
- Hi, My name's [? Anata. ?]
I'm a student at the college.

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:07.480
I wanted to thank Kimberly
for the foundation of theory

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.120
and talking about
citation and making sure

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.940
we acknowledge and give homage
to those that came before us.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:16.210
Emi, you talked about talking
about limitations for things

01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:17.890
that had been done previously.

01:37:17.890 --> 01:37:22.160
And in that vein, my question
is to Fatimah Asghar.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.980
Watching your Brown Girl
series, studying it in class,

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.870
knowing that the first
line of the show is

01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:32.610
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],, knowing
that that was said after

01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:35.770
a young brown woman wakes up
from bed with another woman,

01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:38.800
but also knowing the
history of how absolutely

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.200
LGBTQ-plus-filled
South Asian history is,

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.350
with the backdrop
just a few days ago,

01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:48.940
the overturning of penal code
377 in India that now has

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.240
decriminalized being gay and
lesbian and all the wonderful

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.010
things of being part of
the LGBTQ-plus community.

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.635
I wanted to ask
you, as an artist,

01:37:56.635 --> 01:37:58.780
do you feel a sense
of responsibility

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.290
of engaging within the
repertoire of lived experiences

01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:04.420
in the archive of
history that is often not

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:07.090
explored in mainstream
America or in mainstream

01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:08.760
Western society?

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.020
And if so, how do you
confront that responsibility

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.600
since we are also in
this weird position

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.490
of having privilege,
being in the west

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:17.631
and having that platform?

01:38:17.631 --> 01:38:18.130
- Yeah.

01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:20.680
I mean, I feel a tremendous
amount of responsibility

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.080
to so many people.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.775
When I think about
my artist medium,

01:38:26.775 --> 01:38:28.150
the thing that I
think most about

01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:30.940
is, I think I deal-- my
medium is relationships,

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.980
and it's community.

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.610
That's it beyond anything.

01:38:33.610 --> 01:38:36.119
And so everything
else, Brown Girls,

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:37.660
poetry, all of that
kind, that's kind

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.290
of like subservient to the
idea of that community piece

01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:43.630
that's really, really
important to me.

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.492
And it's hard because I think--

01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:47.200
I don't know if I'm
going to fully answer

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.699
your question because
it's something

01:38:48.699 --> 01:38:51.250
that I'm kind of still grappling
with or think about a lot.

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:58.780
But I feel like there's so
much in terms of responsibility

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:00.180
in being an artist.

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:02.650
There's a responsibility to
the people you come from,

01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:04.540
to the community, to
the lineage that's

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:10.180
behind you, to all of these
different folks that you're

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.230
in conversation with.

01:39:11.230 --> 01:39:13.640
And then there's also
responsibility to self.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.920
And there's responsibility
to just thinking

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.080
about what is your
truth and what

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.240
does it mean to not say that?

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:27.610
And my book, it's
pretty brutal in some

01:39:27.610 --> 01:39:29.350
of my family relationships.

01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:32.114
And that was a thing
that I had to navigate

01:39:32.114 --> 01:39:33.530
with a lot of
responsibility, too,

01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:35.780
is to think about how do I
be honest about things that

01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:38.200
happened but how do I
still love the people who

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.490
maybe damaged me?

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:41.440
And how do you hold forgiveness?

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.610
And how do you hold that love?

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:47.140
And I think there's this
artist, Nick Cave, who I love,

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.120
who makes these really
beautiful soundsuits.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.130
And once I was in
a lecture with him,

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:55.690
and he said this thing where
he said, you as an artist,

01:39:55.690 --> 01:39:56.357
you're a vessel.

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:57.189
And you're a vessel.

01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:59.290
And you're there to receive
and then to put out.

01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:00.870
And everything else is ego.

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.371
So everything else about
wanting your name on something

01:40:03.371 --> 01:40:04.870
or wanting whatever,
that's all ego.

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:08.350
And it's not actually
that important.

01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:10.150
And so in terms of
thinking just about what

01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:12.250
does it mean to be an
artist, specifically

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:15.280
a Pakistani [? Kashmir ?] artist
that's living in the West,

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.450
that's who I am.

01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:21.100
So if my privilege is being a
Westerner, my kind of grappling

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.370
with the romanticism
of where I come from,

01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:26.540
of understanding
histories of all of that,

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:29.620
and that constant rediscovery,
because there is a way that I

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.730
didn't grow up with that.

01:40:30.730 --> 01:40:32.540
There is kind of
a real way where

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:35.170
I didn't know what partition
was until I was in my 20s.

01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:37.897
So I didn't know this incredibly
important historical thing

01:40:37.897 --> 01:40:40.230
that happened, that totally
influenced all of South Asia

01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:41.590
until I was in my 20s.

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:43.780
And so there is kind of a want--

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.910
or what I find in my
own artistic practice

01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:49.120
is the re-journeying
and the constant trying

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.970
to remember where I come
from and all of those things

01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:54.230
that make me up but
also the responsibility

01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:57.290
to my current self
and community.

01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:00.340
I hope that answers
your question.

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.200
- Hi, everybody.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.324
My name is [? Michelle ?]
[? Bent. ?] I'm a student

01:41:03.324 --> 01:41:06.180
at Brandeis, studying masters
in sustainable international

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.260
development.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.870
And my question to
all of you was I'm

01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:14.010
interested in how gender
and evolving feminism can

01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:15.640
translate into--

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.510
or how that would look into
the international realm?

01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:21.690
For example, like sex
work or sexual violence

01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:23.110
in conflict areas.

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:26.200
So how does your work or
the work you plan to do

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.360
or how does your feminism
reach internationally?

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.660
And how can the new generation
and robust feminists

01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.280
reach the international lens?

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.280
- Wow.

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.110
Let's hear it.

01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:52.520
- So in terms of sex workers'
rights and people's rights who

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:57.020
are in the sex trade, US is
far behind other countries.

01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.960
So in the countries where--

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.850
countries like India, there are
mass movement of sex workers.

01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:06.310
In the US, I mean--
this is not to be--

01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:09.880
I'm not trying to say it's bad.

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:15.190
But the US sex worker movement
is vastly white middle class.

01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:17.080
On the other hand,
in other countries,

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.980
it's actually a mass
movement of common people.

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:25.120
In India, in countries
like Taiwan or in Korea,

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.360
we have those mass
movements that

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:32.260
can actually do demonstrations
that can stop things.

01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:34.420
And that doesn't
exist in the US.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.470
And so I think that we need
to really learn from that

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:46.210
and try to figure out how they
were able to sidestep this sex

01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:50.515
wars context of the US
feminism, where anything that

01:42:50.515 --> 01:42:54.280
has to do with sex workers'
rights is put to the question

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.520
about whether or not this--

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:06.850
just having this idealistic
argument about whether the sex

01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:09.160
work is good or bad for women.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.860
And that's the kind of
abstract controversy

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.890
that doesn't really reflect
the reality of people living

01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:19.527
in the situation and how to make
things better for the people.

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:21.860
And I think in other countries,
they're able to do that.

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.260
And that's something
that we want

01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:26.770
to try to borrow from
the other countries

01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:32.350
and trying to see how
it can be addressed.

01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:34.630
In any other field
where there's lots

01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.600
of violence and exploitation
and trafficking,

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.800
we're not going to go and try
to bust and prosecute everybody.

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.830
That's how the US deals
with the sex work.

01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:47.720
But that's not how it is
in any other industry.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:54.160
And it's telling that
they see in the US

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.790
this demonization of
pimps and traffickers

01:43:57.790 --> 01:44:02.110
as men of color, whereas the
people who own the factories

01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:04.990
and farms and hotels
where trafficking,

01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:07.070
labor trafficking-- the
majority of trafficking

01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:09.330
in the US labor trafficking.

01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:11.380
And where those
things happen, those

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:13.300
are businesses
owned by white men.

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.710
And they're not demonized
in the same way.

01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:22.120
And so [INAUDIBLE] I think that
kind of the US white supremacy

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:27.460
and kind of economic
elitism wars,

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:30.530
capitalist arrangements
really impact

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:34.360
that, how we see the
policies around sex workers.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.780
So when I look at
internationally,

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:41.980
I feel like the
people need to realize

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:45.340
that even though we have more
organizations for sex workers'

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:49.750
rights in the US,
they're not advanced.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:50.290
- Thank you.

01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:54.154
And I think that we have
time for one more question.

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:56.200
- I'll be that one.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.550
My name is Kafi Dixon.

01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:00.370
I'm the founder
of a women's co-op

01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:03.190
here in Boston, The
Common Good Project,

01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:08.140
which is the first urban farm
focused on women of color

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:12.925
as a health care outreach and
as a community health hub.

01:45:12.925 --> 01:45:14.800
So one of the things
that we're running into,

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.990
and this is directed
at you, Kimberly,

01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:19.360
because that's what brought
me here from Dorchester

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.700
was you and the
rest of the panel,

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.150
but specifically looking
at some of the women that

01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:28.210
are in our community
who may not specifically

01:45:28.210 --> 01:45:32.450
identify with the word
feminist or feminism

01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:37.900
but practice it in action
every day in their community.

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.230
And what we've been running
into over this last year

01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:46.940
is how to connect those
35-plus women of color

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:51.580
with the new wave of young
academic students who

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:55.770
want to hold space with them and
help them resolve their issues

01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:58.980
but do not necessarily--
the younger feminists

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:03.790
are not identifying with the
older feminists in their work.

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:07.600
And when you were talking about
dialogue between generations,

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:08.710
how do we connect?

01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:11.060
What are some of the
best practices, Kimberly,

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:15.730
you can advise our
organization and connecting

01:46:15.730 --> 01:46:20.440
an arc between those
generational understanding

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.214
of what feminism is
for women of color?

01:46:23.214 --> 01:46:24.880
Sorry for that being
a lengthy question.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.379
- Sure.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:28.010
So I'll make it as
quick as possible.

01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:31.990
So I think that there are--

01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:33.490
black women are not a monolith.

01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:36.040
But there are certain
sorts of experiences

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.560
that we can all connect to.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:45.790
So most black women can identify
with feeling undervalued

01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:49.210
by their employer or--

01:46:49.210 --> 01:46:51.370
and this is just
from my experience

01:46:51.370 --> 01:46:54.880
and from reading lots and lots
of black feminists texts--

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.240
we can identify with a
certain marginalization

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:58.990
in the workplace.

01:46:58.990 --> 01:47:01.270
We can identify with
feeling disempowered

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:03.250
in our romantic relationships.

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.050
We can identify
with feeling like we

01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:10.330
are [? mules ?] in our
interpersonal relationships,

01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:12.130
in our familial dynamics.

01:47:12.130 --> 01:47:15.520
I think that there are just
certain sorts of experiences

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:20.740
that cross generations, that
cross socioeconomic status.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:26.309
The details of my
employer at my law firm

01:47:26.309 --> 01:47:27.850
is going to be
different from the way

01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:32.410
that your employer at your
restaurant job or service work

01:47:32.410 --> 01:47:33.130
job--

01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:35.590
the details of that stuff
is going to be different.

01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:38.680
But those underlying feelings,
we can connect there.

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:41.560
And I think offering
people an open platform

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:44.080
to talk about those
experiences, the foundations

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.720
of those experiences,
and then get

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.570
into the intricacies of the
differences, the detail,

01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:56.140
the dynamics, I think,
offers an opportunity

01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.090
to have connection there.

01:47:58.090 --> 01:48:01.810
I think that there's really
power in embracing difference.

01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:04.630
And so I wouldn't
be afraid of the way

01:48:04.630 --> 01:48:09.580
that those differences pop
up across our experiences.

01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:12.280
- On that note, I want
to take the opportunity

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.630
to thank our fantastic
five panelists for a really

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:16.230
remarkable--

01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:18.980
[APPLAUSE]
