00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.910
It's a time of great transition in the world
economy and it's crucial that important causes

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.650
and problems are not forgotten.
This January, at Davos, our leaders will be

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.039
discussing how we redesign and rethink many
aspects of our world.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.570
YouTube and the World Economic Forum are offering
one person the opportunity to join them.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.250
We need big thinkers, people who will stand
up and get their voices heard.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.250
We're opening the doors to Davos to someone
passionate and articulate, fighting for something

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.260
that deserves everyone's attention.
What issue do you believe needs rethinking?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.910
How would you redesign our approach to pressing
problems?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.460
If you could rebuild your cause, how could
those at Davos help and inspire you?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.510
We want to hear real stories from people working
on local causes, who want to make these causes

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.680
global.
Maybe it's human rights, or the environment,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.770
or poverty or discrimination?
Maybe your cause is education, political freedom

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.909
or saving the world's oceans?
Are you ready to stand up on the Davos stage

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.420
alongside some of the most influential people
in the world and fight for your cause?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.760
