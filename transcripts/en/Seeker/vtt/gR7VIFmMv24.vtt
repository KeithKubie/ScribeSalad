00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.429
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Harry's

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.480
I thought about this a lot guys, does tractor
beam come from ATTRACTION or because like…

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.620
a TRACTOR pulls stuff…

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:22.460
Whatever, either way thanks to lasers IT'S
REAL NOW.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.140
In the Star Trek and Wars universes a standard
trope for grabbing something in space, be

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.070
that a ship or a piece of junk or whatever,
was the tractor beam.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.309
In science fiction, the tractor beam is just
a given, but in real life, scientists are

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.109
really working hard to make it real.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.280
Theoretically, there are three major tractor
beam technologies.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.670
"Optical tweezers" use laserlight to heat
the air, trap particles and create a sort

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.019
of conveyor belt to move them around.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.249
That wouldn't work in space anyway, no air.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.969
Another uses laserlight formed into a corkscrew
shape to push things around, but they can't

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.510
really make that one either… it's called
an optical solenoid beam…

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.530
The "BEST" design in my opinion is the "Bessel
beam."

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.460
it uses electromagnetic, gravitational, or
acoustic energy, to move particles around!

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.570
Unfortunately, they can't build one because
it requires infinite energy…

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.570
#Awkward...

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.950
So none of these are great.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.320
So, let's start over.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.219
At its most basic, a tractor beam applies
attraction force or repulsion force using

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.900
only light energy.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.049
Pushing is easy to envision,

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
it's sort of like a firehose, but instead
of water it's spraying photons…

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.039
pulling makes me think of magnets… but we
want to do this all with a single beam…

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.039
right?

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.630
FINALLY, according to a study published at
the end of last year in Nature Photonics,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.259
science can do this!

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.689
The scientists used a new design that lets
a single beam pull and push gold-coated hollow

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.640
glass spheres for quote "tens of centimeters!"

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.290
PLUS, they actually BUILT ONE!

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.290
FER REALS!

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.170
This real-world tractor beam uses a doughnut-shaped
beam to grab a sphere.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.569
Then by varying the "polarization of the beam"
the researchers can push a sphere, then stop

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.950
and reverse it …

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.480
The SHAPE of the laserlight is clutch, the
tube surrounds the object, trapping it into

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
it's energy.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.990
Think of it like the wheel of a bicycle…[b][c][d]
the lasers are always moving AWAY from the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.900
source, but when the polarization is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.971
radial or along the spokes of the wheel, it
forms this wall of energy -- and the sphere

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.971
is pushed away.

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:32.640
To PULL a sphere, they change to azimuthal
polarization… making the energy flow along

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640
the rim of the wheel.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.510
This creates a corkscrew of energy that actually
hits the sphere on the OPPOSITE side from

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.510
the light source.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.430
So it's not really PULLING as much as reaching
around and hitting its back.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
It's genius!

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.760
Practically, it's not going to be useful for
a while, but it seems like it should work

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.510
in the vacuum of space AND in the lab.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.650
It doesn't require air, or heat, nor does
it need infinite energy -- though it would

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.180
need a lot to move say, a whole ship.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.580
Right now they're still calling this invention,
optical tweezers.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.450
Do you even want this to be a thing?

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.870
What would YOU do with a tractor beam?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.060
Speaking of tweezers, grooming is very important!

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.680
I'd like to thank Harry's for sponsoring this
video.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.230
Harry's was started by a couple guys who liked
shaving so much

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.070
that bought a razor factory to make their
own.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.550
They're cheap, they show up at your door,
and they're sharp both in look and… well,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.550
sharpness.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.320
Not only did they make it so you don't have
to pay a ton for blades, they made them easier

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320
to get!

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320
