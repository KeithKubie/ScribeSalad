00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Today, we're going
to be taking a look at

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.040
how bulletproof stickers can be,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.500
and how many it takes
to stop a bullet completely.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.400
[Music]

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
Guys, we have stickers,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500
which are apparently being
applied to my arm right now.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
We give them out every once
in a while in meet and greets and stuff.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900
They've got the cool King
of Random crown logo on them,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.760
and we wanted to do a test.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.000
We have got lots
of these stickers,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.999
hundreds of them,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.280
and we are going to see how many
it takes to stop a bullet.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.999
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.500
We're going to take a bunch
of stickers stacked up,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.900
and with three different guns,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.260
we're going to see
how bulletproof they are.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.620
So we can stack them
up in a hundred,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.540
and then if we decide
that we're going to need more

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:43.278
than that to stop one
of these bullets,

00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:45.100
we can see just
how many it's gonna take.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.700
We also have a few
different sizes of guns,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.045
so we can try a couple
different things to see

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:51.339
less powerful bullets,

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.800
and more powerful bullets.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:20.400
[Music]

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.000
We've made these stacks
of 100 stickers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.300
That's about how thick they are.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.241
So just over
a centimetre I'd say.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:27.660
We've got lots of those,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.600
and we built
this nice little jig

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.700
that should nicely hold
our stickers in place.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.126
So we're just going to start
by taking this hundred pack,

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:37.500
put it in the back, and see
if we can shoot through it.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.692
We're going to go
with the lowest caliber we have.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.180
We're gonna use a .22 rifle.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.440
I think it'll get through that.

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:44.292
.22's aren't very powerful
as guns go

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:45.441
but I still think it'll get

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.100
through this pack
of a hundred stickers.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.700
Here we go, first test.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.392
100 stickers and
using the .22 rifle.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.200
You guys, ready?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.800
Yep.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.700
Firing.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.520
[Music]

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.180
First shot, I hit the stickers,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
and they launched up
in the air somewhere.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.700
They're back there.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.000
And they landed in the snow.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.600
And I thought I saw
where they landed,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
but when I went to try
and find them, I couldn't.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.800
So we're gonna try this again,
and at least try and keep track

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.700
of where they go.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.480
Shot number two.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.020
EG237818323KR

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.400
That went straight back.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.180
[Music]

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.700
Well, the stickers
went right here.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.680
Yeah.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.520
Wait, did a hundred work?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.300
It might have.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.200
Oh, no.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.500
I don't think there's
an exit wound.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.500
Wait, There's a bullet.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
You caught a bullet
with the hundred stickers.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.300
You knocked the
backboard right off.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.300
It's a .22,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.730
but you still caught a bullet
with a hundred stickers.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.300
Here we go.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.220
[Music]

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.040
That's awesome.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.800
That is our bullet.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.880
[Music]

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.900
And then here we've got stickers

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.700
that I don't think they really
got pierced by the bullet,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.405
but it like,

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.600
it just broke from the force
of the impact.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.360
It looks like this sticker
is honestly like,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.300
I wouldn't have thought
a sticker could get halfway,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.520
but like there's
a tear in the front.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.800
But it's not torn all
the way through at the back.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.933
So this got stopped
by that last sticker.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.600
That's, that's the bulletproof
sticker right there.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.360
And this is really
interesting to me.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.020
&gt;&gt; Like it just hit this hard enough.
&gt;&gt; And it exploded.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.300
You could actually see
where you screwed

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.100
that into place.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.200
The back of this
just tore right off.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.792
Yep.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:33.498
It broke right at the screws.

00:03:33.498 --> 00:03:36.500
We may be improvising are back,
because one more shot,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.300
and that whole thing
is going to come off.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.076
I'm sure of it.

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:41.200
So we'll just end up
bracing it with some,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.900
like a 2x4 and some rocks.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.780
So we shot there nearly
a hundred stickers

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.380
with our .22 caliber.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.760
Now, we're going to try
our hand gun with 500.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.800
Let's see how far we go.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.700
We are using
a more powerful gun.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.240
And since we almost got through
with the weakest gun,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.300
we're scaling it up,
a lot more stickers.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.900
See how many we can get through.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.320
So each one of these little

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.300
paper tabs represents
where we're at a hundred.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.100
So we've got 500 stickers here.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.780
3, 2, 1.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.180
[Music]

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.820
[inaudible] right there.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.360
[Music]

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.060
This is about half of them.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.000
These stickers don't have
any bullet damage.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.700
I don't know
where the rest went.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.262
Well, it looks like we lost 200.

00:04:26.262 --> 00:04:28.600
So we can just put 200 back on.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.960
[Music]

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.180
That's awesome.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.400
I think the bullet
might have bounced out.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.080
Because here we
have an impact,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.100
and then where it stops.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.635
Like we've stopped going
through stickers at this point.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.940
But these ones,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.900
like I can see right
through that one.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.050
There's a hole.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.480
Hello.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.240
I can see you.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.400
You can't see me though.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.900
So yeah, we got through.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.189
So that's I think a hundred.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.760
200.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760
That's about a hundred,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.200
and then I don't know
how it escaped at the bottom,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.958
but it did.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.420
The bullet is gone.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.200
Oh, I think I see the bullet.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.300
Right there.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.680
So I think it went through,

00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:16.800
and then the stickers
pushed it enough.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.460
Okay, so maybe stickers
aren't bulletproof,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.920
but their bullets deflecting?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.280
Yeah, maybe.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.220
Ready?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:33.820
[Music]

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.120
How many did we get through?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.240
At least a hundred,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.590
and then it was still working
its way through the others

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.100
when I think I
got deflected again.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.180
[Music]

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.380
Through some stickers,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.800
out of the back
of this piece of wood,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.000
and I believe I see,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.680
at least part of the bullet
embedded in our 2x4.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.180
Oh, yeah.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.900
Look at this.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.020
[Music]

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.873
Check this out.

00:05:55.873 --> 00:05:58.642
Bullet scraped, bounced
off the back.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.460
Holy cow.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.600
As it took off that direction.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700
Well, this little handgun,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.940
and when I say little,
I mean physically.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.410
The handle of the gun is quite
small and hard to hold onto,

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.660
it's kind of hard to aim.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.800
So I think we're going
to upgrade one more time

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.100
to a more powerful rifle

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.900
that should be easier
to aim well.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:31.060
[Music]

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.220
All right.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.300
That is 1000 stickers.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.520
All sticked together
in like a sticker log.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.200
All right, and for this,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400
we are going to be
using our AR-15,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.920
the most powerful
gun we have here.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.000
If we can get it
to stay in our holder,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.300
which has been taking
some bullet damage, and...

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.760
[Music]

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.900
That should be fine.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:02.980
[Music]

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.400
We have used a lot of stickers
in an attempt to hold the rest

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.360
of our stickers in place.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.600
I don't really think
it's gonna do much

00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:10.800
against the power of a bullet.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.900
But it was really fun.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.200
Maybe it'll help a little.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.100
We'll see.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.100
Firing.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.180
[Music]

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.200
Did I miss?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.880
I'm not even 10 feet away.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.100
Those cites were
lined up perfectly.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.441
I think I shot over it.

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:29.539
I think it's cited for like
to be farther down range,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.400
and I'm so close
that I'm shooting right over it.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.000
All right, firing.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.100
[Music]

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.600
And now it shoots high.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.200
Bring me more bullets.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.680
Nailed it.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.740
Yes.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:58.080
[Music]

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.760
Oh my gosh.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.200
Here's the crazy thing though.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.400
They shot at the back.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.380
Right through.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.720
There's our two bullet holes.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.900
Was this the back one then?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.060
I think so.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.800
They just got like
smashed up against it.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.340
But yeah, I think
that went--

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.140
Look at that.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.500
It's actually held it
in place for you.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.700
I think we shot

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.380
through a thousand stickers
with this rifle.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.600
So you can see
the few holes there?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.653
The two holes there.

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:24.704
This was the the back
piece I believe.

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.700
But when we have
that lined up right,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.520
that shot through
1,000 stickers.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.480
That kind of shows

00:08:31.484 --> 00:08:35.100
off the difference
between the .22 and the AR-15.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.300
The 22, stopped by 100 stickers.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.200
Whereas the AR-15,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.500
shooting .223 bullets,
got through a thousand.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.791
Like I can clearly see right
through that hole too.

00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.700
That actually is really cool.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.500
Like I like that.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.330
This is a design.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.400
It's nuts.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.641
Can a 1,000
stickers stop bullet?

00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:55.980
Well, yes, and no.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.900
It depends what bullet
and what gun.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.160
.22 rifle, not so much.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.000
The handgun didn't seem to get

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.247
through more than
about 250 stickers.

00:09:04.247 --> 00:09:07.709
But our rifle with the .223 ammo
got through a thousand,

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:09.594
and carried on through the back.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.140
Goodness golly gee.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.923
It might have kept on going
right through the 2x4 as well.

00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:15.240
Goodness golly gee?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.198
Goodness golly gee.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.680
Yes.
Goodness golly gee.

00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:20.413
And most importantly,
our sticker bridge...

00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:21.280
It actually--

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.000
Held our stickers in place.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.300
But I think we should attribut
it to the sticker bridge.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.154
I think this sticker
bridge actually worked,

00:09:27.154 --> 00:09:28.100
and it was hilarious,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.900
because all the other
ones went flying.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.700
These stayed.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.464
So can you fire
through a thousand stickers?

00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:34.300
Yes, you can.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.350
Does a sticker bridge
hold it in place?

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.350
Yes, it does.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.800
Oh, that's hot.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.080
That's hot.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.000
Guys, that's not all.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.286
We've always got more
for you see.

00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:46.475
That box up with the top
will take you to our last video.

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:47.546
You should go check that out.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:48.810
The other box
is going to show you

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.573
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.800
And if you hit this
bomb the middle,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.140

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.840
and that way, you'll
never miss out on a video.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.160

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.000
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Talk to you then.
