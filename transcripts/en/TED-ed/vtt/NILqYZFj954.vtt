00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:07.402
It was after ten days of walking in nature

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:09.672
in silence on a meditation retreat

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:11.787
and stepping into an area

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:16.731
that was so pure and tender

00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.011
that it really felt like no person stepped there

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.486
for a very long time or even forever.

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:27.243
And when I stepped there,

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:29.750
the first thought that came to my mind

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.760
was questioning whether I have a right to be there,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.909
stepping in a place full of living organisms

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:41.859
thriving there without any human interference.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.978
And then the next thought was,

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:46.113
"What if I was a cow?"

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.777
You know, then it would be very natural

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:49.119
for me to walk there.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.250
These very different questions

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.716
and these very different ways of looking at myself

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:58.686
walking in the world in a very certain moment

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:02.125
really made me question the whole assumptions

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:06.018
of how we, people, walk on Earth

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:07.000
and work on Earth

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.940
and thrive on Earth.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.399
And is there really such a big difference

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.870
between the way we view animals

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.273
and the way we walk ourselves?

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:20.512
And maybe this inspiration

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:23.753
to how we as designers, as creative people,

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:25.903
as people that are willing to question

00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:26.899
everything around us

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.905
and find new ways,

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.988
is very much about agreeing to walk like cows

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:36.149
and agreeing to be part of this wealth

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.968
of living organisms.
