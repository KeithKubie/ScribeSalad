00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.900
If you were to
Zoom in phase-out,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.640
move in focus on this
Human whose cells magnify

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.150
as you fly through them, and see

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.070
Atoms, looming
but you keep shooting past

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.170
protons, bosons, quarks til even a
part of a particles too big Then

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.630
BOOM an end to the intrusion
As you hit the resolution of the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.350
universe the strands of its fabric
the tiniest fragment the planck length,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.369
past that, Gravity becomes
fallacy, try contrasting that with the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.920
galaxies try to grasp the huge magnitude
of the universe it's unimaginable.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920
But let's try anyway.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.140
If that
insane length was one dollar bill

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.370
Then to reach the
wavelength of the smallest particles

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.920
Quarks, that are so fundamental

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.070
they don't have an inherent size
would be the current price you'd gain if you

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.230
sold
Mount Everest made out of gold.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.710
That is insane.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.449
if you applied the Midas touch to my mind
it'd be quite enough to buy a car to drive

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.310
And the gluons and 3 quarks combined
make a large hadron those guys collide;

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.269
a proton and to magnify to that
size would turn that Midas mountain

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.590
into a diamond my
mind made of that could buy you an island

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.530
and next we ramp up, from
quarks and protons to atoms,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.420
atoms the fractions of matter the ones that
that grant us our mass, and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.260
if that quark was counted every time you take
a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.470
single breath you'd respire
Midas mountains then

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.680
until your death

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.820
and if that life was compressed
into one lock of hair then as we

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.960
climb / up the rest of these
atomic stairs then we'd pass

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.390
DNA when we get to my red streak
and the size of our cells

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.840
we equate to every
hair on my head...

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.930
Sometimes you make me feel so small
Can't comprehend your size

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.800
Yet I'm a giant in your eyes

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.640
If we took my
head of hair that a cell represents

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.410
lifetimes of Midas Everest breaths
and then you would stretch it out to the skyline,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.410
again and again

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.890
you'd find circle round the earth 10 times
before you meet me... and you.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.780
Right here the reach of a human,
a meter or two and if we were to choose

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.740
one song to represent those
horizons, an MP3 on our

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.060
device then to reach the size of the earth
compared to like our size

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.209
that's a terabyte hard drive filled with our
files

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.190
it seems immense
And if we compress that collection to one

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.190
word

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.530
to represent our world, then scaling coefficients
from the planet to the solar system

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.819
would let me re-read the whole of deathly
hallows

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.819
awesome.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.830
And then to travel between stars
as we take to the skies

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190
Would be 10 times every word
you'll ever say in your life

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.640
And as an analogy of the expanse of
galaxies up in space

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.560
10 times the total of every word
in every book ever made

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.340
And to move up to the scale of galaxy clusters
would be every word said by everyone in Shanghai,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.959
in London Berlin, Delhi, LA, Mumbai, Sao Paulo
and Moscow

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.940
Jakarta, Karachi, Dubai, Telford, Tokyo and
Stockholm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.770
And then to galaxy superclusters in the large-scale
structure

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.770
with filaments that feel inadequately described
as humungous

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.040
since if we stay with the scale of Earth as
a word that equates

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.330
to all the words everyone alive today will
ever say

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.330
finally we reach the biggest physical thing
we can confirm

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.580
The indescribable size of the observable universe
which would be more than every word that every

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.620
person ever has said
Every word that was ever written and every

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.620
word that was ever read

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.620
Sometimes you make me feel so small
Can't comprehend your size

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.790
Yet I'm a giant in your eyes.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:32.290
I can't control the scope
But I'm not losing hope

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:46.670
To summarise
Every word that every person has ever said

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.830
in their lives
where each word implies enough MP3s to fill

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.300
a terabyte hard drive
Where each song is 10 times the number drives

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.150
to the horizon
that it'd take to ride around the world each

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.880
time you set eyes on one

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.720
where each horizon is a head of hairs
and every hair there is the length of a lifetime

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.180
and each breath in that life is the price
of mount everest made entirely by midas

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.020
and that finally describes it, and it's increasing
in size

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:38.650
So each time you listen to this song again
it'll be even more difficult to comprehend.
