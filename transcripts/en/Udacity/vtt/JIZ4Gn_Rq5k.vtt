00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you haven't had a theory of computation class,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm not going to explain this now, but I hope some of you have had it

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and will be able to answer the next quiz,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is if it's proven that factoring is NP-hard,

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what would it mean?
