00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.760
We're asked to add the
complex number 5 plus 2i

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.740
to the other complex
number 3 minus 7i.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.370
And as we'll see, when we're
adding complex numbers,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.670
you can only add the
real parts to each other

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.970
and you can only add the
imaginary parts to each other.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's add the real parts.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.730
So we have a 5 plus a 3.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.790
And then the imaginary
parts-- we have a 2i.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.440
So plus 2i.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.580
And then we have a negative
7i, or we're subtracting 7i.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.730
So minus 7i right over here.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.200
And 5 plus 3-- that's
pretty straightforward.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.430
That's just going to be 8.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.230
And then if I have
two of something

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.124
and from that I subtract
seven of that something--

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:46.540
and in this case,
the something is

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.240
the imaginary
unit, the number i.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.650
If I have two i's and I take
away seven i's, then I have

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.150
negative five i's.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.560
2 minus 7 is negative 5.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.470
So then I have negative 5i.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.720
So when you add these
two complex numbers,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.600
you get 8 minus 5i.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.080
You get another complex number.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.370
It has a real part
and an imaginary part.
