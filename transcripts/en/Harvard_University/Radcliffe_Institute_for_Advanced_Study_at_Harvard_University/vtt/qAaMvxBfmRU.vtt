00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.972
- Welcome, everybody.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.180
I want to just jump right in.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.370
Because we have so much
interesting material today

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.820
to talk about in our panel
on animal aesthetics,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.470
and how gender and
aesthetics are not

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.410
limited to the human world.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.290
My two colleagues that are
here to present today--

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.450
by the way, I'm Ani Patel.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.742
I'm a fellow here at the
Radcliffe Institute this year.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:27.970
And I'm a professor of
psychology at Tufts University.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.920
Anyway, so my colleagues
here are my colleague

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.820
from Tufts, Zarin Machada, an
assistant professor of Tufts

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.640
at the Department of
anthropology and biology.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.120
And research director of
the long-term research

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
project on chimpanzees, the
Kibale Chimpanzee Project.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.800
Zarin has spent the past 17
years studying wild chimpanzees

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.850
in Uganda.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.360
And is especially committed
to their conservation.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.250
Her research revolves
around social relationships

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.790
in chimpanzees and
wild chimpanzees.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.660
Machada has also
conducted several studies

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.340
in chimpanzee
communication that have

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.950
helped shape our understanding
of human language.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.450
She's also on the
board of directors

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.010
of this really great
project called the Kalial?

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.660
- Kasiisi.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.370
Kasiisi Project, an
organization that

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.790
works with more than 10,000
schoolchildren in Uganda

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.150
implementing conservation
and education programs.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.550
And the other colleague here
is Professor Richard Prum,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.830
professor of Ornithology
at Yale and curator

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.770
of Ornithology at the Peabody
Museum of Natural History

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.340
there.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.240
He's researched many
topics in biology,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.480
including feather
development and evolution,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.110
sexual selection, and the
dinosaur origins of birds.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.780
He's the author of a book
called The evolution of Beauty:

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.270
how Darwin's Forgotten
Theory of Mate Choice

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.030
Shapes the Animal
World and Us, that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.360
was published in 2017, which was
included in the New York Times

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.070
10 best books of 2017 and a
finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.810
Prize for general nonfiction.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.160
I read it last winter.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.050
And I highly recommend
it to you all.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.420
He's been awarded many
fellowships, including

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.700
the Guggenheim, and the
MacArthur, and the Fulbright.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.760
And he has directed
Yale's Frank program

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.020
for science and humanities.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.660
So he's used to crossing these
boundaries that we so much like

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.970
to cross here at Radcliffe.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.940
So just the briefest of
introductions into a concept

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.320
that will be important today.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.540
Many of you will be familiar
with Darwin's theory

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
of natural selection, his
great idea about the mechanism

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.400
of evolution, of how species
change over time, which

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.260
involves some key
things like there

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.480
has to be variation in traits.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.570
Let's say, like, how long
your bill is if you're a bird.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.000
Some of that variation
has to be inherited

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.090
by the next generation.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.000
And that variation
has to be related

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.130
to differential survival
and reproductive success.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.413
So for example, a longer bill
might help you find more food.

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.580
And therefore, survive
better and pass on your genes

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.883
to the next generation.

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:46.300
So that has to do with how you
survive in the environment,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.347
finding food, escaping
predators, and so on.

00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:49.930
But there's a second
mechanism that he

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.210
proposed in his great
book The Descent of Men,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.410
about human evolution.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.740
Actually, a lot of that book was
spent on talking about animals.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.050
And his other
principle of evolution

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.910
called sexual
selection, which is also

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.738
a variation in traits,
which is inherited,

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:05.780
which leads to differential
reproductive success.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300
But this time it's
about traits that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.130
help you compete for mates.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.620
Things that maybe a display
that helps attract a mate,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.870
or something that helps
you fight off a competitor

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.490
in the battle for
finding a mate.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.310
So these two ideas, natural
selection and sexual selection,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.170
are different
mechanisms of evolution.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.420
And today we're going to
hear about how they play out

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.080
in terms of animal aesthetics.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.320
So with that, I
will invite Richard

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.145
to give our first presentation.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.530
- Thank you to Ani.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.330
And thanks to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.520
for this marvelous opportunity.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.490
When the invitation came to
address Beyond Words, gender

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.770
and the aesthetics
of communication,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.200
it was like a dream come true.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.090
That means I have way too many
aspirations for my 15 minutes.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.980
So what is an
ornithologists doing here?

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.210
I have been working on the
evolution of courtship display,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.970
and the physics and chemistry
of color of feathers,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.770
avian display, and through--

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.980
evolving through sexual
selection for a long time.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.780
And that has led me to some
really revelatory things

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.430
about the agency in the world.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.260
So what I want to do is
give away my punch line.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.970
I think that we
can scientifically

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.310
establish that birds are
beautiful because they

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.020
are beautiful to themselves.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.510
That they are agents
in their own evolution.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.030
That subjective
experiences actually

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.250
are the core of what sexual
communication is about.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.910
In addition, having understood
or recognized the agency--

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.660
aesthetic agency
in birds that leads

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.340
us to understand for
the first time what

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.530
it means when
agency is infringed

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.140
by sexual conflict
or sexual violence.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.190
And that leads to the
conclusion that sexual autonomy

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.710
matters to animals.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.030
That there is something it is
like to have freedom of choice.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.650
And that the
capacity to reinforce

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.170
your freedom of choice,
or to earn and create

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.810
sexual autonomy,
evolves in the wild.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.330
And that this has
real implications

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.480
for how we think and
understand our own evolution.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.050
So I have spent a
lot of time looking

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.350
at what I call beauty
studies, the deep aspects

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.300
of the courtship of birds.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.700
And I could go on about
the physics of this blue

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.260
and the chemistry
of that purple.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.450
But I'm just going
to shamelessly use

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.970
animal video to--

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.250
this is an image, a video,
of a male superb bird

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.390
of paradise in New Guinea.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.550
It was filmed by my student, Ed
Scholes, a number of years ago.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.948
[BIRD SCREECHING]

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.950
Yeah.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.590
So this is a
[INAUDIBLE] species.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.120
The female does all
the reproduction

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.000
and chooses among
available males.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.480
What we're going to see here
is an incredible performance

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.950
of an amazingly transformative
communication event.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.200
The female is regarding
this male at inches away.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.400
And that blue is a photonic
structure-- a structural color.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.310
And around that blue are
super black feathers.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.330
The physics of which we've just
described in the last year.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.970
Now interestingly, this
raises a lot of questions.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.370
And I want to just go
straight into the controversy

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.160
in evolutionary biology, which
is that most of my colleagues

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.830
believe that sexual
selection operates

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.500
to select for characters
that actually provide

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.070
objective information
about quality.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.050
And there's the alternative is
that this is purely aesthetic.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.490
That it's about subjective
pleasure in the act of choice.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.800
So in the science
that I recommend,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.300
the subjective
experience of animals

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.400
should be moved to the
center of our science.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.670
Not explained away as merely
a path toward adaptation,

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.530
but as it's right in itself.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.980
And here we have the--

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.370
imagine the olfactory
world of the mall,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.870
or the sonar world of the
bat, or the electrical world

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.280
or the more mirrored
fish, would sing songs

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.390
in electrical pulses that
vary in tempo and frequency,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.580
like music but an
entirely different wave.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.090
Right?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.132
Well, of course I've
studied the bird sound here,

00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:21.900
which we can much
more easily relate to.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.520
Right?

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.550
In sound effect.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.970
But I want to propose
that there is a--

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.680
[BIRD TWIRPING]

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.920
That's a little land probably.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.140
There is a mode of
evolution, that I'll

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.080
call aesthetic
evolution, that is

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.560
an emergent consequence
of sensory perception,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.340
cognitive evaluation,
and choice.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.960
And then what this choice,
either sexual, or social,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.750
or ecological choice, happens
on a heritable substrate,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.030
you get the evolution
of aesthetic features

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.020
that function not in
the physical world,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.850
but in the cognitive
domain, in the evaluation--

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.730
the aesthetic evaluation
of con-specifics or other

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.500
organisms.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.250
And this applies to
both sexual signals,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.390
but also to flowers, and
to the scents of flowers.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.320
So part of this research is
to try to bring beauty back

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.550
into the sciences--

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.650
as a legitimate topic
for the science.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.690
And so to define beauty
in a way that, I think,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.720
is scientifically productive,
I say that beauty is not merely

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.860
attraction.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.840
Beauty is a core
evolved attraction

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.570
in which the form of
preference or desire

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:30.800
is shaped to match
the object of desire.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.299
And that this
shaping as happening

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.270
through a mutual
entrainment of interactions.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.520
I won't spend time on
how to differentiate

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.679
between the adaptive
and non-adaptive view,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.997
but I express my view
as beauty happens.

00:08:41.997 --> 00:08:43.580
And what that means
is that when there

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.430
is choice and a
heritable substrate

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.170
that beauty will arise.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.850
That's an expectation of nature.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.500
And that mate choice
in this regard

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.180
is kind of like a spinning top.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.980
It creates normativity.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.260
But that normativity
is unstable over time.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And then if you spin the
top millions of times

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.850
it will go to different places.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.310
And that is why nature
looks the way it does.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.428
Now I haven't been able to
defend any of those assertions,

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:09.470
but I'm going to move on.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.510
Well, what this does
is focus the science

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.400
on the aesthetic
agency of animals.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.160
The fact that animal
choices are really

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.630
at the heart of the science.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.510
Now for accidental
reasons, really, I

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.670
moved from this area
in sexual selection

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.250
to start working on duck sex.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.045
Now duck sex is a
problematic topic.

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:34.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.100
And when Patricia Brennan,
now at Mount Holyoke,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.700
came to my lab with an interest
in working on the evolution

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.350
of avian genitalia.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.780
I thought, well, I've never
worked on that end of the bird

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.410
before.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.100
I'm sure I'll learn a lot.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.370
But what I learned
transformed, really,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.370
my understanding of biology
in a fundamental way.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.650
Now duck sex is problematic
because there are-- well,

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.770
much of duck sex
is what we imagine.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.210
Females, like this
female mallet,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.040
choosing males on the
base of their core

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.640
evolved preferences for
traits, like the green head

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.870
and the quack, quack, quack.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.410
Right?

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.490
But in ducks there's a problem
that high breeding density also

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.540
leads to many males not
being paired, leading

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.900
to forced copulation, or
essentially rape in the ducks.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.290
And what that is made possible
as a consequence of the fact

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.020
that birds have a penis.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.780
That the penis evolved in a
common ancestor of reptiles

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.520
and mammals, but was
lost in most birds,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.810
but still retained in ducks.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:41.090
So this is fascinating
and also troubling.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.610
Because this
animal, for example,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.980
the penis of birds or
ducks is very unusual.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.790
This is the largest penis for
any animal of its body size.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.890
It's actually longer
than the duck.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.200
And so it took patty
Brennan, a female biologist,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.630
to come to my lab and
say, what is with that?

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.560
Where is that?

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.160
And how is that functioning?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.260
So a bit of introduction
to the avian penis.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.710
It is homologous,
but very weird.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.140
It has a counter
clockwise spiral.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.050
It has an open groove
instead of a closed urethra,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.880
called the sulcus.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.450
And it comes in smooth,
ribbed, and toothy varieties.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.530
And-- most of which
have co-evolved

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.310
with forced copulation,
or with force.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.920
Now in science we
aim to change lives.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.810
And the next video
will change your life

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:37.710
if you've never seen a slow-mo
video of a duck penis erecting.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.197
But-- and so, here we have it.

00:11:42.197 --> 00:11:43.780
If you don't want
to change your life,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.770
then keep your eyes closed.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.990
This is a video taken.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.960
And the erection of the penis
takes a third of a second.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.870
It unfurls from outside in.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.690
And that is a--

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.863
well, you can see,
16 centimeter there.

00:11:58.863 --> 00:12:00.530
And I want to point
out that we're using

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.550
the metric side of the ruler.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.550
So that means that this
is actually science.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.900
Although ducks are
common barnyard animals,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.810
it took until 2010 to
actually describe something

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.630
that all farmers, or all people
around waterfowl, have known.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.130
Right?

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.100
So this is a new
and unknown biology.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.210
So what's going on?

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.450
Well, what Patty
discovered is that there

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.180
is a co-evolution
between the penis

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.280
and the vaginal
morphology in ducks.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.190
On the left we
have a small penis

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.060
at a simple virginal tract in
a species that has very little

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.710
forced copulation.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.300
But on the right
we have a species

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.380
with advanced or frequent
force copulations

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.470
with a convoluted and
complex vaginal tract.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.930
Well, those-- that
complexity matters.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.940
Here we say that
females have evolved

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.560
anatomical countermeasures
against forced fertilization.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.740
On the inside of the vaginal
tract the first set of things

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.050
are a set of blind pouches,
or dead end cul de sacs.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.650
And above that is
a clockwise spiral.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.000
So female ducks have literally
evolved an anti-screw device

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.780
in their anatomy.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.280
Right?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.980
Which they can
behaviorally deploy

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.150
during forced copulation.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.090
And we know this is effective
because in species where

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.680
40% of the copulations
are forced, only 2% to 5%

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.070
of the eggs in the nest
are fathered by males

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.630
other than the social partner.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.870
So this is a 98% successful
birth control method.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.370
Right?

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.260
That is FDA approvable.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.070
Right?

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.050
So how do the ducks do it?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.330
How do they evolve such a thing?

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.540
We were able to actually
demonstrate that vaginal--

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.390
or demonstrate that
the shape of the track

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.310
affects the success
of intramission

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.580
by having ducks erect their
penises into these glass tubes.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.060
Male-like on the right, and
female-like on the left.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.070
And they failed
over 80% of the time

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.470
to completely intrimate,
or to enter the female--

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.390
or to enter the glass tube
that was shaped like a female.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.020
What this means is that sexual
autonomy matters to animals.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.530
Right?

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.498
That-- as I said,
there is something

00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:16.040
it is like to have
freedom of choice,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.320
and there's something that is
like to be have that infringed.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.080
So how could these
structures evolve?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.890
Well, when the female chooses
the male that she prefers,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.990
her offspring will
inherit the traits

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.930
that she and other
females have evolved

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.720
to prefer through the
aesthetic co-evolution.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.390
But if she's
forcibly fertilized,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.430
then her offspring
will more likely

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.910
inherit either a random
trait, or a trait that she's

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.160
specifically rejected,
which means that they're

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.560
less likely to be recognized
by other female ducks as

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.590
attractive.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.770
That is the indirect
genetic cost

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.080
of sexual violence to females.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.610
And so anything
the female could do

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.760
behaviorally or anatomically to
reinforce her freedom of choice

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.370
will be rewarded
by other females.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.470
So these anatomical
structures grow

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.430
as a consequence of the power
of aesthetic normativity.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.650
Females who agree on
what is attractive

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.460
can use that to advance
their freedom of choice

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.750
in the face of persistent
sexual violence.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.300
Right?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.170
Now that is a kind of
statement that as a scientist

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.920
I never thought that I would
be in a position to make.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.240
And I think it is a
scientific statement that is--

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.850
we've led to
specifically because

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.820
of recognizing the
aesthetic agency

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.020
of the aesthetic position.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.710
Right?

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.700
Now duck sex is a
co-evolutionary arms race

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.110
played out in the genitalia.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.050
But there are other
kinds of birds that

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.530
show other sorts of responses.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.580
Here is a Bower bird.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.380
The Bower bird is--

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.420
a male builds this
structure, which

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.230
is not a nest, but
a seduction theater.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.840
Right?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.830
And it has one seat.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.150
And that one seat is
occupied by the female.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.650
OK.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.860
So I think I got 2:40.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.360
Yeah.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.930
So what we see here
is the female is--

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.950
or this is a male.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.340
And the Bower have various
kinds of architecture.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.213
So here we see, for example,
a male with his ornaments.

00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:12.630
And in the front
of the ornaments,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.330
those ornaments are
actually fossil clam shells.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.540
So this is a
paleontological Bower bird.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.840
As a curator, I kind
of relate to this guy.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.420
So that's actually the male,
but he's sitting in the position

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.490
where the female sits.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.480
So when the female
sits there the male

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.030
is out front displaying to her.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.040
But now we see the
male makes the Bower,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.320
because the females prefer it.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.620
They're the agents that have
shaped the architecture.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.390
But now we see
the other feature,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.740
which is that when the
male approaches the female

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.710
to copulate, he has to
go back around the walls

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.430
of the barrel--

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.310
of the Bower, providing
her with the opportunity

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.340
to pop out the front if she
doesn't like the way things

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.150
are going.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.590
So the Bower is aesthetic.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.090
It has architecture.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.280
But it also has
this extra feature,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.570
that it protects her
from sexual coercion.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.210
Right?

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.960
And so she can intimately
regard the male

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.869
at this intimate distance
for as long as she likes.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:11.369
Right?

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.260
And to make her
[INAUDIBLE] choices

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.270
and have that freedom
without threat.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.770
Right?

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.599
And I call this
aesthetic remodeling.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.849
Mate choice has
remodeled maleness

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.869
in a way that furthers
female sexual autonomy.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:29.320
So then lastly, what do
females do with their freedom?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.300
They choose beauty.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.240
And so freedom
autonomy in nature

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.570
creates an explosion--
an aesthetic explosion

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.640
in the Bower birds
with elaboration

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.580
of all kinds of
architecture and all kinds

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.140
of ornamental structure.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.830
Right?

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.140
So that is the second
profound discovery

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.080
that I never thought I'd be
in a position that has been

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.330
made possible by the aesthetic.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.830
Right?

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.010
This sort of phenomena is
going on not just in sexuality,

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.710
but in other choices,
like ecological choices,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.360
like pollinators, and frugivory,
or coral snakes, which

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.690
are kind of a genre of
horror in the natural world.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.680
Right?

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.030
Another kind of art.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.630
And so I see my time is up.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.870
And I-- if you like
this, there's more.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.270
And please check out
Evolution of Beauty.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.015
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:18:24.015 --> 00:18:25.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.215
- Great.

00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:33.715
- OK.

00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:34.685
You go get them.

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:35.670
- OK.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.220
Duck penises are a very
tough act that follow.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.990
I will do my best.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.760
I will say, just
as I'm starting,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.560
that I was teaching a
class and once needed

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.900
a picture of a duck
corkscrew penis

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.200
and made the mistake of googling
corkscrew penis in Google.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.240
Don't do it.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.580
I forgot the duck part.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.400
It was really terrible.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:57.900
OK.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.090
So I'm here to tell you about
chimpanzee communication.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.820
It's something that I have
studied for many years.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.700
And I'm particularly
interested in sex differences

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.710
in chimpanzee behavior, and how
they manifest in communication.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.860
And I would be remiss
today if I didn't all

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.980
teach you how to find your
inner chimp a little bit.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.990
So chimpanzees give at least
60 distinct vocalizations

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.350
that we generally have a good
idea of what each of those

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.420
mean, not every single one.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.790
And if you spend time
with chimps in captivity

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.070
or the wild one of the
most commonly heard

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.880
sounds that you will
experience is the pant-hoot.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.760
Now this is pretty
much the loudest call

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.380
that a chimpanzee could give.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.770
We can hear it in the forest
for up to two to three miles.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.740
So imagine being able to make
a sound that you could hear--

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.800
that someone could hear
you three miles away.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.520
So the call actually has
four different components.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.560
And let me actually just say,
this is in many ways a way

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.240
that chimpanzees
give a greeting.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.030
It's kind of a
hello, I'm over here,

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.990
I'm really excited to see you.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.070
It's a call they give when
they're socially excited.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.230
Before two groups
of chimps meet up

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.840
they often call-- give
this vocalization as a way

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.700
to say, hey, come over to me.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.200
I'm really excited.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.140
So that's why I think this is
appropriate for this venue.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.390
So the call comes in
kind of four parts.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.420
The first is called the pant.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.800
So it's-- [PANTING].

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.000
And then they're excited.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.572
So it gets louder and faster.

00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:35.780
And it's called the build up.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.130
[CHIMP NOISES] And then
they have the hoot.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.690
And the hoot is the loud part.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.512
So this is the part we
hear from very far away.

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:46.220
And the other thing
I love about the hoot

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.620
is that it's very
individually distinctive.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.900
So when I hear hoots
of different chimps

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.210
I can usually tell
who is hooting just

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.455
based on that sound.

00:20:54.455 --> 00:20:57.080
So the hoot, as you're thinking
about your inner chimp the hoot

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.360
could be something like--

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.650
it's going to be loud.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.670
The hoot could be something
like, [SCREAMING]..

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.580
OK.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.945
It could be like that.

00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:08.080
It could be a little
bit more melodious.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.002
It could be like
[CHIMP NOISES] OK.

00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:15.230
So think about you as a chimp.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.090
And then, this is very
important if you're

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.950
going to teach small
children this call,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.660
you have to stop
screaming eventually.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.680
At some point you
stop screaming.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.865
And you kind of relax.

00:21:25.865 --> 00:21:26.990
And you have this let down.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.950
[PANTING]

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.450
OK.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.770
So let's put it all together.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.706
This is my pant-hoot.

00:21:32.706 --> 00:21:43.845
[CHIMP NOISES] Hello.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:44.345
OK.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.818
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.130
Now you're all going
to do your pant-hoots

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.600
to say hello back to me.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.870
So are you ready?

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.370
- Yeah.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.080
- Remember this is loud.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.900
So how many times
a professor's told

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.000
you to be as loud as possible?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.200
Never.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.670
They should hear us
in Porter Square.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.470
OK.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.980
You ready?

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.994
[CHIMP NOISES]

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:14.770
Wonderful.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.320
Now here is an actual
chimp giving a pant-hoot.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.654
This is a chimp named Johnny.

00:22:20.654 --> 00:22:22.097
[PANT-HOOT]

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.600
- So I could tell
you that is Johnny.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.332
Johnny's hoot is
like [PANT-HOOT]..

00:22:35.332 --> 00:22:37.180
It's amazing.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:37.680
OK.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.600
So there is a lot of
information encoded

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.820
in that one vocalization.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.970
So through many studies
by many different people

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.260
we know that the pant-hoots
are mostly given by males.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.200
So the males give
this call much more

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.990
come much often than females.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.800
Males who are high ranking tend
to give this call more often.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.800
So alpha males pant-hoot more.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.740
Interestingly, we also
know that individuals

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.230
who have higher
levels of testosterone

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.730
give more pant-hoots.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.210
And the actual hoot
has a higher pitch when

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.430
their testosterone is higher.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.070
But there's also a lot
of social information

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.230
encoded by this call.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.140
We know individuals who are
good friends with each other

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.390
tend to pant-hoot
together more often.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.740
So they chorus.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.890
And when you see chimps in
the wild pant-hooting a lot

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.800
of times those first
parts, that [BREATHY OOH],,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.810
they'll actually extend
that so that they

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.750
wait for other
individuals to join in.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.230
And what's interesting is
that not only do these calls

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.850
kind of indicate or
give us a sense of who--

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.580
which chimps have strong
bonds, but they also

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.950
facilitate more cooperation
with the chimps.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.170
So if they chorus
together you're

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.690
more likely to see other
cooperative behaviors

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.370
between those individuals.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.070
And interestingly,
they also give us

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.090
information about
group membership.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.970
So different groups
of chimpanzees

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.580
have different
dialects of pant-hoots.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.620
And my favorite-- one
of my favorite studies

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.190
is that a group of Dutch
chimps got moved to Scotland.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.300
And the Dutch chimps actually
learned the Scottish dialect

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.750
of the chimps that they now
had to be roommates with.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:26.580
So there is a lot of meaning
in these vocalizations.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.760
But one of the things that
we often have trouble with

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.920
is trying to figure out
what these calls mean,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.040
and really trying to
understand different aspects

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.300
about these calls.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.540
And we can take a lot of data in
the wild just observing things.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.720
But another way that animal
scientists have collected data

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.240
on the meaning of calls
is through the use

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.250
of experiments in the field.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.410
And so I'm going to
tell you about one

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.230
that I love that we
did about nine-- oh,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.170
six years ago now, where we
were trying to understand

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.020
the vocalizations that
chimpanzees give in response

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.660
to things that scare
them, like snakes.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.850
So we found a Python skin.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.130
We stuffed it to
make it look real.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.470
And then we hit it on a path.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.990
And we covered it with leaves
so they couldn't see it.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.130
This is-- this is obviously
the illustration of this.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:19.484
And then a chimp came by we
would reveal a snake to them.

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:20.876
[CHIMP CALLING]

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.610
And we would then
record what happened.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.590
So here is what happens.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.150
This is a chimp named Nambi.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.160
She's about to get
exposed to the snake.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.440
Nambi's seeing the snake.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.920
- Hoo-ing.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.900
Hoo-ing.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.780
Hoo-ing.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.540
So that voice is my colleague,
Anna [INAUDIBLE],, who

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.340
collected the data for this.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.275
So that first
response, [HOO-ING]..

00:25:48.275 --> 00:25:49.650
Very kind of--
it's probably what

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.720
we would do if we saw a snake.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.310
Now here's the interesting part.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.890
Now this is a view from behind.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.660
That's Nambi.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.000
And this is Nambi's son.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.167
So she's just hoo'd.

00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:04.750
And you're going to
see her look back.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.400
And she's giving this
call called a waa bark.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.010
[WAAING]

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.940
She looks back.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.282
She sees who behind her.

00:26:16.282 --> 00:26:18.740
Here's the most amazing thing
about this study, we had-- we

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.580
did 40 trials, different
chimps, different groups.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.450
When chimpanzees saw the snake,
that hoo, that hoo-hoo, that

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.820
seemed to be just
automatic, a reflex,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.570
kind of a fear response.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.410
But that waa bark,
that [WAAING]..

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.410
What they would do, they
would look behind them.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.790
They'd see who it
was behind them.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.230
And if it was a friend or a
relative they would waa bark.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.920
And if it was anybody else
they would keep walking.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.750
So what does this mean?

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.720
Two profound
implications of this.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.064
One, chimpanzees are jerks.

00:26:52.064 --> 00:26:53.720
We know that.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.660
But I think more interestingly
from a scientific point

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.920
of view, chimpanzees, at
least in this particular call,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.440
are showing signs
of intentionality.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.740
Signs that they can control the
sounds that they make and give

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.270
them in different contexts.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.010
And they don't have-- they
can choose not to communicate.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.050
So I think that's a
really important aspect.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.710
And that's something that
really puts chimpanzees in kind

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.920
of the sphere of humans.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.420
Right?

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.730
One of the hallmarks
of human language

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.680
is our intentionality
in speaking.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.860
But chimpanzees also do
a number of other types

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.670
of communication.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.710
Obviously we focus
on vocalizations

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.110
because we can hear
them, but as you

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.090
get to know
chimpanzees more you'll

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.380
see lots of different
kinds of communication.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.170
So here are two
of our male chimps

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.120
just sitting around grooming.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.510
This is something that we think
they do to relieve stress.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.610
We know that
chimpanzees-- we know

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.660
that males are much
more likely to groom

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.240
each other than females.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.120
So in a two year study we
did we had 2,000 grooming

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.670
events between males and--

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.700
I'll just wait for the
horn bells to pass--

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.600
and 32 between females.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.950
So a huge difference.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.520
We also know that grooming
just facilitates a lot

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.870
of other cooperative behavior.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.962
So this is a way of
saying, I like you.

00:28:09.962 --> 00:28:11.170
I'm not going to beat you up.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.030
Let's have fun together.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.990
We also can do things about
looking at the initiation

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.040
of these kinds of events.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.060
This is Stout.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.465
This is Kakama.

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.090
And you'll see they
scratch each other.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.320
They're scratching.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.575
We think that may
be a signal to, hey,

00:28:25.575 --> 00:28:26.700
I want someone to groom me.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.780
Look how itchy I am.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.000
And then they start grooming.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.910
This is a particularly
fascinating behavior

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.280
where, when they
groom, sometimes they

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.130
just hold their hands
up above their head.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.960
We have no idea why.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.120
We've done-- we've
done studies on this.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.460
We still don't know
why they're doing this.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.530
And not every chimpanzee
group does it.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.050
So this is something that
we think is really cultural.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.540
Some groups hold
hands, others don't.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.630
Lots of unanswered questions
in chimpanzee communication.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.130
Is this a signal?

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.330
It's a debate.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.870
Why do this kind of grooming?

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:08.420
Chimpanzees, especially males,
often have communication just

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.110
by trying to be big and strong.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.870
So when we watch
male chimpanzees

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.900
we'll sometimes see them like
lift all of their hair up.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.640
It's called piloerection.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.650
Of course, we think
this is to make them

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.720
bigger than they actually are.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.660
We have this vestigial response
when we get goose bumps.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.160
It's kind of just a stimulus
where we're kind of stimulated.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.440
And that's what's
happening here.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:39.050
Now chimpanzee males are
especially interested in kind

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.600
of being bigger than they are.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.960
And rank and hierarchy
matter a lot for males.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.620
So this is Kakama, the same
chimp that you see here.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.260
He's going to walk by
a lower ranking chimp.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.710
And you'll kind of see
his swagger, his bravado.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.425
And he really intimidates
the little chimp.

00:29:57.425 --> 00:29:58.910
[CHIMPS HOO-ING]

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.640
And that vocalization,
called a pant-grunt, is a,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.680
I know I'm not as
dominant as you.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.120
Please don't beat me up.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.620
OK.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.550
And I think you can
hopefully see that swagger

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.990
that Kakama has.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.240
Now when chimpanzee males--
when you're watching them,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.850
you'll often see
them displaying.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.100
So it's not just that
kind of everyday swagger,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.080
but a lot of times
during the day

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.600
they'll actually puff
up all of their hair,

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.060
and just run around
and throw things.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:35.456
And just act a little crazy,
but act strong and powerful.

00:30:35.456 --> 00:30:36.842
[CHIMP CALLING]

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.750
So that was Mikoku.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.580
Working in the jungle
is a little crazy

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.849
so there's a lot of
foliage in the way.

00:30:46.849 --> 00:30:48.346
[CHIMP CALLING]

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.580
There are four
chimps displaying.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.860
And this is something
we see on a daily basis.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.710
Males making themselves
look big, and scary,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.210
and intimidating.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.020
Now this is a product
of sexual selection.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.630
But unlike the birds
of paradise where

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.690
we see the evolution of
ornaments, what we're

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.760
seeing here is more
of the evolution

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.270
of armaments, things that are
good for fighting abilities.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.520
And what happens
in chimpanzees is

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.130
that males are competing
with each other

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.150
to have access to females.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.950
So we see things like males
are bigger in body size.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.650
They have bigger canine teeth.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.320
They have bigger
bodies, more muscles.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.810
But interestingly, we also
see that they're more social.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.120
Just like we saw those
two males grooming.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.970
And that's because what happens
with male chimpanzees is

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.460
that a lot of times the
way they get to the top

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.690
is through their friends.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:48.710
So an alpha male often gets
to the top by having friends.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:53.030
So that kind of sociality is
very important for those males.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.750
Females are much more kind
of concerned with raising

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.440
their offspring.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.290
Once a female chimp becomes
an adult and has a baby

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.810
she nurses them till
they're four or five,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.250
and then has another one.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.310
And over her lifetime she
probably has about five or six.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:10.640
And so the daily lives
of female adult chimps

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.060
are very much about mothering.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.530
And I will say
just to highlight,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.430
I don't have anything
about chimp penises,

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.330
but they are actually
extraordinary, as well.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.510
The fun fact to take
home with you today

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.050
is that male chimpanzees not
only compete with their bodies,

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.240
but they compete
with their sperm.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.490
So male chimpanzee--
a female chimpanzee

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:37.060
will mate with every male in the
community when she's ovulating.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.360
And so there's-- people's faces.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:39.860
OK.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.280
So chimpanzee sperm has evolved
to compete with each other,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.930
to be very fast.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.180
And they have to
make a lot of sperm.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.460
And so chimpanzee testicles--

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.650
chimpanzee testicles are giant.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.540
They hang down to their knees.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.320
And the size of one
chimpanzee testicle

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.360
is the same size as their brain.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.280
And they have two testicles.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.080
OK?

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.580
So--

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.730
- Zarin, you're
almost out of time.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:05.910
- Yes.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:06.090
I know.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.590
OK.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.580
So just-- I just want to kind
of echo something that Richard

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.000
said, which is, when
we see females--

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.380
I want to just focus on
females for maybe one minute.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.240
When we see females
they often do

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.130
approach males for copulation.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.690
I'll show a quick video.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.920
And here you're going to see
Tongo approaching Kakama.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.390
Kakama has his erection.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:29.680
And this is Tongo.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.460
This is Kakama.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.120
And you'll see her
approach him eventually.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:34.900
He's scratching.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.317
He's drawing
attention to himself.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.050
This is why we can get so much
more intimate detail on chimps

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.550
than human.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.234
And she goes up to him.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.080
They copulate.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.920
The average copulation
is seven seconds.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.140
So don't be too impressed.

00:34:00.473 --> 00:34:02.140
And I think one of
the questions that we

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.650
can discuss with Richard is
this idea of female choice.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.340
I think a lot of you might think
that Tongo is choosing Kakama

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.610
as a mate, when actually,
a lot of our studies

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.310
show that what's happening
here is a form of conditioning

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.239
coercion.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.520
And male chimps are so
aggressive to females

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.250
on a daily basis
that when it is time

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.739
to copulate the females
approach the males more

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.710
out of a fear of retaliation
than as a choice.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.219
And so in fact, what
we see are probably

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.630
aspects of male choice.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:35.290
Males have preferences for
older females, mate with them,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.060
aggress against them more often.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.620
And as I'm getting
off, I do want

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.050
to just say we tend to
focus on male communication,

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.449
but female communication
is interesting.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.590
It's more subtle.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.960
And as I'm walking away
I'll show you a little video

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.909
of a mom and her baby.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.010
And this is mom who's
trying to sleep,

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.020
and a baby who's
sitting on her face.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.930
So thank you very much.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.220
I'm sorry I went over.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.573
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.300
- Thank you very
much, both of you.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.010
So to launch in, I wanted
to start just quickly,

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.513
Richard, with this idea
of aesthetic remodeling.

00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:25.930
And if you could just quickly
remind us what that idea is,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.940
and how you think it might
apply to human evolution.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.470
- All right.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.020
So aesthetics
remodeling is a way

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.080
in which female
choice can evolve

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:41.170
to change maleness in
a way that furthers

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.510
their freedom of choice.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.260
And so it means
that preferences are

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.090
correlate with something else.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.980
They're correlated
with actually more

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:55.050
females being able in the
future to have more choices.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.540
And in the book I
have the opportunity

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.130
to apply both arbitrary
female choice-- or Beauty

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:07.210
Happens, and sexual autonomy
evolution to human beings.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.850
And I have proposed--

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.810
it's probably about as grandiose
a theory as you can get.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.850
Though, it's a bit embarrassing.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.790
But in fact, I propose that
one of the biggest ways

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.400
to overcome the kind of
environment of coercion

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.350
that we see in chimpanzees
is through female choice.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.820
Taking coercion
apart bit by bit.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:33.370
So I propose that the reduction
of canine weapons in males--

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.030
male humans-- or male primates
have weapons in their faces

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.550
that human males lack.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.950
And it's an important question
to ask, how do you get

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.480
males to give up their weapons?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.910
That's actually a quite potent
question in America today.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:52.000
But the answer an evolution
sense is you make them unsexy.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.370
And I think that's
been one of the roles--

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.890
and also the reduction
of size, that morphism.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.390
We're a lot bigger
than chimpanzees.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.640
That would mean that we
predicted to get very much

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.940
different in body size.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.320
And yet, we're
much more similar.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.520
It turns out the famously
peaceful Bonobos are actually

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.140
a lot more different in
body size than humans are.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:09.640
- Hmm.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.140
Interesting.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.130
- And I think one of
the other aspects,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.623
instead of just thinking
about canines, is that--

00:37:14.623 --> 00:37:15.790
I don't know if you noticed.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.580
But Tongo, when
she was ovulating,

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.940
chimpanzees have this
very visual pink signal,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.730
which is a swelling of
the labia tissue, which is

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.950
about 10 days around ovulation.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.540
It's, hey, I'm ovulating.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.440
I'm ready to mate.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.840
And obviously, one of
the things that humans

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.790
have lost in the
course of our evolution

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.980
is this sexual swelling.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.410
I'm very happy about that.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.720
But it does mean
that what humans

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.670
have is concealed ovulation.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.430
And I think that has
allowed human females

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.780
to change the interactions that
they have with males in ways

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.700
that chimpanzee
females can't do.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.340
- Hmm.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:52.840
Zarin.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.740
I wanted to ask you about--

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.620
you talked a lot
about the binaries

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.070
between male and female
chimps, but what about--

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.870
one of the themes of this
conference is the continuum.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.580
And one thing you
mentioned to me

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.350
is that there are different
ways of being an alpha chimp.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.880
It's not always about
being the tough guy.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.190
Right?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.310
And could you talk a little
bit about the continuum.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:09.730
Kind of--

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:10.230
- Yeah.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.240
I mean, I think one of the
things that's lacking sometimes

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.400
when we talk about
animals is the variation

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.340
that we see within a sex.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.680
And so, for being
an alpha male we

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.890
have examples from my study
site where we have kind

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.620
of Kakama, who is just a jerk.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.300
Just a despotic male.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.370
All-- you could tell all
the other chimps just

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.860
were like-- he'd show up
and they'd be like, oh.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.810
Because he was going
to beat everyone up.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.730
And in contrast,
we had Big Brown,

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.890
who is actually still alive.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.330
And he was the politician.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.580
Kissing-- he still
plays with babies.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.810
And he really had success by
being friendly with everyone,

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.540
conceding matings when he needed
to, building relationships.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.440
And I would say they were, in
many ways, equally successful.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:54.940
So, yeah.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.100
I think you can have
different forms.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.673
- That's fascinating.

00:38:58.673 --> 00:39:00.340
It looks like it's
running down to zero,

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.050
which means we're about to
go to audience questions.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.350
Right?

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:02.800
OK.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.092
So we'd like now open it up
to members of the audience.

00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:07.310
There should be a mic
appearing pretty soon.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.710
And then please do lineup.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.920
And make sure your
question is a question.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.790
And we'll try and
honor everybody

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.360
who comes to the microphone.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.130
- So my question is, if the
female birds are selecting

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.500
for the beautiful
male birds, how come

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.820
in the history of fashion--

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.880
although in world
historical terms,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.800
human males have
been at least as

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.940
fashionable and colorful
as females, if not more so.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.210
For the past few 250 years
it switched completely

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.510
to the other side.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.200
Can you offer me a
scientist's hypotheses

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.800
about why it's the
females of Homo sapiens

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.355
that now are the colorful ones.

00:39:48.355 --> 00:39:50.290
- I Would say that
the scientific answer

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.220
is patriarchy.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.580
And actually, one of the
conclusions of the book

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.080
is that patriarchy is the
appropriate scientific way

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.720
to describe that situation.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.790
I will also talk just a
little bit about birds.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.490
I focused on female
choice in birds

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.107
because those are the
aesthetically most extreme

00:40:12.107 --> 00:40:12.940
birds on the planet.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.340
And that happens to be where I
started with my own fieldwork.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.760
However, there is a huge
variety of that in birds.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.570
Lots of mutual mate choice.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.218
You think about
puffins and penguins

00:40:25.218 --> 00:40:27.260
where males and females
have identical ornaments,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.980
and identical preferences,
and long-term pair bonds.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.600
And then there is
polyandra species,

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.850
where a female will
acquire a territory

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.150
and defend it with weapons
and large body size.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.920
And attract multiple females.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.760
She lays the eggs.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.750
The males take care of the nests
and eggs entirely on their own.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.700
So there's lots of other kinds
of variation within birds

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.200
as well.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.930
And I would also say that with
human fashion, whether it's

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.360
male or female, I
think we possibly

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.570
can also interpret that as
a way of displaying status.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.070
Right?

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.740
So not just beauty,
but also our status.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.420
- Thank you.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.300
Lucia?

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.210
- So my name's Lucia Jacobs.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.230
And I would like to tie
this morning's talks

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.750
to these talks, which
is the role of olfaction

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.990
and the sense of smell.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.790
In fact, in bird--

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.710
there's new studies
showing birds are actually

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.990
using odor to choose
mates and zebra finches.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.960
And I think it's--

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.270
of course, and mate choice--

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.040
odor and mate choice
is kind of universal

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.480
in insects and invertebrates.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.340
And what's interesting is, tying
into your Bower bird example

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.970
is that in mice there's this
complex signal that females

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.300
are using to decide whether
or not to approach a male.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.670
And there's a long
distance olfactory signal,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.643
and then there's a
contact olfactory signal.

00:41:42.643 --> 00:41:44.060
And the long
distance ones is very

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.220
similar to what you
said about the Bower,

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.190
where the female can make a
decision from a safe distance.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.770
And I think the whole question
of male aggression, which

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.800
we know is important
for many animals,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.450
females always
have that problem.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.170
Like, who is it?

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.550
How good is he?

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.420
And-- but-- and is
he going to hurt me?

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.310
And I think that there might
be a very interesting parallel

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:11.000
in mice that I would like to
hear what you think about it.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.180
- Well, olfaction is
probably the least studied

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.940
sensory modality in birds.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.080
The idea is that they don't
have a very good sense of smell.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.350
But there are lots of
exceptions that are being known.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.570
For example, parakeet
auklets, which

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.970
live in the Aleutian Islands,
smell exactly like tangerine.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.730
It's not actually
just like tangerine.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:32.437
It is tangerine.

00:42:32.437 --> 00:42:34.520
It's the exact molecule
that makes tangerine smell

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.450
like tangerines.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.860
And they-- but however, they
rub each other all over with it.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.760
They call it the riff--

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.840
the sniff rough, where
they're rubbing each other

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.510
with tangerine oil.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.940
And so they're using at
a very intimate distance.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.450
But we don't really know much
about pheromones or olfactory

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.620
communication in
the lives of birds.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.120
- Thank you.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.578
Let's move on to
the next question.

00:42:58.578 --> 00:43:00.320
- Thank you very much.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.790
- Hi.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.330
I have a question for Zarin
about the transferring

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.850
of cultures between
the chimpanzees.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.210
So I'm wondering if you
can speak a little bit more

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.900
about how those
cultures are observed,

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.030
and then how you observe
them being transferred.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:22.850
So is their a dominant male in
one group whose decides, well,

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.670
we're going to use the Scottish
call, or the Dutch call.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.550
Or is it the
transference exactly

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.660
like they were already
there, and the Dutch--

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.050
- It's probably a combination
of a lot of things.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.500
I would say in many ways
the transfer of culture

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.415
among chimpanzee communities is
going to be driven by females.

00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:40.790
Because females
are the ones that

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.310
transfer to new
communities at adolescence.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.200
So they're the ones
that bring things

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.565
from the culture they're
born into into a new place.

00:43:48.565 --> 00:43:49.940
And one of the
interesting things

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.790
we saw about that
hand clasp study

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.700
is that they actually clasp
hands in different ways.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.070
So they can go, you
know, palm to palm--

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.620
all sorts of different ways.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.870
And the way they do it is
the way their mother did it.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.910
- Hm.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:02.690
- Wow.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:06.470
- So a lot of times there is
a lot of female influence,

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.380
I think, in chimpanzee culture.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.880
But I think you're right though
that with some vocalizations

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.210
we see dominant individuals
kind of being the ones who

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.480
everyone else copies.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:15.980
- Thank you.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.950
We have two minutes,
and two questions.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:18.450
So let's--

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.080
- Hi.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.540
Professor Machanda, I
was curious first of all

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.908
whether female chimpanzees
are exempted from sex when

00:44:25.908 --> 00:44:27.200
they're raising their children?

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:27.890
First of all.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.120
- No.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.630
- And then secondly, I was
curious about the snake example

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.650
that you gave, and whether
it was entirely binary,

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:36.470
the results.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.680
Because I would've assumed
that you would actually

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.410
see greater evidence
of evidenciality--

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.580
or intentionality if
one or two of the chimps

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.050
had actually indicated
to strangers, as opposed

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.940
to just one or the other.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.110
If you saw kind of a range of--

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:55.610
- Sure.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.960
There always a range.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.328
I mean, so the result--

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.870
you know, there were
certainly chimps

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.850
that would give calls to--

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.050
none of them were strangers.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.842
It was either, are they
related or good friends?

00:45:05.842 --> 00:45:07.550
So there were certainly
chimps that would

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.160
call to people-- to people.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.010
To chimps that
weren't good friends.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.340
But the majority-- it
was kind of a majority.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.590
We did not see a difference
between males and females.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.350
So that's also kind
of interesting.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.830
And just about your sex
comment, female chimps

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.610
don't generally have swelling
while they're lactating.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.690
Sometimes they do.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.180
And female chimps when
they have a little infant

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.023
tend to separate
themselves from the group.

00:45:34.023 --> 00:45:35.940
So we don't really see
that many interactions.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.110
So they in many ways protect
themselves and their offspring

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:39.980
from some of that.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.490
- Thank you.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.590
Can we do one last
quick question?

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.090
Oh.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:45.770
Oh, great.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.520
Well, we're done.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.690
Well, thank you very much.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.840
[APPLAUSE]
