one of my favorite quotes which I'm

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569
one of my favorite quotes which I'm
 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.180
one of my favorite quotes which I'm
using my writing comes from the former

I'd like to keep an open mind but not so

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.390
I'd like to keep an open mind but not so
 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.810
I'd like to keep an open mind but not so
open that my brains fall out and that's

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820
open that my brains fall out and that's
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.710
open that my brains fall out and that's
the key point

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720
the key point
 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.689
the key point
we can't keep we we have to scalp

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699
we can't keep we we have to scalp
 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.149
we can't keep we we have to scalp
skeptically assess the information we

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:21.159
skeptically assess the information we
 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.479
skeptically assess the information we
receive we can't be gullible because

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489
receive we can't be gullible because
 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.279
receive we can't be gullible because
there when we get a lot of information

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289
there when we get a lot of information
 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.409
there when we get a lot of information
it's absolutely certain that some of

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419
it's absolutely certain that some of
 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.130
it's absolutely certain that some of
that information is wrong and so we have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140
that information is wrong and so we have
 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.920
that information is wrong and so we have
to always filter what we get and we have

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930
to always filter what we get and we have
 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.970
to always filter what we get and we have
to ask ourselves the following question

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
to ask ourselves the following question
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.100
to ask ourselves the following question
how open does my brain apt to be to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110
how open does my brain apt to be to
 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.230
how open does my brain apt to be to
accept that information does it have to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240
accept that information does it have to
 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.020
accept that information does it have to
fall out and and by that I mean when

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030
fall out and and by that I mean when
 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.700
fall out and and by that I mean when
someone tells you something you have to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710
someone tells you something you have to
 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.100
someone tells you something you have to
ask is this consistent with my

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110
ask is this consistent with my
 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.620
ask is this consistent with my
experience is it consistent with the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630
experience is it consistent with the
 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.180
experience is it consistent with the
experience of other people around me and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190
experience of other people around me and
 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.050
experience of other people around me and
if it isn't then probably there's a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060
if it isn't then probably there's a
 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.460
if it isn't then probably there's a
there's a good reason to be skeptical

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470
there's a good reason to be skeptical
 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.340
there's a good reason to be skeptical
about it it's probably wrong if it makes

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350
about it it's probably wrong if it makes
 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.730
about it it's probably wrong if it makes
predictions that also appear to be in

predictions that also appear to be in
disagreement with things that you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480
disagreement with things that you
 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.930
disagreement with things that you
observe around you you should be you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940
observe around you you should be you
 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.740
observe around you you should be you
should question it and so we should

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750
should question it and so we should
 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.649
should question it and so we should
never take anything on faith that's

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659
never take anything on faith that's
 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.480
never take anything on faith that's
really the mantra of science if you want

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490
really the mantra of science if you want
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.410
really the mantra of science if you want
the faith is the enemy of science we

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
the faith is the enemy of science we
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.270
the faith is the enemy of science we
often talk about a lost loss of faith in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280
often talk about a lost loss of faith in
 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.300
often talk about a lost loss of faith in
the world today I don't lose anything by

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310
the world today I don't lose anything by
 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.170
the world today I don't lose anything by
losing faith okay what you gain is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
losing faith okay what you gain is
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
losing faith okay what you gain is
reality and so skepticism plays a key

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
reality and so skepticism plays a key
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.080
reality and so skepticism plays a key
role in science simply because we also

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090
role in science simply because we also
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.440
role in science simply because we also
are hardwired to want to believe we're

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
are hardwired to want to believe we're
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.680
are hardwired to want to believe we're
hardwired to want to find reasons for

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690
hardwired to want to find reasons for
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.990
hardwired to want to find reasons for
things in the ancient into the savanna

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000
things in the ancient into the savanna
 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.630

and Africa the trees could be rustling

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
and Africa the trees could be rustling
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.840
and Africa the trees could be rustling
and you could choose to say well there's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850
and you could choose to say well there's
 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.480
and you could choose to say well there's
no reason for that or maybe it's due to

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490
no reason for that or maybe it's due to
 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.730
no reason for that or maybe it's due to
a lion and those individuals who thought

a lion and those individuals who thought
 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.380
a lion and those individuals who thought
there might be no reason never live long

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
there might be no reason never live long

there might be no reason never live long
enough to survive to to procreate and so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180
enough to survive to to procreate and so
 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.030
enough to survive to to procreate and so
it's not too surprising we want to find

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040
it's not too surprising we want to find
 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.859
it's not too surprising we want to find
explanations for everything and we

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869
explanations for everything and we
 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.560
explanations for everything and we
create them if we need to to satisfy

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570
create them if we need to to satisfy
 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.059
create them if we need to to satisfy
ourselves because we need to make sense

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069
ourselves because we need to make sense
 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.339
ourselves because we need to make sense
of the world around us and what we have

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349
of the world around us and what we have
 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.680
of the world around us and what we have
to understand is that what makes sense

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
to understand is that what makes sense
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.850
to understand is that what makes sense
to the universe is not the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
to the universe is not the
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.950
to the universe is not the
same as what makes sense to us and we

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960
same as what makes sense to us and we
 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.740
same as what makes sense to us and we
can't impose our beliefs on the universe

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
can't impose our beliefs on the universe
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.380
can't impose our beliefs on the universe
and the way we get around that inherent

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
and the way we get around that inherent
 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.320
and the way we get around that inherent
bias is by constantly questioning both

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330
bias is by constantly questioning both
 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.660
bias is by constantly questioning both
ourselves and all the information we

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
ourselves and all the information we
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.610
ourselves and all the information we
receive from others that's what we do in

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
receive from others that's what we do in
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.890
receive from others that's what we do in
science and it works beautifully in the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900
science and it works beautifully in the
 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.680
science and it works beautifully in the
real world as well when you're presented

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
real world as well when you're presented
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630
real world as well when you're presented
with questions or answers about any

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
with questions or answers about any
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.730
with questions or answers about any
problem there are a few questions you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740
problem there are a few questions you
 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.650
problem there are a few questions you
can ask yourself that you should ask

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
can ask yourself that you should ask
 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.270
can ask yourself that you should ask
yourself right away first of all you can

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280
yourself right away first of all you can
 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.949
yourself right away first of all you can
ask yourself do I like this answer and

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959
ask yourself do I like this answer and
 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.710
ask yourself do I like this answer and
if you do you should be suspicious

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
if you do you should be suspicious
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.910
if you do you should be suspicious
because you're much more likely to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920
because you're much more likely to
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.310
because you're much more likely to
accept something that appeals to you and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320
accept something that appeals to you and
 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.150
accept something that appeals to you and
and whether it's right or not so you if

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160
and whether it's right or not so you if
 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.100
and whether it's right or not so you if
you inherently like something in some

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110
you inherently like something in some
 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.960
you inherently like something in some
sense that's a reason to be almost more

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
sense that's a reason to be almost more
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.320
sense that's a reason to be almost more
suspicious of it if you're a scientist

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
suspicious of it if you're a scientist
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.390
suspicious of it if you're a scientist
but then you can ask the question when

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
but then you can ask the question when
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.580
but then you can ask the question when
you're presented with information does

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590
you're presented with information does
 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.229
you're presented with information does
that information is that information

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
that information is that information
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.729
that information is that information
consistent with what I know already

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739
consistent with what I know already
 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.190
consistent with what I know already
based on data I've taken about the world

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200
based on data I've taken about the world
 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.690
based on data I've taken about the world
around me and that and by data it's not

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700
around me and that and by data it's not
 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520
around me and that and by data it's not
just scientists if you if you're if you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
just scientists if you if you're if you
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.500
just scientists if you if you're if you
put your if you're a child all children

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
put your if you're a child all children
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.670
put your if you're a child all children
do this you put your hand in a flame

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680
do this you put your hand in a flame
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.720
do this you put your hand in a flame
okay

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730
okay
 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.490
okay
the second time you know not to because

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
the second time you know not to because
 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.750
the second time you know not to because
you have the data that it hurt the first

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
you have the data that it hurt the first
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360
you have the data that it hurt the first
time and if someone tells you you know

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
time and if someone tells you you know
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.070
time and if someone tells you you know
that flame isn't going to hurt you you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080
that flame isn't going to hurt you you
 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.320
that flame isn't going to hurt you you
should you have the data to assess that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330
should you have the data to assess that
 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.479
should you have the data to assess that
that's probably wrong so you want to ask

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489
that's probably wrong so you want to ask
 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.120
that's probably wrong so you want to ask
yourself does that information is that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
yourself does that information is that
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.500
yourself does that information is that
information consistent with what I know

that is done is likely to be true so

that is done is likely to be true so
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.979
that is done is likely to be true so
many sources question what you see and

many sources question what you see and
whether it's consistent with what you

whether it's consistent with what you

go to echo chambers and just read the

that if you look at many sources you can

that if you look at many sources you can
 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.230
that if you look at many sources you can
also quickly decide which ones are not

also quickly decide which ones are not
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.270
also quickly decide which ones are not
reliable and throw them out if they're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
reliable and throw them out if they're
 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.100
reliable and throw them out if they're
not reliable in one case then you should

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110
not reliable in one case then you should
 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.630
not reliable in one case then you should
be highly suspicious of them in the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640
be highly suspicious of them in the
 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.080

so we all turn to different sources that

way we actually learn anything is by

sometimes what you think is skepticism
