1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.820
You got any your interview?
Oh my God,
we're going to have to sit down.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.410
She got a spectrum.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.060
So you got people that don't even know if they're human or of live ingest.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
Is this all the sedation because they'd been lied to so much for so long.

5
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.014
Then I know it's true.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.140
And then over here you've got people that just believe whatever they see on CNN

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
and me,
I'm just trying to look at everything on while they've lot a lot,

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.590
but sometimes it's not that often times is incompetence.
What's real.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.030
And so I don't blame it to editing.

10
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.780
That's like way over here or other people that are like way over here cause

11
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.210
they're trying to find some solace and believe there's order in the universe.

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.220
The truth is there's not order in the universe.

13
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.730
There's people trying to bring order to the universe and that's why they stage

14
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.880
events.
So they can try to bring order within that event.

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.340
And that's all I'm going to say.
What event are you talking about?

16
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.290
No Northwoods or Gulf of Tonkin or whatever the thing is or,

17
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.220
or taking a real event and making a big,
but it's not bad to question that.

18
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.440
And so how do we get convinced to say,
well,
uh,

19
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
you know,
I asked questions and I need to be shut down.

20
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:00.180
As long as I'm legitimately asking questions,

21
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.170
it is going to judge that I have that right.
So that's where we're all going.

22
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.590
Just what is the system?
We'll get rid of free speech,
right to self defense,

23
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.710
the family to fend those things and ask yourselves,

24
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.390
what are we about to than men?
I believe in that.
You can say that shit again.

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.920
What was it right to bear arms free speech and what was the third one?
Family.

26
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.790
Family.
What were the needs?
Big Sneezing.

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.000
John asks the question,
who was the big three?
Say that again.

28
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.300
I think mystery is what Ge,

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.060
I think mystery is what's key thing.

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.720
Now you get why and I appreciate you having me on guys.

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.310
My eyes don't want to be like,
my life is not sandy hook.
I'm said.
Yeah.

32
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.070
Tell me what you were telling me earlier that you were actually,

33
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.700
you even before all this happened,
you were planning your exit strategy.

34
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.640
Like you get weary of this.
Yeah.

35
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.490
And it's not like I'm afraid of the fight,

36
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.910
but I'm 45 and I've had a long adventurous life so I'd probably like 60 and I

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.490
was already like,

38
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:09.110
I wasn't sure about Trump or whatever has really bad feeling when he got
elected.

39
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:11.130
Not that he was bad,
just like all the worries about to start.

40
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.780
And then I was already planning to kind of face things out just cause I don't

41
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.870
wanna like Dow and I'm 55 a heart attack and the fact they attack me so much

42
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.210
makes me have to battle and fight and never give up.
And,
and,

43
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.790
and so it's not like they even wore me down before they ever,

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.860
they kept me in the game.
I explain it.

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.000
They kept me in the game attacking me in lying about me because now I'm,

46
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.310
we'll out.
I've now become,
when I was worried about,

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
now I dream about this stuff you that was what you were worried about initially?

48
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.900
Yeah,
because I realized about the four year,
five years ago,

49
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.440
but it's obsessive that I was already totally obsessed and you were telling me

50
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.370
that it fucks with your head [inaudible] certain amount of it after a while it

51
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.790
just fucks with your head.
Yeah,
the negativity.
Yeah.

52
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.140
And I like to have dreams.
I have like dreams are like 20 years long.

53
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.860
Like you said about DMT.
I'm a farmer and like it's a,

54
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.870
it's like 500 years ago and I'm just like planning things,

55
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.400
eating food and like put my kids to sleep and like,
you know,

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.100
cutting trees down and like walking around.
I like,
I have dreams,

57
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.090
robberies like normal and just being a normal person.
And so I,
I never,

58
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.070
I didn't like the global state.
Like they have like all these shows,
homeland,

59
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.260
all these shows her on this pick Damon,

60
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.520
I didn't like calculate what I was going to do and then I was already not ready

61
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.950
to give up.
I was ready to move on and innovate.

62
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.810
And now it's almost like it's God doing it.
I was like,
no,
no,

63
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.650
it's not that easy.

64
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.190
You're going to be pinned against the wall by your enemies and you're going to

65
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:40.110
fight to the death.
And I don't believe God's a sadist,

66
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.690
but I realize it's God's plan.
I'm not going to be turned loose.

67
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.890
I wasn't just going to do a couple tours in this fight and beat be turned loose.

68
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.830
And so it's been,

69
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.470
it's been framed to realize that this is all big stage and God wants to see some

70
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.610
people dance.
But I tell you,

71
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.700
the globalist think they're like running me out or they think they've got me.

72
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:04.000
It's the difference.
It's like,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's the opposite.

73
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.770
Now they've turned me into this maniac.

74
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.353
<v 1>Well,
there's a,</v>

75
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.360
there's definitely some sort of a struggle going on right now and there's a,

76
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:13.780
it's,
uh,

77
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.100
seems to be like a universal struggle for figuring out what people are and how

78
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:21.070
we should behave and who gets to decide that.

79
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.240
And there's certain universal truths are ignored and there's certain ones that

80
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.750
our emphasis over emphasized and there's certain ones that are,
you know,

81
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.320
that are in the goldilocks spot and we were working it out.

82
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.570
I think that's part of what's going on with human beings.

83
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.250
But when we have to be really,

84
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400
really careful of is that by silencing some people and never giving them any

85
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:47.260
path to retribution,
we create internal enemies.

86
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.271
And this is,

87
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:51.520
this is what easily could be happening right now when someone doesn't have

88
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.470
ability to express themselves

89
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.810
<v 0>because an evil force wants conflict.
And what you say is,
let me know.</v>

90
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.880
<v 1>It's an evil force,
but it's an archetypal force there.</v>

91
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.530
They're listening to all those around them.

92
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.240
And there's a hive hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of this.

93
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.430
There's not a lot of debate about,

94
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.220
<v 0>by the way,
let's just say this Joe and,
and to,
um,
10th plan.</v>

95
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:15.054
Everybody else,

96
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.310
you didn't give into the pressuring of the threat.

97
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.180
It was more than nagging like a Shyrone,
like a bitching woman,
not against women.

98
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.790
But I mean,
I may not get it.

99
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.940
That's why us and so that's why you didn't have me on.

100
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:33.530
But then you realize I was just a shamble of you just trying to live the life

101
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:35.420
and put out good ideas and talk to people.

102
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.290
But folks are going to make you choose a shy and that's what's happening in this

103
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.570
quickening ish.
I don't want to choose a side.

104
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.560
<v 1>Ryan Seacrest has got it nailed.</v>

105
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.850
Nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest for like political advice.
He's got it nailed.

106
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.480
He hosts a bunch of shows.
The real nice guys got a great smile.

107
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.680
He figured it out.
Yeah,

108
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.060
<v 0>but you understand what that sweet spot man,</v>

109
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.580
dummy you're talking about any,
oh my God,

110
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.440
he's leaving himself.
Entropy is stagnant water.

111
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.780
Oh it's still nothing's going on.
It's all clear.
It's dead and rotting.

112
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.370
What's alive?
Oh,
should big crashing waves.
It's seriously.

113
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.570
I've seen beyond.
Everybody has,
but I've,

114
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:24.350
I've seen way beyond cause you want to be in the conflict.

115
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.950
You want to be in the fight.
You want to take all your,

116
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.890
you're not successful Joe.
Cause you played along with the system.

117
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.710
You're successful because you did it organically and real doesn't mean it's

118
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.110
perfect.
I mean,
it's bad.
It was real.

119
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.110
That's why your success and then they come in,
you think,
oh,

120
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.090
I'm not saying you're bad.
I'm the same way.
Oh,

121
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.770
all these people are telling me how great I am.

122
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.830
I play ball with them because I've got,
you know this thing.

123
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.230
But they want you because they're soulless.

124
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.110
And so all I'm saying is you've made the right decision.

125
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.640
And I would just say having me on because I'm not perfect,
is deciding,
no,

126
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.830
America,
still America,
the world still the world.

127
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.950
We're allowed to talk about real things and hear rolled things because they want

128
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.280
to shut other voices down so they can lie about those voices.

129
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.500
And any idea that fears,
exposure or fears,
debate is a failed idea.
