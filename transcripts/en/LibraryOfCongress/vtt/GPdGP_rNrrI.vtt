00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.420
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you all
very much for coming to part two

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.910
for this lovely symposium.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.280
It's a terrific morning.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.010
And we're going to move
right into panel two.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.190
It's called Culture Production,
Activism and a Creative Hub:

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.810
The Drum and Spear Bookstore.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.330
Since we are talking about
cultural politics, region,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.310
geography, democracy
and all those things,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.000
we wanted to bring it
all the way home here

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.130
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.380
And we're going to
start by saying

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.730
that there were some bios.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.030
I believe they're out there.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.800
If not, you can actually dial
them up on your cell phones,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.070
iPhones, smartphones,
tablets, what have you.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.260
And we're going to start
with our panel here.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.560
Distinguished panel of folks,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.030
many of whom have
been interviewed here

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.160
for the Civil Rights History
Project, a joint initiative

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.650
of the Library of Congress
and National Museum

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.570
of African American
History and Culture.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.080
And to my right, your left,
that's for the camera as well,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.000
Judy Richardson, activist, media
producer, longtime stalwart

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590
of many artistic
productions here at DC

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.140
and across the country.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.960
Next to her, Tony Gittens,
well-known to some of you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880
as the director of DC's
Premier Film Festival.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.750
To my left, Jennifer Lawson,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.290
another media producer,
activist.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.450
To her left is Josh Davis.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.420
And we sort of inverted the
order because our final guest,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.760
Josh Davis, professor at
the University of Baltimore,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.380
author of aforementioned book
which I've held up for you --

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.000
and he is available
for signatures

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.300
and what not later on.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.080
And all the way to his left
is Courtland Cox, activist,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.100
organizer, political worker,
member of the DC government

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.930
in many capacities over
the course of time.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.870
And we are very, very
thrilled to have them all here.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.230
I'm going to stop talking
at this moment and sit

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.530
and do what John Fend did,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.550
which was to kind of
mediate everybody.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.560
And I'm going to begin by also
starting off with a film loop

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.330
which will play in the
background as we're talking,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.050
and it gives you some sense
of what the cultural milieu

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.000
and the social structure and
all those things of 1968 and so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.380
on Washington DC
was as they speak.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.680
There are no particular --

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590
I think there will be some
references made to some

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.890
of these photographs,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.990
but they'll not be
speaking directly with them.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.550
So Judy, if you would start.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.850
Thank you.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.150
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Okie-dokie.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.450
Well, thank you,
everybody, and thank you,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.750
Guha, for introing us.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.970
Let me just say that for me,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.670
Drum and Spear bookstore was
a continuity of the work,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.680
a continuation of the
work that we did in SNCC.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.950
Expanding the awareness
of ourselves

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.150
and of our power to
change the world.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.760
And Drum and Spear becomes
the largest African American

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.430
bookstore in the country.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.320
Now when I first see the store,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.830
I had to go through
tear gas to get to it.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.580
It was May 1968.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.210
It was on 14th and
Fairmont Streets,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.390
and the street had just
recently been tear gassed

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.690
after the rebellions

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.480
that followed the
assassination of Dr. King.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.130
So I meet Tony Gittens,
this person here,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.530
who is the manager of the store.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.720
And we go through the tear
gas and he opens the door.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.550
And what I see is a
space with maybe three

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.530
or four recently stained
bookcases and no books.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.750
So I had arrived in DC
just a few days before

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.060
because my SNCC buddies had
asked me to come run the office

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.090
for the parent company,
African American Resources, Inc.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.110
So I'd left DC where I'd been
attending Columbia University

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.790
since returning to school
after three years on SNCC staff

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.990
in Mississippi, Alabama,
Southwest Georgia.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.020
And I headed to DC with
my mattress on the roof

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.920
of a car driven by Curtis
Hayes, another SNCC person

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.100
who was involved in
setting up the store.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.510
Tony outlined to me
what needed to be done

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.820
and the process for
getting there.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.200
He was the first person I saw.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.270
I knew that Courtland and
Charlie Cobb and a number

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.300
of other people,
Jennifer, were involved.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.900
But Tony as the first person
that I see in the store

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.400
through this tear gas, right?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.910
And so he outlines what has
to be done and the target date

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.900
for the opening of the store,
which is just a month away.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.910
And I'm sitting there
looking, there are no books.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.660
So at some point we set up
an account with Bookazine

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.220
which was book distributor.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.750
I actually remember
this, in New York City.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.270
And the bookstore had purchased
a VW van which I drove.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.610
So Tony and I drive
up to New York City.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.280
We get to Bookazine and there
is this incredible black

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.070
salesperson at Bookazine.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.530
So we tell him about the
store and that you know,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.050
it's a black bookstore,
that it's going to be right

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.830
in the heart of the
community in DC.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.600
And he gets so excited, right?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.650
We give him a list of books
that we were interested in.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.180
Books about the African Diaspora
here in the US, in Africa,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.110
in the Caribbean, wherever.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.110
And books about history,
politics, culture,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.980
intellectual discourse,
whatever.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.320
So he pulled the
titles as we requested,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.170
but then he pulled a lot more.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.840
He also showed us a
few black kids books,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.440
mainly African folktales and
a few others, but just a few.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.740
Because this is 1968.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.310
So we didn't yet have the
federal mandate that required

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.800
that children's books used
in schools reflect the makeup

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.270
of the children in the
communities that they served.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.860
That had not happened yet.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.380
So we got more books, we
stained the bookshelves

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.830
and we opened the store.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.790
Purposely, we wanted it on
14th Street, but I'm going

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.490
to let Tony and Jennifer and
Courtland talk about that,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.590
about the politics
of the location,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.820
why they decided
to start the store.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.160
I will say what I did understand
even first coming in was

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.480
that Charlie Cobb had
initially had the idea

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.120
from going through Vietnam.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.760
And that's a whole other
story which I won't take

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.750
up my seven minutes
to tell you about.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.280
But he sees this idea,
he comes through Paris.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.320
He sees it in Paris,
sees the cafÃ©, sees books

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.590
and people having
coffee and discoursing.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.720
And he thinks, "Oh,
I can do that in DC."

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.750
Now it helps him that his
father was the founder

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.050
and then 15 years into
being the executive director

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.710
of the United Church of Christ
Commission for Racial Justice.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.010
So he had money.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.660
So he gives us the
first $10,000.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.730
Hey. So we are set at least
for the first $10,000.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.570
We also have the Episcopal
church at 815 Second Avenue.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.030
They used to give
us money as well.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.650
Okay, so the basic point is that
we sited the store deliberately

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.400
at 14th and Fairmont
because it was in the heart

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.410
of the black community.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.700
And understanding to that this
was an economically depressed

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.000
section of DC.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.710
This was not the
Gold Coast, right?

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.110
But it was a section of
high energy and culture.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.410
There was a jazz place

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.200
that I can't remember the
name of up the street.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.530
There was just lots going on.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.070
And it was just such high
cultural and political energy

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.670
in DC at that time, it
really was chocolate city.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.300
So we are able to
bounce off of all

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.620
of that energy in
doing our store.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.140
Now I was going to
ask Tony to do this,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.660
but he doesn't really
remember it, so I'm going

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.830
to tell the story anyway, okay?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.530
So we were selling not
only to individuals in DC,

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.420
but also institutionally to the
new black studies departments

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.720
that had been fueled

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.040
by the Toward the Black
University Conference that comes

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.030
out of the takeover
that Tony was one

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.580
of the two main leaders for.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.950
So that had just
happened in 1968,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.750
take over the administration
building at Howard, right?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.140
I see Tony at the bookstore.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.610
I don't even know that
he's just come off that.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.830
What I do know is that in '69,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.320
because of the Toward the
Black University Conference

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.570
that gets fueled
by the takeover --

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.870
because that's one
of the demands

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.010
and they get a Toward the
Black University Conference --

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.460
you get black studies
departments.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.930
No, programs.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.130
They rarely become departments.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:21.000
Black studies programs at San
Francisco State, at Cornell,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.420
at a lot of these universities.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.820
So they're institutionally
buying books

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.480
from Drum and Spear Bookstore.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.670
That's really helpful.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.950
I should also say that what
the Bookazine staffer started

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.830
in terms of children's
books we ran with.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.550
So we built what
became a wonderful

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.380
and extensive children's
section of black books.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.750
Picture books, young adult
books, comic books, et cetera.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.420
And we were able to
include Eloise Greenfield,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.520
Sharon Bell Mathis, DC authors,
as well as Lucille Clifton

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.260
from Baltimore and
so many others.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.230
In fact, we became a magnet
for some black teachers

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.830
who normally did
not come up into

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.250
that portion of 14th Street.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.980
And they would often
be amazed to find all

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.920
of the children's books that had
black and Latino children in it.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.000
Because they had not
formerly been exposed to that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.520
And that has to do with
who wrote the books

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.830
and whom they were sold to.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.480
And we can go into that
at some other point.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.610
At that point you
had Brent Hanos

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.890
and that was then
the chain down town.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.050
But it really wasn't
carrying black books,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.870
adult or children's.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.210
And in fact, our
experience starting Drum

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.940
and Spear Bookstore seemed

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.400
to really surprise both
the mainstream bookstores

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.190
and the publishers to find

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.360
out that black people
really read books.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.150
What a concept, right?

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.780
And they started doing
books at a lower price

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.000
but never the extensive
stock that we had

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.730
in both children's books
and adult books and --

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.460
oh gosh, African
literary services.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.360
We had so much from the African
diaspora around the world.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.830
Now we also ended up --
and in fact, by the way,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.900
the children's section
with history and literature

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.010
for all ages becomes one

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.040
of the most popular
sections of the store.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.780
And I know Debra Mancart who was
head of Teaching for Change --

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.830
and everybody should go
grab her at the end of this.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:29.980
She had the bookstore
at Busboy's and Towitz.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.280
Not Towitz.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.610
Busboys and Poets at
14th Street, initially.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.340
And is still so active
and has what,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.950
84,000 teachers nationwide
on their list.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.140
This is the lady, okay?

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.430
So in a lot of ways, what we
were learning is the importance

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.390
of children's books
to bring in people.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.050
And that's something
we knew in SNCC.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.350
This is obscure.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.650
Something we knew in SNCC,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.860
because one of the ways
we organized SNCC is

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.670
that you started freedom schools
and you did things with children

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.880
because it brought
the parents in.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.770
And then they would
get registered to vote.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.440
We understood the
importance of children.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.440
Okay, so we ended up doing a
number of teachers conferences

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.060
and exhibits in DC
and out of town.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.830
And we often made more
in a one-day exhibit

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.470
than we sometimes made
in a week in the store.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.730
So Drum and Spear Press,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.640
brings me to how we
published the first book

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.840
of now-famous children's book
author Eloise Greenfield,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.140
Bubbles.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.440
She's a DC native.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.660
She still lives and
writes here in DC.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.440
Oh, they want me to slow down.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.070
Oh no, he's telling me
I've got tow minutes.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.030
That's why I'm talking
so quickly.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.040
[ Laughter ]

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.690
Okay, so we had formed
Drum and Spear Press.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.290
We had our office in the
Roundstone and Amos Morgan

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.580
at 18th and Belmont,
all three floors.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.630
And only one other black
publisher then existed,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.220
and that was of nonfiction
books,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.830
and that was Dudley
Randal who had Broadside.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.320
But he mainly did poetry.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.050
So Eloise Greenfield
hadn't yet published.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.190
And she sent us her manuscript,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.160
what becomes her
first book, Bubbles.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.330
I was the children's
book editor.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.930
I remember now these
folks, Charlie and Courtland

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.820
and Jennifer were away
in Tanzania doing Drum

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.630
and Spear Press East Africa.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.500
So I'm up there.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.800
We had no money.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.100
So we had no fuel.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.400
So I was freezing.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.780
I remember being in a coat.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.560
Jimmy the rat had the kitchen
and I had a sign that said,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.100
Jimmy the rat has the
kitchen; go in at your peril.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.730
And I'm reading these
manuscripts.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.420
And I find this one from
Eloise Greenfield and it is

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.720
such a wonderful story.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.710
I call her that night and I
said, "I'm calling from Drum

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.210
and Spear Press and we
want to do your book."

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.040
Now this is the book
that we did.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.340
It was called Bubbles.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.640
Oh, it was so wonderful.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.940
It had all these illustrations.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.800
Okay. So natural extension, I'm
going quickly, natural extension

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.840
from our interest in
children's literature is

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.530
to our radio program,
Sia Watoto.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.420
So Dewey Hughes was the program
director at WOL here in DC.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.490
And he offered us time for
a weekly children's program.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.400
I became BB Amina and
I was the host, right?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.030
So I opened it saying, "Jumbo,
my young brothers and sisters.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.730
This is BB Amina
bringing you Sia Watoto,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.470
which is The Children's Hour

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.280
in the African language
of Swahili."

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.580
I knew no Swahili.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.930
I learned how to say Sia
Watoto from Jennifer.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.330
Okay, and so all these
children would plug in

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.630
and their parents would plug in.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.540
So Mimi Hayes and I,
another SNCC person,

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.890
developed the scripts
from African folktales.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.530
Jennifer, Tony, Courtland,
others, all became characters

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.950
in our taping of
these folktales.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.430
So they were Mr. Rabbit
and Miss Elephant.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.810
And drumming was provided by
Topper Carew's New Thing Art

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.650
and Architecture Center
which was down 18th street.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.690
And this was a black-oriented
arts organization.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.960
And so one of their
guys would drum

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.100
and he would provide the
music while we did Sia Watoto.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.520
I also did visits as BB Amina
in African dress and the gala

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.670
and I'm reading from
the children's book.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.310
Then, and this is the end,
we had Malazo Bookstore.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.140
So black employees of what
was then the HEW building

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.180
that becomes HHS, they
wanted a satellite.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.780
They were offered a store
in the HEW building.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.630
Elliot Richardson, then the
director of HEW, said, "Oh,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.680
they'll probably want
a clothing store."

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.750
No, they wanted a satellite
of Drum and Spear Bookstore.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.680
So we then -- I organized
this new bookstore,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.170
again going to Jennifer.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.660
"What is a name for a
store that has books?"

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.650
So we came up with Malazo, which
of course nobody could find

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.060
because you know,
this is before Google,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.880
and how would you
remember Malazo?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.210
Anyway, so we started the store

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:52.000
and it became really a
wonderful area where a lot

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.340
of the black employees and
white employees could find

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.540
out about all this
literature about black people.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.800
Now, last story is I'm
sitting there and somebody,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.170
a salesperson from
Scholastic Books comes in.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.290
Now Scholastic was then and is
still now the largest publisher

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.980
of children's books, right?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:19.510
Oh, okay, I thought
-- okay, fine.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.740
This is my last story.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.170
So he comes in, Scholastic
books, and he opens his --

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.450
now by the way, there are
African masks all over.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.030
I'm in a gala, okay?

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.790
And he opens his catalog,
you know, his book,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.960
and it's all white books.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.680
And so I said, "But
what about" --

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.170
it was one of my
favorite children's books,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.470
Sunflowers for Tina.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.850
And I said, "Oh, but what
about Sunflowers for Tina?"

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.580
And he says, "Oh, I didn't know
this was a black bookstore."

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.210
Now, what that meant is like --

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.940
okay, you're only going to
sell these black-oriented books

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.310
to the black bookstores.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.310
And so the white
folks and Latino folks

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.270
and anybody else is not
going to have the benefit

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.380
of these wonderful stories,
not to mention the fact

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.680
that black kids will not be able

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.980
to see themselves
in these stories.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.200
So luckily, some of
that has changed,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.180
but Debra knows how
difficult the road still is.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.770
And so I'm going to stop there
and that goes over to you, Tony.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.500
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.790
Tony?

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.410
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: When we were
doing all this, and Judy,

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.780
I forgot half of this
stuff and how we met.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.040
But when we were doing all this,
you've got to think we were

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.050
like 25, 26, you know, we
thought we could do anything.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.760
We thought we could do anything.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:43.340
And when I met Charlie,
Courtland and some other folks

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.360
from SNCC and Judy, back in '68,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.590
as Judy mentioned I had
just come out of Howard

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.950
with no real plan to do
anything else after that.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.250
What to do, I don't know.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.540
I just knew I wasn't
going into the army.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.170
We took care of that.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.320
But then I remember being
up at Charlie's apartment

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.860
and Charlie talking
about the bookstore.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.610
And saying, "You know,
we really need a manager

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.910
for the bookstore."

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.420
So I said, "You know,
I'll do it."

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.310
And I remember Charlie
throwing me the keys --

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.280
throwing me the keys and sort
of leaving me to figure out what

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.640
to do next with a lot of help.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.200
So that's how I got
involved with Drum and Spear.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.500
I was the first manager.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.840
I think I did it
for about a year

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.820
until Ralph Featherstone
took over.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:36.310
But when folks asked that
we talk about the past,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:43.020
I try to do my best to be as
honest about is as possible.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.710
Why? Because they're young
people who are involved

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.800
in organizing, setting
up institutions and such.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.420
And sometimes folks can get
taken away by the romance

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.290
of what happened
in '68 and earlier.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:07.560
And so I'm here to break up all
that romance to give them --

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.590
I mean really to
give folks some sense

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.020
of when things don't go the
way you want them to go.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.170
That you're not doing
anything wrong.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.470
It's the nature of it.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.860
You're pushing against
the culture.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.460
You're pushing against in
our case a lot of folks

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.290
who have were so much more
powerful than we were.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.670
And sometimes things
didn't work out.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.370
So I really appreciate so
much of what Judy had to say

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.320
because I just really
didn't recall it.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.440
My recollection of drum
and spear was hard work.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.280
My recollection was
sometimes, most of the time,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.630
seven days a week, long hours.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.380
Not only me, but the other
folks who were working on it,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.060
Jennifer, Courtland, Judy, that
it was long, it was hard work.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.980
And that's my recollection
of it.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.280
There were high points [laughs],

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.880
but somehow they don't
come immediately to mind,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.690
at least they're not visceral.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.990
[Laughs] You know,
the other folks

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.660
on the panel I'm sure
will talk about them.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.220
So I was trying to think
about a way to sort of present

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.950
at least my point of view on it.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.630
And I think the best way for me

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.900
to do it is like,
"What did we learn?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.200
What have we learned from
going through that experience?"

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.750
And so I think one
thing we learned --

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.860
we sort of knew this going
in -- is that racism lives in

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.940
and is maintained
by institutions.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.020
That can only be combated by
building counter institutions.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.410
And the folks at African
American Resources,

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.780
Courtland can talk I'm sure more

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.150
about this, and I
was part of it.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.930
I was on the board,
had some say,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.220
even though I just
got out of school.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.760
The idea was to build
an institution

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.330
that would counteract
the racist information.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.850
And we wanted to build
educational institutions

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.360
that were communication
institutions.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.740
And so we had the bookstores.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.670
We had two bookstores to present

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.990
that information
in written form.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.250
We also had the press
which Judy mentioned,

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.440
and folks down the way will
talk about that a bit more.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.340
And we had the children's
show which I had forgotten.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.950
The other person
who was a character

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.370
on that show was Kojo Nnambi.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.670
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yes.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:30.250
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: We would gather
up in that studio once a week.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.550
Who wrote the script?

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.850
Mimi wrote the script.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.150
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.450
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Mimi
wrote the scripts

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.750
and we would read these things
cold and sort of make it

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.270
up almost as we were
going along.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.890
It was great fun.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.830
I remember that as a highlight.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.560
And we had a school.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.270
And we had all of
these satellite things

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.840
around African American
resources that were attempts

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.530
to build an institution

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.520
to counteract all the other
information, negative,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.360
racist information that
was being put forth

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.860
by the larger society.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.290
And so that was very
intentional, very purposeful.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.590
That's why we did it.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.340
What we learned is you've got
to have that kind of focus

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.820
or you're just going to
be floating out there.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.370
Any old idea that would pop up,
you would be attracted to it,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.440
but it wasn't in keeping, it
wasn't viable in some way.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.340
It was passed on.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.320
We learned that there are
unavoidable contradictions

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.960
in conducting a capitalist
enterprise like Drum

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.260
and Spear while we practice
progressive politics

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.170
that oppose capitalist
enterprises.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.780
In other words, we were --

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.120
and Josh does a great job in
his book which I would refer

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.080
to anybody who's
here and interested

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.070
in this subject at all.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.930
He does a great job
about describing not only

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.080
in our case -- get out of here.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.150
[ Laughter ]

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.030
I'm only up to two.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:22:00.100
[Laughs] Okay, I'll speak more
quickly and more concisely.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.060
So Josh does a great description

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.310
and real hard-hitting
description about not only

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.590
in our case and in the case
of other black bookstores,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.250
but other what he calls
activist enterprises that went

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.550
through the same thing.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.480
So I'm just going to
read one quote from him.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.840
Josh puts it in his excellent
book, "Activist entrepreneurs

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.010
who criticize capitalism could
not totally ignore economic

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.840
realities if they
wanted their enterprise

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.300
to survive in the long-term.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.940
Indeed, the greatest threat

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.530
to activist entrepreneurs
was not being co-opted,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.740
but simply going
out of business.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.690
Many activist enterprises
stayed in business

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.850
for only a few years, and
most of those that emerged

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:53.310
in the 1960's and 1970's did
not make it into the '80's."

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.190
One other point about that,
that when I became manager

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.400
of the bookstore,
I went to New York.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.110
I went to Michaux's bookstore
which was the iconic,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.280
the granddaddy of all the black
bookstores in the country.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.030
And I had an opportunity
to talk to its owner

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.310
and founder Lewis Michaux.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.910
And when I talked to him, what
we talked about, I said, "Look,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.880
man, I'm trying to figure
out how to do this."

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.350
And he gave me some advice.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.330
And he said, "Always
remember that you've got

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.680
to pay the sales
tax every quarter.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.180
Never overbuy, overstock
the bookstore.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.080
Don't take on too much credit."

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.040
We didn't talk about
one of the books

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.880
that he had on his shelves.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.720
The intellectual discourse
was somebody else's concern.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.390
But he knew, and
I learned a lot,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.750
I mean just in the time
I was speaking with him,

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.540
about what to do
and what to avoid.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.330
And so that was my
approach to it.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:49.630
Number three, I'll be quick.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.470
From the very beginning, we
learned that Drum and Spear was

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.630
about more than selling books.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.360
That my job was not just
making the trains run on time,

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.740
but the store had become this
community gathering place

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.690
that folks would come
in to talk, to meet.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.820
A lot of the things that the
programs that Judy had done,

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.270
and then Courtland and Jennifer
had done others and other people

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.700
in our staff had done -- you
know, all of that was expected

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.500
to happen in the bookstore.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.790
So we had a responsibility
to not only sell books,

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:27.940
but also to serve the
community in other ways.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.160
We learned that building
an enterprise like Drum

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.890
and Spear is continuous
hard work, as I mentioned.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.900
It requires long hours
and often days and weeks.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.880
It also included cantankerous
disagreements among ourselves.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.600
Good intentions for the struggle
do not eliminate hard-headed

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.950
human nature.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.790
We had arguments among ourselves

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.500
and pretty much we
kept it to ourselves.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.570
That just comes with it,
you guys who are planning

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.240
to do a similar kind of project.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.800
You're not doing anything wrong.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.760
And finally we learned that
our success would help lead

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.260
to our own demise,
as Judy pointed out.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.900
Drum and Spear showed that there
was a market for black books.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:13.620
And the bigger bookstores like
Brintano's and Barnes and Noble,

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.950
they also saw that and they
began to take our customers.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.920
They might have been
limited, as Judy pointed out,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.040
to just a section
in their bookstore.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.810
But they were selling books

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.210
that they never would have
touched before we showed

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.550
that it was possible.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:36.320
They did book parties and book
signings for black authors

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.550
that they never would have
bothered with until we showed

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.350
that we had a line
around the corner coming

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.660
in to see Eloise Greenfield
and people like that.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.220
Julius Lester.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.720
That we showed that
that was possible.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.980
And like all good capitalists,
they took from us and went on.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.460
And then that as true.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.260
I mean, if we were running a
pure capitalist enterprise,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.690
what capitalists do is they
take, or so I understand,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.580
they take that money and they
put it back into the business.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.440
Any profits we had,
any excess cash we put

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.540
into our activist activities.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.870
And then towards
the end, you know,

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.760
it wasn't possible
for us to do both.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.320
We couldn't do both.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.140
You know, it was too
late to be practical

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.240
because we found ourselves in a
financial hole and other things.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.210
Josh talks about what happened.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.570
When you relate it to a
movement, then that interest

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.730
in the movement will
help people come

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.820
and help fund your enterprise.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.340
When the movement becomes not as
prominent, then people go away

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.280
or move on to something else,
then you don't have those people

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.880
who will come, and over time
you begin to fall apart,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.980
which is what happened to us.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.520
So I can go more into it,
but I've got to move on.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.290
Thank you.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.620
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: So Courtland
is going to be up next.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.150
Thank you.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.880
&gt;&gt; Courtland Cox: All right,
well Tony and Judy talked

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.860
about what we did
and how we did it.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.040
I'd like to spend a few minutes
talking about why we did it.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:27.000
The reason we did it was that
it was important to be able

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.460
to have the power to define.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:37.700
When we were coming along in
the '60's, one of the things

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:46.950
that we faced was a
narrative that said

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.240
that Africans contributed
nothing to civilization,

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.820
they have never done anything
and they will never do anything.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.080
And the sense of the
narrative of superiority

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:08.850
and inferiority was built
on a whole discussion

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.100
about our lack of contribution.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:20.000
And that existed you know,
both in Ivy League colleges

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.340
and existed in a
number of institutions.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.540
But unfortunately, it also
existed in our communities.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.730
And that one of the things that
was particularly important was

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:42.360
to be able to create a
definition of ourselves

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.490
that we could control and
that we would be proud of.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.830
And I remember -- and it's
just a very simple thing --

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:58.570
if you call somebody black in
1960, it was a high insult.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.120
If you call them a negro
today, it's an insult.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.190
So the ability to define
was particularly important.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:15.700
I think that probably when we
looked at it, there were two

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.260
or three lonely souls,
Carnegie Woodson, J. A. Rogers

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.190
and a couple of others,
who tried to talk

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.920
about the contributions
of black people

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:34.150
and the African people
to civilization.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:42.340
But I think that we were very
lucky because two years earlier,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:50.130
on June 16th 1966, our good
friend Stokely Carmichael Aquame

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:55.800
Toure put out the
slogan of black power.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:02.260
And it spread like wildfire in
terms of the black community.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.680
And basically at least
at the cultural level

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.380
and at the intellectual
level, black people began

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:16.800
to define themselves as not only
beautiful in a physical sense,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.040
but beautiful in every sense of
people who made contributions.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.360
So that when Drum and
Spear Press and Drum

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.820
and Spear Bookstore and the
Center for Black Education

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:36.540
and other entities that we
created came into being,

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.930
we brought it into
an environment

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:43.930
that black people were hungry
to be able to assert themselves

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.550
as people who made
contributions to civilizations.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:57.880
I think that the purpose of Drum
and Spear and all its aspects,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.870
which is the power to
define, is still the situation

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.680
that we have to deal with.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.950
I listened to the previous
panel on Appalachia and one

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.370
of the comments that was
made about Appalachia,

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.240
about black people -- I mean,
and I look at what's going on

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.000
and the discussion today
about the Supreme Court

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.430
and the question of
sexual abuse of women.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:30.770
That if you don't have the power
to define whether you're worthy

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.770
in Appalachia or whether
you should be listed

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.300
to about sexual assault,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.040
or whether you've made
contributions to civilization,

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.600
you don't have the
power to define that.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.680
And you're always trying
to defend yourself.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.740
You will always be in a hole.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.140
So one of the things that's
important that we tried to do

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.840
at Drum and Spear then and
we're trying to do now is trying

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.020
to assert the power to define
who we are, what's important

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.250
and how we should move
forward to make progress.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.830
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
Thank you, Courtland.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:15.150
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: These issues
for us were, as you can see,

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.480
not purely about
what we were doing

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.490
in the sense of books or radio.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.200
But it was fueled by
this why we're doing it.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.150
And in that sense I think
we thought of ourselves

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.060
as educators with a little
e, that we saw ourselves

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.320
as really being in the
business of education.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.150
And it was no mistake that
we were affiliated then

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.950
with the Center for Black
Education in that respect.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.650
And there were other places as
well that we were connected to.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:51.120
And that it was no mistake
that books would be sort

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.220
of the focus of this initially.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.610
Courtland and Charlie and I had
worked together in the movement

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.270
with the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee or SNCC

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.720
in Mississippi and Alabama.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.880
And particularly in
Alabama we had found

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:13.450
that it was really helpful
to this defining oneself,

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:17.460
defining what you wanted
to do, was really helpful.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.400
And that we started
creating our own books there.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.940
We created comic books as a way

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.190
of educating the
would-be black voters

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.780
and would-be politicians there

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.300
about why complain
about the sheriff?

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.450
Why not be the sheriff?

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.890
And then people would say,
"But what's the sheriff's job?

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.660
We don't know what
the sheriff does."

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.900
So we would then take the
information and make it

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.220
into a comic book about,
here's the role of the sheriff.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.380
Here's the role of
the tax assessor.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.540
And then over time, people
ran for those positions

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.940
and became the tax assessor
and became the sheriff.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.330
So these rudimentary comics
were very, very beneficial,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.100
and that that was sort of
the beginning of our sort

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.670
of working collaboration
in that way.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.680
And I was an amateur artist.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.910
I never had any formal training.

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:21.670
But one of the other things that
I think was really so defining

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:26.120
about all of us is a
kind of can-do spirit.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.630
It wasn't a question of, "Well,
I don't know how to do this."

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.310
I mean, you've heard that all
down the line, of Judy saying,

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.740
"Well, I've never
done this before."

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.040
Tony, the same.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.090
The same was true of me.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:42.150
And then even after we
had established Drum

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:46.040
and Spear bookstore, the
question was, what's missing?

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.530
We need books.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.510
We need our own books,
not just the books

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.900
that are being sold
by other publishers.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.920
We need our own books.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.420
And so we started creating them.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.980
And we had the good fortune
to have CLR James around,

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.600
and so we then published
CLR James',

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.000
A History of Pan-Africa Revolt.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.840
We said, "We need new
children's books."

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:17.260
So Courtland and a teacher, a
DC school teacher, Daphne Mews,

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.350
a group of us got together
and started brainstorming

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.430
about what is it that
we would tell kids?

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.840
And we created then
the book, all right?

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.280
We'd illustrate and we would
write the text together.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.560
We did the same thing
with our folk tales.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.160
And the people in
Tanzania were visiting

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.770
and found it quite impressive.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.120
And we found ourselves
invited to Dar Es Salaam,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.190
Tanzania to help establish
a publishing company there.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:54.070
And the publishing venture
continues to this day.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.470
Our invitation to Tanzania
came also in association

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.980
with the Sixth Pan-African
Congress which Courtland

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.470
and several other people
helped to establish.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.440
So it was this, the work
that we were doing both

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:14.260
in creating a publishing company
or in creating the bookstore,

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.070
were things that then continued
to inspire other people.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:22.130
And it was wonderful to see
them move on to do these things.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.050
Somebody sort of said, "Well,
what would it look like today?"

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.250
And one of the things that
we are very clear about is

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.630
that again, it's the
why, not the what.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:37.630
And we all have been very
active in the last few years

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.270
in creating what is called
the SNCC digital gateway,

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.920
which is a website that
tells then the story

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.590
of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:52.240
And goes on to talk about what
young activists are doing today.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:00.650
So that's the story of Drum and
Spear Press, and I look forward

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.650
to after Josh, to hearing
questions from others too.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.050
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Okay.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.740
Yeah, I wanted to just
thank Guha and thank John

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.440
and thank Thea and
everyone at the AFC

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.010
for putting this together.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.380
Really great event.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:24.810
And I want to talk about Drum
and Spear, but just emphasize

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.790
that of course what we've
been talking about grew

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.970
out of the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.380
It grew out of organizations
like SNCC

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.570
and also was very much a part
of the Black Power Movement.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:41.600
And I think especially
in years '66, '67, '68,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.620
there wasn't always
necessarily a clear line

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.570
between the two there,
overlapping.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.390
And kind of the big point
I wanted to make today --

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.770
and I wonder, do you think we
could switch to the PowerPoint?

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:58.750
Yeah. The point I was going to
make is that I think there's

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.780
as lot of discussion
in recent years

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.100
about how skewed
Americans' understanding

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.450
of the Civil Rights Movement is.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.890
And how the public's
understanding has really lagged

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.570
behind the participants'
understanding.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.820
And I would say the scholarship
has gotten much, much better.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.370
But most Americans,
if they know anything

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.890
about the Civil Rights Movement,
they think of it as a movement

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.900
for political change,
for social change.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.030
But what I was going
to say is one

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.920
of the real neglected
legacies is that Civil Rights

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.590
and Black Power were movements
for intellectual change.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.560
And I think Drum and Spear
really epitomizes that.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.900
And so I wanted to start
with a brief quote.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.480
It's from the New York Amsterdam
News which most people will know

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.330
as kind of one of the premier
black newspapers in the country.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.150
The quote's from 1972.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.000
"Anyone who walks
along 100 25th Street

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.110
in Harlem today may be
impressed by the market changes

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.540
from the Harlem Street
of yesterday.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.160
There are black-owned
clothing stores, record shops,

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.740
bookstores, African bazaars
and other cultural happenings

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.560
that now indicate a new
pride and self-determination

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.480
in the black community.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.350
These changes in
the face of Harlem

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.780
and other similar communities
are largely the result

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.480
of a black revolution
of the mind,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.610
begun less than a decade ago."

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.690
I think that's a quote
that I think really --

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.710
this idea of the black
revolution of the mind.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.900
I think that's a large part of
what Drum and Spear was doing.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.010
And you know, I think a
lot of different parts

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.240
of the Black Freedom
Struggle are doing this,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.870
the black arts movement
for example.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.220
In SNCC for example, I'm sure
a lot of people have heard

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.410
of the Mississippi
Freedom Summer,

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.490
and one of the large
parts of that effort

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.110
in 1964 were the
Freedom Schools.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.020
And the Freedom Schools
which a lot

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.460
of SNCC people were
involved with,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.360
and Charlie Cobb was
very involved with,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.740
I think there are seeds of Drum
and Spear in the Freedom School.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.510
And so Drum and Spear, like I
was saying, was not only part

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.000
of the Civil Rights Movement,
the Black Power Movement,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.710
but also two movements that I
talk about in my book called

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.760
From Head Shops to Whole
Foods: The Rise and Fall

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.290
of Activist Entrepreneurs.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.300
Actually, let me see if -- okay,
so here's a picture from 1968

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.440
of two of our esteemed
panelists.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.270
And this is a wonderful photo.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.180
It was in the previous
photo stream, but this was

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.960
in the Washington Post.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.040
So the Post was covering it.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.560
Washington Afro-American
was covering it,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.130
which was the sister paper
of Baltimore Afro-American.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.730
Washington Star, you know,

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.410
which was a major
newspaper, was covering it.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:58.960
And here, actually
this is a picture

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.550
from the Washington Star.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.160
The Washington Star
photo morgues are

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.180
at the DCPL, the main branch.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.360
And so I was going through
there and saw all of these.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.530
And this is just a day in
the life of Drum and Spear.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:19.060
And then here is a neat picture
of just one little corner

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.430
in Drum and Spear Bookstore.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.510
And the posters, the drawings,
I'm sure you can identify a lot

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.780
of the people there, kind of
the wall of fame, so to speak.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:37.460
So here's this really
outstanding cover of one

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.760
of the Drum and Spear catalogs,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.710
and we saw that in the
previous slideshow too.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.720
But just the artwork
to me is so powerful.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.930
And we were talking about it --
what was his first name again?

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.250
Was it Robert cheeks?

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.550
&gt;&gt; Bruce.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.850
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Bruce
Cheeks, okay, yeah.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.000
And it actually took
a long time.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.840
I had a conversation with
a lot of people about,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.900
"Who is this Cheeks
person who did this work?"

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.840
And Bruce Cheeks, it sounds
like he's still around.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.780
Yeah, I'd like to maybe
talk to him at some point.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.500
But here's two pages
from the catalog.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.250
And I just wanted to -- so
here's an amazing illustration.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.560
And then the catalog, you know,

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.190
the categories were not typical
bookstore's categories, right?

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.850
Like there's a whole page
on African Nationalism.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.410
There's a whole bunch
of different categories.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:31.400
So Drum and Spear was
part of what I would call

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.050
that activist business movement
which is businesses growing

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.580
out of not only the Black Power
Movement, but feminist movement,

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.030
antiwar movement, even
the hippie movement,

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.330
environmental movement.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.580
Activists who were
starting businesses.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:50.190
They're thinking of businesses
less as moneymaking ventures

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.060
and more as organizing tools.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.710
They are interested in
keeping the lights on,

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.640
but that's what my
book is about.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.070
And yeah, if anyone
wants to check it out,

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.790
I've got copies back there.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.320
But getting back to this idea

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.010
of also I would say a
black bookstore movement.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:15.500
So obviously there were black
authors going back centuries.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.830
But in the United States,

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:21.220
the kind of mainstream literary
marketplace, other than people

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:28.460
like Ralph Ellison, Langston
Hughes, the real heavyweights --

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.500
they were just a
few marquee authors

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.290
who were getting any attention

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:37.010
from the white-dominated
literary marketplace

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.310
in the early-'60's.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:43.030
And in the early-'60s, I think
I found there was maybe a dozen

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:46.310
what we could call black-owned
and black-oriented bookstores

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.610
in the whole United States.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.300
Roughly a dozen.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.510
But those numbers began
booming in the middle

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.510
and especially late-'60's.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.800
Really they're inseparable
from the Black Power era.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.330
So what was a dozen stores

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:04.380
in say the early-'60's
became something

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.970
like 75 stores ten years later.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.820
And it's a big jump
from 12 to 75.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.960
In 1969, New York Times
-- am I getting a warning?

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.260
Two minutes, okay.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.420
1969, New York Times
did a story.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.480
This kind of goes to the point
Judy was making, just the fact

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.440
that the New York Times would
do a story on the novelty

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.460
of black people selling
books to black people.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.020
That was a novel going-on.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.220
And the Times said, "A surge
of book-buying is sweeping

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:43.340
through black communities
across the country."

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.790
And the whole piece was
about black-owned bookstores.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.510
And there were these
old stalwarts

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.100
like Lewis Michaux's Books
in Harlem, his store.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.480
But there are stores
popping up all

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.120
over the countries
in DC, in Atlanta.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.190
More in Harlem and Brooklyn.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.150
And there's a few that
still even exist today.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.510
Marcus Books comes
out of San Francisco

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.240
and they still have a
store in Oakland today.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.130
Vaughn's bookstore in Detroit.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.860
Okay, so black-owned bookstores
are promoting self-education.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.570
They are promoting
self-definition.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:18.540
They are in a sense
information centers

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.810
for the Black Power Movement.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.550
And they are, like I
mentioned, part of a movement

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.850
for intellectual change.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:31.010
If you just look at the books on
this one page of this catalog,

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.190
it's some of those
exact same people.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.860
So I don't think J. A.
Rogers is on this page.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.550
But I came across this
document recently.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.130
I'm about to click
to -- here we go.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.040
I'd never seen this
until recently.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.760
It's a reading list from SNCC.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.020
And I think I estimated,
looking at some

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.250
of the titles I think
it's from 1968.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.600
I think there's at least a
Julius Wester title on here

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.180
that is published
in '68 I think.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.190
But I mean, it's
DuBois, it's St. Clair,

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.290
Drake, E. Franklin Fraser.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:05.720
Howard Zin is on there, right?

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.050
Howard Zin having been the
first person to write a book

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:12.290
about SNCC I think, and had
himself been involved in SNCC.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.680
And maybe Julius Wester is
not on this page actually.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.390
But this is the dimension
of the Civil Rights Movement

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:23.870
that I think most Americans
are not aware of, this movement

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.170
for intellectual change.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.750
And it's been something
that's been occurring to me.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.460
I'm just wrapping up very
belatedly a Taylor Branch

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.000
trilogy on MLK which if
you put the books together

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.600
and the type is tiny.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:42.130
But just really drove home
for me also like Dr. King,

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.350
remembered as a Civil Rights
leader, as a master orator,

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:49.230
as a minister, as a moral
force, as a nonviolent force.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.110
But he really was
an intellectual also

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.280
and I think that's
just been forgotten.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.500
But he was an intellectual.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.000
That was such a big
part of who he was.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.110
And so I'll just end
it on that, yeah.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.410
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: Thank
you all very much.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.210
A hand for the panel, please.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:10.060
[ Applause ]

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.460
So everybody here was
handed a list of questions

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.760
that they were going
to talk about.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.610
But I want to pick
up this and sort

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.910
of go off script a little bit.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.380
Not only because Courtland
is getting ready to leave,

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.010
but I wanted to ask
about this notion

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.420
of intellectual production and
representation which has come

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.730
up again as you mentioned
already

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.640
between the previous
panel and this one.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.690
And what does the future hold
if you want to be a futurist

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.470
in terms of how you
control that?

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.570
And you touched upon
that briefly,

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.310
but what are some
logical outcomes perhaps

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.680
that you might look towards?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.370
&gt;&gt; Courtland Cox: I mean,

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:45.030
I think the previous panel
could have been this panel.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:49.460
Because I think one of
the things that was said

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.090
and I got was that the
energy and the solutions come

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.770
from the people who
have the problem.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.790
That's where you have to look.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:05.620
And so you know, my sense is
-- and I'm talking about King.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.700
And I agree King
was an intellectual.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:13.380
You know, and when I first
heard this, thought it was,

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.280
"Well, this is not serious."

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.230
But King used to say the arc
of the moral universe is long,

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.160
but it bends towards justice.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.840
And I thought, "Well,
that's not serious."

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.320
I mean, it does seem to me
what you have to look for.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.390
Because I mean, as you look
at history, if you focus

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:38.770
on what you're for, and that's I
think the real critical piece --

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.610
not what you're against,
but what you're for --

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:45.550
and organize that, that will
get you to where you need

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.550
to be across the board.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.660
And let me just say the
reason I do have to go,

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:55.220
and I have to excuse myself, is
that I am working on a project

00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:02.510
which says that in six states
that exist -- Florida, Georgia,

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:07.300
North Carolina, Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Ohio --

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:16.100
in 2018 we want to get the
black vote to either equal

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.120
or exceed the white vote.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.490
And people are on the
ground organizing that.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.810
So we meet every Monday at
4:00 to have that discussion.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:28.200
So I mean, basically it's not --

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.530
I mean, I do have to think that
being conscious of what you have

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.980
to do, where you have
to go and work on it

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.370
on a daily basis is
where you have to go.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.670
Sorry.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.510
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
Thank you, Courtland.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:45.380
[ Applause ]

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.210
I actually wanted to
pick up on something

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.510
that Courtland touched on.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.810
Yes?

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.110
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: I
wanted to mention something.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.410
Keep going.

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.710
Don't worry.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.010
You've got work to do.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.880
But it relates to something
that we've been doing.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.450
And I just want to hold this up
because this is -- I'm sorry --

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:02.360
an ad for our SNCC
digital gateway.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.490
Yeah. And part of what
we've been all talking

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:09.730
about I think is how do you
control how people portray you,

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:13.040
how you see yourself, how the
rest of the world sees you,

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.220
so how your work is known.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.360
And luckily for us,
we were younger then.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.260
Well, we were obviously
younger then.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.420
But we were the youngest.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.270
SNCC was the only
youth-led Civil Rights

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:27.020
organization nationally.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.910
And so we were 15,
16, 17, 18 years old,

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.370
which means that now we are
more or less walking and talking

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.560
and not just sitting and
knitting baby booties.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.940
What that means is that for
the last four years we've been

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.650
working with Duke University.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.490
Thank you, Melon Foundation.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:47.580
And we have done an
amazing SNCC website.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.530
And it's called SNCC
digital, SNCCdigital.org.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.830
It is incredible.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.370
It has profiles not just of
SNCC people but also of a lot

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.670
of the people that we worked

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.630
with because we wanted
them to be known.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.760
So you don't only
know Mrs. Hammer.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.340
You also know Mrs. Devine
and you know M. C. Moore

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.750
and you know all of the folks
who grounded us, who taught us

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.030
when we were working in
those local communities.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.410
But you also have
all these links.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.750
So for example, we
linked to Debra.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.890
Debra links to us on
Teaching for Change.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.180
We have CRMVet, Civil
Rights Movement Vet.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.490
And that's another
website that is incredible

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.610
because it has primary
documents.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.160
So when Debra and I did a
three-week teacher institute

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.210
for NEH in July, we used
both SNCC Digital --

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:36.060
and it was 30 teachers grade
7-12 from around the country.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:40.530
And for three weeks they
used SNCC Digital and CRMVet

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.520
as primary documents
where they could go

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.050
and share with their students.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.030
I'm saying that to
say we are using --

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.260
and I have books so that you can
see the actual copies of some

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.180
of the books that
you've been seeing.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.160
We have tried to frame ourselves
so that others do not frame us.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.460
So that's it.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.760
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: Thank you.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.060
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: And I have
cards if people want them.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.820
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: There's
something else which I wanted

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.120
to talk about, the resonance

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.790
between the previous
panel and this one.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:11.110
I hope you all can address
it in your own ways.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.050
As Josh touched upon, when you
were at the Freedom Schools

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.080
on the front lines of the
Civil Rights Movement back

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.260
in Mississippi and
places and back home here,

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.590
you fought with the
weapons in hand.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.320
There was something about
strategy and tactics

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.650
which is involved in this, which
is replete with the language

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.850
of SNCC and other
Civil Rights activists.

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.430
And so it seems to me today
then that direct sort of action

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.400
on the ground has shifted
to another strategy

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.030
which is take control
of media representation,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:39.060
media ties representation,
in film and books

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.750
and radio programs and so on.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:45.780
Is that another -- where do
you stand with that right now

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.080
in this particular instance?

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.940
Is that the way to go
going forward in terms

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.970
of advancing the cause of social
justice and social movements?

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:59.470
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: I think that
if we had had the resources --

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.820
I mean, for example, all of the
things that we're talking about,

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:07.410
Drum and Spear and then also
doing Drum and Spear in Tanzania

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.290
at the same time we were doing
Drum and Spear in Washington,

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.840
we were doing this pre-internet.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.140
So this was pre-internet.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.010
This was even pre-fax machine.

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:21.700
So that I have letters where
Judy is asking me about a cover

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.450
for one of the publications
here in Washington,

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:29.420
and sort of saying, "How soon
will it be before we get it?"

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.860
And it's a question not just
of when it will be created,

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.810
but how long it takes
to ship it,

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:36.760
how long it takes to go by mail.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.680
So we are talking about this
work taking place at a time

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.870
that was pre-internet
and when we talk

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.720
about media, this was it.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.680
And radio was accessible to us.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.310
I think there is no question

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.790
that we would have
been dealing now --

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.080
if we were doing the
same kind of thing now,

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.160
we would be dealing with
film and television.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:05.810
It's no mistake I think or
no accident that three of us

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:11.650
up here right now have had
careers in media, that we moved

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:16.510
from this work into
film and television.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.670
And that public media
was also very important

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:22.730
because that again
was the notion

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.160
that these are our tax dollars.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.890
And that the kind of public
forum, the sense of community

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.170
that we've been talking
about creating,

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:35.070
that Apple Shop was doing, that
the center was doing in New York

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:39.300
with culture, that these
places should exist

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.320
and that they should exist
for the benefit of us all.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.600
And that to me is one of
the values of public media.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.690
And why it becomes so
important to not only keep it

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.030
in existence, but
to keep it ours too,

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:59.900
to keep it as a real benefit to
the communities that it serves.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:05.530
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Yeah, I think
that now folks are still trying

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:14.570
to figure out what to do against
the oppressive forces now.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.820
That there's a lot of opinion,
there's a lot of analysis.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.110
There are marches
and demonstrations,

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:26.350
all of which are good
and strong and such.

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:28.150
There's a lot of opinion.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:32.220
But what to do, what do you do
when you get up in the morning

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.440
to combat this insanity

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.380
that we're facing I think
is still being developed.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.990
That there is the
vote, you know.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:48.150
Folks can vote and
put Republicans out

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:50.250
and the Democrats in
and that's all good.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.360
But there's a personal
frustration that I have

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.660
about what is there --

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.910
eventually you get tired
of hearing people talk.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:57.950
You know, I get tired
of hearing people talk.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.740
I get tired of hearing
myself talk,

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.210
you know, much less others.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:05.180
And there's a difference
between talking and doing.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.600
What happened around Drum
and Spear was a lot of doing.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.870
There was a lot of doing.

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:15.710
I mean, what it took to build

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:21.270
and maintain back then
was constant work.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:27.020
And I don't know
of a place now --

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.510
I don't know of every
place, obviously.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.810
There might be.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.110
I'm sure they're out there.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.550
Young people are doing
all kinds of things.

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.630
But it's what to do
to make the difference

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:39.490
that at least to
me is not clear.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.090
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: See, it's
interesting when Jennifer talks

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:51.640
about how three of us
have gone into media.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:58.270
I mean, Jennifer really was
really major in PBS and CBB

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.060
and some of the funding
that Apple Shop talked

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.530
about that was coming
through Jennifer's shop.

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:08.820
Tony all these years has
been doing DC film festivals.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.790
And you know, when
I worked on Eyes

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:13.480
on the Prize, it
was all 14 hours.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.440
And one of the things I wanted
to do in that second series

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.430
of eight hours -- because
the first series is six hours

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:24.940
and the second is eight hours
-- we had a chance of doing --

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.950
we all talked as a team about
what college takeover do you do.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.400
We could have done
San Francisco State.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.340
We could have done Cornell.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.820
And I said to Henry Hampton,
the head of Blackside

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:38.320
which was the production
company that did it --

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.310
I said, "You know,
sometimes we're not talking

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:41.610
to white folks.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:42.910
We're talking to each other."

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:46.040
And so for me it was we need to
do Howard University takeover.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.580
And that's why that Howard
University takeover story is

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.340
in Eyes on the Prize.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.350
By the way, all 14 hours of
Eyes on the Prize is on YouTube.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:57.180
I have to just mention that.

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:02.480
And I think part
of the -- say what?

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.370
You got it.

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:07.350
I mean, given that PBS doesn't
do diddly-squat with it,

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.720
it's good that it's on YouTube.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.520
But I think that the other part

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.030
of it though is how
you organize.

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:17.150
And I think we always understood

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:20.390
that nothing replaces
the door-to-door.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:23.000
Nothing replaces going
to everybody so that --

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.760
I mean, one of the
things that Beto O'Rourke

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.500
in Texas understands is that
he's gone through every one

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:31.310
of those counties in Texas.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:36.280
That social media can be really
helpful if you use it as a tool,

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.030
but if you don't understand
that people are going

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:41.210
to put their lives on the line
for you, or their economics

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:44.440
or whatever it is, that
they've got to know who you are.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.450
And they cannot know that
through Twitter or whoever.

00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:49.750
They've got to see you

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:51.400
and they've got to
see you in action.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.110
And social media is not
going to do that part

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:57.020
of it for you I think.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.740
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: And I
was struck by something

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.430
on Josh's reading list that's
there, and then looking

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.480
at what you have in the
table in front of you.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.730
Obviously these books are sort
of for a high political theory,

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:09.810
CLR James and Herbert
Afthaker and so on,

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:13.280
so there's that reaching
people who have been educated

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.720
to some extent or who have
the capacity and the interest

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.530
in hearing about these kinds
of intellectual perspectives

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.310
and rather high theoretical
positions.

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.030
But then the Watoto Africa
and the children's books,

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.430
you seem to be getting them
from the sort of cradle to --

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.010
not quite grave, if
you know what I mean.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.310
[ Laughter ]

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.610
You know, sort of my age.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:34.990
Not sure if it's the grave
or not, but can you speak

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:36.550
about that just a little bit?

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:38.300
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Well, it's
interesting, one of the things

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:43.480
that we at SNCC were known for
was sort of telling our history

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.180
from the inside out
and from the bottom up.

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:50.530
And so that in part relates
to the notion that we believe

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.420
that everybody that we
work with was important,

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.230
and that we didn't
make distinctions

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:58.730
between the sharecroppers
or the people

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:00.640
who were the school principals

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.340
in the areas that
we worked with.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.910
And in some cases, like
with the Freedom Schools

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.820
that were mentioned,
and some of the work

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.400
that we subsequently did,
we put a lot of emphasis

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.860
on adult education and on
literacy, because that was part

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.170
of the legacy of the
segregation and the horrors

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.860
that people had lived through.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.400
And that it was the
thirst for knowledge,

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.260
the thirst for information.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.760
It's just incredible.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.080
And so the kinds of discussions
that we would have in SNCC

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.690
and with people with
whom we were working

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:37.030
in these rural areas
was quite astonishing.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.800
Because people really
wanted to learn.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.690
They wanted to talk about ideas.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.730
They wanted to talk
about a range of things.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.930
And so that was what these works

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.650
in part we were creating
them for.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.450
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: I'd like
to step back a little bit

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.310
from what I just
said, that the folks

01:00:55.310 --> 01:01:02.750
who I think are really doing
something are the teens

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.080
from the high school where --

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.380
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Yes, Parkland.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.680
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Parkland.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.980
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yeah, honey.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.280
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Yes.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.820
That when we were watching
them, they did remind us,

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.860
the did remind me of some

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.660
of the activity we've been
talking about here today.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.150
That those kids are smart and
they work hard and they're

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:25.660
out there and they put
their heart and their soul

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.910
into doing something to
change, to make that shift

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:32.280
about defining that
Courtland was talking about.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.030
The question with
them is, do they --

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.060
and I'm sure they -- all right.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.900
Do they know -- and this
is something we learned,

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.640
it's a long-term struggle.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.970
That the enemy is dug in.

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:47.600
The NRA in their case is dug in.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.080
Those guys and girls
fight for every inch

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.220
of holding onto those guns.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.670
And it's going to take a while
to beat those folks back.

01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:01.650
But I would say that
they're doing something,

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.120
that those young kids
are doing something.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.030
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: I want
to shift gears slightly.

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:09.180
Josh, did you have
something to add to that?

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.480
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis:
Yeah, just briefly,

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.120
I was going to say we just kind
of can't overemphasize the point

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.500
about this being pre-internet.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.900
I think we are all
aware of that.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.110
But I always have
to really emphasize

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.600
that with students,
what that meant.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.940
I mean, if you wanted to learn
about political movements,

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.790
you've basically learned
about it either through books

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.900
or more likely through people
and the people around you,

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.810
people you went to school with,
people you went to church with.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:37.020
And these activist
businesses, and Drum

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.640
and Spear really epitomize this.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.070
They were focused
on the three P's.

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.470
First of all they wanted
to put new products out.

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.140
They wanted to put
political products out there.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.780
Books by black authors
that are almost unavailable

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.490
in American society.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:52.200
Then they wanted to
focus on the processes.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.780
So this wasn't just a
book store, but Drum

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.990
and Spear had a radio show,
and the publishing press,

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:03.040
and they're linking up with
publishers in Tanzania, right?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.230
So they're reinventing
processes.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.800
But place, place was
really, really important

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.410
and I think place is
still very important,

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:14.360
but I think especially then
without people being able

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.120
to connect through a thing like
the internet, through a thing

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.380
like Twitter, you
needed to meet in person.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.880
And it was very hard
to find a gateway

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.670
into movements, into literature.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:28.770
And I remember Judy saying
this before: the bookstore was

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:33.410
for the community, and you
know, DC was chocolate city.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.090
But there's still
class segregation even

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.050
within black DC.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:41.170
And so a place like Howard which
is like the shining institution

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.330
on the hill was very, very
distant from a lot of people

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:45.630
in the Columbia Heights
neighborhood.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.780
You had people coming into
the store who had never been

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.970
to a bookstore before.

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:54.850
And to have a public
facing political institution

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:58.060
that sold some of these books
like these but had it kind

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.960
of mediated through people
who could connect people

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.190
on the ground to some of these
books, that was hugely important

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.840
in a way that is
even more important

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.870
than I think it would be today.

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.900
Because people can
self-educate online.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.230
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: Right.

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:15.830
So we were talking
about the space

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.130
of intellectual production.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.070
And I want to make
sure that those of you

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.460
who don't already know this
story, even for those of us

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.760
who do know the story,

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.420
that intellectual
production is dangerous.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.290
It brings about certain
kinds of reprisals.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:31.990
It brings about certain
kinds of attention.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:35.410
And I think the point that Tony
is making about what the forces

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:38.220
that are impinging upon you in
the first place and keep coming

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.880
down on you are very real.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.570
And maybe I'll get
Josh to kick this off,

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.620
because there's a really
intricate part of this book,

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.620
From Head Shops to Whole
Foods, which is also excerpted

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.430
in the Atlantic Magazine which I
wanted all of you to talk about.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:56.420
But can you talk a little
bit about exactly who it was

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.870
and what were the kinds of
outcomes and effects from people

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:04.070
in positions of power against
Drum and Spear and other kinds

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:05.630
of entrepreneurs like that?

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.930
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: All right.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:11.980
So I think again to go back to
this idea of these businesses,

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.990
especially Drum and Spear
being the public face

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:18.070
of a movement, as
Courtland said.

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.480
Stokely was a dear
friend and people

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.090
like the FBI were very
keenly interested in Stokely.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.850
I mean, they were
deeply interested in SNCC

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:29.070
and the movement and
Dr. King and everyone.

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:33.920
But in 1968, I think Stokely
was really one of the people

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.110
that they were almost
obsessed with.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:40.220
And the dangers of him -- if
you've ever heard of this memo

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.090
that J. Edgar Hoover
wrote about we've got

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.450
to stop the possibility of
a rise of a black messiah.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:50.270
And what I kind of came up
with through my research was

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:55.310
that as part of [inaudible],
part of the FBI really focusing

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:58.400
on trying to disrupt
movements and especially trying

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.210
to destroy Civil Rights
and Black Power Movements,

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:03.510
they became very,
very interested

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:05.040
in black-owned bookstores.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.050
And Hoover even issued a memo
to every local field office

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.100
in the country and it said,

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.880
watch out for what he called
African-type bookstores.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.370
"They're extremists, they're
hateful, they're anti-white.

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.030
And if there's one
in your jurisdiction,

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.980
you need to open a file
on them immediately."

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.240
And that's maybe six months

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.540
after the black messiah
memo of March 1968.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.260
But as it would just happen,

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.960
Drum and Spear was conveniently
located not even five miles

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.300
from the Federal Bureau

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.920
of Investigation's
national headquarters.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.440
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
Strategy or tactics?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.740
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Yeah.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.480
And you can imagine the FBI
agents were like, "Well,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.920
I guess we're the ones who only
have to drive three miles."

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.960
And so they had all
kinds of interactions.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.930
And I think I found
probably FBI agents

01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:01.210
in at least half a dozen cities
doing surveillance and informing

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:03.060
and spying on black-owned
bookstores.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:07.510
But there's probably
many more than that.

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:10.130
[ Inaudible ]

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:15.520
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: Do you want to
talk about that a little bit?

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.820
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Okay, yeah.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.120
Okay.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.420
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Okay, so they
used to come into the store.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.800
We found this out --
actually Josh dug this out.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.940
Josh is so talented.

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.240
The man is a good man.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.710
Thank you, Josh, for
all you do, really.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.010
Really.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.310
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yes.

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.000
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: So
Josh got the FBI records

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.340
about their surveillance
of us at Drum and Sphere,

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.130
which is fascinating reading.

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.100
I read it twice late
one night when --

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.700
I forgot, I think Josh
or Judy sent it to me.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.680
And it's just fascinating,
but they would come

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.970
in in plain clothes and
engage us and buy books.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:49.140
And I think they had bought --

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.410
I think Josh, you said they
had bought a whole bunch of --

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:55.580
we were selling Mao's Little Red
Book and they bought them all

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.040
and sat in the car
outside and read them.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.060
[ Laughter ]

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.140
It got to the point
of being silly.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.000
But there are files on everybody
you see sitting up here,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.630
and many more, about
our comings and goings.

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.670
I was surprised what they
knew about where I lived,

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.910
who my social friends were.

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:17.700
But they had a file on us.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.250
I mean, they were about to
bring us down if they could.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.900

an earlier point too,

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.070
when I was working
with SNCC in Atlanta

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:30.070
and we had some financial
problems, I and a group

01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:32.830
of others -- SNCC people
had opened a little store,

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:38.260
a little boutique near the
Atlanta University complex.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.260
And there are FBI
records too that show --

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:46.860
in the records they talk
about then people coming

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:49.870
into the store, their
agents coming into the store

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:53.830
and overhearing things in
the store about you know,

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.070
whether Stokely or
someone was coming to town.

01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:59.920
And it's really interesting
because then you know,

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.650
the conversations that they
overheard helped us identify

01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:12.880
who then the agent was
in that particular case.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.150
But it was fascinating
to see this sort of trail

01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:20.640
of surveillance wherever
we were in that respect.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.740
It used to take a lot
of time to get back

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.030
into the country
when we traveled.

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.040
[ Laughter ]

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.340
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Can I also say,

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.170
I don't know why they thought
that they could be undercover.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:34.240
At this point, you know,
we were not gentrified.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.350
I mean, only black people
came into Drum and Spear.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:39.630
And there were only white
agents at this point,

01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:40.930
and they always looked
like they used

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.230
to in Greenwood, Mississippi.

01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.530
They had the funny little shoes

01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:45.520
and they always wore a
button down, and they walk in

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.820
and they think that
we're not going to know

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.120
that they're FBI agents.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.330
And you know, then they
pull stuff off the shelves

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.580
that they clearly don't
even know what it is.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.060
You know, and then
they pile it up.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.220
Now most people used to
come into Drum and Spear

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.730
and you'd have one or two books.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.030
They had piles of books

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.980
that they're buying,
and they're white.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.030
So you know, we kind
of knew, yeah.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.040
[ Laughter ]

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.340
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
So I like the fact

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.510
that your sustainability model
is predicated on surveillance.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:13.110
[ Laughter ]

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:14.830
Maybe the library's missing
a few on our circulation.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:16.130
I'm not quite sure.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:17.430
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Bring them on.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.350
They also got into
our bank accounts.

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:23.060
They went to the bank
where we did our banking

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.360
and there were reports.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.340
There was some guy there who
sent them everything we did,

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.890
all of our statements,
all of our activities,

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:31.630
companies we were dealing with.

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.760
I mean, all that's
just recorded.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.060
They were after us.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.850
They were after us hard.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.760
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: So
I think we're coming

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.510
to unfortunately the
end of the discussion.

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.790
But I want to open it
up to folks out there.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.090
I mean, I have tons
more questions.

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:47.120
I'm happy to keep talking
up here, but I'd really

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.090
like to make sure that we
have this as a dialogue.

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:51.130
And again we have the mics.

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:54.850
So please, yes, Barry
is right here in front.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.900
&gt;&gt; I just had a question.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:04.470
In I guess '69 or '70 I
drove out here from Missouri

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.800
to attend the DC Blues Festival.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.520
You mentioned Topper
Carew was the first person

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.820
who put that together.

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.470
It was one of maybe the first

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:17.710
and only blues festival
put together

01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:20.460
by an African American
organization at that time.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.760
It seemed to me.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.530
Anyway, was that
connected in any way to Drum

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.150
and Spear or to your work?

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:27.450
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: No.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.750
I was not formally connected.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.350
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: But
there were some wonderful

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.220
organizations in
Washington DC at the time.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.640
And Karen Spellman and a group

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.910
of other people are
developing a collection

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.970
of materials online
that's called the Black

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.450
Power Chronicles.

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:46.040
And it's about some of
the cultural activities

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.770
that were taking
place in Washington DC

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:52.960
from like 1966 on
up to present day.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.150
And that Topper Carew,
and I've forgotten

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.910
who else he was working
with, had the new thing.

01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:01.680
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Alice Carew later.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.980
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Alice.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.280
Then they had the New Thing.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.500
And also he had a background in
architecture as well as in art.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:13.980
And there was Lou Stovall and
Die Stovall and Lloyd O'Neal

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:21.200
who had been the workshop
which focused on printmaking

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.180
and also graphic
design and the arts.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.890
And Lou did the typography
for it.

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:30.180
He did the fonts and
everything for this book,

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.920
the coloring book called
Children of Africa.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.670
But there were other -- the
Center for Black Education,

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:42.820
Gaston Neal was an
incredible force.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:47.700
And Gaston considered
himself the spy

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.270
of Brintano's and places.

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.860
He would go down and then
come back to Drum and Spear

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.510
and report what Brintano's
was selling

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:58.150
and what they were
selling at 4:00.

01:12:58.150 --> 01:12:59.950
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: He
actually stole the books.

01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:01.270
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Yes, thank you.

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:02.570
Thank you, I was about to say.

01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:03.870
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: We're
here to tell the truth.

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:05.170
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yes.

01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:07.030
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Gaston
had skills and he would --

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.040
[ Laughter ]

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.930
And all of the sudden he'd show
up and he'd have all these,

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.520
the newest books that we
could never afford to put.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.580
And he would make them available
to us at real discount prices,

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.180
and we'd put them
on our shelves.

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.340
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: However,
we got caught, let us remember.

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.640
&gt;&gt;TG: Yes, oh.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.940
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Remember
when the woman came up?

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.240
The woman from Brintano's.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.000
Now this is before we get to
the story that you're saying.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.670
So we're still a small
store right on 14th Street.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.760
And she walks in and she
has a couple of the books.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.620
And she says -- oh, no, no.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.920
I'm sorry.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.200
She takes them off our
shelves and she shows it to us

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.840
and she says, "No,
you'll see Brintano's" --

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.510
because they had
Brintano's in them.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:48.230
[ Laughter ]

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:51.040
And so she says, "Now,
we will not prosecute."

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.590
Because she knew who he was.

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:55.390
She said, "We will not
prosecute him, but you are not

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.410
to buy any more books from him."

01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:58.710
And we didn't.

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.520
But yeah, we called
him Sticky Fingers.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.820
Yeah.

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.840
&gt;&gt; Didn't Topper Carew -- he
was involved in media later.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.160
He went to LA, didn't he?

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.570
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yeah,
because I worked with him.

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:11.460
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Topper Carew
also started the New Thing.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.760
&gt;&gt; Rainbow Media.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.060
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Media Works.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.360
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Yeah.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.660
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: So I went

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.960
out after we started
the first series

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.260
of what became the 14
hours of Eyes on the Prize.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.560
And then I go out and
I work with him in LA.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.820
And did you all at
PBS, did you fund him?

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.120
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Yes.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.420
Yes, we funded him.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.720
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
That's right.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.020
Yeah.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.320
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson:
We funded him.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.620
He did a series of
children's programs,

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.920
and he also did a series

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.250
of other television
programs and films.

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:37.650
His best-known film
was probably Car Wash.

01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:38.950
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
No, no, DC Cabs.

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:40.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: DC Cabs.

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:41.550
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Oh,
it was a horrible film.

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:42.850
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: DC Cabs.

01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:46.190
And he then was the person who
discovered Martin Lawrence.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:49.340
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: And later
became Martin's talent agent

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.360
and then went on to become
the agent for a number of sort

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.830
of high-profile comedians in LA.

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.990
And he is now at MIT.

01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:02.680
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: I just
wanted to point out,

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.360
just had to make sure that
from the Library's perspective,

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.810
stealing books is
not a good thing.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.010
Sorry.

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:10.310
[ Laughter ]

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:12.010
We need to make sure
that's on the record.

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:13.980
[ Laughter ]

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.300
Any other questions?

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:20.400
&gt;&gt; I just wondered about your
relationship with libraries

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.770
and outreach to libraries.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:26.030
I worked very briefly in
the beginning of my career

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:27.330
and they didn't know
what to do with me

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:28.630
because I was the new kid.

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:32.220
And they put me in the library
in the black neighborhood.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.490
It was an incredible lesson
in the power of books.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:36.850
And we were like a place

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:39.480
where the kids would
come after school.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.830
And they'd all stream in and
they were just so excited.

01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:48.630
And so I wondered how your
interaction went with libraries.

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.390
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: I
can say that there was

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:53.970
at that point a black
caucus of the ALA,

01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:56.110
the American Librarians
Association.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:57.870
And so we would do
conferences with them

01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:00.590
and we would present a display.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.290
As I said, we would take the
exhibits other places outside

01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:05.590
the store.

01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.020
And so we would bring some
of the children's books

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.620
that we had, and they were
very supportive of us.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.290
I don't know of any
-- maybe you all do.

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.510
I don't know of any
direct relationship we had

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:17.550
between the store and the
librarians except to say

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:19.950
that they would often come
into the store and check

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.250
out some of the titles.

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:25.350
Because of course, they're
not being shown the titles

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:26.730
by the publishers.

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.160
And we were.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.460
I mean, yeah.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.760
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: But
it's interesting too

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.060
in our later lives.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:37.570
I think that our appreciation
for education and you know,

01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:41.040
big E, small e, is just
so profound that then

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.980
that continues our
relationship with organizations

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:47.370
like Debra Mincart's
Teaching for Change.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:51.200
And also with work that
goes into the library.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.040
For example, whether it's
Eyes on the Prize or some

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.570
of the other documentary
or other films that we did,

01:16:57.570 --> 01:16:59.540
we'd always make provisions

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.710
that there would be what we call
outreach or other extensions

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:07.940
of this work so that it would
go then either on the internet

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.960
or it would have materials
that would go for use

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.200
by community groups
and for kids.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.980
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar:
Other questions?

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.770
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: But we love
librarians, let me just say.

01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:20.070
We do.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:21.370
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Yes,
librarians are very special.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:26.400
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: And librarians
love you, thank you very much.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.700
Yes, sir?

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you for this panel.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.760
I don't necessarily know if I
have a question or a comment.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.390
I'm sure it's going to morph
into wanting, begging an answer.

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:40.060
My father's from
Greenwood, Mississippi.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.530
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Oh, okay.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:45.420
&gt;&gt; And my name is
Julius Rosenwald.

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:51.220
And I just wonder -- I didn't
know who Julius Rosenwald was

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.720
until I became in my 30's.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.380
And so when I read about
this symposium, I said, "Oh,

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.850
well let me get down there."

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:08.580
Because I just saw
Fahrenheit 11/9.

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.880
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: How is it?

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.180
&gt;&gt; It was wonderful.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.480
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Okay.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.780
&gt;&gt; And I want to
say you were in it,

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.080
but you were speaking
about the kids.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.380
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yes.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.680
&gt;&gt; And that's my question.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.150
There are a lot of
organizations.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:22.870
For years I was involved
with AFL, CIO, NAACP.

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:29.340
And so there are a lot
of organizations now

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.960
that have not usurped you

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.260
but are doing pieces
of what you're doing.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.070
Or pieces of what
NAACP is doing.

01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:41.370
And some people would argue

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:44.630
that they're doing
it more efficiently.

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:47.450
But I think that they're
not doing everything

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:48.750
that you're doing.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.050
See, you had to do everything.

01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:51.350
Now you have organizations
that are just going

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.460
to do a little bit of
it, a little bit of it.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:56.200
So they can specialize.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:05.870
But I think one of the concerns
is that students, when they want

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:09.700
to get involved, and
I see that you all --

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.730
I was reading your bios.

01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:16.640
And you know, you had successful
careers, so how do students now

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.430
that they want to get
involved and they still have

01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:22.710
to be concerned about their
livelihoods, how do they make

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.330
that transition to
that capitalism?

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:29.930
How do they -- you
know, you can't go

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:33.750
through your life
being an activist

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:36.660
without being able
to sustain yourself.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.000
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: But
I think there are times

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.130
when we can do both.

01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:44.430
&gt;&gt; But how do you do that?

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:45.890
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Okay,
let me just say that all

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:47.690
of us have figured
out ways to do both.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:48.990
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: That's correct.

01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:50.290
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:51.590
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: So I'm
going to answer your question.

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:54.720
One of the things that has
been very helpful to me is

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.930
that I knew nothing
about filmmaking, right?

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:58.660
Nothing. Diddly-squat.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.730
I go in and Henry says, "Okay,
I'm starting what is going

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.540
to be a one-hour documentary
on the Civil Rights Movement."

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.840
It becomes 14.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.140
Who knew?

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.230
But I brought the skills
of the movement with me.

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:10.590
That's what got me in the door.

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:13.270
Because I knew nothing
about filmmaking, right?

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:17.860
I knew how to interview, because
I had operated the 800 line

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.160
for SNCC.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.750
So when people are calling
in about church burnings

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:25.600
or killings, I knew how to take
the information and then give it

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.970
to an FBI that did not care.

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.920
The bottom line was
though that the skills

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.980
that you get you can
take other places.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.710
The problem is you
really have to be grounded

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.990
in knowing why you're
where you are.

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:42.810
So I always -- even when I went
into -- Blackside was easier.

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:44.800
Even Northern Life
Productions, I go into that,

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.900
we do the Orangeburg
Massacre and other films.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:51.330
I'm working now for the
National Park Service.

01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:54.490
I and the team had done the
Little Rock Nine Orientation

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:57.070
films for Little Rock
Central High School.

01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:59.120
Now we're doing summer, right?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.440
But it's the skills
of the movement

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.070
that are bringing me in there.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.490
I think there are enough
ways that you can do --

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.140
and sometimes it's not
going into capitalism.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.910
I never think of myself
as figuring out a way

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:12.640
to become a capitalist, okay?

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.080
It is how do I bring my values
into whatever situation I'm in?

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.330
And how am I able
to pay the rent?

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:23.790
And maybe that's something
that others can talk about.

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:26.860
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: When
we're born, we grow up,

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:29.450
we're told that there
are certain rules,

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:31.800
that there's a certain track.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.800
That if you behave, you play
by the rules, you don't bump

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.910
into the walls too much,
that you're going to be okay.

01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:43.770
And you find out -- we found
out that those rules are made

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:46.700
up by other people just like us.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:51.480
And we can therefore
-- once you know that,

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.190
you can pretty much do whatever.

01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:58.350
You know, there's no --
there aren't any rules.

01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:00.160
So you make up your own.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.800
I mean, at least
it's my approach.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.690
I don't know about
the folks down there.

01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:07.630
But I don't know anything
about making movies.

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.440
And I've spent a good part

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.810
of my professional life
putting on film festivals.

01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:16.050
You know? I don't know
how to do any of that.

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.550
I mean, Judy just talked
about what she knows.

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:19.850
The lady over there,

01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:24.380
I know she's bright
as can be, you know.

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.570
But you sort of --
once you sort of --

01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:29.190
we spent a lot of the time
with things we were talking

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:32.310
about up here pushing
against the rules,

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:34.000
somebody else's rules.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.210
They said, "Look, don't do that.

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:40.060
If you just go to school
and get the master's degree

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:42.850
and da-da-da-da-da, you know"
[laughs], if you just do that,

01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:45.470
it's going to be okay.

01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.210
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: And she's
from Greenwood, by the way.

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.890
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: And
she's from Greenwood.

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.190
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.580
Strong movement family
in Greenwood, yes.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.880
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: You know?

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.390
And then you find out
it's just somebody else

01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:58.690
who made the rules up.

01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:00.400
Well, if they make them up, we
can make up our own rules too.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.040
We're going to start
a bookstore.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.930
Hey, and then we're going
to start a press over here.

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:07.090
You know? What do we know
about doing that stuff?

01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:12.180
What we knew is you know,
we knew that we didn't

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.200
like the things -- we
didn't like the way

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.250
that they're treating not
only us, but other people,

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.090
and we were going to do
something about that.

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:24.120
It bothered us to our core the
way they would oppress people

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.280
and us and our friends and
people that we didn't even know.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.070
That we didn't even know.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.530
And that pissed us
off, for sure.

01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.170
It pissed us off.

01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:36.000
And we said, "We're going
to do something about that."

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.610
That's what we knew.

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:39.660
That's what we knew.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.050
I'm only saying that
because all of us,

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.320
we get young people
coming to us.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.040
When they come to me, they ask
advice, "Well, how do I do it?"

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.340
And I have no answers for them.

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.640
I don't know what to tell them.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.520
&gt;&gt; The reason I asked
that question is

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.770
because now I'm a
member of 100 Black Men

01:23:58.770 --> 01:24:00.070
of Prince George County.

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.760
And we have all these
brown kids.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:09.790
And so we want -- I want to
be able to have them know

01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:13.540
who you are, and to know --

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:17.250
I don't know if they should
know that they'll be okay.

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:21.670
But I do want them to have
tools in their toolkit

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.760
so that they can
make that transition,

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.360
so that they are not
afraid to be true

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.170
to who they are and
be activists.

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:37.150
In the 9/11 movie, most of the
kids, those were white kids.

01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:42.140
And I'm not saying that --
well, they are privileged.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:45.200
And our kids are
brown and black.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.920
And the target population
may or may not go to college.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.010
And so I don't know if they're
going to have those skills,

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:54.310
but I want them to
have those skills.

01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:55.610
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: But
there are other films

01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:58.130
about young people like
them that you can show them.

01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:59.430
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Right.

01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:00.730
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
And I don't know --

01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:05.060
Debra, Jennifer,
some suggestions?

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:10.190
[ Inaudible ]

01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:11.490
I mean, part of the problem is

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:12.860
that we only see
the Parkland kids.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.240
There were kids organizing
before them,

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.540
there's kids organizing now.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.140
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Thankfully,
they've often allied with

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.440
and made sure those other --

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.670
there's the Dream
Defenders which you can learn

01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:23.190
about them at the SNCC Gateway.

01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:24.490
There's the film
Precious Knowledge

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:26.600
about the young people
in Tucson.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.950
There's other documentaries.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:29.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Yes.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.950
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: All right.

01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:32.600
We're just now going
to wrap it up.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.910
But I want to get maybe the
historian's perspective on this,

01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:36.210
not because it's the last one,

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:39.090
but because it's the stepping
back and looking at things

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.040
from a broader perspective.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.700
These questions have all
raised some interesting things.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.610
We could probably do
another two panels on this.

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:49.260
But what is your
takeaway as a historian

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:52.850
that might be interesting for
all of us to share with us?

01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:56.390
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Maybe to
connect it to the last question,

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.110
to me what's really amazing is

01:25:58.110 --> 01:26:03.540
to see what all the people
coming out of SNCC did

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.320
in the rest of their lives.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.910
And I think that is
really amazing to see

01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:14.620
that so many people coming
out of SNCC, very creative

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:20.840
and finding different ways
to continue their work

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.940
through different agencies,
vehicles, organizations.

01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:25.240
I mean, it's really profound.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.000
If we just looked at
these three people here,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.990
but then if you throw John
Lewis in and [inaudible].

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:34.250
I mean, it's just endless.

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:35.660
The list is just endless.

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.540
You see what all the
people did, yeah.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.840
&gt;&gt; Tony Gittens: Stokely.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.730
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: And I think
that's part of the answer

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:45.520
to your question, is looking
at someone like Bob Moses

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.820
who did Radical Equations.

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.650
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Yes.

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:49.950
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis:
There are things

01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:51.470
that maybe our society
doesn't think of as part

01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:55.460
of the Civil Rights Movement,
a book about bringing math

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.400
to underprivileged students.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.020
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: And who
has the Algebra Project.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.320
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Yeah.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.800
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Which is
coming to DC public schools.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.100
&gt;&gt; Joshua Davis: Yeah.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.480
That would be my main
kind of answer to that,

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.160
is that things take
different forms.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.000
But the creativity is what
allowed so many people coming

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.990
out of SNCC and just
the movement in general

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.530
to continue doing
what they're doing.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:22.610
Not necessarily get rich,
but to survive and sustain

01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:25.710
and even prosper in the
fullest sense of that word.

01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:27.010
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: And as long
as we're talking about it,

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:28.310
there are three other veterans

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.660
of the Civil Rights
Movement here with us.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.810
Charlene Kranz, [inaudible]
right back there,

01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:37.400
all of whom have been introduced

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.740
for the Civil Rights
History Project.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.850
So if you're looking for models,
that's one place to look.

01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:45.270
The SNCC Digital Gateway at
Duke University is another place

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:46.570
to look.

01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:47.870
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: I have
fliers for those who want them.

01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:50.630
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: And so
if you're taking cards,

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:51.930
you might as well take a copy

01:27:51.930 --> 01:27:54.310
of Josh Clark Davis's
book with you.

01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:55.910
It's right out there
in the lobby.

01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:59.390
It's actually in the
gift shop now, sorry.

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:03.010
So that's quite all right.

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:04.310
[ Inaudible ]

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:07.020
And I'm going to bring it to a
close because I have the card

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.590
which says two minutes and I've
just given myself 30 seconds

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.030
to say --

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:13.040
[ Laughter ]

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.340
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson:
Thank you, Guha.

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.840
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson: Thank you.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.040
[ Applause ]

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.340
&gt;&gt; Guha Shenkar: It's our
privilege here at the Library

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.640
of Congress American
Folklife Center

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.940
to have hosted this panel.

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.930
So thank all of you, and
thank all of you for coming.

01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:26.060
We'll see you the
next time around.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.940
&gt;&gt; Judy Richardson:
Thank you very much.
