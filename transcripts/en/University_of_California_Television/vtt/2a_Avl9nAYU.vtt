- [Tony] Thank you very much. So I
couldn't have asked for a better

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.880
introduction for what I'm going to talk to
you about here today. We've heard from

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.310
several of the previous speakers about the
genetic legacy of interbreeding with

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.930
Neandertals. But I'm very interested in
understanding what, if anything, is the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.360
phenotypic legacy in modern human
populations. Is this Neandertal DNA that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.630
remains in us, is it functional and if so,
what function does it have? And so, as

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.780
we've seen thanks to the pioneering work
of many of these previous speakers, we

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.810
know that Neandertal DNA remains in
certain modern human populations. And if

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.910
we look at a schematic of a human
chromosome here, you can think of this as

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.850
a long string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, I've
colored in blue all the locations where

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.370
we've ever observed someone living today
to have Neandertal DNA in their genome.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.770
And if you sort of look across many, many
thousands of European and Asian

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.460
individuals, you'll see that on average,
around 2% of their genomes are derived

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.820
from Neandertal interbreeding. As we've
observed, different people will have a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.150
different 2%. My 2% is different than Ed's
2% is different than Anne's 2%. And I want

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.630
you to remember that because this is a
really important feature that we're going

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.810
to use later to try to understand the
function of these different bits of

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.720
Neandertal DNA that remain in our genomes.
And some parts of our genome are more

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.280
likely to retain Neandertal DNA than
others. So in one extreme, we see these

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.290
Neandertal deserts, like the position here
on the right-hand side, where we've never

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.560
observed anyone to have Neandertal DNA.
And then on the left-hand side, we have

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.410
the other extreme where we have up to 60%
of European individuals, if you went out

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.130
and sequenced a bunch of European people,
would have Neandertal DNA at that

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.700
location. And so, ultimately this suggests
that Neandertal DNA had an influence on

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.320
our ancestors after the interbreeding, in
some cases perhaps positive, in other

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.880
cases perhaps negative. And so for me,
this raised a very big question that I

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.330
really wanted to answer is, okay so then
what is the phenotypic legacy of this

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.950
Neandertal interbreeding and the DNA that
remains from it in modern humans? And so,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.590
I hope, if you remember nothing else from
my talk, really just two main points. The

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.230
first is that indeed interbreeding with
Neandertals has left a phenotypic legacy

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.660
in modern humans. And the way I'm going to
go about trying to show what that legacy

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.450
has been is using a sort of a new type of
resource that's just becoming available,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.090
and that's of large clinical bio banks
with electronic medical records from

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.060
patients from hospitals linked to genetic
information. And this is a really, really

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.820
powerful resource for studying the
genetics of disease, but I also think it's

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.000
a really, really powerful resource for
studying genetics of our recent evolution.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.690
And so, if you want to, you can go to
sleep now and just remember those two

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.960
things and I won't blame you. So,
basically, we got the idea for this

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.660
project because I collaborate with a big
national consortium called The Electronic

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.980
Medical Records and Genomics Network. And
what this is, it's a collaboration of

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.630
about 10 academic hospitals from across
the nation that have electronic medical

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.200
record systems implemented in their
hospitals and also, genetic information

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.410
from those patients linked to their
electronic medical records. And so this

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.260
looks a little something like this where
on the left-hand side we have John Doe's

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.440
patient records, he's been coming to the
hospital and seeing doctors, let's say,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.410
for the last 10 years. And we've got
records of all those events and all the

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.790
treatments he's received in that
electronic form. And then some day, John

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.260
comes in to have blood drawn and he says,
"Yeah, actually it'd be okay if you use

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.500
any leftover material from this blood draw
for basic medical research." And if he's

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.660
consented to do that, then all that
information is sent through a

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.360
de-identifying process where all the
identifying information is removed from

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.290
that electronic medical record, but the
basics of the treatment history are

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.140
maintained. And then the blood sample is
also passed through and bio-banked and

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.590
given an ID that links it up to that
anonymized version of the electronic

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.960
medical record. And now this is really
powerful because it enables us to do

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.310
genetic association testing on a very
large scale. So what is genetic

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.350
association testing? Well, let's imagine
we've got a number of patients here for

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.700
which we have these bio-banked blood
samples. And let's say we're interested in

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.000
studying something about their genetics.
Well, we can look at these blood samples

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.680
and see at one given position in their
genome whether or not they have an A, T, C

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.760
or G. And so in this example, patient one
has an A, patient two has an A and then

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.090
patient N has a G. And let's say we're
also interested in heart disease and

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.690
whether or not this particular location in
those patient's genome has any effect on

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.510
their risk for heart disease. What we can
do is then go look in their electronic

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.100
medical record and say, "All right, well
has this person ever been treated for

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.840
heart disease?" And let's say in this case
we find that yes patients one and two have

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.730
and then patient N has not. And once we
have that information, we can perform

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:38.190
statistical tests for association between
these individuals' DNA at that given

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.100
position in their genome and whether or
not they've ever been treated for heart

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.410
disease. And so in this simplistic example
we might say that, yes having an A at this

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.270
location in your genome increases your
risks for heart disease. Now, of course,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.120
we don't normally do this on three people,
we do this on tens of thousands of people

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.620
to try to find significant associations
between regions of our genome and disease.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.540
And so now this is all well and good but
let's say we're interested in another

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.860
disease. Let's say we're interested in
arthritis and the genetic basis for

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.810
arthritis. Well, if we didn't have this
electronic medical record system, we'd

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.900
have to go out and collect a whole other
cohort of people that had arthritis and

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.460
then some match control people that didn't
have arthritis and then genotype them and

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.670
then test whether or not their genetic
loci had any effect on the risk. But

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.480
because we have the electronic medical
record system, we can instead just go look

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.090
in the record and say, "All right, let's
find a new set of cases and controls for

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.030
arthritis and perform genetic association
tests again on the genetic information we

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.190
already have." So, that's all well and
good but we're here because we care about

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.260
human origins and human evolution. So
let's get back to that. How can we use

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.860
this kind of data to answer this question
about the effects of the Neandertal DNA

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.030
that remains in modern human populations?
And so what we did was to start with data

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.610
from this large emerged Electronic Medical
Records and Genomics Network from across

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:12.800
the country. We got data for about 28,000
patients from across the country. And we

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.550
first looked at their genotypes. We first
found genetic information from about

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.650
600,000 positions across their genomes.
And so you can think of this as a stream

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.480
again of about 600,000 As, Ts, Cs and Gs
that we've associated with each one of

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.710
these patients. And then, what we realized
we could do was use these great,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:40.270
high-quality maps of Neandertal DNA that
remains in modern human populations that

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.740
you've heard about from Sriram and Josh.
And so we could look at those maps and

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.340
then intersect them with our own patients
and apply those techniques to our

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.920
patients' genomes and identify regions
where each patient had Neandertal DNA. And

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.560
so we could do this for about 1500 of
these positions in these patients' genomes

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.540
and we can see where some may have
Neandertal DNA and others may not. And

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.780
then finally, the last piece, as I
indicated before, comes from using this

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:15.470
electronic medical record data to define a
set of phenotypes or traits for each of

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.490
these patients. We can ask for hundreds of
different phenotypes covering the whole

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.010
spectrum of things you might be treated
for by a doctor whether or not each of

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:29.150
these people either had that disease they
were a case, or they were control, or we

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.440
couldn't really figure it out and we
should leave them out of the analysis. And

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.130
so then using this matrix of data of
genetic data annotated with Neandertal

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.020
ancestry and then many, many different
phenotypes, we were able to start testing

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.130
for the effects of Neandertal DNA on a
much broader scale than really had been

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.350
possible before. And so before I get into
what we actually find, I'll try to be a

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.310
good scientist and think about what we
would expect to find before actually

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:07.580
running the experiment. And so what did we
expect? Now, as modern humans migrated out

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.040
of Africa where they first appeared, they
encountered a number of different

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.240
environments. So they encountered
different climates, you know, different

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.660
levels of sun exposure, different
temperatures, different sort of seasonal

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.750
patterns. They also encountered different
animals and plants that led to different

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:32.080
diets. And, very importantly, they also
encountered different pathogens. And so

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.715
it's been proposed that perhaps, by
interbreeding with Neandertals and

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:41.770
Denisovans and perhaps other archaic human
forms that had been living in these

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:47.200
environments for hundreds of thousands of
years in many cases before anatomically

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.070
modern human groups ever arrived there,
perhaps there really was some adaptive

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.380
benefit you could get from, you know,
spending a night with a Neandertal, maybe

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:03.690
that was not such a bad trade-off. But
yeah, this is really a hypothesis, this

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:11.170
hasn't been shown at all. So under this
hypothesis we might expect that the

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.450
Neandertal DNA that could have been
adaptive in our modern human populations

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:22.050
would have been influencing human traits
that are involved in interactions with the

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.860
environment. So things like our immune
system, of course, one of the most

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.370
important, but our skin perhaps, and you
know perhaps also our metabolism or other

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:37.550
traits related to our diet. And so, we
also expected that well, we might see some

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.930
effects on our bone or skeletal structure
because we also know about many important

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:48.040
differences, our many very easily
detectable differences between the bones

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.110
of anatomically modern humans and
Neandertals. So those are some of the

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.860
things we were expecting as we went into
this analysis. So, what did we find? And

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:03.980
now, in doing this analysis, we decided to
split up our data, our 28,000 individuals

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.920
into two different sets, a discovery
cohort of about 13,500 individuals which

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.090
we'd run an initial analysis. And then a
replication cohort in which we'd tried to

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.200
replicate anything that we found in that
first cohort. So in the discovery, I'm

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.870
going to show you just some of the top
associations we found between Neandertal

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:30.920
DNA and potential phenotypes in a European
ancestry anatomically modern human

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.080
populations. And so, when I saw this I
almost couldn't believe it because what we

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.810
see at the top, we see osteoporosis, a
bone trait. Then we see hypercoagulable

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.360
state. So what is that? That's just blood
clotting, your blood's too thick, it clots

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.630
too much which can lead to all sorts of
problems. Then we see protein-calorie

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:54.570
malnutrition, a metabolic trait. And so it
really surprisingly matching sort of what

00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:00.050
we expected. But before I go too far into
interpreting these, let's talk about that

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.370
replication analysis I mentioned. So what
we did here is we looked at the other

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.780
14,500 individuals we left out of the
initial analysis and tested to see whether

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:16.560
we saw a consistent effects in that group.
And so, luckily for four of these top

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.280
associations I'm telling about, we did see
something consistent, we did see a

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.820
consistent effect. Unfortunately, the
osteoporosis one that did not replicate

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.340
there. And I should say just as an aside,
I don't think that necessarily means it's

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.010
not true but it's sort of notoriously
difficult sometimes to replicate these

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:37.590
genetic associations and we're following
that up in some other cohorts. So, let's

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:43.370
focus on these four that did replicate. So
first we have this hypercoagulable state

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.140
association that I already talked a little
bit about. So this means that your blood

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.400
coagulates very quickly. And this is
actually a very important part of the

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.590
early immune response. The coagulation
factors, like really some of the first

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.870
proteins that pathogens interact with when
they come into your body. And so this

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.690
really fits in with this idea of the
potential immune benefits. And we've

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.110
looked into the molecular basis for this
association and we've actually been able

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.940
to show that the Neandertal DNA
nearby...sorry, this Neandertal DNA that

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.450
is associated with increased coagulation
increases the level of several nearby

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.690
coagulation factors in your blood. So we
have a very compelling sort of molecular

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.860
mechanism for how that might be happening.
And now, I'm sure by now you've read the

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.160
rest of this list and seen one that's sort
of a little bit more difficult to

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.560
interpret, right? And that's tobacco use
disorder. And so that really just means an

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.900
addiction to nicotine. And so, I think,
you know, should we be thinking about

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.830
this? Were Neandertals sitting around
outside of caves smoking? And I want to

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:54.010
say unequivocally no. We cannot say this,
we should not say this, we should not

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.100
think this. This extreme example
highlights a really important point, that

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:06.360
the effects of genetic variation in modern
environments may not actually reflect its

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.940
effects 50,000 years ago against a very
different genetic background in

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:15.030
Neandertals or in early human/Neandertal
hybrids. And on top of that, of course,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.990
tobacco is a New World plant, they didn't
really have nicotine existing in their

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:24.680
environment. But what this does tell us is
that Neandertal DNA in modern humans is

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.920
influencing a system in our body that is
now, in modern environments, relevant to

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.030
this trait. And in particular this bit of
Neandertal DNA is very nearby a

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:40.680
transporter for a neurotransmitter called
GABA that's involved in all sorts of

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.300
important processes in the brain and, you
know, even may have a role in circadian

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.180
processes. So we don't really know what
might have been behind this association.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.500
So, now just to move on, I want to tell
you about one more analysis that we did.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.920
So in that first set of tests, we were
testing for the effect of one bit of

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:07.460
Neandertal DNA with one trait in the human
population. But we wondered, well, what if

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.990
we looked at all the Neandertal DNA that a
person might or might not have in

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:16.950
aggregate, and ask whether or not that
could better predict someone's risk for a

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:23.120
disease. And so we did an analysis of
that. And again, we found several very

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.900
interesting associations that replicated.
And now I think this top one is really

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.430
fascinating. It's Neandertal DNA. If I
know your Neandertal DNA compliment, I can

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.990
better predict your risk for actinic
keratosis. And this is a...in case you

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:45.680
don't know, this is a skin disease. It's
not terribly serious, it's often seen in

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.780
fair-skinned people after long-term sun
exposure. And it's caused by

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:57.420
malfunctioning of a type of cell in your
skin called keratinocytes. And I find this

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.990
so fascinating for really several reasons
because keratinocytes, one of their main

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.710
functions is protecting our skin from UV
radiation. So again, a very important

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.000
environmental difference between Africa
and other non-African environments. But

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.270
they're also really intimately involved in
early stage of the immune response, in

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.030
signaling for the activation of other
immune factors. When we look the patterns

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.920
of where Neandertal DNA falls in our
genome, we see that many of the

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.050
Neandertal, high-frequency Neandertal bits
of DNA are nearby genes that are involved

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.980
in keratin biology. And so this is sort of
taking it to the next step in showing not

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.060
only is it enriched nearby those genes,
but actually in modern populations, it's

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.560
having an effect on a phenotype that's
very relevant to keratin. But again here,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.340
we'll see there's a second kind of
confusing, or at least more complicated to

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:58.230
interpret association that we need to
think about and that's depression. And so

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.720
again, I really want to be very clear that
this is not what we should be thinking

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.600
about. Neandertals, we cannot say they
were depressed, we cannot blame them for

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.160
any depression we have. These are very
complex phenotypes with major

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.750
environmental components and many of the
genetic components. And the Neandertal

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:18.180
influence is really quite modest in the
whole constellation of all the

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:24.280
contributions to them. So in conclusion, I
want you to remember that interbreeding

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.530
with Neandertals has indeed left a
phenotypic legacy in modern humans. And in

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:34.000
particular, it's left effects on many
different systems in our bodies: our

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.880
immune systems, our skin, our metabolism
and in fact, even likely our brains. And

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.180
so I think largely because of the nature
of the data sets we've been looking at, we

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.930
found many cases where the Neandertal DNA
has a mildly deleterious effect in modern

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.440
environments, but again I want to remind
you that's not necessarily true 50,000

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.570
years ago when this interbreeding likely
occurred. And so, one of the main

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.260
challenges going forward is trying to
understand what knowing something about

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.470
Neandertal DNA in a modern environment can
actually tell us about what was happening

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.640
back then. And so then, the second point I
wanted you to remember is this was all

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.650
enabled by using a new type of resource,
these large scale databases of tens or

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.940
hundreds of thousands of electronic
medical records from patients linked up to

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:30.050
genetic information. And so I think just
as the ability to sequence people's DNA at

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:34.760
large scale has dramatically changed our
understanding of the genetic basis of

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.870
human evolution over the past 5 or 10
years thanks to many of the speakers in

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.740
this symposium, I think that leveraging
these sorts of data and these sorts of

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.110
projects that are popping up all over the
world will allow us to do the same thing

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.740
for the phenotypic basis of recent human
evolution. And so with that, I would like

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.361
to say thank you all very much for
listening and thank all of my

00:20:54.361 --> 00:20:56.955
collaborators, and yeah.
