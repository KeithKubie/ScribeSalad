00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.580
So, Sam, you're going to teach me how to build this app.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.990
I guess that means we're going to do a lot of coding?

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.260
&gt;&gt; None whatsoever. It's all going to be using point and click.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; And what does that mean, point and click? What will we actually be doing?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.880
&gt;&gt; There'll be a little bit of pointing. You know, clicking with the mouse.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.375
&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:17.990
[LAUGH]

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.800
&gt;&gt; And at the end you're going to have a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920
really fully functional web and mobile app. It's really cool.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.530
&gt;&gt; All right. Sounds good.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; No, but seriously. In the first lesson,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620
you're going to create an app and learn how Salesforce

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.980
stores data. In lesson two, you'll learn how

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.740
to take a big problem and break it into

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.270
smaller pieces, and how to represent those pieces

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.040
in Salesforce. In lesson three, you're going to learn how

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.280
to visualize your data with fancy charts and graphs,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.120
and pi charts. In lesson four, you learn how

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.460
to automate the things you've been doing by hand using

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.620
workflows and approvals. Finally, in lesson five, you're going to take that

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.740
web app you've been developing and turn it into a

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.810
mobile app that you can take with you anywhere you go.
