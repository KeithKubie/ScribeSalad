00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:03.356
- [Instructor] Sometimes in
life, like say, on an exam,

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.854
in particular, like an AP exam,

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:10.021
you might be asked to describe
or compare a distribution.

00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:12.600
And so we're gonna get an example

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.788
of doing that right over here.

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:18.753
Sometimes in life, say on an exam,

00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:21.371
especially on something like an AP exam,

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:26.110
you're asked to describe
or compare a distribution.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.559
And what we're gonna do in
this video is do exactly that,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.179
in fact, this one we're gonna describe

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.230
and in a future video we're
going to compare distributions.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.190
Now before we even read
about this distribution

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.588
or look at this distribution,
if you're asked to describe

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:44.129
a distribution, there's
four things that you should

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.411
be thinking about.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.120
You should be thinking about
the shape of the distribution.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.857
And when we're talking about shape,

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:55.299
there could be left-skew,
there could be right-skew,

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.730
and we'll see examples of these.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.625
And we've talked about them
in detail in other videos.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.478
It could be symmetric,

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.185
these are the ones that we typically see,

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:07.616
although there might be
other types of shapes,

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:11.299
you'll have your center of distribution.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.949
And there's multiple
ways to be thinking about

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:15.830
the center of distribution,
we've talked about this before,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.298
you have your mean, you have your median,

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:21.533
these are the two most typical ones.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.866
You have a notion of spread.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.323
And for spread you could use range,

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.625
you could use interquartile range,

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:34.792
you could use something like
a mean absolute deviation,

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.240
you could use the standard deviation,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.511
these are all measures of spread.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.267
And then, you probably
should at least comment

00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:47.284
about outliers, even
if you don't see them,

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.673
it's a good idea to
comment just to make sure

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:53.294
that you are being
relatively comprehensive.

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:57.256
So now, given that, let's
describe the distribution

00:01:57.256 --> 00:01:58.232
right over here.

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:00.057
It says in the state of Connecticut,

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.640
the Department of Motor Vehicles, the DMV,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.713
requires 16 and 17 year
olds to take a 25 question

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:10.868
knowledge test in order to
obtain a Learner's Permit.

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:14.509
To pass, prospective drivers
must correctly answer

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.051
at least 20 questions.

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:21.002
On one Monday, 22 teenagers took the test.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.169
The dot plot below shows their scores.

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:26.370
So why don't you pause this video

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.579
and see if you can take a
shot at describing the shape,

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.729
the center, the spread and the outliers.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.492
Some of these you might
be able to come with

00:02:32.492 --> 00:02:34.487
the actual numbers, you might be able

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.808
to calculate some of these,

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:37.330
but really just to get a sense of it,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.994
why don't you take a shot at it.

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:40.136
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:42.723
So first, on the shape.

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:45.332
So what we see is, we have,

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:48.618
in most of the distribution
is in this part

00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:52.697
between 20 and 25, but then
we have this fairly long

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:54.551
tail to the left

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:58.294
and so this tells us
that we have a left-skew

00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:02.576
or it is a left-skewed
distribution right over here.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:06.909
So we have done the shape,
it's a left-skewed distribution

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.876
because the tail goes to the left.

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.076
Now what about the center
of this distribution?

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:14.868
So there's a few ways to measure center,

00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:17.433
mean or median, just for
the sake of simplicity,

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.430
I'll think about the median here,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.213
I can eyeball that to some degree.

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:22.799
You could also calculate the mean,

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.525
it would take a little bit more time.

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.562
I would guess that it's someplace,

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:30.051
not even calculating it, I
would guess that it's someplace

00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:31.880
in this range right over there

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.140
but let me actually calculate it.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.630
So the median, there's 22 data points,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.236
so the median is whatever number
has 11 onto the right of it

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:44.386
and 11 to the left, half of 22.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:48.118
So let's see, we have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:50.785
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:54.727
So the median here,

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:57.189
is going to be,

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.022
let's see, this is 23.

00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.013
Because we have a bunch of 23s,

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:05.814
one, two, three, four, five, six 23s

00:04:05.814 --> 00:04:08.201
and if we were to just
order all of the data points

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.618
11 of the data points would be 23 or less

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:14.727
and 11 would be 23 or more.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.562
So our median here, so
I could say our center,

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:23.188
is 23, if we use the median.

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.291
And actually, let me write that down.

00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.386
So our median is 23, that's
the measure of center

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:32.253
that I decided to use.

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:34.378
Now, what about spread?

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:37.283
Well the simplest measure
of spread is just the range

00:04:37.283 --> 00:04:40.407
which is just the highest
value minus the lowest value.

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:43.157
And so our range here would be 25

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:45.215
minus four.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.062
25 minus four is equal to 21,

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:51.119
so that is a measure of range.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.986
You could have others but this
one is very easy to calculate

00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:58.673
and then if we think about
outliers, well there are a few

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.171
outliers I would consider

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:02.582
and it's very subjective.

00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:05.068
People can debate, you know
if there's a dot right over

00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.339
there, is that an outlier or not.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.173
But I would say that these four

00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:13.649
right over here, I
would consider outliers.

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:17.259
So I would say
approximately four outliers,

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.859
but once again this is subjective.

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.627
The main point of this exercise is to just

00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:24.381
get in the habit of
thinking about these things.

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:28.165
And statistics is all
about creating engineering,

00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:31.111
one could say, different
measurements for center,

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:32.558
for spread.

00:05:32.558 --> 00:05:36.061
Different ways to describe the shape,

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:38.440
but the point is is to just think about

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.867
these various dimensions.
